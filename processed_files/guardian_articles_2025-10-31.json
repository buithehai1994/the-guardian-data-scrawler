It was usual to have a team review after a big tournament and after the Euros in 2022 we came together in the Club England meeting room at St George’s Park, the team’s headquarters.The emotional security that I felt within England was bolstered by the culture and values that had underpinned and contributed to our success. Non-collegiate behaviour was not tolerated. We came back together to the news that Hannah Hampton had been dropped from the squad: her behaviour behind the scenes at the Euros had frequently risked derailing training sessions and team resources.We split off into groups and reported back on what had gone well – which was pretty clear, given we had won – what hadn’t and what we could do differently in the future.The only negative that each group reported back on was that behaviour, which was overwhelmingly considered disruptive and unreliable, with a risk of being destructive, taking energy and time from coaches who needed to work with the rest of the team on set-pieces, mentality and of course goalkeeping sessions. It affected us all in a domino effect to an extent that was extremely unusual in a successful elite team environment. It also completely contradicted my professional values, which included preserving everything I had, mentally and physically, for performance and for a goalkeeper union where everyone, whatever their role, had the space and support to be great at their job.“I accept this was negative,” Sarina acknowledged. “This has been dealt with and it’s not appropriate to speak about one individual any more,” she said, drawing a line under it. I had often shut down conversations in camp about it too.View image in fullscreenMary Earps and Sarina Wiegman address the press before England’s World Cup quarter-final against Colombia in 2023. Wiegman later replaced Earps as the Lionesses first-choice goalkeeper.Photograph: David Gray/AFP/Getty ImagesIn the spring of 2023 Sarina called me to bounce the idea of bringing Hannah back into the squad. Sarina now routinely called me into leadership meetings and would take my opinion into consideration on team matters beyond goalkeeping. I was happy to be part of those conversations and no matter whether you were among the more experienced or junior players in her squad, feeling like you had a say was a part of our success.“It doesn’t make me feel comfortable,” I said in response to the idea of a return, not needing to remind her of the disharmony that the squad had felt before. I felt protective of the good energy we now had in goalkeeper training and the morale of the wider team.View image in fullscreenHannah Hampton (top) and Mary Earps during an England training session in October 2024.Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Action Images/ReutersI wished that this situation wasn’t what it was but I had been asked my opinion, precisely because the decision would affect my work and performance space, too, and I was both expected and needed to be honest. The progress and development of younger players had become a huge feature of my professional value set in football. Equally, to reward certain behaviour went against those same fundamental values of creating a healthy and happy space for players of all experience to work and thrive, not least in a team environment before a World Cup. I saw, too, that other hard-working keepers would miss out on that space as a result.“I think everyone deserves a second chance,” Sarina said, and another call followed a few weeks later with a wider group, in which she reiterated the same, confirming she wanted to bring her back in. There was a genuine concern about fixing something that wasn’t broken but we respected the manager’s decision and with Hannah back in the squad I kept my focus on retaining my standards and those within the group.In April 2024 as we filed out of a team meeting in the hotel’s conference room, Sarina called me back: “Mary, can I have a word?” she said, in front of everyone.That was unusual and I felt embarrassed being singled out. I didn’t know if it was intentional or if it was her way of making an example of me. I hoped it wasn’t, but, like at school, when you’re asked to stay behind you tend to know exactly what’s coming. And you know that the fact you had been called back is going to be the talk of the town. I hated that.“What have I done?” I asked, genuinely wanting to understand this energy shift. I felt devastated before anyone else had even uttered a word.“I want to give someone else experience,” Sarina confirmed. She didn’t want me to be upset but she was matter-of-fact about her choice. I had to respect that, but we could be frank enough with each other that I thought I could explain that I didn’t understand or agree with it.“I don’t get it,” I said. “It’s a qualifier match. And bad behaviour is being rewarded.”View image in fullscreenEngland’s goalkeeping union – Hannah Hampton (left), Ellie Roebuck (second right) and Mary Earps (right) – with goalkeeping coach Darren Ward in Basel in June 2022.Photograph: Lynne Cameron/The FA/Getty Images“Everything you’ve said, we’re aware and we’ve taken into consideration,” Darren Ward, the goalkeeping coach, replied. “This is still what we want to do.” So they had thought what I was thinking too.Now this felt unjust. My eyes welled with tears. It was a choice that went against my core values. I couldn’t get my head around it because when my values were compromised, the strain always felt heavy enough to keep me up at night. When this kind of a decision compromised my football, I was sleepless.The affinity I had for Sarina and this job – one I’d given every last cell of myself to – was being destroyed, the trust and respect evaporating.I thought my days of rejections were over, but here I was again at the peak of my career facing another huge blow. I tried to remain positive, to be grateful for all the things I had in my life, all the amazing opportunities, the incredible people, the sport I loved, but I also felt utterly dejected. And because I knew where that could take me, because I carried the lessons I had learned when I’d moved from darkness into light before, I realised for the first time I didn’t have to let anyone else crush my spirit again. I had a choice with England too. I wasn’t entitled to keep my place if Sarina didn’t want me to but I was entitled to decide what happened next. I could do what other people do if they’re no longer enjoying their job: I could leave, I could retire.In April 2025 I went to St George’s Park with my head up, even if I was working extra hard to keep it that way, not knowing exactly how things were going to play out but at peace with the fact that it would most certainly be my last camp there as an England player.Mary Earps says she told Wiegman she was rewarding Hampton’s ‘bad behaviour’Read moreA day in, earlier than usual, I had a message to meet: “Mary, Sarina wants to talk to you.”I went to room 206, a bedroom that had been converted into a meeting space where our conversations usually took place, at the allocated time.I felt sick and anxious as I took my seat with her and Darren.Then came the words I’d waited over 12 months to hear: “I’ve decided Hannah’s the No 1 for now.”I felt the weight of my heart sink to the floor and the relief that I had finally had clarity lift from my shoulders all at once.“She’s a little bit ahead of you,” Sarina continued. “It’s nothing you’ve done or done wrong.”“I expected this,” I said. I had 30 seconds to say my piece. I told her I wasn’t surprised by what she’d just said, that it had been a long time coming, but I felt extremely disappointed, nonetheless.Then I said: “I just think you could have been more direct and honest from the jump.” She wasn’t happy with that.“No, I don’t think that’s fair. I always communicate openly. We’ve only just made this decision,” she cut in.That sounded like bullshit to me.Darren didn’t look up from the floor the whole time.“Respectfully,” I said, “we’re going to have to agree to disagree. You’ve made your decision. I’ve had to make one too. This will be my last camp, I’m internationally retiring.”Sarina wasn’t at all shocked – we’d already discussed the fact I needed to consider my future. She said she could see I’d been thinking about it for some time and now asked me why. “It doesn’t align with my morals and values to continue,” I said. “I’d like to graciously step aside. I’d rather Khiara [Keating, the Manchester City goalkeeper] get the experience. I’ve had my time in the sun.”View image in fullscreenSarina Wiegman gestures towards Mary Earps in a huddle on the Wembley pitch after the Finalissima win over Brazil in 2023.Photograph: Naomi Baker/The FA/Getty ImagesI continued with honesty but my voice broke as I said: “I used to feel invincible here but I don’t feel that way any more.” That saddened me the most of all.I told her that playing for my country had been the greatest privilege of my life but I couldn’t bear to look back on it as a place where I cried in my room, where I didn’t recognise myself. I said I no longer felt supported there and that the goalkeeper dynamic had been too unhealthy for too long.“I know it’s hard but you have so much more to give and your level is so high,” she said.“I know my level is high, that’s not the question,” I said, defiant in the truth. The reality, I told her, was that none of it made sense any more: “It’s better for the team if I move on.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I knew that no matter how much I said, they wouldn’t understand because it wouldn’t fit their agenda. From where they stood it looked better for me to be there, in the background, during the Euros that summer and to be dropped entirely afterwards.“Do you want to sleep on it?’ Sarina asked. “I want you to reconsider. You have so much more to give,” she said again. “This isn’t the end of your England career.”The words and actions didn’t match. “I don’t want to sleep on it,” I said. I’d been sleeping on it for so long. I wanted to make the most of my last camp.“It’s been a good run,” I added with a slight smile. They half-laughed at the pragmatism.We’d been sat there now for 20 minutes. To my surprise, they both thanked me for my honesty.“That took incredible bravery,” Darren said, looking up for the first time. It felt like the most frank thing he’d said to me in over a year.They asked if I’d spoken to any of the girls about it.“Not yet,” I said. There were two important games that week and I felt the bare minimum professional conduct was not to burden them. I walked away, and didn’t start either game, but later that week I had another text, this time directly from Sarina: “Mary, could I have 10 minutes?” I headed back to room 206.“I was thinking about what you said and I don’t accept your retirement,” she said. “I don’t want you to go.” I had told her in the earlier meeting that I knew it was time for younger keepers like Khiara to step up. Now she told me: “She will have her time. This is your time now.”View image in fullscreenMary Earps makes a spectacular save during the World Cup quarter-final against Colombia at Stadium Australia in August 2023.Photograph: Zac Goodwin/PAI was stunned. It was a 180-degree turn – she had changed my role for over a year and put me on the bench, my brain had done a mental Olympics trying to figure out what to do for the best, for everyone, now I was being told it was my time?Then, she added: “I also don’t think it’s the right thing for you to go.”“What do you mean?” I asked.“I just worry what people will say. I think it’s better that you stay for the tournament, win a trophy then go.”I’d been clear that I wanted to get off at the next stop, now I felt like I was being manipulated into staying.Out of the blue, two days before my league semi-final playoff in May and two weeks before the next England camp, Sarina texted me asking for my decision. I was totally focused on not derailing my PSG season and wasn’t expecting it yet. Besides, mentally, I wasn’t at all convinced I wanted to change this enormous decision I’d thought so long and hard about.If I was really being asked to reconsider, I asked her for a definitive reason as to why I’d lost my spot. “There has to be a reason beyond just the high level of competition between us,” I said.“Distribution and defending the space,” she answered.I thanked her for the clarity of response. The PSG game was at 9pm on Sunday. She said she needed an answer by 1pm on Monday. I felt pressured but I agreed.The way this next bit played out is the only part of my retirement that I wish I had done differently, where I wish, more than anything, that I had stayed true to myself, that I’d stuck to my intuition.It was 11am and I was in my Paris apartment when Sarina and I spoke. We’d won our match the night before, and a place in the final. I’d barely slept, fuelled by adrenaline, thinking about that and the conversation I had to have.View image in fullscreenMary Earps accepts the Fifa Golden Glove award at the 2023 Women’s World Cup despite England’s defeat in the final.Photograph: Cameron Spencer/Getty ImagesI felt completely up against it and I couldn’t shake her words of warning from camp about it being better for me that I stay.Dubiously, I told her: “OK, I’ll continue.” She was pleased. Then, before we left the call she offered up, in passing: “Well done, I saw you won last night.” I was glad she’d noticed, as it reinforced what she’d said. Then she said she hadn’t watched it.With that, I knew instantly that I’d made the wrong choice; I immediately wished I hadn’t uttered the words. I had committed to something and someone who didn’t seem committed to me; whose words, where I was concerned, still didn’t match their actions, and I’d known it all along. Backtracking was entirely the wrong choice from me and for everyone involved and I felt my body fill with immediate regret. Now I had to either live with it or fix it. I felt trapped.My head had been in a hole that I needed to dig myself out of. How could I ring the manager back and say, “I know I said I’ll continue but it was a mistake”?I was going to the Champions League final to watch my England teammates play for Arsenal. Maybe I could meet Sarina there and talk to her face to face. I messaged to ask if she was going, telling her I needed to talk. She replied saying she wasn’t. England camp was due to start two days later on the Monday; she suggested we speak at lunchtime then.This couldn’t wait. I arrived back in Paris late on the Sunday night and hit her number on my phone.“I can’t do it,” I said.“Wow,” came the reply. Her only word shook me. “I can’t believe it,” she said. “I’m so disappointed. What made you change your mind?”“I don’t think I ever really did,” I replied.I couldn’t have been more honest.View image in fullscreenI had been all along.They say that life puts you in the same situation over and over again and if you approach it in the same way it will deliver you the same lessons too. Sarina had given me the confidence to fulfil the potential I always believed I had inside myself and now our journey together was ending with me having the confidence to say no to her.This is an edited extract from Mary Earps: All In by Mary Earps (Bonnier Books, £22).

But they’re finding it hard to beat a player who breaks all the rulesFri 31 Oct 2025 13.46 EDTLast modified on Fri 31 Oct 2025 20.01 EDTShareEvery year is election year in the US, but the contests of 2025, which reach their climax on Tuesday, will be especially revealing. These “off-year” battles – a smattering of governors’ races, statewide referendums and the election of a new mayor in the country’s biggest city – will tell us much about the national mood 12 months after Americans returnedDonald Trumpto the White House and one year before midterm contests that could reshape the US political landscape. Above all, though, they will reveal the division, the confusion and sheer discombobulation Trump has induced in the US’s party of opposition.The verdict on Trump’s first 10 months in office will be delivered most clearly in the two states set to choose a new governor: New Jersey and Virginia. By rights, these should be relatively easy wins for the Democrats. Both states voted for Kamala Harris a year ago, and the current polls are grim for Trump. This week,an Economist/YouGov surveyregistered Trump’s lowest rating of his second term – 39% of Americans approve of him, while 58% disapprove – the lowest number they’d recorded for him bar one poll in his first term. Trump’s handling of the economy gets especially low marks, and a plurality of voters blame the continuing government shutdown, now in its second month, on Trump and his party. If an off-year election offers an opportunity to kick an unpopular incumbent, then Tuesday should be plain sailing for Democrats.And yet, the contest in New Jersey, for one, is looking far from comfortable. Democrats there are mindful that a year ago Trumpsurged in the state: after losing to Biden by a whopping 16 points in 2020, he trailed Harris by just six. Current polls show the Democratic candidate for governor ahead, but only narrowly:one surveyput her just one point aheadof her Republican opponent. The party is funnelling serious money into the contest and deploying its biggest guns: Barack Obama will campaign in New Jersey on Saturday.It may work. But the fact that, after all that voters have seen from Trump these past 10 months – the power grabs; the wild on-again, off-again moves on tariffs; the failure to shrinkinflation; theindulgence of corruption; the vanity projects, including the demolition of the East Wing of the White House to make room for a gilded Trump ballroom – a Republican is even competitive in a state such as New Jersey should be troubling Democrats. And, if my conversations in Washington and New York this week are anything to go by, it is.The problem is that, even after a decade in which Trump has dominatedUS politics, Democrats are still not sure how to confront him, or even, more fundamentally, what they should really be. Take the mayoral contest in New York City, which is exposing the depth of the divide.The frontrunner is Zohran Mamdani, a 34-year-old newcomer who came from nowhere to storm his way to the Democratic nomination. Hugely charismatic and a master of social media, he has energised voters who had long regarded the Democrats as stale and tired: in the Democratic primary earlier this year,turnout was highestamong those between ages 25 and 35. His chief opponent is the man he beat in that primary, the former Democratic governor of the state and scion of one of the party’s most storied families: Andrew Cuomo.Their clash captures what Cuomo, now running as an independent, calls the “quiet civil war” among Democrats in almost cartoonishly stark terms. Mamdani is a socialist beloved by the young, but feared by the old – and by those alarmed by his refusal to denounce the slogan “globalise the intifada”, a phrase they believe sanctions attacks on Israel-associated, meaning Jewish, targets in the US and elsewhere. Cuomo is 67, previously endorsed by the party establishment and tainted by thebullying and sexual harassment scandalthat drove him out of office in 2021.LiveNew York mayoral frontrunners Zohran Mamdani and Andrew Cuomo clash during debate – videoIt is a divide that is both ideological and generational. Plenty of younger Democrats see Mamdani as radical and inspiring, drawn to his message of “affordability” of housing and public transport. They see Cuomo as the embodiment of an exhausted, morally compromised centrism that cannot beat Trump. Meanwhile, many older Democrats see Mamdani as radical and untested, carrying too little experience and too much ideological baggage – the same leftist liabilities that the right ruthlessly exploits and ultimately always leads to Democratic defeat. I got a glimpse of that divide when, ata live event in Manhattanfor the Unholy podcast, I asked Hillary Clinton whether, if she had a vote in New York City, she would cast it for Mamdani, who is, let’s not forget, the official Democratic nominee for mayor: “You know what? I don’t vote in this city. I’m not involved in it. I have not been at all even asked to be involved in it, and I have not chosen to be involved in it.”If Mamdani wins, and either of the comparatively moderateDemocratsrunning in New Jersey and Virginia loses, then the party’s progressive wing will take that as confirmation that its approach – the path of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders – represents the party’s best hope. But if all three win, and especially if the gubernatorial candidates improve on Harris’s performance in 2024, then the moderate wing will be buoyed, and the argument inside the Democratic party will rage on. In fact, it’s a fair bet it will rage on whatever happens.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Whatever you’re doing right now | Andy BeckettRead moreAnd that is because the age of Trump has been utterly confounding for his opponents. How do you play against a player who breaks all the rules of the game? If you stick to the old ways of doing politics, if you obey the traditional proprieties and conventions, you cast yourself as part of the very establishment or deep state or elite that Trump has so profitably railed against for 10 years. But if you don’t, if you disrespect past norms, then you become part of the problem, the danger, Trump represents, weakening the guardrails that keep democracy on track.An example of that dilemma is on display in California. The state’s ambitious governor,Gavin Newsom, has tabled a ballot initiative – a referendum – that would redraw the boundaries of California’s congressional districts to give the party about five more seats in the House of Representatives in time for next year’s midterm elections. It’s retaliation for a Trump-approved gerrymander in Texas that will hand Republicans a similar advantage in that state. Democrats have hailed Newsom’s move as an act of resistance, fighting Trumpian fire with fire. And so it is. But it also burns away one more democratic norm, turning boundary changes into a routinely partisan battleground.Democrats are struggling because there are no good options when fighting a nationalist populist unafraid to wreck democracy. If you stay high while he goes low, you lose – and he is free to wreak further destruction on the democratic system. But if you sink to his level, you risk damaging the very thing you want so desperately to protect. The havoc of Donald Trump is never confined to Trump. It engulfs his opponents too.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistGuardian newsroom: Year One of Trumpism: Is Britain Emulating the US?

There had to be payment, it had to be with strangers,” singsLily Allenin her surprisingly candid and detailed album thought to be about her open relationship with her ex-husband.The album has catapulted the concept of non-monogamous relationships into the spotlight, and couples therapists report that an increasing number of their clients are choosing to go down this route.But as Allen’s album makes clear, while open marriages, or consensual non-monogamy, may work for some, they can also go very wrong – and there are a number of common pitfalls to avoid.“It’s a risky business emotionally. I’m seeing it more and more in the work that I do, but how it manifests itself varies hugely,” said Katherine Cavallo, a psychotherapist and spokesperson for UK Council for Psychotherapy.My wife is my best friend. How do I tell her I want an open marriage?Read more“It’s normal for feelings of jealousy and insecurity to emerge, and those need to be responded to. The existing relationship, the attachment between the couple, needs to be maintained as well.“And things can always change. It has to be an ongoing process in which things are continually reviewed to make sure it remains consensual.”Communication, consent and trust were key, she said, and if agreed boundaries were not adhered to, it could lead to “significant emotional and relational trauma”.People choosing to open up their relationship after one partner has had an affair, or doing it in order to “fix” something, are cause for concern. “It’s bound to be problematic going down that route,” Cavallo said.Katerina Georgiou, a psychotherapist and senior-accredited member of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy, said there was an important distinction to be made between people who identify as polyamorous, and heteronormative couples choosing to do this.The latter might choose to open up a marriage for “sexual experimentation, to create intimacy by playing with sexual dynamics, or an agreement as a result of circumstances such as being apart for a while”, she said.The modern dating world, and dating apps, were also fuelling the shift, she said. “People are being more liberal, but I think there’s also some people maybe being pressured into it. I’m seeing more of that feeling that it’s too vanilla to just want straight monogamy.”Juliet Rosenfeld, a psychoanalyst and author ofAffairs: True Stories of Love, Lies, Hope and Despair, said the growth of open relationships was part of a wider societal trend in which “the idea of the couple is shifting radically”.“It’s a challenge for therapists because there is a much wider range of ways to be in a couple now,” she said. “A monogamous lifelong relationship is simply not what a lot of people, in particular women, want.”Marriage and birthrates have declined rapidly across the UK and elsewhere in recent years, and in England and Wales, the proportion of adults who have never entered a legally registered partnership increased from 26.3% in 1991 to 37.9% in 2021.Rosenfeld said there were a number of potential positives, as well as negatives, in opening up a relationship. “In marriage now there is feeling that people want the other person to be everything – a partner, best friend, teammate, lover – which is very pressurising. So one way of looking at an open marriage is it’s a way of taking pressure off that,” she said.“But I would be looking to understand whether wanting other people in the relationship was a way of avoiding ending it. If you are in an open marriage, how do you not know that your partner isn’t trialling someone else to replace you?”She said there was a growing acceptance and normalisation of open relationships, but still a lack of understanding about exactly what makes them work well. “We don’t know enough about what kind of characterological capacity or strength people need to be in a consensual non-monogamous relationship.“What happens if one person falls in love, for example? What does the couple do then? When you remove sexual exclusivity, what else are you removing? What else are you taking away?”Explore more on these topicsMarriageRelationshipsSocial trendsLily AllenCounselling and therapynewsShareReuse this content"

Wossy’s wardrobe reveals had as much drama as the round tableSpoiler alert: this article discusses Celebrity Traitors and reveals events contained in episodes one to sixChloe Mac DonnellFri 31 Oct 2025 09.31 EDTFirst published on Fri 31 Oct 2025 08.47 EDTShareThe most exciting moment on each episode of the realityTV show Celebrity Traitorsis when the ornate door of the breakfast room swings open to reveal which Faithful has survived another night of murder.This season however, there has been an extra element of anticipation for the contestants and viewers at home. What willJonathan Rossbe wearing?Since the hit show started in 2022, it has been the hostClaudia Winklemanwhose kilts, oversized knitwear and dramatic sweeping coats have drawn attention. This time around Ross has had the cast and the nation gripped until the very last second of his banishment. Over the past three weeks, the broadcaster has appeared in everything from dapper tailoring to an 80s Top Gun-esque jumpsuit. There have been snazzy cravats, oversized aviator sunglasses and dramatic fuzzy stoles. At one point he even paid homage to Winkleman’s signature style by sauntering around the castle in a tweed cape and fingerless leather gloves.View image in fullscreenJonathan Ross styles it out in an air force inspired outfit on Celebrity Traitors.Photograph: Euan Cherry/BBC/Studio LambertThroughout his career, on-screen and off, the 64-year-old has been known for his eccentric personal style. Ever since he burst on to screens in 1986 as the host of the late night TV chatshow The Last Resort, a jazzy oversized suit has been his signature. So while no one expected Ross, who once wore a blue checked Jean Paul Gaultier tailored skirt suit to a Pulp Fiction premiere in 1994, to start dressing like a member of the Labour party, his decision to ramp up his outlandish style as a Traitor did come as a surprisebecause remaining inconspicuous is key. In previous seasons of the civilian version of the show contestants such as Paul Gortontried to go under the radarin unremarkable jeans and T-shirts and the ex-army engineer Harry Clark leant into a “softboi” persona in flannel shirts and a pearl necklace.The fart that could save TV! Why Celebrity Traitors is all about Alan Carr v Celia ImrieRead moreDr Dion Terrelonge, a fashion psychologist, thinks of Ross’s look as a costume. “In a game that is all about perception, Ross seemed to lean into his personal style even more so than he tends to do in his everyday life,” he said. Terrelonge believes Ross’s looks contributed to the Faithfuls’“big dog” theorywhere they were convinced it was either him or Stephen Fry leading the Traitors pack. “He went on a show where usually the simplest strategy used is to try to blend in,” Terrelonge says. “But by dressing in an attention-grabbing way, Ross purposefully chose to stand out. Sometimes when people dress in that way it is used to signal status. It says ‘I am a leader’ and ‘I am going to do things my way’. It was risky. It could have made him much more vulnerable just because he physically stood out.”View image in fullscreenJonathan Ross leant into his reputation for big, bold outfits on the show.Photograph: Euan Cherry/BBC/Studio LambertWhile the cast were assigned a stylist, Ross plotted his looks himself, choosing pieces from his vast personal wardrobe. In a post-show interview, he explained he had packed even more unconventional pieces – including a full goth look – that he never got a chance to wear.Of course, only the viewers at home knew that Ross was truly a Traitor. As a result, his wardrobe performed in the same way as his treacherous behaviour to the other cast members. That aforementioned jumpsuit and Ray-Ban aviators look alluded to Tom Cruise’s “Maverick” hero and created a sort of Faithful energy as Ross pushed a two-and-a-half-tonne Trojan horse up a hill with his fellow celebrities.While under the cover of darkness, Ross donned a velvet cloak to carry out his killings, by day his jovial tweed cape evoked the gentle detective Sherlock Holmes as he pretended to help the Faithfuls determine who was deceiving them. All that was missing was the deerstalker hat. His homey knitwear also helped to mislead players as he captured the aesthetic of cosy crime films such as The Thursday Murder Club. Would a ruthless killer really wear a fuzzy leopard print cardigan and caramel corduroy trousers to breakfast in the morning?Clare Baldingdidn’t seem to think so when she compared that particular look to the cast of the Flintstones. “Yabba, yabba don’t,” quipped Alan Carr in response.View image in fullscreenCould a Traitor wear leopard print and corduroy? Ross’s fellow contestants couldn’t be sure.Photograph: Euan Cherry/BBC/Studio LambertBut for every innocent guise there was a more undeniably faithless look. In a post-show interview, the comedian Lucy Beaumont, who was murdered by Ross face to face, said on reflection she could not believe her and her fellow faithfuls didn’t decipher Ross was a Traitor from his clothing alone.The stylist Peter Bevanpoints to checked tailoring as “Bond baddie coded” and compares the black furry stole Ross wore to Paloma Faith’s funeral to Cruella de Vil. “Even though his clothes are naturally quite eccentric, it felt like he hammed up the bad-guy persona intentionally,” Bevan says.View image in fullscreenCruella de Ross? Some feel the broadcaster’s love of costuming hastened his downfall.Photograph: Euan Cherry/BBC/Studio LambertHowever, even when Ross was aware he was coming to his demise, he remained defiant, choosing to wear an attention-grabbing Kermit green blazer to attend what would be his last round table. After seven days and dozens of wardrobe changes, the faithfuls finally put the not-so-secret sartorial clues together.Explore more on these topicsThe TraitorsJonathan RossMen's fashionThe news on TVTelevisionAlan CarrClare BaldingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She opens up about politics, monsters – and whether her teen romance scenes would be acceptable todayEmine SanerFri 31 Oct 2025 09.00 EDTShareIn the new thriller The Beast in Me, a memoirist takes on a sinister property developer who may or may not have killed his first wife, and it’s not entirely clear which of the two is more dangerous. It has been billed by Netflix as “cat and mouse”, butClaire Danesprefers to think of it as the more evenly matched snake and mongoose.“I liked the idea of a writer being truly dangerous, and predatorial,” she says of her character, Aggie Wiggs – grieving the loss of her young son and living divorced and alone in a big house she can’t afford – who develops a fascination with her new neighbour. Nile Jarvis (I can get on board with everything in the gripping eight-part series except, perhaps, just about every character’s name) is certainly monstrous, may also be a murderer, but might just have found his equal, because “she’s a real fighter, and she doesn’t have that much to lose”.When they meet, explosively, Aggie is riding the tail end of the success of a bestselling memoir, and running out of money. Her marriage collapsed in the aftermath of their son’s death in an accident, and Aggie’s behaviour towards the young man she believes was responsible has landed her with a restraining order. “I really grew to enjoy her company,” says Danes. “She’s in a lot of pain that she’s not fully admitting to herself, but I admired her mind, her intellectual integrity and her chutzpah and, ultimately, her depth of feeling.”View image in fullscreen‘They’re soul mates, but sex isn’t at play’ … Claire Danes as Aggie Wiggs and Matthew Rhys as Nile Jarvis in The Beast in Me.Photograph: NetflixAggie is experiencing writer’s block on her new book, a worthy analysis of the friendship, across the political divide, of the US supreme court justices Ruth Bader Ginsberg and Antonin Scalia. “I think it’s a story that could offer hope,” Aggie says, uncertainly, over lunch with Nile (Matthew Rhys), her sinister new friend. “No one wants hope,” he snaps back. “People want gossip and carnage.” Sadly, he’s not wrong, but then what we want and what we need are rarely the same thing. Try befriending a sociopath who may end up manifesting your darkest desires and see how that plays out (it’s not a spoiler to say: not ideal).Their dynamic is all the more fun, and refreshing, because there’s no romantic subtext – Aggie is a lesbian, but Nile is a rich sociopath so, of course, he thinks she wants to have sex with him. “They’re really excited by each other, and wrestling for power with each other, but they’re also genuinely delighting in each other,” says Danes, when we speak over Zoom. “They’re kind of soulmates, but they’re adversaries, and sex isn’t at play. That was interesting. I’d never played that, and I haven’t really seen it before.”Was she nervous about playing a lesbian character and how that might be perceived at a time when we question whether apparently straight people – Danes is married to the actor Hugh Dancy, with whom she has three children – should be taking queer roles? “Oh, that’s interesting,” she says. “No, I wasn’t, to be honest, but maybe I should have been.” Thoughtful and intelligent as Danes is, I can’t work out if she’s being a little disingenuous. But it was intriguing not to have to be considered “sexy” to a male character, probably for the first time in her career. As a girl, she says, “I had to learn how to cultivate and assume a more feminine affect”. She remembers consciously training herself to walk in a more alluring way. “And suddenly in this role, I felt I could let some of that go. I felt like my 11-year-old self, before I had to present in a particular way, and that was really enjoyable, quite freeing.”View image in fullscreen‘I wasn’t nervous about playing a lesbian, but maybe I should have been’ … Danes as Aggie Wiggs in The Beast in Me.Photograph: NetflixThere were parallels with Carrie Mathison, the CIA agent Danes played over eight seasons of Homeland, the role she is still best known for. “She definitely was a dangerous person who didn’t have much to lose, and was deeply isolated and super-brilliant. Carrie probably did use her feminine wiles a little more.” She laughs and adds: “But she was still in a pantsuit.”Could she imagine Homeland now, in the current political climate where TV networks are nervy in Trump’s America and politics moves ever faster? “I hope so,” says Danes. “I don’t know if another show was so committed to reflecting the political moment as it was happening as Homeland was, and that was really exciting.” She remembers spending a week with intelligence experts, “what I started calling spy camp”, before the writers went off to write each new season. “We would get a forecast. It was a great privilege, and a little TMI sometimes. I miss it. There was something wonderful about being able to metabolise what was happening, politically, and reflect and comment on it in this fictional work. I don’t have that means of expression any more.”She doesn’t think a Homeland-style show would be impossible to create today, though. “This is a funny metaphor that’s coming to mind, but if you want to wear a ballgown, wear a fucking ballgown. I think it’s a little like that. If you decide to make a show like that, you’ll make a show like that. I don’t know that Homeland was made because the climate allowed for it. I think that show was made because Howard [Gordon] and Alex [Gansa] wanted to make it.” On her own feelings about the state of politics in the US, she says carefully, “It’s scary. It feels very volatile, and I’m really sad about how frightened we are of each other right now. I’m sad about that, so many of us are distrustful of each other.”It was Danes, who is a producer on The Beast in Me, who brought Homeland producer Gordon in to get it made, after it stalled for a couple of years (she was sent the script during the pandemic by Jodie Foster, who at one point was going to direct). “It’s really the first time I’ve produced a project from the beginning, and that was wonderful, I loved that,” she says, then adds with a laugh: “That’s the nice thing about being old. I’ve made friends along the way, and I can turn to them to make something with me.”View image in fullscreen‘It was a little awkward, but it was OK’ … Danes with Jared Leto in My So-Called Life in 1994.Photograph: Studiocanal/AllstarDanes is obviously not old – she’s 46 – but has been working for decades. She grew up in Manhattan, with artistic parents, and discovered a love of acting and performing as a child. The family moved to California when Danes got the lead role of Angela Chase in teen drama My So-Called Life. Danes was 14, and the boy she was supposed to have a crush on was played by Jared Leto, who was 21, an age gap that these days would be considered vastly inappropriate. Did it feel awkward at the time?“A little, but it was OK,” she says. Everything was awkward then. “I had barely kissed a boy and here I was making out with this Adonis, and I didn’t even know how to interpret the stage directions. Like it said I was supposed to kiss his face, and I did not know what that meant. I didn’t know that there was any other terrain that one could explore.” It was strange she says, “circling these themes in real time. Two months later, what I was exploring as Angela would suddenly become personally relevant to me.” Teenagehood, she points out, “is so Kafka-esque. It’s a really wild ride, and there I was, having a parallel one as a fictional self.”But it never felt exploitative or damaging, she says. The people who created the show, including writer Winnie Holzman, “were bona fide benevolent grownups, so it was a very solid, sane environment. That was luck. Not every environment is.” But would she say it’s a good thing that we probably wouldn’t cast a 21-year-old man opposite a 14-year-old love interest now? “I really don’t know. We might, would we not? I honestly don’t know what my moral stance on that is. Maybe because it just was my experience, and I felt safe.” But working with intimacy coordinators now as standard is great, she adds. “How did we not have that before? I’m very for it. But it is funny to be working with an intimacy coordinator for the first time as a 45-year-old.” She smiles. “Like, it’s a little late.”View image in fullscreenYoung love … Danes with Leonardo DiCaprio in Romeo + Juliet in 1996.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library/AlamyDanes seems to have survived decades in the industry, apparently relatively unscathed. “I think it was good that I took a little time out and went to college,” she says. Around the height of her movie fame, having co-starred with Leonardo DiCaprio in the 1996 film Romeo + Juliet (she was 17 during filming, he was 21), she spent two years at Yale studying psychology.“My parents were always very present when I was on set as a kid,” she says, “and made sure I was protected and my needs were met, and I had a good tutor, and sufficient rest, that kind of thing.” Others looked out for her. Jodie Foster directed her when she was a teenager in the 1995 family comedy drama Home for the Holidays. What has she learned from the great Foster? “She said a lot of things, but she always has urged me to advocate for myself. And also to relax.”Mostly, Danes just really loves the work – everything else that comes with being a successful actor – the attention and awards – is, she says, “kind of just noise” even if what she describes as “the undulations of success” are what leads to more work. “I hope that people are connecting with what I’m trying to make, and I also hope that I have another chance at making another thing.” She laughs. “Like, that’s it.”The Beast in Me is on Netflix from 13 November.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionClaire DanesDramafeaturesShareReuse this content"

I think weConservativeswere just becoming a bit irrelevant,” said Henry Bateson, a one-time Conservative student who switched to Reform UK and is now president of Newcastle’s merged Conservative and Reform UK society.Recentopinion pollssuggest nearly half of Tory members would support a merger with Reform into a single party. While Conservative leaders have dismissed the idea, on campuses those on the right, such as Bateson, say their societies would struggle on their own.“If we chose one party then we would lose half of our numbers and probably struggle to survive,” said Bateson. “I’ve now jumped on the Reform bandwagon.Kemi Badenochis not cutting through at all.”The decision to merge provoked a phone call from the party hierarchy, unhappy at the approach. But the combined Newcastle group continues to attract Conservative MPs and luminaries to its “pint and policy” debates.Bateson said the merger was necessary to maintain a place for students on the political right, and warned: “I think it’s only a matter of time before Conservative societies go extinct at British universities – and we may hasten the Tories’ demise unapologetically, because they have let us down.”The latest polling shows Reform overtaking the Conservatives among younger voters. YouGov’smost recent pollhas Reform supported by 10% of those aged 18 to 24, with the Conservatives on 7% – both well behind Labour and the Greens.At the University of York, the Conservative society lost about half its members after many left to form a Reform society, in what the group’s former secretary, Jacob Boneham, described as a “nasty split”.“I know friends from the York Conservatives who identify as working class, voted for Boris Johnson and were big fans of his. Now they’ve gone over to Reform,” said Boneham.‘The centre cannot hold’: John Curtice on the collapse of two-party politics – podcastRead moreDurham University’s Reform society was started last year by Xavier Hale, a philosophy student and former Conservative who has since helped other students looking to launch their own branches, including at Exeter, Kent and Oxford.Hale said: “Durham was the first Reform society on the scene, so we set the standard. We were the first to get ratified, the first to start holding fully developed events, the first to actually get a functional relationship with our local branch.”In its early days, the society struggled to attract 30 members, but Hale says the numbers attending events this year has doubled and Reform has been included in cross-party events such as a bar crawl involving the Conservative and Lib Dem students.“There was more of a taboo last year than there is this year,” Hale said.Jack Eccles, who launched Lancaster University’s Reform society in January, is another former Conservative supporter who says he “switched straight away” to Reform whenNigel Farage returned as leader.“Farage represents more British values. He just resonates with working-class people a lot better,” Eccles said. “It’s just a ticking timebomb for the Conservatives; young Tories are getting fed up. I think all the younger people on the right are switching to Reform.”Connor Winter, the chair of Lancaster’s Conservative society, said: “Last year we took a hit because the Reform society had a buzz, everyone was talking about it … There are plenty of Conservative societies that have taken a hit.”Reform’s appearance on campus has not gone unnoticed by other parties. At Lancaster, more than 750 students signed a petition asking the student union to refuse affiliation. At Edinburgh, political societies including Labour and the Greens have agreed to exclude Reform from cross-party events such as debates.But with Reform prepared to rapidly promote its youngest members, including an18-year-old as leader of Warwickshire council, its student members see their campus societies becoming a pipeline for future candidates.Eccles, who has accepted a position within the national party, said: “We need to have successful societies at university campuses all across the country because it allows us to prepare future council candidates, future local councillors, maybe even future MPs,” and adding: “I genuinely think it’s a movement that could go on for 100 years.”Explore more on these topicsReform UKStudent politicsStudentsHigher educationConservativesDurham UniversityNewcastle UniversitynewsShareReuse this content"

Talks on the relocation package are believed to be ongoing.Now stripped of his titles including prince and HRH, Mountbatten Windsor was struck from the officialroll of the peeragejust hours afterBuckingham Palace announced the formal process had been initiated.View image in fullscreenMountbatten Windsor and King Charles leaving the funeral of the Duchess of Kent in September 2025.Photograph: Toby Melville/ReutersA palace statement on Thursday said the king had started the formal process “to remove the style, titles and honours of Prince Andrew” and that “formal notice has now been served to surrender the lease” on Royal Lodge.It added: “Their majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse.”What does it mean to be plain old Andrew Mountbatten Windsor?Read moreThe prime minister, Keir Starmer, is said to fully support the king’s decision. A Downing Street spokesperson said: “Our hearts go out to the family of Virginia Giuffre and all the victims who suffered from Jeffrey Epstein’s despicable crimes.”Giuffre’s brother, Sky Roberts, told the Guardian that the palace statement was a royal “acknowledgement that something occurred” between the disgraced duke and his sister, who died by suicide this year.He added: “I think that [the king is] speaking very clearly in that statement when he says he’s with survivors out there.”The government was consulted before Buckingham Palace’s announcement, and has made clear its belief it is constitutionally proper for the king to make this decision.It is understood that the Cabinet Office worked with the king’s senior aides to find a solution that would avoid use of parliamentary time, and consulted with several constitutional experts. The king ultimately opted to abolish the dukedom using his powers of royal prerogative.A royal warrant and letters patent to formally remove Mountbatten Windsor’s entitlement to use his prince and HRH style will be processed over the next few days.A senior government minister suggested on Friday that Mountbatten Windsor should go to the US to answer questions on Jeffrey Epstein if asked.Trade minister Sir Chris Bryant told BBC Breakfast: “I think that just as with any ordinary member of the public, if there were requests from another jurisdiction of this kind, I would expect any decently minded person to comply with that request. So I feel exactly the same in this situation.“What I’m basically saying is that I think that if Andrew is asked to do something by a Senate committee, then I would have thought that he would want to comply.”Scotland Yard is considering whether it should launch new criminal investigations into the alleged activities of the former prince. He is now caught up in two inquiries by British police.View image in fullscreenVirginia Giuffre pictured in April 2025 holding a photo of herself as a teenager.Photograph: Emily Michot/TNS/ZUMA Press Wire/REX/ShutterstockOne is a “scoping” exercise – an inquiry before a formal criminal investigation is launched – into whether Giuffre’s posthumously published memoirs and other recent claims require a full investigation.The second inquiry follows claims that Mountbatten Windsor tried to get his police protection officers to “dig up dirt” on Giuffre.While the loss of his titles comes into effect immediately, the former prince is not expected to leave Royal Lodge until after Christmas, which means he will – conveniently – not be present when the royals gather at Sandringham for the holiday.Discussions about Mountbatten Windsor’s tenure on Royal Lodge reportedly grew more urgent in late 2024, when the Prince and Princess of Wales decided to move to Forest Lodge, less than two miles away.As they intend to remain in their new home when William eventually becomes king, the couple feared the PR implications of having his uncle as a close neighbour, sources told the Guardian.Sources also said William and Kate felt deeply frustrated at the lack of acknowledgment of Epstein’s victims in the statement Mountbatten Windsor released two weeks ago, announcing he was voluntarily relinquishing the use of his titles.The Telegraph reported on Friday night that the queen had also been a factor in the move to strip Mountbatten Windsor of his titles, as she was concerned about his impact on her work with sexual abuse victims.View image in fullscreenThe entrance gates to Royal Lodge in Windsor Great Park.Photograph: Peter Nicholls/Getty ImagesBuckingham Palace has previously said that the royal family, including the Waleses, fully support the king’s leadership on this matter, and all decisions have been the king’s, with the support of the wider family.While Charles is expected to make private financial provision for his brother, Mountbatten Windsor’s ex-wife,Sarah Ferguson, will make her own arrangements. Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice will retain their titles as daughters of the son of a sovereign, in line with King George V’s letters patent of 1917.The decision to strip Mountbatten Windsor of his titles followed two weeks of difficult negotiations following his statement he would cease to use them, a move which failed to stem negative headlines.Palace sources indicated the latest move was prompted by serious lapses of judgment over the former prince’s involvement with Epstein, and that the necessity of action was never in doubt.The king’s decision was almost certainly influenced by Giuffre’s posthumously published memoir, Nobody’s Girl,exclusive extracts from which were published in the Guardian.These repeated her allegation – strenuously denied by Mountbatten Windsor – that she had been forced to have sex with the then prince on three occasions while trafficked by Epstein.Thursday’s palace statement made clear that the censures were “deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he [Mountbatten Windsor] continues to deny the allegations against him”.Throughout the process, the palace is understood to have been conscious of the impact the king’s decision will have on his brother and his family.Pressure had intensified as MPs called for parliamentary debate on Mountbatten Windsor’s position, and as the public accounts committee released a list of detailed questions they had sent to the crown estate about his 75-year lease on Royal Lodge.View image in fullscreenMountbatten Windsor, Giuffre and Ghislaine Maxwell in a photograph taken on 10 March 2001.Photograph: US Department of Justice/PADespite the king’s move, Mountbatten Windsor remains eighth in the line of succession to the throne. A change to this would require primary legislation, for which there are no current plans.“Clearly it would take quite a catastrophe for him to become king, given all those that are ahead of him,” said Joe Little, managing editor of Majesty Magazine. “So might it not have been tidier to withdraw him from the line of succession?”The former prince also remains a counsellor of state, albeit inactive, as parliament has previously been assured only working royals would be eligible to act as stand-ins for the king should he be incapacitated or abroad.Mountbatten Windsor is said to have had a “cast-iron” lease for Royal Lodge, and only after negotiations with the king’s representatives did he agree to serve formal notice to surrender the agreement, which had more than 50 years left to run.Though the process of surrendering the lease and other formalities can be drawn out, it is understood that things are moving as quickly as practicable.Buckingham Palace and Kensington Palace were approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsAndrew Mountbatten WindsorKing Charles IIIJeffrey EpsteinSarah FergusonMonarchyPrince WilliamKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

The public deserves to know who was abusing women and young girls alongside Epstein.”Republicans hold the majority in the House, but amid public outcry over Donald Trump’s handling of the Epstein case approved an inquiry by the oversight committee into how the government handled his prosecutions. Interest in the case flared in July, after the justice department announced a much-rumored list of Epstein’s sex-trafficking clients did not exist, and it would share nothing further on the case.The House investigation has thus far resulted in the release oftens of thousands of pages of documents– includinga lewd drawingapparently made by Trump for Epstein’s 50th birthday – as well as depositions from former top government officials.As a member of the minority, Khanna does not have the power to subpoena Mountbatten Windsor’s testimony. Spokespeople for the committee’s Republican chair, James Comer, did not respond to questions about whether he believes the former prince should be questioned.Khanna and Thomas Massie, a Republican congressman, have introduced a bill to force the release of files related to Epstein, but Mike Johnson, the Republican House speaker, a top ally of the president, has refused to bring it up for a vote. Massie and Khanna have circulated a discharge petition that will require the bill be voted on, if 218 members of the House sign it.“This is what my effort with Representative Massie has been about: transparency and justice for the survivors who have been courageously speaking out,” Khanna said.The petition has been signed by all 213 House Democrats, as well as four Republicans. The 218th signature is expected to be Adelita Grijalva, who won a special election in Arizona last month, and awaits swearing in by Johnson. However, the speaker hasrefused to do sountil the House comes back into session, and says he will not tell lawmakers to return to Washington until the Senate approves a measure to end theongoing government shutdown.Explore more on these topicsHouse of RepresentativesJeffrey EpsteinAndrew Mountbatten WindsorDemocratsRepublicansCaliforniaUS CongressnewsShareReuse this content"

There has been a shift,” he said.Giuffre’s sister-in-law, Amanda Roberts, said: “To put that acknowledgment out for survivors is huge. We haven’t seen that from anyone, and to acknowledge that there are survivors in this situation is an acknowledgment that abuse did occur.“It is the very first step for that justice for survivors. It is first the acknowledgment that something went on here. There was real trauma that happened to these young girls.”In a posthumous memoir, Giuffre – who died earlier this year – repeated allegations that, as a teenager, she had sex with Mountbatten Windsor on three separate occasions. He has always denied any wrongdoing. He settled a civil case with Giuffre for a reported £12m with no admission of liability.Amanda described the statement by the palace as a “victory” and “vindication for our sister”.“We’re just so exceptionally proud of her, but then the sorrow hits because you wish she was here to share this moment together with her – a moment that she has been waiting for, for a very long time,” she added.Women’s rights campaigners and advocacy groups also welcomed the move by the royal family, with some saying it sent an important message to survivors of abuse.Gemma Sherrington, chief executive of Refuge, said it was “incredibly powerful to see survivors recognised so directly in a statement from the palace”, adding that it sent a message that “survivors matter, that their experiences are believed, and that they deserve to be at the heart of national conversations about abuse”.Penny East, the chief executive at the Fawcett Society, said “it is a welcome acknowledgment that the real victims here are not embarrassed politicians or disgraced princes, but the women and girls who were sexually assaulted by entitled, misogynistic men.”However, she added: “Removing a title, or moving house can never be viewed as true accountability or sufficient punishment. Indeed, one brave woman, Virginia Giuffre, has lost her life. It was a terrible tragedy, and a reminder of the profound impact sexual assault has on women and girls.”Describing Giuffre’s character and fight for justice, Sky said she was a “strong warrior” who could also be cheeky and goofy.“This is an ordinary girl from an ordinary family that did something extraordinary and I think this is something the world should be proud of.“She was this strong warrior who refused to back down and refused to stay silent and we are finally getting that acknowledgment that she truly was a world hero.”The palace declined to comment.In the UK,Rape Crisisoffers support for rape and sexual abuse on 0808 802 9999 in England and Wales, 0808 801 0302 inScotland, or 0800 0246 991 inNorthern Ireland.

As it was, the story could not be convincingly denied, however much friends of Andrew tried to suggest the picture was a fake. Or that Andrew wouldseek to blacken her namemuch later byinstructing his royal protection officer to seek out derogatory detailsabout her, even providing her birth date and social security number, which can only have come from the convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein or his minions?An odd, giveaway gesture by someone who had publicly pretended to have never heard of her, said he could never have had sex with her and yet paid her $12m of his mother’s money to fend off a long prevaricated lawsuit.In this context, talk of the royals acting decisively to cut Andrew off are wide of the mark. This scandal has gone on for the best part of 15 years since that photograph, and another of Andrew walking amiably in Central Park with Epstein, came to light. Arguably it was longer still: how long ago did his siblings, perhaps even his parents, know that Andrew was so self-entitled?They must have realised, if his staff and the police were doing their jobs, that he had some deeply disreputable friends given he openly invited them to Buckingham Palace, or Balmoral, or evenRoyal Lodge, another of his perks.The fall of Prince Andrew – a timelineRead moreIf the family did not know about his sexual proclivities, they certainly knew about hisextravagance with public money, because the trips were printed in the royal annual reports: the taking of a helicopter from the palace to an Oxfordshire golf course and back again in time for lunch, the private flights instead of scheduled services, all for the convenience of “Airmiles Andy”. Then there was the entitlement that demanded deference when he entered a room (“Let’s try that again, shall we?” when people did not notice his arrival, according to hisrecent biographerAndrew Lownie) or the supreme consciousness about the use of his royal titles, from on his letterheads to with his personal acquaintances.He could get away with it while his mother, who inexplicably indulged him, was still alive. Queen Elizabeth did at least strip him of public duties and honorary colonelcies after his disastrous and, we now know,mendacious Newsnight interviewsix years ago, which he thought had gone rather well. But his behaviour has scarcely changed since, sidling into the limelight at public events, most recently at the Duchess of Kent’s funeral in September, vainly trying to make conversation with an all too evidently discomfited Prince William. And clinging on desperately to his grace and favour residence at the 30-room Royal Lodge in Windsor Great Park, even into this week reluctant to give it up in the face of pressure from the king.View image in fullscreenAndrew standing behind Prince William and Catherine, Princess of Wales, after the funeral of the Duchess of Kent in London in September.Photograph: Toby Melville/ReutersIt was only in the last fortnight that events sped up after the publication not only of Lownie’s bookEntitled, but Giuffre’sposthumous memoir, Nobody’s Girl, giving more grim details of his behaviour and that of Epstein and the convicted child sex trafficker Maxwell towards her. Further disclosures have again exposed Andrew’s thinking that he could get away with lying about his contact with Epstein in the Newsnight interview. If the palace thought that ceasing the use of his titles without actually removing them – allegedly, though clearly not actually, at his request and still without acknowledgment of any fault – it had another think coming.The public (and the media) were far ahead of the royals. There was no one of any consequence to speak up for him, a result of all those years of arrogance, and the gravity of the looming institutional damage was finally clear. The more intelligent royals realised that. The one imperative is to pass on the monarchy, if not as heretofore at least intact and untarnished. They have spent the last 190 years trying to undo the reputation of the Georgians, proving they are useful, responsible and responsive to their subjects; if not exactly like them, then role models for respectability and good behaviour. Andrew wasputting all that in dangerin an age when deference and discretion is no longer enough.Finally, the famously indecisive king was prodded further. There was no alternative. The palace had lost control of the narrative. The days when the indiscretions of princes could be overlooked or hidden – think Edward VII and his predilection for chorus girls and mistresses, Edward VIII and his half-secret relationships with Freda Dudley Ward and Wallis Simpson, or even the Belgian Leopold II, who had sex with underage children (not as bad as his treatment of the people of the Congo, his private fiefdom, but bad enough) – were over.It is theloss of titlesand the continued and lifelong public humiliation that will hurt Andrew,demoted to just Mr Mountbatten-Windsor, the most. As will the fact that he is the first royal to lose his titles in modern times; the last to do so was the Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale, who sided with Germany in the first world war, while Japan’s Emperor Hirohito was stripped of his knighthood of the garter after the second. Since one of Andrew’s few claims to fame is his service in the Falklands war, this will particularly sting. He is still a counsellor of state, theoretically able to stand in for the king, and he is still eighth in line to the throne, but neither of these will ever come to pass.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Will the agreeable golf courses of the north Norfolk coast still welcome him as an honoured guest?Of course, he is not retiring to Surbiton or Slough, but to the royal family’s 8,100-hectare (20,000 acre) estate at Sandringham. There, he will be furnished by the king with one of the grace and favour houses –will it be York Cottage or Wood Farm?– and given some sort of private allowance, though it may still take some time for him to move in. It is not Royal Lodge, where he paid a peppercorn rent for more than 20 years – that really caused public outrage, and Norfolk is a bit distant, but even so it may not be far enough. Presumably Kazakhstan, where he is friends with members of the elite, was a bit remote.Will locals be pleased to see him doing the weekly shop at an Aldi in King’s Lynn? (That’s probably a step too far.) Members of the public still stroll through the Sandringham grounds and the royal family themselves decamp there for Christmas and new year (and go to church), but there he would be an unwelcome stranger at the feast. Apparently, Sarah Ferguson, his ex-wife, will not be moving in. It will be an internal exile.This is not over. There are stillfiles in the hands of the US Congressto be disclosed, though the Americans are understandably more interested in who on their side of the Atlantic was ensnared in Epstein’s net. Willparliament demand more, orinvestigate the waste of public money? There may even be a police investigation into his behaviour, though that seems unlikely – neither the government nor the king would want that.Which property on the Sandringham estate is fit for a former prince?Read morePerhaps for the moment the institutional damage to the monarchy is limited. The narrative from the palace on Thursday night was clearly that the removal of titles was what Charles, and particularlyPrince William, wanted. No more pretence that Andrew was doing it voluntarily. And, remarkably, the brief five sentences showed clearly that the royals were siding with Giuffre’s version of events, not Andrew’s. Even more, for the first time they finally showed concern for the victims: “The censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him. Their majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse.”Ultimately it is entitlement, self-seeking and indolence that will kill the monarchy. In his stupidity, self-indulgence and venality, Andrew seems never to have learned that lesson.Stephen Bates is a former Guardian royal correspondent and is author of Royalty Inc: Britain’s Best-known Brand, and The Shortest History of the CrownExplore more on these topicsAndrew Mountbatten WindsorMonarchyJeffrey EpsteinGhislaine MaxwellKing Charles IIIPrince WilliamanalysisShareReuse this content"

It’s quite different from seeing out his days in a council house, but few imagine that his new life, somewhere on the lush Sandringham estate, will be anything other than a private hell.Andrew is a commoner, but what will that mean? What will life be like for 65-year-oldAndrew Mountbatten Windsor? Will it bring an end to the questions still being asked about him and his dealings with the late disgraced financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein?Royal observers believe Thursday’s announcement represents nothing short of “absolute humiliation” for Andrew.Richard Fitzwilliams, a royal author and commentator, told the Guardian: “I think it will be pretty well a living hell for him, given his particular fondness for titles and his entitled attitude.”The fall of Prince Andrew – a timelineRead moreAndrew had never done himself any favours, Fitzwilliams said. The public have rarely warmed to him. “One of the troubles with him is that he has proven to be so greedy,” he said. “People see him as entitled, greedy and also unbelievably bovine because of that extraordinary Newsnight interview.”Titles are rarely taken away, and the history of it will surely burn hard on Andrew’s pride. The last men to be stripped of their princehood were the Dukes of Cumberland and Albany, in 1919, after they fought for Germany in the first world war.Observers say that when he was a prince, Andrew particularly enjoyed going to the annual and lavish Garter Day ceremony at Windsor Castle in June. But he has been stripped of the Order of the Garter, too, just as Emperor Hirohito of Japan was during the second world war.“He has been treated as an enemy of the state, effectively,” the royal biographer Robert Hardman told Sky News.View image in fullscreenJapan’s Emperor Hirohito was stripped of the Order of the Garter in 1941.Photograph: APAndrew is banished and has no chance of being invited to the king’s Christmas celebrations – or any royal event, save perhaps royal funerals, said Fitzwilliams. But questions remain – including why Andrew remains eighth in line to the throne.“I’m sure at some point quite soon, somebody will ask, if they’ve not already done so, why he hasn’t been moved from the line of succession,” said Joe Little, the managing editor of Majesty Magazine.Little said it was not all bleak for Andrew, particularly since the king is providing him somewhere new to live. “He will no longer be in Windsor, but he’ll be on a private royal estate in Norfolk, and will have accommodation provided and he will be supported in other ways by his brother, the king, for whom it’s been, equally, a very difficult time.”Andrew has always denied any wrongdoing, but if he thinks the stripping of his titles is the end of troubles, others will disagree. He is now an “ordinary member of the public” and some see that as an opportunity for him to be extradited.The family of the late Virginia Giuffre – who claimed to have been trafficked to and made to have sex with Andrew when she was 17 – continue to call for Andrew to face justice in the US.He “needs to be behind bars”, Giuffre’s brother Sky Roberts told the BBC’s Newsnight programme on Thursday.‘Prince Andrew believed having sex with me was his birthright’: Virginia Giuffre on her abuse at the hands of Epstein, Maxwell and the king’s brotherRead moreThe UK trade minister Chris Bryant also suggested Andrew should, if asked, go to the US to answer questions about the crimes of Epstein.Bryant told the BBC: “I think that, just as with any ordinary member of the public, if there were requests from another jurisdiction of this kind, I would expect any decently minded person to comply with that request.”The Democratic congressman Suhas Subramanyam recentlycalled on Andrew to appear before a committeethat is investigating the handling of Jeffrey Epstein’s prosecution. “If he did nothing wrong, he should come before a committee and swear himself in and testify that he did nothing wrong,” he said.In the UK there have been signs thatformal parliamentary inquiries may be launchedinto Andrew’s affairs.The Metropolitan police have also said they are “actively”looking into claimsthat Andrew passed Giuffre’s date of birth and social security number to his police protection officer in an attempt to dig up dirt for a smear campaign.It is impossible to say exactly what is next for Andrew, but no one can see a meaningful way back for him as a public figure.Explore more on these topicsAndrew Mountbatten WindsorMonarchyJeffrey EpsteinKing Charles IIIHonours systemnewsShareReuse this content"

He said the army’s failure to take appropriate action “more than minimally” contributed to her death.On Friday, the court heard that Webber engaged Beck in a drinking game called Last Man Standing before touching her thigh and trying to kiss her.Beck pushed Webber, then a 39-year-old battery sergeant major, away and she spent the night locked in her car, hiding from him.Judge Advocate General Alan Large told Webber: “She had the courage and good sense to tell you to stop and told you to go to bed, but you persisted to the extent she considered she wouldn’t be safe from you even if she went back to her own accommodation.”The judge pointed out that Webber was promoted after the assault. “Your career continued completely unaffected,” he said.View image in fullscreenLeighann McCready, mother of Jaysley Beck, speaks to the media outside court.Photograph: Ben Birchall/PAIn a victim personal statement, Beck’s mother, Leighann McCready, described how she received a phone call from her “very scared” daughter after the assault. She said that when Beck heard Webber had been promoted, she said: “I got a letter, he got a promotion.”McCready said: “The assault shattered her faith in the system that was supposed to look after her. I truly believe that what he did and how it was handled broke something inside her that she couldn’t repair.”Outside court, she said: “The army is clearly not a safe space for young women. This is still continuing. They mark their own homework and this has been going on for too many years. Jaysley followed the rules but those responsible didn’t follow theirs.”‘This is not a problem of the past’: Jaysley Beck’s death shows toxic misogyny persists in the armed forcesRead moreWebber served in the army for 22 years before leaving in August. He now works as a lorry driver and receives £1,200 a month from a military pension.Michael Webber, in grey T-shirt, at a training event with Jaysley BeckRepresenting Webber, Matthew Scott said: “He accepts his actions on that night contributed in some way to the tragic outcome when she took her own life.”After the inquest, the army said it should have done “so much more” to support and protect Beck.On Friday, the minister for veterans and people, Louise Sandher-Jones, said: “We are honouring Jaysley’s legacy by bringing about crucial reform, to provide a place where people are proud to work and have faith in the service justice system.”Maj Gen Jon Swift, an assistant chief of the general staff, said: “We are sorry we didn’t listen to Jaysley when she first reported her assault. We are determined to make sure the same mistakes don’t happen again.“Work is ongoing to make lasting and effective change. Change that will give service personnel the confidence they need to report sexual offences and inappropriate behaviours, knowing that they will be listened to.”In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

An executive at one parts maker said: “In some ways the government played a blinder with everyone thinking they bailed out JLR. They did nothing.”JLR was able torestart limited productiononly in early October. It has since been focusing on ramping up output, with a full rate of production expected by early December.The shutdown caused chaos in the UK automotive industry, which was already under pressure after an extended period of low demand. Suppliers laid off thousands of workers to save cash, and this month the Guardian revealedJLR’s plan to pay upfront for partsin order to get money into the supply chain quickly after a month without orders.JLR is on track to avoid the worst-case scenario of a shutdown lasting into the new year. However, the Confederation of British Metalforming (CBM), a lobby group representing many of the company’s suppliers, said financial support to parts makers stillneeded to be accelerated.Most suppliers work on 60-day payment terms, meaning some will start to feel the worst of the financial pressure next week, two months after the attack halted orders.The crisis prompted calls by MPs for government intervention, before the Labour party conference at the end of September. The evening before the conference, Kyle announced that government-controlled UK Export Finance (UKEF) would guarantee a £1.5bn loan, in effect promising to cover 80% of the debt if JLR were to default.The size of the guarantee was “outside of UKEF’s normal risk appetite”, its chief executivewarnedthe business secretary.Announcing the loan guarantee, Kyle said it had “the explicit intention that that is to support the supply chain into JLR as well”. In itsannouncementthe government said it would “bolster JLR’s cash reserves so it can support its supply chain which has been greatly impacted by the shutdown”.In his conference speech two days later, Kyle trumpeted the government’s intervention. Hesaid: “I’ve announced £1.5bn support – a huge amount of money to help a hugely important company.”The Financial Times reported that JLR only formally agreed the loan covered by UKEF this month, with HSBC, Mitsubishi UFJ Group and NatWest acting as potential lenders.Several sources told the Guardian that none of that loan facility had gone into JLR’s accounts, nor had any gone to any of its suppliers. Instead, the carmaker used its existing large cash reserves for its scheme to help suppliers.The ability to access a loan readily, even if not used, may have helped JLR marginally by lowering the risk of it breaching other banking agreements. However, the loan guarantee isunlikely to have helped suppliers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While tier 1 suppliers have generally received cash from JLR’s scheme, the carmaker is reliant on them to keep making payments to the lower tiers.Byrne, a Labour MP in a Birmingham constituency that is home to many JLR workers, also asked for more information on how the government was monitoring whether adequate support was going beyond the first tier, and why the government thought a loan guarantee was the best option to help the supply chain.Stephen Morley, the president of the CBM, said some parts makers had received much-needed cashflow but others further down the chain would start feeling the worst of the squeeze imminently, two months after their last invoices became due.“From 1 September, no matter when you get paid, there’s no sales to invoice,” Morley said.“Depending on your payment terms, come 1 November the majority of invoices would have been due. This is a critical pinch point as there is nothing to invoice.”However, he added that the recovery was going better than expected overall. He said: “JLR has done well so far, but there’s work to do.”Explore more on these topicsJaguar Land RoverAutomotive industryHackingnewsShareReuse this content"

Then came the words I’d waited 12 months to hear’Read moreThe book, offering the fullest explanation of Earps’s decision to quit international football in May, is the first to reveal tensions inside the England women’s squad during an unprecedented three-year period of success including winningtwo European Championshipsandgetting to a World Cup final. Earps is also candid about her struggles with weight, binge-eating and alcohol.Earps played every game of the Euros in England in 2022 and the Women’s World Cup in Australia in 2023, when she was named goalkeeper of the tournament after saving a penalty in the final. She wasnamed 2023 BBC Sports Personality of the Year. Hampton was a member of the squad for those tournaments but was dropped for a period after the 2022 Euros.In an interview with the Guardian to accompany the serialisation, Earps says of Hampton: “I think we had different ideas of what being a teammate should be. I think there was a mismatch, a misalignment, of values.”Asked to elaborate on what the disruptive behaviour was, Earps said: “I don’t want to go into the specifics because it’s not my place … She is a very good goalkeeper and I’ve tried to draw a line under all that. I have messaged her privately to say: ‘Look, no bad blood.’”View image in fullscreenMary Earps (left) and Hannah Hampton during an England training session in July 2022.Photograph: Lynne Cameron/The FA/Getty ImagesThe Guardian revealed in October 2022that Hampton was dropped by Wiegman because of her behaviour and attitude at England camps. Wiegman would not be drawn on the reasons, saying after the Guardian story: “She has to do something personal that I would not like to comment on.”Hampton spoke later about the impact the story had on her and said she felt like quitting football. “It was harder to find that fight in me to prove people wrong, but somehow I managed it,”she told Elle in June. “I had all my friends and my family around me at the time to guide me in the right direction and keep me going. It’s worked out for the best – I’ve got a lot to thank them for.”Hampton returned to the squad in 2023. Earps writes that Wiegman consulted Earps about restoring Hampton. Earps says she told her it “doesn’t make me feel comfortable” but the England coach said “everyone deserves a second chance”.View image in fullscreenMary Earps is settled in Paris: ‘I’m going to play as long as I can, because I bloody love this game.’Photograph: Laura Stevens/The GuardianHampton went on to play some matches and in April 2024 Wiegman told Earps she planned toplay Hampton in a Euros qualifier. “I don’t get it,” Earps says she told Wiegman. “It’s a qualifier match. And bad behaviour is being rewarded.”In April 2025 Wiegman said Hampton was now her first-choice goalkeeper, leading to Earpsdramatically retiring from international footballshortly before this year’s Euros in Switzerland. The Lionessesretained the trophywith Hampton in a starring role.Earps’s autobiography, published next week, covers Earps describing being bullied as a young player, criticism of her weight by coaches, and lows during lockdown which led to “shovelling down biscuits instead of meals” and binge-drinking vodka. Earps says she never came close to trying to take her life but thought of how she might end it “more often than I would have liked”.She also talks about her partner Kitty, who lives with her in Paris while Earps plays for Paris Saint-Germain, and navigating difficulties with her parents, who struggled with Earps’s sexuality. She also reveals she has frozen her eggs in the hope of becoming a mother one day. “I’m 32 now, don’t look a day over 18!

It also flagged wire transfers made by Epstein to Russian banks.JP Morgan’s report said it had flagged about 4,700 transactions, totalling more than $1bn, that were potentially related to reports of human trafficking involving Epstein,the New York Timesreported. The report, filed during the last Trump administration, also flagged sensitivities around Epstein’s “relationships with two U.S. presidents”.Lawsuits against banks with Epstein ties may shed new light on financier’s crimesRead moreThe report was included in a release of previously sealed court records that were made public on Thursday after requests from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. The documents included other SARs that JPMorgan filed in the years before Epstein’s 2019 arrest about large cash withdrawals, the New York Times reported.The 2019 report did not detail the nature of the transactions or why they were suspicious. But it identified transactions with Leon Black, the co-founder of the private equity firm Apollo Global Management who left the company in 2021; the hedge fund manager Glenn Dubin; the lawyer Alan Dershowitz; and trusts controlled by the retail tycoon Leslie Wexner.The report identified $65m of wire transfers from the mid-2000s that appeared to move between multiple banks linked to Wexner’s trusts but it did not provide details about the transactions involving Black, Dubin or Dershowitz.None of the individuals named in the report have been charged with crimes in relation to Epstein.JP Morgan’s 15-year relationship with Epstein, a convicted sex offender, has become a source of major legal and political scrutiny.The unsealed documents were part of a 2023 litigation filed by the US Virgin Islands, where Epstein owned a private island and conducted most of his financial affairs, and on behalf of his victims.JP Morgan settledthe cases without admitting liability.Patricia Wexler, a spokesperson for JPMorgan, said the release of the SARs showed that the bank had alerted regulators about Epstein.She said: “The SARs do confirm what’s been inferred all along: the bank filed SARs about Epstein early on, and specifically when it exited Epstein from the bank in 2013 – and repeatedly between 2013 and 2019, as required.“It does not appear that anyone in the government or law enforcement acted on those SARs for years.”Devon Spurgeon, a spokesperson for Dubin, said the transactions in question were unrelated to Epstein’s crimes, and Dershowitz, who was one of Epstein’s lawyers, said the only funds he received from Epstein were payments for legal services, according to the New York Times.A representative for Black did not want to comment.

She died at the scene from stab wounds after the attack on 22 July 2024.March, 47, of Surrey Quays, south-east London, admitted her murder on the seventh day of his trial after an expert no longer supported his claim of diminished responsibility.Odysseos was among the women whose deaths were included in the Guardian’sKilled women count– a project highlighting the toll and tragedy of femicide in the UK. She was described as a “brilliant mother” who “completely doted” on her daughters.View image in fullscreenAlana Odysseos was pregnant with her third child.Photograph: Family Handout/PAJurors in March’s trial were not told that he had been convicted of murder before. He was 21 when he fatally stabbed 17-year-old Andre Drummond in the neck at a McDonald’s restaurant in Denmark Hill, south London, in January 2000.He was released on a life licence in early 2013, and recalled to jail later that year after he stamped on the stomach of another pregnant girlfriend in July. He was released again in February 2018.March also had convictions for assault and criminal damage in 1995.The court was told Odysseos had known about March’s murder conviction, and safeguarding checks had been made by probation services. But when the defendant said their relationship had ended amicably, no further checks were made.Hours before killing Odysseos, March had argued with her about whether to abort their unborn child, with the victim heard to say: “I don’t want to kill my baby.”On Friday, Mr Justice Murray jailed March for life with a minimum term of 42 years. He rejected calls from Odysseos’s family and the prosecution for a whole-life order but noted that, given his age, March may never be released.March had appeared in court by videolink from Belmarsh prison, having initially refused to come to the Old Bailey.View image in fullscreenKaren Cronin (left) paid tribute to her daughter outside the court.Photograph: Ben Whitley/PAOdysseos’s mother, Karen Cronin, said: “Alana, my beautiful kind and loving daughter, left this earth in the most callous and brutal way imaginable.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You took Alana, you took the baby she was carrying, the child she was excited about. I fear if you are ever released you will kill again.”DI Aytac Necati, who led the investigation, said March had been unhappy with the news that Odysseos was pregnant, leading to an escalation in the controlling and coercive behaviour she endured during their short relationship.Prosecutor Louise Oakley argued for a whole-life order – meaning March would never be released – given the “exceptionally high” level of offending.Previously the court had heard how police were alerted by members of the public in Lynmouth Road who found Odysseos outside her home wearing a nightie and dressing gown and clutching her right side.Bleeding from multiple stab wounds to her body, she pointed at the defendant standing nearby and shouted: “Shaine stabbed me, he stabbed me.

As with similar resolutions in previous years, the text makes no mention of a referendum on self-determination that includes independence as an option, which is the solution long favoured by the pro-independence Polisario Front and its allies, includingAlgeria, Russia and China.Western Sahara is a phosphate-rich stretch of coastal desert the size of Colorado that was under Spanish rule until 1975. It is claimed by Morocco and Polisario Front, which operates from refugee camps in south-western Algeria and claims to represent the Sahrawi people indigenous to the disputed territory.The US, which sponsored the resolution, led 11 countries in voting in favour, while three countries – Russia, China and Pakistan – abstained. Algeria, Polisario’s primary benefactor, opposed the measure.UK swings behind Morocco’s autonomy proposal for Western SaharaRead moreMike Waltz, the US ambassador to the UN, said the vote had been “historic” and would “build on the momentum for a long, long overdue peace in Western Sahara”.Amar Bendjama, the Algerian ambassador to the UN, said that while the resolution was an improvement on previous iterations, it “still has a number of shortcomings”.“It is below, below, I say, of the expectations and the legitimate aspirations of the people of Western Sahara, represented by the Polisario Front,” he said.The resolution says “genuine autonomy under Moroccan sovereignty could constitute a most feasible solution”.The measure also renews the UN peacekeeping mission in Western Sahara for another year, as has been done for more than three decades. Prior extensions, however, have not included a reference to Morocco and its allies’ preferred outcome.The UN resolution calls on all parties involved to “seize this unprecedented opportunity for a lasting peace.” Depending on progress, it asks António Guterres, the secretary general, to review the peacekeeping mission’s mandate within six months.The shift could unsettle a long-stalled process that for decades has eluded resolution, despite a UN peacekeeping mission that was designed to be temporary. Demonstrations have ensued in Sahrawi refugee camps in Algeria this week, where people have vowed not to give up their fight for self-determination.Morocco controls nearly all of Western Sahara, except for a narrow strip known as the “free zone” that lies east of a Moroccan-built sand wall.A 1991 ceasefire was meant to pave the way for a referendum on self-determination, but fighting over voter eligibility prevented it from taking place.Over the years, Morocco has transformed the disputed territory, constructing a deepwater port and a 656-mile (1,055-km) highway. State subsidies keep food and energy prices low, and the population has ballooned as Moroccans settle in cities such as Dakhla and Laayoune.Polisario withdrew from the ceasefire in 2020 after clashes near a road Morocco was paving to Mauritania.The group has since regularly reported military activity, while Morocco has mostly denied open conflict. TheUnited Nationscalls it “low-level hostilities”.In response to the draft resolution, Polisario said that it would not join any process aiming “to ‘legitimise’ Morocco’s illegal military occupation,” saying peace “can never be achieved by rewarding expansionism”.Morocco’s Foreign Ministry did not respond to questions before the vote but its king, Mohammed VI, said afterwards that the move was “opening a new and victorious chapter in the process of enshrining the Moroccan character of the Sahara, which is intended to bring this issue to a definitive close”.The conflict is the driving force in north African diplomacy. Morocco considers support for its autonomy plan as a benchmark for how it gauges its allies.Last October, UN envoy Staffan de Mistura suggested partitioning Western Sahara, a proposal neither side accepted. He urged Morocco to clarify what autonomy would entail and warned a lack of progress might raise questions about the United Nations’ role and “whether there is space and willingness for us to still be useful.”The push to reassess the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara comes as the United States slashes funding for UN programmes and agencies, including peacekeeping.US officials are taking an a la carte approach to funding, picking which operations and agencies they believe align with Trump’s agenda and which no longer serve US interests. They argue that the UN’s budget and agencies are bloated. They pledge to halt new contributions pending a review of every UN agency and programme.Explore more on these topicsWestern SaharaAfricaMoroccoUnited NationsAlgerianewsShareReuse this content"

All four had been strongly rumoured to have been in line for their parts, but only now has their participation been confirmed.Each of the four real-life women played significant roles in the Beatles’ story. Cox met drummer Ringo Starr as a 15-year-old trainee hairdresser in 1962, when the band were still regulars at Liverpool’s Cavern club; they married in 1965 but were divorced 10 years later. Eastman was a photographer who met Paul McCartney in 1967; they married in 1969 and she joined his post-Beatles band Wings and performed regularly with him until her death in 1998. Ono, an artist and musician, met John Lennon in 1966; they were married in 1969 after Lennon divorced his first wife, Cynthia, and they remained together until Lennon’s death in 1980. Boyd, a successful fashion model, met George Harrison in 1964 on the set of the Beatles’ film A Hard Day’s Night; they were married in 1966 and divorced in 1977 after she had become the object of attentions from Harrison’s friend Eric Clapton, who co-wrote the 1970 song Layla about her.Mendes said in a statement: “Maureen, Linda, Yoko and Pattie are four fascinating and unique figures in their own right – and I’m thrilled that we’ve managed to persuade four of the most talented women working in film today to join this amazing adventure.”Currently titled The Beatles – A Four-Film Cinematic Event, Mendes’ projectwas first announced in 2024with the aim of making four separate fiction films, one for each member of the band. In April,the band members’ casting was announced– Paul Mescal as McCartney, Harris Dickinson as Lennon, Barry Keoghan as Starr and Joseph Quinn as Harrison – andin May reports emergedthat award-winning writers Jez Butterworth, Peter Straughan and Jack Thorne had been hired to work on the films.Explore more on these topicsThe Beatles filmsSaoirse RonanLinda McCartneyYoko OnoThe BeatlesnewsShareReuse this content"

The town centre has been annihilated and now resembles a demolition site.Among the crumpled buildings and streets filled with zinc sheets from roofs and other dangerous debris are people traumatised, bewildered, grieving and desperate for help. Families with children who appear to be setting up residence in a bus shelter and others scouring the debris for food are indications of an unfolding humanitarian crisis.Some had come to Black River, the parish capital, from nearby devastated areas hoping to find aid, only to discover a scene of utter devastation.View image in fullscreenA flooded roadside home.Photograph: Ina Sotirova/The GuardianSpeaking through tears, Beverly Stephens, who survived the storm with her son and elderly mother who is unable to walk, asked the Guardian to “tell the world thatJamaicaneeds help”.Having sought refuge in a room that had a reinforced roof, she said, she and her son spent three hours holding a door that the wind seemed intent on ripping off.The death toll from the storm, which hit Jamaica, Cuba, Haiti and the Dominican Republic hardest, is thought to be 50 – 19 in Jamaica and 31 in Haiti – and is expected to rise. Communication networks remain largely down in Jamaica and Cuba and the full scale of the damage could take days to confirm.Map of hurricane’s path over JamaicaAbout 462,000 people were without power in Jamaica, the country’s information minister said on Friday night.The hurricane tied with a 1935 record for the most intense Atlantic storm ever to make landfall when it hit Jamaica on Tuesday, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.One woman in Black River told the Guardian she was on the way to the police station to report a death. Another, choking back tears, said she had lost everything.Annette Royal, who was visiting Black River from the western parish of Westmoreland, said every house in her area was hit.“The country mash up,” she said. “We need food, we need water, we need shelter, we need everything to survive, because if we don’t get all of things we will suffer in Jamaica.”View image in fullscreenA ruined church in Black River.Photograph: Natricia Duncan/The GuardianAston McCatty, a religious education teacher, said it was clear it would take “billions upon billions” to rebuild.Pointing across the road to a demolished parish church, he said: “You are looking at hundreds of years of history, in one day totally destroyed. How do you rebuild all of this? Nobody in Jamaica can say they have ever seen anything like it.”In the nearby tourism community of Treasure Beach, residents were also stunned by the unprecedented power of Melissa, which had swept away an entire beachfront restaurant, leaving no trace of its existence, and dragged tombstones out of their place.Allan Daley, 67, a fisher, said his house lost part of its roof and his boat was severely damaged by a large shipping container smashing into it.“I am 67, I went through hurricanes, including Gilbert [in 1988], and I have never seen anything like this,” he said. “It was the hardest wind I ever felt in my life. The foundation structure in my house is concrete and I could feel it moving.”View image in fullscreenFisher Allan Daley sits on his boat which was crushed by a shipping container.Photograph: Ina Sotirova/The GuardianOwen Clarke, a hotel owner who for a second year in a row faces having to rebuild his properties, after they were also damaged by Hurricane Beryl last summer, called for more support for businesses affected by hurricanes. “It’s really bad. We don’t have electricity, we need material like zinc, board, cement, steel, nails,” he said.Tourists caught up in the storm were also on the beach on Thursday assessing the damage. Sri Sudevi, from Islington in London, and her daughter Rachel Dimond, who had come to Jamaica for a two-week holiday, said they had to flee their accommodation and head to the hills when it became clear the hurricane was going to be a major threat.Describing the people of Treasure Beach as strong, resilient and friendly, Sudevi said she had been having a wonderful holiday before Melissa struck.Dimond, who was stranded in Treasure Beach in 2020 during the Covid-19 crisis, said that during the hurricane she was particularly concerned about not being able to communicate with family in the UK after she lost power and mobile phone and internet services.But she said: “Treasure Beach people look after each other, they keep each other safe, so I knew that I was in safe hands. If I have to be anywhere for a hurricane, I’d be in Treasure Beach.”View image in fullscreenBritish tourists Sri Sudevi, right, and Rachel Dimond.Photograph: Ina Sotirova/The GuardianNear the beach, Candace Dryden, a local chef who was leading a World Food Kitchen operation to provide hot meals and drinking water to residents who had no power or running water, said: “A warm plate of food will remind people that they’re still home.”She said: “We’re just a little bit uncomfortable right now but we still have each other and we’re still here cooking with love.”Theresa Rodriguez-Moodie, the chief executive of the Jamaica Environment Trust, said Melissa’s strength and slow movement were “clear signs of climate change”.“The science shows that while we may not see more storms overall, the ones we do get are becoming stronger, wetter and more destructive. Category 4 and 5 hurricanes are now more frequent in our region,” she said.“For theCaribbean, this means more intense storms like Melissa, longer recovery times and greater social and economic strain. If global emissions aren’t drastically reduced, these kinds of events will become more of the norm.”Leaving St Elizabeth in the late evening, heavy-duty military vehicles stacked with mattresses and other supplies could be seen navigating the difficult roads to bring what people hope will be relief for those caught in Melissa’s aftermath.Explore more on these topicsJamaicaHurricane MelissaCaribbeanAmericasHurricanesnewsShareReuse this content"

Her body was found the next day, and her family want answersDaisy DumasFri 31 Oct 2025 17.33 EDTFirst published on Fri 31 Oct 2025 10.00 EDTShareThe appeal of Lizard Island is its remoteness. TheGreat Barrier Reefisland, 250km from Cairns in Queensland’s tropical north, is known for its impressive snorkelling, with giant clams nestled among the coral. It also has a scientific research station.Tourists are mostly kept at bay by its inaccessibility and eye-wateringly high accommodation prices.But a week ago, on the west of the island, Suzanne Rees, a healthy and active 80-year-old, died alone. She had possibly just watched her luxury cruise ship, the Coral Adventurer, sail away without her.The keen gardener and bushwalker from Sydney had intended to hike to the island’s historical summit, Cook’s Look, with other passengers on the second day of their 60-day circumnavigation of Australia. But on Saturday, feeling the heat, she turned around early. She never made it off the island and back to the ship.Authorities were not alerted until five hours after the Coral Adventurer left Lizard Island at 3.40pm local time. The next day, Sunday,Rees was found deadclose to the walking trail.How she died, and why her absence from the ship was not immediately flagged, are the questions being asked by her grieving family, other cruise passengers, industry experts and authorities.Coral Adventurer route map‘Then the ship left’Rees and her fellow passengers boarded Coral Expeditions’ 120-guest Coral Adventurer in Cairns on Friday 24 October. Balcony rooms on the cruise were priced at $86,400 per person, according to Clean Cruising, with a 46-member crew on board the 94.5-metre purpose-built vessel.VesselFinder satellite tracking data shows the ship left Cairns at about 5.30pm, arriving at Lizard Island at 8.30am on Saturday.Rees was among a group of passengers who headed to the island to hike but, according to her daughter Katherine Rees, she had cut her walk short.Grieving daughter of cruise ship passenger left behind on remote Australian island says ‘there was a failure of care’Read more“We understand from the police that it was a very hot day, and Mum felt ill on the hill climb. She was asked to head down, unescorted,”Katherine Rees said on Thursday.“Then the ship left, apparently without doing a passenger count. At some stage in that sequence, or shortly after, Mum died, alone.”The Bureau of Meteorology’s closest weather station, about 30km away, recorded a high temperature of 31.9C that day.View image in fullscreenSuzanne Rees, 80, who died on Lizard Island.A sailor on a nearby boat, Traci Ayris, told News Corp Australia she heard headcounts for snorkellers and that the ship had left soon after the presumed last hikers had returned from the island.VesselFinder shows the Coral Adventurer left Lizard Island at 3.40pm, tracking north-westerly.When Rees didn’t show up for dinner at about 6pm, the alarm was raised on board. Several bow-to-stern searches were conducted, with Rees initially believed to have gone overboard.The Coral Adventurer made a sudden about-turn at 8.43pm on Saturday. At that time, it was about 114km from Lizard Island off Cape Melville. The cruise ship sailed south, retracing its path.At 9pm, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (Amsa) was notified by the ship’s master that Rees was missing.Queenslandpolice were alerted later that night.The Coral Expeditions chief executive, Mark Fifield, said in a statement this week that “a search and rescue operation was launched on land and sea”.By midnight, a helicopter search for Rees was under way on Lizard Island, according to Rob Siganto, the owner of the South Pacific II fishing and charter boat.He told Australia’s national broadcaster, the ABC, that he was moored nearby and, listening on the radio, heard the helicopter crew discussing Rees’ last known location, “halfway” up the scrub-covered hill.TimelineCoral Adventurer timelineShowTimes are in local Queensland time.24 October 20255.30pmCoral Adventurer departs Cairns.25 October 20258:30amCoral Adventurer arrives on the western side of Lizard Island.25 October 20253:40pmCoral Adventurer leaves Lizard Island, tracking north-westerly towards Cape Melville.25 October 20258:43pmBetween Barrow Reef and Unison Reef off Cape Melville national park, the ship makes a sudden about turn and begins heading south.26 October 20253:25amCoral Adventurer arrives back at Lizard Island.26 October 20256:55pmCoral Adventurer leaves Lizard Island for the second time, again heading towards Cape York.27 October 202512:15amCoral Adventurer passes the point at which it previously turned around.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The Coral Adventurer’s tracking data shows it had returned to Lizard Island by 3.25am on Sunday. A team on a smaller boat had reportedly been sent ahead to look for Rees, but the search was eventually called off until daybreak.Shortly after the aerial search resumed on Sunday morning, Ayris said, Rees’ body was found at about 9.30am. The Coral Adventurer left Lizard Island for a second time at 6.55pm.‘It seems there was a failure of care’Katherine Rees said her family was “shocked and saddened that the Coral Adventurer left Lizard Island after an organised excursion without my mum, Suzanne”.“From the little we have been told, it seems that there was a failure of care and common sense.”The Coral Expeditions chief executive said on Thursday that exactly what happened was yet to be established.“We have expressed our heartfelt condolences to the Rees family and remain deeply sorry that this has occurred,” Fifield said in a statement.“The circumstances of her tragic death are the subject of official investigations. We are fully cooperating with those investigations to determine the facts. For this reason, it would be inappropriate to comment further on the investigations while they are under way.“We continue to provide our full support to the Rees family through this difficult time.”The police are preparing a report for a coronial inquiry, which Katherine Rees hopes “will find out what the company should have done that might have saved Mum’s life”. Amsa and WorkSafe Queensland are also investigating.On Friday, the Coral Adventurer was close to Prince of Wales Island in the Torres Strait. Amsa said it intended to board the ship when it arrived in Darwin. Part of the investigation would focus on why Rees may not have been accounted for during boarding, a spokesperson said.‘Count the people’David Beirman, an adjunct fellow in management and tourism at the University of Technology Sydney, said any failure to account for all passengers was “very unusual”.“One of the standard things they always do when there is a shore excursion, of any sort, is they count the people who are leaving and they count the people who are coming back. It’s basic common sense,” he said.“For whatever reason, it appears they didn’t do it as effectively as they might have done on this occasion.”Former Coral Expeditions passengers have expressed surprise that a passenger could seemingly be unaccounted for.“We have cruised the Kimberley coast on this small ship,” one wrote on Facebook.“We had our names checked off a list when boarding the tender boat and checked off again when boarding the ship. It is beyond belief that the captain and crew would leave without everybody on board.”Another Facebook user said she had travelled with Coral Expeditions in May and there were “so many checks” – including a number assigned to each passenger that was ticked off upon returning to the vessel.“Many of [us] also watched for older solo travellers, making sure they weren’t alone,” the traveller wrote.Map showing location of Lizard Island in relation to Queensland coast and CairnsDespite the protocols, Beirman said there were “plenty” of cases of passengers being left behind. Notable examples include the case ofeight passengers who scrambled to meet their shipafter being left behind in São Tomé and Príncipe last year.But the Great Barrier Reef, in particular, has a history of maritime misadventure.In 1998, Tom and Eileen Lonergandied after their tour boat leftwhile they were scuba diving on the Great Barrier Reef. Officials believe they drowned or were eaten by sharks.In 2008, a British holidaymaker and his American girlfriend, who survived for 19 hours in shark-infested waters off the reef, told how arescue helicopter failed to spot themwaving frantically for help.In 2011, officials investigated a dive boat company that accidentallyleft behind a US touristsnorkelling at the reef.Explore more on these topicsQueenslandCruisesTourism (Australia)Great Barrier ReefnewsShareReuse this content"

It has been at London’s expense. There is no question about that.”In his time as Morgan Stanley’s top executive in London, Rooney led the US investment bank’srelocation of hundreds of bankers and billions of poundsof assets to Frankfurt to sidestep Britain’s shock EU departure. More than440 other City companies followed suit, moving almost £1tn between them – roughly 10% of the entire UK banking system – to financial hubs across the EU.“I have friends and family who moved to Barcelona, Madrid and Paris. And these cities are all booming.”Before next month’s budget, the economics of Brexit are high on the political agenda. Rolling the pitch for big tax rises and spending cuts, Rachel Reeves hasblamed the 2016 leave votefor Britain’s recent growth weakness and an expected downgrade in the public finances.The chancellor is understood to have been handed a dramaticallyweaker productivity forecastsfrom the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), partly caused by Brexit, contributing to a shortfall of up to £40bn against her “iron-clad” fiscal rules.Last week Reeves revealed that the Treasury watchdog would be “pretty frank” that growth since the 2016 leave vote had beenworse than anticipated. After years of Labour downplaying the B-word, it was a marked shift, drawing it into the framing of her tax and spending plans.Productivity growth has disappointed across the western world since the 2008 financial crisis. But the UK has notched a significantly worse performance than many of its peers on this metric of output for each hour of work – which is a vital driver of economic growth, wages and living standards.graphFor years the OBR has overestimated that growth could return closer to the 2.2% annual average recorded before the crash. In the spring it predicted annual productivity growth of about 1.25% by 2029-30, significantly above the estimates of other forecasters, including the Bank of England.However, productivity isnow falling. Since 2019, it has grown by just 1.5%, highlighting the deep impact of the Covid pandemic. While there are hopes for an artificial intelligence-powered turnaround, past performance is far from encouraging.View image in fullscreenRob Rooney sees London’s future as a financial hub is vital.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianTaking all this into account, the OBR isexpected to cut its forecastfor trend productivity growth to about 0.9% instead. That might not sound like a big change, but this tiny spreadsheet tweak has a hefty price tag: adding roughly £21bn to government borrowing by the end of the decade.Explaining this is a tough job. Productivity is tricky to forecast, in a task made significantly harder byunreliable jobs market data, while there are myriad reasons for Britain’s underperformance. Many economists label the sustained slowdown a “productivity puzzle” that defies easy explanation.However, experts say it is increasingly clear that Brexit has played a significant role, exacerbating the post-2008 slump by hitting sectors with EU ties, and as the political turmoil led businesses to put investments on ice.Erecting tougher trade barriers with the UK’s largest partner is expected to cut Britain’s long-term productivity by about 4% relative to a remain scenario. The OBR could update this estimate at the 26 November budget.graphSince the end of the EU transition period at the end of 2020, UK exports havefallen significantly behind the G7 average. Cars, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and food have all slumped in relative terms. But while services exports have outperformed, the finance sector has been hit as City firms lost easy access to EU clients.The UK has beenlosing market share since 2016to the Netherlands, Ireland, Spain and Italy. Governmentanalysisshows Britain’s share of the global pie has slumped to 15%, down from 21% in 2010.“You would have expected the UK – given the size of its finance sector – to have done at least as well, if not better, than other countries,” says John Springford, an associate fellow at the Centre for European Reform.“But financial services output has been pretty weak since 2016. And there hasn’t been a great deal of investment in the sector either.”City banks oncedrove UK productivity growth, with Britain recording the second-highest rate in the G7 pre-2008. In level terms it remains well above average. But since then, the rate of growth has collapsed into reverse – as one of the biggestsectors dragging down the UK’s overall performance.The story is similar for the beating heart of finance: London. Despite levels of productivity well above the UK average, contributing to Britain’s position as one of the west’s most regionally unequal nations, the capital’s ability to drive its productivity higher has collapsed.graphThat might be hard to square with the gleaming towers, multimillion-pound mansions and bonus-wielding bankers. But the City has still suffered relative to other EU financial hubs.“Walk around Canary Wharf and the City and you think: ‘Wow, this looks great, who said Brexit was going to bad?’ It is great. But arguably, it would have been even better without Brexit,” says William Wright, managing director of the New Financial thinktank.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It also expanded its business in Dublin, Amsterdam, Madrid, Milan and Paris.“This is true of all banks. You saw the Milan office, the Madrid office, Frankfurt office, the Paris office, the Nordic offices all grow,” he says.Barclaysmoved more than £100bn of assets to Dublin, turning the centuries-old London firm into Ireland’s third-largest bank overnight.Bank of America,HSBC, andCitishifted operations to Paris, whileGoldman SachsandJP Morganmoved staff to Frankfurt.Doing so has made financial services less efficient, as the fragmentation led companies to duplicate roles, alongside the extra red tape of dealing with post-Brexit rules and multiple regulators.View image in fullscreenFor Rachel Reeves, improving the UK’s weak productivity would increase the tax take.Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PAFor Reeves, turning around the UK’s weak productivity performance has clear attractions, not least because it would increase the tax take. There would be benefits for workers, too: bumper productivity growth up to 2007 helped real wages togrow by 33% per decade on average. Since 2008, they have flatlined.Facing the OBR’s productivity downgrade, the chancellor is expected to tell the watchdog that Labour’s policies can turn the tide. This will include flagging positive contributions from planning reforms, cutting business red tape, and trade agreements.However, by blaming Brexit, Labour could run into trouble amid its refusal to entertain rejoining the EU single market or customs union.“The problem is given the UK’s red lines this [blaming Brexit] can’t go much further,” says Anand Menon, the director of the UK in a Changing Europe thinktank. “The danger is, by talking about an issue, that you’re increasing its salience without having any sort of plan of how to deal with it.”Still, the chancellor is defiant. She told the Guardian in October that Labour’s readiness to build closer EU ties would boost productivity growth. “I think that we can defy the past and that we can do better.”Rebooting the City is part of her plan. Outside the EU, some experts say this strategy is also easier to pursue. Financial services has been included in the government’s industrial strategy. Reeves is reducing City red tape, while her “Leeds reforms” are designed to boost competitiveness.It does, however, create tensions for Labour. The party was burned by its close association with the 2008 crash, cosying up to bankers is anathema to many on the left of politics, and Reeves has been urged to tax the banks to tackle her budget shortfall.Many economists issue a warning that the City’s pre-crisis productivity growth was built on unsustainable profits made via excessive risk-taking. Others warn that Britain has a “finance curse” from hosting a global industry that crowds out other sectors and stokes inequality.For Rooney, however, London’s future as a financial hub is vital.Since leaving Morgan Stanley three years ago, the American has taken over as the chief executive of Hyperlayer, a UK-based financial technology firm that works with big banks to provide personalised consumer accounts, rewards products and payments.In October it raised £30m in a funding round, valuing the firm at about £150m, highlighting how Britain is attracting a new breed of finance startup. The challenge, however, will be ensuring that Hyperlayer does not followother UK startupsby ultimately relocating to the much-bigger US market.“You’ve got some terrific innovation here in the UK,” says Rooney. “But I think the question is, could there be more? Could it be faster? And I think that’s really what the chancellor has got to be trying to figure out.”Explore more on these topicsProductivityEconomicsBankingBrexitFinancial sectorTax and spendingRachel ReevesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Oxford Road has changed a lot since October 1945. While its grand buildings remain, the wartime bombsites and smog are long gone. Much of Chorlton-on-Medlock, the residential area it bisected has been lost to postwar clearances and replaced by university complexes.But to the young people gathered in the foyer of the Contact Theatre, the events of 80 years ago were full of relevance. The dance show they came to see –See My World: Homage, staged by the choreographers Joe Price and Kieron Simms a fortnight ago – was just one of an unprecedented number of events to celebrate the anniversary of the fifth Pan-African Congress, which took place less than a mile away at the former town hall.The congress was a seismic moment for Black countries during their fight for independence from colonial rule and helped to shape the destiny of millions. But for years the event was an under-recognised chapter in Manchester’s radical history, spurring the late community leader Kath Locke, among others, to campaign for a commemorative plaque outside the building in the 1980s.View image in fullscreenCharles Lauder (left) speaks to Tunde Adekoya at an 80th anniversary event.Photograph: Albert/AKMVisualsNow, against a backdrop of increasing unity between African-Caribbean countries,resurgent anti-Black sentimentand increased awareness of thedebt Manchester owes to slavery and colonialism, the congress’s message of Black unity as well as political and economic liberation is experiencing a resurgence.Tunde Adekoya, the artistic director and chief executive of the See My World festival – which celebrates Manchester’s pan-Africanist legacy – has been central to the 80th anniversary celebrations, organising a series of seminars, exhibitions and performances.Adekoya’s introduction to the congress came 10 years ago and it has inspired his work ever since. “It was a struggle that resonated with mine, and I decided had to look at ways to continue to develop our communities in the same way (as the congress), creating a festival that would allow people to have these conversations, to look at what betterment would [look] like through events and storytelling, reclaiming narratives and looking at how we develop the next generation of leaders,” he said.View image in fullscreenPeople break for refreshments during the congress at Chorlton-upon-Medlock town hall in October 1945.Photograph: John Deakin/Getty ImagesWhile the legacy of the event continues to resonate within Manchester’s arts and activist communities, African and Caribbean politicians are taking steps to fulfil the dreams of the original delegates.In September, the African Unionrevealed it was joining forceswith Caribbean countries to seek reparations from European colonial powers. The announcement, at the second Caricom-Africa summit in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, came as the regionsstrengthened their commitment to cooperateon global financial reform, climate action, education, health, trade and cultural exchange.The Caricom secretary general, Dr Carla Barnett, said the summit was “guided by the pan-African ideals set out by iconic minds from the Caribbean and from Africa, with Marcus Garvey, Patrice Lumumba, George Padmore, Jomo Kenyatta and Kwame Nkrumah among them”.The Jamaican activistAmy Ashwood Garvey, the former wife of the pan-Africanist Marcus Garvey, was a delegate at the 1945 event – which was chaired the African American intellectualWilliam Edward Burghardt Du Bois– alongside Nkrumah,Kenyatta, the Trinidadian journalist Padmore, Dr Hastings Banda, Jaja Wachuku and Obafemi Awolowo.View image in fullscreenA man attends the fifth Pan-African Congress in Manchester.

Many delegates would return to Africa newly inspired as part of a network of pan-Africanists.“The hall itself was grand, with handmade posters … calling for oppressed people of the world to unite; ‘freedom for all subject people’ was another demand. Karl Marx was quoted – ‘Labour in the white skin can never free itself as long as labour in the black skin is branded’ – and there was a call for ‘Arab and Jews to unite against British imperialism’.“For Manchester’s Black delegates and observers to the congress, we know it was a hugely important event too, with attenders like Len Johnson continuing to organise against racism for decades after.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She was keen tohighlight crucial messagesfrom the pan-Africanism of 1945 for an audience in 2025.“A lot of [the delegates’ concerns] around being anti-racist and thinking about freedom of the press, thinking about all the rights of women – all of those things are really relevant to where we’re at today,” she said in an interview for a bonus episode ofthe Guardian’s Cotton Capital podcast.“Today, when we think [about our] activism, a lot of it is happening online. So there’s something specific and … special about what happens when a group of people meet and they say: ‘We are going to sit together and plan change.’”View image in fullscreenDr Peter Milliard, the president of the Pan-African Federation, addresses the audience at the congress.Photograph: John Deakin/Getty ImagesFrom debates to concerts and exhibitions to literary readings, several institutions in Greater Manchester – including MMU, the Ahmed Iqbal Ullah Race Centre, the Caribbean and African Health Network and the flagship arts venue Factory International – have staged events centred on the Black diaspora that have climaxed in the anniversary month of October, which is also Black History Month in the UK. In Moss Side and Hulme, historical centres of postwar Black life in Manchester,the political festival The World Transformedbrought pan-African activists together, adding to the city’s rich legacy of Black activism.The historian Hirsch added: “Manchester during the second world war had this thriving Black community that had settled herebefore the [Empire] Windrushship and a later generation joined them.“Within this community was a very active pan-Africanist network. In fact, the British state had pinpointed Manchester as the centre of the pan-Africanists during the war. The Negro Association in Manchester was a key network, established in 1943 byDr Peter Milliard,that provided the basis for the Manchester branch of the Pan-African Federation.“It actively encouraged solidarity with anticolonial struggles, for example: raising money in support of the Nigerian general strike in 1945. On the Negro Association membership lists – on show at the People’s History Museum – there are very famous names like Jomo Kenyatta, future president of Kenya, who lived and worked in Manchester for a short time, but there are also many local Black Mancunian members that we still know very little about.View image in fullscreenSee My World events unite creatives and activists to celebrate pan-Africanism and its legacy.Photograph: Daniel Oyegade/wxvei“The central pan-Africanist in Manchester wasT Ras Makonnen, who was the real force behind the congress taking place in Manchester. Makonnen set up a whole range of restaurants, bookshops and even a tea shop around the Oxford Road that were able to attract a huge audience because they did not operate a colour bar and welcomed Black GIs and other racialised communities.“From these ventures, Makonnen was able to finance the congress. His links with the local Labour party, [which] had political control of the city, meant they could secure the large Chorlton-on-Medlock town hall (now an MMU building) as the venue for the congress.“It is hard, from these media reports, to get a sense of the exhilaration and sense of freedom that Black people must have felt meeting and organising in Manchester. Walking into the town hall for the congress, with the flags of Black nations on display, there must have been a feeling of pride anddetermination to continue the struggle.”This pride and determination is still felt today. Edna, who came out on a chilly October night to see Homage at the Contact Theatre, said: “I was born in Portugal but my origins are from São Tomé and Príncipe. Believing in pan-Africanism means believing in yourself, claiming who you are and always fighting for what matters.”Explore more on these topicsColonialismCotton Capital: ongoing seriesBlack History MonthRaceReparations and reparative justiceManchesterGreater ManchesterBlack British culturefeaturesShareReuse this content"

At this age, they’re increasingly inquisitive about the world and changing all the time. From “real world play”, such as pretend food sets, to a shape-sorter that’s bound to delight little ones, there are so many lovely options to appeal to this age group.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.If you’re looking for a toy to help with education and development, look for one that encourages problem-solving, hand-eye coordination or understanding cause and effect, as these are skills they are developing. As one-year-olds are often starting to walk and talk, you may also look for wooden walkers and books to spark their imaginations and help them get to grips with language.Having had a baby last year, I’ve learned how much space a tiny human’s things can take up, so it’s often worth choosing gifts that are compact or easy to tidy away.How I selectedI’ve included toys that one-year-oldsandtheir parents will appreciate, focusing on things that will help little ones develop key skills, as well as encourage interaction and social play. I’ve excluded anything too unpleasantly noisy – parents, you can thank me later. I’ve put the products on this list through their paces with my daughter, along with some of her friends.The best toys and gifts for one-year-oldsWalker this wayView image in fullscreenMulti-activity baby walker£69.95 at Scandiborn£69.95 at Millie and RalphMy daughter’s eyes lit up when I presented her with this wooden walker. She’s obsessed with pulling herself up on our sofa, and enjoyed practising on this. As it’s on wheels and she’s not yet walking, I hold it still for her, though you can also use the brake setting to keep it steady. There are all sorts to play with on the front and sides, including a spinning mirror, lots of blocks, cogs and beads to move around, and a simple shape sorter. If you’re giving this as a gift, you may give the parents a heads-up that it needs assembling, though I found it straightforward.Materials:woodSuitable for:1+ yearsFun figuresView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Isabelle Aron/The GuardianPop-up wooden toy£11 at Early Learning Centre£9.35 at AmazonI bought one of these for my niece years ago, and it has stood the test of time. The compact wooden shape has four little figures that jump out when you press down on them, while the wooden pegs are ideal for little hands to grab – good for hand-eye coordination and colour matching.Materials:woodSuitable for:1+ yearsCute fitView image in fullscreenSoft denim dungarees£35 at Mori£35 at NextThese incredibly sweet denim dungarees from Mori are stylish and functional. Made from a mix of 88.5% organic cotton, 10% polyester and 1.5% elastane, they’re soft and comfy with some room to stretch. With poppers on the legs in all sizes up to the age of two (trust me, the parents will be grateful for this), they’re also designed for easy nappy and outfit changes. Clothes for little ones are often gendered, but these are unisex, making them an ideal gift that can also be passed on when they grow out of them.Materials:organic cotton, polyester and elastaneSuitable for:from three months to four yearsClassic talesView image in fullscreenThe Gingerbread Man book£7.19 at the Guardian Bookshop£5.99 at AmazonMaybe it’s the singsong rhythm of the words, or the push-and-pull sliders on each page, but I always enjoy reading this book to my daughter. There are loads of others in the First Stories series too, includingLittle Red Riding HoodandThe Three Little Pigs.Board books have lots of benefits for little ones, says Emily Goodacre, research associate at Play in Education, Development and Learning (Pedal) at the University of Cambridge. “They have longevity. It’s going to be something that babies can look at by themselves, as they can pick them up and turn the pages, but they can also look at it with a parent,” she says. “With fewer words, you can focus more on the pictures and ad lib, which can be good for the child’s language development.” Unlike paper books, which can get easily torn or damaged by toddlers, board books are more hard-wearing, too.Materials:boardSuitable for:1+ (or younger for reading aloud)All aboardView image in fullscreenWooden stacking train£20 at Early Learning Centre£20 at the EntertainerWith bright colours, animal faces, and blocks that can be stacked on and off the moving train, there are lots of ways your little one can play with this. My daughter was excited about this toy before I’d even taken it out of the box, which is always a good sign. She loves playing with the blocks and watching me pull the train around for her.Materials:woodSuitable for:1+ yearsWord playView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Isabelle Aron/The GuardianLearning Friends 100 Words book£13.99 at John Lewis£13.99 at AmazonThis interactive electronic book is packed with 100 words to help children develop their language skills in an engaging way. Each page is focused on a different category, including pets, food and vehicles. There are three different settings to choose from – you press the pictures to hear the word, a sound relating to the word or a fun fact about the word. My daughter loves to press the yellow star button and listen to all the different sounds the book makes. If you’ve got a bilingual child, or you just want to start them learning languages early, there’s also the option to switch between English and French. It’s handy for taking on the go, too, and a great distraction on long journeys.Materials:plasticSuitable for:1+ yearsRound and roundView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Isabelle Aron/The GuardianBead maze£10 at Early Learning Centre£15 at M&SIn my experience, a bead maze is a hit with every baby at soft play, and my daughter was delighted when I produced one at home, where no one was about to grab it from her. Made from sustainably sourced wood, kids will love moving the different coloured shapes around as they develop their fine motor skills, hand-eye coordination, and get to grips with colours and shapes. It’s relatively small, so won’t take up loads of room and could easily be taken on trips.Materials:woodSuitable for:1+ yearsWheely goodView image in fullscreenPush & Go scooter£124.95 at Soren’s House£124.99 at ScandibornThis neat scooter is designed to adapt to a child’s needs as they grow. A two-in-one, it can be used as a seated ride-on toy or as a stand-up scooter. There’s also a parent push bar to save your back, which can be used whether it’s in the seated or standing position. The adjustable seat and handlebar, as well as removable footrests, mean you can change things around as your child gets bigger, so they’ll get plenty of use out of it.Materials:plastic and metalSuitable for:1-5 yearsReading materialView image in fullscreenWho’s Hiding In The Park?book£7.19 at the Guardian Bookshop£7.35 at AmazonWith charming illustrations by Axel Scheffler (who also illustratedThe Gruffalo) and different coloured felt flaps – sturdier than paper ones that are often ripped out – both kids and grownups will enjoy reading this sweet book.It’s a huge hit with my daughter, and she often reaches for it when we’re choosing a story.There are others in the series, too, includingWho’s Hiding On The Farm?andWho’s Hiding On Safari?As well as being sturdier, “felt is more tactile,” says Larissa Hazell, a nanny with 14 years’ experience and founder ofThe Childcare Guide. “They can manipulate it, squash it and push it between their fingers. With those sorts of books, they’re not just about looking at the pictures and reading a story – there’s a sensory element, too.”Materials:boardSuitable for:1-3 yearsFrame gameView image in fullscreenFour-in-oneclimbing frame£109 at GoodevasThis Montessori wooden indoor climbing frame set includes a climbing arch, which can also be flipped upside down and used as a rocking seat, and a Pikler triangle (named after the Hungarian paediatrician Dr Emmi Pikler, who designed it to encourage physical development).There’s also a slide board that can be used either to connect the two climbing bits or as a slide, as well as a cushion that fits the climbing arch when used as a seat. As far as toys go, it takes up quite a bit of room, but if you or your recipient has the space, it’s the perfect option for little ones to clamber all over as they get increasingly mobile. My daughter has a great time pulling herself up on to the two climbing frame parts and crawling through the Pikler triangle. It comes as a flat pack and – while the assembly process isn’t too complicated – that does take a little time.Materials:woodSuitable for:1-3 yearsThrow shapesView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Isabelle Aron/The GuardianShape-sorting box£29.71 at the Kid Collective£29.75 at ScandibornMy daughter loves to put all of the shapes from this toy in her mouth, which is a sure-fire sign of approval. It keeps her engaged for a good while, too. “A well-designed shape-sorter, where the child can get them back out again and re-sort them, will help them learn what fits together and what doesn’t,” says Pedal’s Goodacre.My baby isn’t yet at the stage where she can do shape-sorting herself, but it’s a great toy to play with together. “A shape-sorter is the sort of toy that a parent would be more likely to get involved with,” says Goodacre. “You can do problem-solving together, for example, saying: ‘Can you see where that goes? Shall we try it on this one? Oh, it doesn’t fit there, let’s try another one.’”Materials:plasticSuitable for:10 months+Perfect plushiesView image in fullscreenBashful bunny toy, small£18 at Jellycat£18 at MoriThis classic Jellycat bunny is soft and comes in different sizes – the small one is great for babies to play with both at home and when out and about. My daughter was given one as a gift and has become attached to it, and her friends love playing with it too. As a bonus, it comes in useful for distractions during nappy changes when your child doesn’t want to cooperate. You can also get the bashful bunny inrattleandcomforterform, and there’s the option to have gifts personalised.Materials:polyesterSuitable for:from birthMake a splashView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Isabelle Aron/The GuardianUpcycled boat bath toy£24.95 at Babipur£24.98 at Little Concepts“Bathtime with toys is brilliant,” says The Childcare Guide’s Hazell. “It’s a time when parents aren’t distracted, so the child has their undivided attention. Most children love being in the water and playing, so it’s also a lovely bonding time.” Featuring three different parts which stack to make a boat, this toy from Oli & Carol is perfect for making bath-time fun. My daughter was excited when I presented this – she loves the bright colours, getting the boat to float and watching me pour water out of the different shapes. Made from natural rubber from hevea trees and upcycled cherry seeds, it has great eco-credentials, too.Materials:natural rubberSuitable for:from birthskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

Each block has a letter on one side and a picture of something beginning with that letter on the other, as well as numbers one to 10 at the bottom. Right now, my daughter loves spinning the blocks, and I’ve been talking her through what’s on them; it’ll be a great educational tool for helping her to learn the alphabet and new words as she gets older. It’s also compact and easy to tidy away.Materials:woodSuitable for:from 18 monthsAll-weather adventuresView image in fullscreenWaterproof scampsuit£95 at Muddy Puddles£95 at John LewisWhile a puddle suit might not be quite as exciting as a shiny new toy for a one-year-old to unwrap, they’ll be thrilled when they can roam about outside in all weathers. Hazell advises looking for one that is fully waterproof rather than showerproof: “Showerproof ones are cheaper but they’re not actually waterproof, so as soon as a child sits down in the puddle, which they love to do, they’re wet through,” she says.This three-in-one waterproof scampsuit from Muddy Puddles fits the bill, with a 10,000mm waterproof rating that promises to keep kids dry in heavy rain. It’s versatile, too, with two layers including a waterproof suit and an inner fleece onesie. Each layer can be worn on its own or together, and the adjustable stirrups will keep the suit in place.While they aren’t the cheapest, the Muddy Puddles suits have been recommended to me by various mum friends, who say they hold up well.

Marmalade sandwiches not included.Materials:polyesterSuitable for:from birthWhat you need to knowWhat to buy for a one-year-old“For me, there are two key things when it comes to gift-buying for this age. Firstly, looking for toys that are open-ended, can be used in multiple ways and for a long time,” says Hazell, from The Childcare Guide. “Secondly, a toy that will encourage conversation between parents and their child, and spark their imagination.”When choosing a gift for one-year-olds, Hazell suggests looking for “toys that are repetitive with a clear consequence”, colour- and shape-matching toys, as well as things that “encourage creativity, imagination, story telling or building”. Anything that inspires “real-world play”, such as people, animals and vehicles is also a good idea.How often should I rotate toys for a one-year-old?Don’t feel you have to rotate toys on a set schedule, says Pedal’s Goodacre. “It depends on the child and how intensively and how long they’re showing interest in something,” she says. “If they’ve really latched on to a toy, I’d let them play with it for as long as they’re getting something out of it. At this age, if they’re showing active interest in something, then they’re learning from it. Letting them see that through will be beneficial.”On the flip side, if you put a toy out and your child shows no interest, it may be worth putting it away for a few weeks and then trying again.Isabelle Aron is a lifestyle and culture journalist.

She talks about the genre’s toxic fans, welcoming new boy Liam Hemsworth to the cast – and what sorcery really sounds likeFri 31 Oct 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 31 Oct 2025 10.19 EDTShareIt is a bittersweet day for Anya Chalotra. On the one hand, The Witcher, the fantasy epic in which she has played super-sorcerer Yennefer of Vengerberg since 2018, is about to return for a fourth series. All the hard work she and hundreds of others have done can finally be seen by millions of fans worldwide. The cast and crew wrap party is due to take place a few hours after we speak. It’s an exciting time for the actor. But on the other hand: “I wrapped The Witcher for good yesterday,” Chalotra says. “So forgive me if I can’t string a sentence together. It’s all very odd … I cried a lot.”Refreshingly for a big-budget fantasy show, The Witcher will bow out with its story complete, rather than at some dissatisfying midpoint due to an unceremonious cancellation. And though viewers will be seeing a final season of monsters, magic, mages, swords, skulduggery and swearing next year, the final two seasons were filmed back to back, meaning after the evening’s shindig, that’s that. The job that has taken over Chalotra’s life for so long, and the people who go with it (besides one high-profile absence, which we’ll touch on later), is finally over.The Witcher: Blood Origin review – this profanity-packed fantasy is a riotRead more“I was 23 when I started,” Chalotra, now 30, says. “It’s been a long time. I think the most emotional I got was when I was sat there yesterday watching everyone work. Just in my chair, drinking a cup of tea. You know these people … everyone worksso hardon the show. Eight months of a year for seven years. I’m going to miss everyone’s faces.”It has been a long journey, for the actor and the character. The Witcher began as a series of short stories and novels by Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski about monster hunter for hire Geralt of Rivia, which then became a hugely successful video game franchise before Netflix brought Sapkowski’s world to TV. Chalotra’s character begins the tale as a 14-year-old peasant girl, abused by her parents because of her physical deformities, who eventually becomes the ass-kicking mage, military leader and love of Geralt’s life we know today. When Chalotra was cast, she thought it important to do her research, playing the games and getting stuck into the books, of which she remains a fan: “When I was going back to the books this season, there’s someremarkablelines. Someincrediblequotes. It’s so grounded for a fantasy.” She carried that groundedness over to the way she played Yennefer, making burning thousands of soldiers to a smouldering crisp with apocalyptic flame spells or the quiet grief of learning she was unable to have children equally plausible. It’s a fine balance, not easy to strike.Chalotra was born in Wolverhampton, her father from India and her mother from the Midlands (the mention of which elicits a hoot of “Midlands! Yaaaaay!”). “I was a middle child,” she laughs, considering why she thinks she became an actor. “I don’t need to say any more!” But she pinpoints her mixed heritage as a huge element of her desire to perform: “I watched a lot of Bollywood as a kid. I loved musicals, film, watching very different experiences of people on stage, on screen. Because I only had my own experience, coming from quite a strict upbringing. So I was so curious about other people’s lives. Wanting to find out more about why someone is the way they are, their culture. I was very heavily influenced bymyculture. And I think I was just interested in how people were created.”My first season, there was a lot of fan negativity … I learned that it can be quite intenseA desire to use acting to find out what made her and the people around her tick led Chalotra to the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, and then to the Guildhall School of Music & Drama. “There was nothing else that came into my head that I wanted to do,” she says. “I didn’t think it was possible until about 17 years old when I got in and I realised that my family were going to support me. And going to London from Wolverhampton. That was a huge shift.”That commitment paid off quickly. Not long after graduating, she was nominated for a Stage Debut award in a Globe production of Much Ado About Nothing in 2017, and then in 2018 starred with Toni Collette in the BBC’s Wanderlust, and John Malkovich and Shirley Henderson in Agatha Christie adaptation The ABC Murders. “Shirley Henderson, Toni Collette, John Malkovich,” she lists. “That’s it – I’m happy. I was so curious, I almost didn’t want to do any work. They’redoingit in front of you. You’re so close. I just wanted to watch them.”View image in fullscreenUnder the spell … Anya Chalotra.Photograph: Rachell SmithIt was shortly afterwards that Chalotra was cast in The Witcher, and everything changed. It was her first taste of the intensity of geek culture, for better and for worse. The third Witcher game, considered one of the greatest of all time, has sold in excess of 60m copies worldwide; the books more than 15m by the time Chalotra took the role. Season one of the show in 2019 broke Netflix’s records as its most-watched debut series ever up to that point. That’s some enthusiastic fandom. “I was chucked into it,” Chalotra says. “A baptism of fire. Daunting, but so thrilling.” Sadly, as with many women of minority ethnic backgrounds cast in popular franchises, a small yet vocal corner of the internet protested her involvement on the grounds of her having the temerity not to match the exact image of the character each individual fan had in their heads. “I’m not on social media. I stopped,” says Chalotra. “I haven’t been on it for a long time. The first season, for me … there was a lot of negativity. A lot of positive as well, but obviously the negative … This was one of my first jobs. It hit me hard. I learned very quickly that it can all be quite intense.”Eight months filming a year for seven years was also intense, though the bulk of it took place at Longcross Studios in the UK. “We try to travel as much as we can,” she says, but handily, at least for budgetary reasons, the studio’s surroundings have “a lot of green”, and when a different type of green is called for, they do “a fair bit of filming in Wales”. This at least allowed Chalotra, who lives in London, to retain some semblance of normality when off the clock. “But even when you are filming here, you don’t get much downtime,” she says. “And so those moments, when you do come off set and get home, you want to keep to yourself anyway. I get home and eat something and have a shower, kind of like washing off Yennefer. Eight months is such a lot of a year to be in the headspace of a character. You go in the next day and you’re doing the same thing. I have had to learn so many tools to try to separate myself from this job. I have found that really tough, and continue to.”For these final two seasons, there was also the added complication of the show’s previous Geralt, Henry Cavill, departing after season three due to the time constraints of filming and different ideas about how his character should be portrayed than those of the showrunners. Into his gruff shoes steps Liam Hemsworth, who brings a new vulnerability to the baritone badass, which does the character no harm whatsoever. When Cavill left, did Chalotra think that could be the end of the show? Another fantasy epic left half-finished on the scrapheap of cancellation?View image in fullscreenLook sharp … Mecia Simson and Anya Chalotra in the new season of The Witcher.Photograph: Netflix“No, actually,” she says. “I think I always knew we’d all continue. With the love for the material, we knew that it was going to go again. I was excited to see where Yennefer went, that’s for sure.” The cast and crew were also eager to make Hemsworth feel welcome – Chalotra is adamant no hazing rituals or ribbing of the new boy occurred. “We didn’t want to be too intense,” she laughs. “We just wanted to make space for Liam. He understands people. He understands this world. He was able to come in so naturally. It was really easy.” (Hemsworth himself has rather sweetlydescribed the experienceas being like “changing school halfway through the year”.)For one day more, at least, Chalotra seems happy to still be very much in Witcher World. She describes the previous day of filming, and how when casting spells, even after seven years, she still makes “Whoosh!” and “Fzzzzzt!” noises when performing the hand gestures. “You’ve got to, right?! Someone’s always saying: ‘Anya, now can we do a take without the sound effects?’ Fine, I’ll try!”She is tight-lipped about her next projects, and says “the next stage of my life is about rewilding”, though she is set to star alongside Ralph Ineson and Euphoria’s Chloe Cherry in the dark thriller Two Neighbors, which played at this year’s Edinburgh film festival. She is also about to go straight into a “short period of filming”, though insists “it doesn’t mean that I won’t be grieving Yennefer. We’re all just so connected by these seven years. I think we’ll be trying to distil this experience for a long time. And what will always be a constant is how much we love and respect the people who were next to us doing it.”Nevertheless, it’s time to step off the juggernaut, and Chalotra is reflective. “This character’s in me and I’ve let her go. So it’s not sad at all really, it’s a new beginning.”But first, there’s the small matter of the wrap party. You can’t help but think she’s earned it.The first episode of season four of The Witcher is on Netflix from 30 October.Explore more on these topicsFantasy TVTelevisioninterviewsShareReuse this content"

We need to put that on the table.’Photograph: Dan Mullan/The RFU Collection/Getty ImagesAutumn Nations SeriesNo mountain too high for Itoje and England with Australia first up in autumn seriesEngland captain stresses team must display their full power in Saturday’s first of four home internationals in NovemberRobert KitsonFri 31 Oct 2025 16.00 EDTShareJust occasionally even the world’s best rugby players are genuinely taken aback. In mid-September, Maro Itoje, recuperating from hisBritish & Irish Lions exertions, stood and watched an England training session and could not believe the pace, intensity and all-round zip on view. “I was thinking: ‘Wow, I need to get back in the gym, I need to make sure I come back quickly,’” he admitted this week.Itoje says his former teammate Mako Vunipola was just as impressed – “He didn’t remember it being that fast” – on a visit to England’s base in Bagshot the other day. Another recent retiree, the England scrum-half Danny Care, felt similarly. All of which has been fuelling Itoje’s growing belief, with the 2027 Rugby World Cup on the horizon, that “there’s no mountain we can’t climb”.Australia’s Harry Wilson rejects claims Wallabies use illegal breakdown tacticsRead moreIt also adds an extra frisson to an upcoming autumn series already rich with possibility. Find a way past Australia, Fiji, New Zealand and Argentina on successive weekends and England could extend their winning sequence to 11 games since losingto Ireland in Dublin in February. By the time the World Cup pool draw is made on 3 December it could be that several of their rivals are looking anxiously over their shoulders.The alternative scenario is that England, currently fifth in the world rankings, continue to repeat their familiar trick of flattering only to deceive. Remember last year’sdramatic 42-37 defeat by the Wallabiesand Max Jorgensen sprinting away down the left touchline to secure victory late on for the visitors? Or the frustrating losing margins oftwo pointsandnine pointsrespectively against New Zealand and South Africa?It is not impossible history could repeat itself. Australia have been improving and have arrived battle-hardened from the Rugby Championship with seven of the pack who started last year’s corresponding fixture. As they showed on the Lions tour, particularly inthe final Test in Sydney, they are a more cohesive side under Joe Schmidt and alsobeat the Springboksin Johannesburg in August.Yet, even with standards rising around them, there are signs that England are now getting their wildfowl in a row. The snap and crackle that Itoje noticed in early-season training has been maintained, as has the joie de vivre of the squad’supbeat summer tour to Argentinaand the United States. And when it comes to youthful Red Rose talent the cupboard is increasingly well stocked, albeit more so in certain positions than others.View image in fullscreenGuy Pepper is emerging as a back-rower of class and intent.Photograph: Dan Mullan/RFU/The RFU Collection/Getty ImagesTake a look down their squad list, for example, and ponder the collective abilities of Tommy Freeman, Henry Pollock, Immanuel Feyi-Waboso, Noah Caluori, Fin Smith, Guy Pepper, Fin Baxter, Tom Roebuck, Henry Arundell, Freddie Steward and Emeka Ilione, all aged 24 or under. If they stay fit it is not hard to see half a dozen of them winning 100 caps for their country and collecting a decent amount of silverware en route.The 22-year-old Pepper is definitely one to watch: the son of the former Harlequins and England B forward Martin, Pepper is rapidly emerging as a back-rower of serious class and intent. His move to Bath from Newcastle has worked out nicely for him and his first Twickenham start for England is destined to be the first of many. “I’ve been really impressed by him,” Itoje stressed this week. “Not only is he a very good player but it’s his mentality to want to get better. That will put him in good stead for years to come.”In company with the salty Pollock – his on-field irritant schtick is not to all tastes – Ben Earl, Sam Underhill and Tom Curry, there is certainly no shortage of breakdown energy and dynamism, if not enormous bulk. This might just permit England, when the mood takes them, to maintain a relentless tempo and run teams off their feet in the latter stages of gamesA strong final quarter is definitely part of Saturday’s plan, much thought having gone into finding ways to transform last year’s narrow reverses into wins. With six Lions on the bench – there is a song lyric in there somewhere – including perhaps their most unyielding front row, it could well be that Australia will require a decent early lead.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Without Will Skelton, Len Ikitau, Tom Hooper and James O’Connor – unavailable because the game falls outside the official November international “window” – Australia do not pose as muscular a threat. Carter Gordon, newly back from rugby league, is also not yet fully ready to return in the all-important No 10 position.This particular autumn, though, will ultimately be defined by whether England can fulfil their own potential. Itoje, first and foremost, wants his side to be unashamedly physical. “Rugby is a game of aggression. Generally speaking, the most physical team tends to win,” he said. “The onus is on us to really show what we’re about and the type of team we want to be. I believe at our best we’re an incredibly physical team. We need to put that on the table.”There is also an understanding that success breeds success. Just as England’s 2003 World Cup winners beat all-comers in the preceding couple of years, so the northern wannabes need to ruffle a few southern feathers this month. “As a squad we want to do really well in 2027,” Itoje said. “But you don’t just rock up to a World Cup and win. Often a World Cup is a reflection of your [previous] body of work.”A big game beckons for the seasoned George Ford, picked ahead of Fin and Marcus Smith at fly-half, with the next few weeks also psychologically important for Steve Borthwick’s wider project. “I think we can,” said Itoje when asked if England were targeting a November clean sweep. “There’s not a team we’re playing who I don’t think we can beat. We want to win all our games. Every player should definitely aspire to that. Our fans should expect us to have that mindset.”And having touched rare heights with the Lions, Itoje is not about to lower his sights now he is back in a white jersey. “I’ve been fortunate enough to win a few trophies in my career and when you win one, the feeling of ecstasy is so severe that it’s a bit like a drug. You want some more of it.”England remain a work in progress but their time could just be approaching.Explore more on these topicsAutumn Nations SeriesEngland rugby union teamRugby unionAustralia rugby union teamAustralia sportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Wolves faced Chelsea on 24 December two years ago in the first Premier League Christmas Eve match since 1995, but that was a Sunday, allowing the game to start in the afternoon, which would not be possible this year because it is a working Wednesday.Palace have since asked for Tuesday 23 December to be considered, with EFL sources indicating they favour that date on the grounds of fairness, given that Palace’s game at Leeds two days earlier kicks off at the same time as Arsenal’s trip to Everton. However, Arsenal are understood to have pushed back during talks with the EFL against the prospect of both teams playing two games with one day’s rest in between and are adamant the tie should be in the original slot. A decision is expected next week.When it was suggested that the quarter-final could be moved to help Palace, Arteta said: “I don’t think that’s fair, because we have other competitions as well we have to try to accommodate. We knew at the start of the season the competitions that each club is playing in … On balance we have to try to accommodate the best possible way for everybody.”Asked whether 23 December could be an option, he said: “No, there are others. There are others, believe me, there are other options much better than this one. We already suggested that.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And everybody has a responsibility for the players … It’s dangerous, irresponsible to say that you should play Sunday-Tuesday-Thursday.” He said he was “really upset” wider scheduling issues had not been resolved by the leagues and governing bodies.Arteta, who stressed that player welfare and supporters were the key factors in determining scheduling, warned that clubs could consider pulling out of competitions if issues with fixture congestion were not resolved. He said: “I hope we don’t go [that far]. If we have that big piece of paper with those two principles there in front before we make any decision, all of us in our industry, we won’t get there. If we don’t and we just ignore that, then anything is possible.”Gabriel Martinelli remains sidelined and William Saliba is a doubt for Saturday’s trip to Burnley, where Arsenal hope to make it nine successive victories in all competitions, owing to an ankle injury. Arteta is hopeful the injured trio Martin Ødegaard, Kai Havertz and Noni Madueke could return after the next international break. “I’m excited because they are tremendous players,” he said. “I see them work every single day, how desperate they are to be part of the team.”Explore more on these topicsArsenalnewsShareReuse this content"

The head coach admitted that six defeats in seven games was unacceptable before Aston Villa’s visit on Saturday and denied making excuses for Liverpool’s worst domestic run in 72 years.Slot accepted the pressurewas on before his makeshift teamexited the Carabao Cupagainst Crystal Palace on Wednesday. That pressure to arrest the slide, however, is not, he insisted, coming from Liverpool’s owner, Fenway Sports Group, FSG’s chief executive of football, Michael Edwards, or the sporting director, Richard Hughes, after a summer transfer outlay of almost £450m.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead more“They say similar things,” said Slot, whose team next week face Real Madrid in the Champions League and travel to Manchester City in the Premier League. “I speak mainly to Richard and once in a while to the others. They also see similar things as what I see. For me the conversations haven’t changed a lot. We always talk about the game and it’s always nicer to talk about the game if you have won than if you have lost.”Slot believes Liverpool “have an unbelievable squad if they are all fit and all ready for the programme we are facing”. He said the summer investment in players such as Florian Wirtz and Alexander Isak, who is expected to be sidelined again against Villa through injury, had left the club “in such a good place for the short-term future and the long-term future”.Asked why his team were taking so long to gel, he replied: “You don’t really help me. ‘Why, why, why?’ I give an explanation and people say I’m coming up with excuses. I can come up with five or six reasons why we are not winning as much or losing as much as we do but, as I say every time, there are never enough excuses to have a run of form as we had now. No matter if I could come up with 200 excuses, when you are Liverpool you cannot lose – for me – five out of six, but the reality is six out of seven [Slot was discounting the Palace defeat from Liverpool’s recent run].“There will never be enough reasons but when I came last season all players were fit, and all players had – as a minimum – one year of Premier League experience. So they know what it is to play during the week and then go toBrentford on Saturday. And they were all fit and stayed fit. We had our issues in pre-season [this summer] with players not being fit and players who came in later. It has been more of a struggle to keep them fit or get them all fit.”Only Burnley (21) have faced more big chances from open play this season than Liverpool (19). The league leaders, Arsenal, have faced two. Yet Slot denies the champions have been too open and claims there is no reason to sacrifice his attacking principles for a more pragmatic style after 10 games without a clean sheet. “I don’t see us conceding a lot of chances so I don’t see a reason to change our playing style completely but we need to do better in not conceding goals,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He has lost 19 of his 52 games since signing a two-and-a-half-year contract and last season took United to 15th, their lowest Premier League finish. The Portuguese was asked whether he had worried about completing 12 months in charge.Ruben Amorim’s year at United: renaissance of hope on a long, difficult journeyRead more“To lose so many games, that was so hard for me,” he said, “because this isManchester United. Putting all the attention on the Europa League and not winning, that was massive. So I had some moments where I struggled a lot, and I was thinking: ‘Maybe it’s not meant to be.’ Today is the opposite … Today I feel that it was the best decision in my life [to join], and I want to be here.”Amorim has drawn scrutiny for his 3-4-3 formation and refusal to change it. The 40-year-old outlined why he trusts it. “When I started thinking about the system, nobody was playing 3-4-3, so I can understand how to rotate players,” he said.“Even in the way we buy players, if you have a clear idea how to play, it’s easy for you to [say]: ‘This is the guy that I want.’ And that can help you. When [today] is 4-3-3 and tomorrow is a 4-4-2, it’s harder to make the characteristics right for the players, so I try to use all this knowledge to search for the right players.”Amorim was asked whether he would like to sign a midfielder in January. “A lot of things can happen. We have the World Cup, some players who are not playing, they will ask to leave, so I have to manage everything,” he said. “And then we want to bring players that we can see have a big future in Manchester United.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The omens were not good forWrexhamgiven Frank Lampard’s side had scored 34 goals in 12 games before arriving in north Wales and the home side had won only one of their previous seven.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead moreBut Moore turned the contest on its head with two goals in the space of nine second-half minutes, the Wales striker capitalising on a couple of excellent Josh Windass assists. Moore then took his tally for the season to nine – from yet another Windass assist – seven minutes from time, his fine left-footed strike adding to his earlier right-foot finish and header.Coventry made the final moments interesting as Tatsuhiro Sakamoto pulled a goal back from 20 yards in the 88th minute, but Wrexham held on to move up to 11th in the table.Wrexham were seeking to end their Carabao Cup hangover after losing at home toWelsh rivals Cardiff on Tuesdayand Windass wasted the first opportunity after seven minutes. Coventry’s first chance was a wayward Liam Kitching header, while Matt Grimes curled a free-kick wide.Wrexham showed far greater intensity than they had done against League One Cardiff and fashioned promising moments. Carl Rushworth spilled a Matty James corner and Dominic Hyam hooked the ball over his shoulder for Kitching to clear in a crowded six-yard box. Rushworth redeemed himself after James sent Windass scampering into the channel to find Lewis O’Brien, the goalkeeper saving well with an outstretched foot.View image in fullscreenLewis O’Brien races to congratulate Kieffer Moore after his third goal for Wrexham.Photograph: Ben Roberts/Danehouse/Getty ImagesCoventry took advantage of that escape and struck moments later as Wrexham stood off Sakamoto and the Japanese winger delivered a searching pass for Mason-Clark to sweep home on the half-volley after staying onside.Luke Woolfenden’s looping header was tipped over by Arthur Okonkwo as Coventry scented more success. Wrexham responded, with Liberato Cacace unable to keep his volley down and O’Brien’s 25-yard attempt safely gathered by Rushworth.Max Cleworth shot just wide of the far post as Wrexham continued to press after the break, although the home side breathed a sigh of relief after Mason-Clark surged forward and Haji Wright was off target.Wrexham’s endeavour was rewarded on the hour when Issa Kaboré fed Windass down the right and the sliding Moore met his cross to beat Rushworth from close range. It got better for Wrexham nine minutes later as Windass again found the room to pick out a cross to the far post this time and Moore, peeling off his marker, headed home brilliantly. Moore completed his first hat-trick for more than seven years with another polished finish, after running on to a through ball down the left.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He is not at fault in this incident,” the statement read.Lawson had returned to the pits on the opening laps of the race having taken damage. When he emerged he was confronted with two marshals running across the track having been clearing debris from the opening corners directly in front of him.“Mate. Oh my god, are you kidding me? Did you just see that?” he said to his engineer on team radio. “I could have fucking killed them.”After the race he was outraged that the marshals had been placed in such danger apparently without being informed that he was out of time with the rest of the field after pitting early.“I honestly couldn’t believe what I was seeing,” he said. “It’s pretty unacceptable. We can’t understand how on a live track marshals can be allowed to just run across the track like that. I have no idea why, I’m sure we’ll get some sort of explanation, but it really can’t happen again.”At the time the marshals had been prepared to be given the all-clear to collect debris from the opening corners, however when Lawson took his stop the FIA race director rescinded the clearance to enter the track. Why the marshals still proceeded to do so remains the subject of an FIA investigation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSport in FocusFree weekly newsletterSign up to Sport in FocusEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This de-princing could leave the entire House of Windsor facing redundancyFri 31 Oct 2025 08.47 EDTLast modified on Fri 31 Oct 2025 14.22 EDTShareIncredible news for residents of the likes of Prince Andrew Drive and Prince Andrew Way, who in recent years have sought name changes from their local councils to remove the unfortunate association with You Know Who. Thanks to last night’s historicallydramatic action by the king, the dignity of those aforementioned small stretches of Britain has been restored. (If anyone happens to live in Andrew Mountbatten Windsor Close, my commiserations.) But has the dignity of the British monarchy – current custodians: the House of Windsor – been restored? No, I reckon. In fact, this has made it worse.By way of background, the royal family’s crises have not been external for some time. It is not beset by marauding forces, or rival claimants to its throne, or parliamentarian revolt. All its greatest crises in the past few decades have come from within. Those crises have been marital, financial,even clinical– and have just avoided being criminal. The royal family has proved its own worst enemy. The things that have happened have not happenedtoit, butbecauseof it. The call’s coming from inside the castle.I’ve covered this particular Andrew story for well over a decade, and it hopefully goes without saying that the ex-prince is an utterly grim, utterly dim disgrace. But for my money, this latest Windsor crisis is the most dangerous variety yet for the crown: philosophical. Far from securing the monarchy’s future, the de-princing of Mr Mountbatten Windsor has hastened its end, in the great scheme of things. Don’t ask me to put a number of years on “the great scheme of things” – all I can tell you is that it’s a real rush writing a column that will only be proved right or wrong long after I’m dead. Tony Blair must feel like this every time he says history will judge him kindly for the Iraq war.But look, here’s the take: when there isn’t a royal family any more, analysts will look back and see the unprecedented enforced commoner-ing of Andrew as a key moment. Notthekey moment – that was the abdication. Forgive me getting all Stranger Things on this story, but 1936 was the moment the Windsors opened the gate. Once they started suggesting that people could be fired from Earth’s most committed non-meritocracy – unroyalled, as it were – then they played around fatally with the idea of royalty itself. Now, you might well think that the idea of royalty itself is stupid, but it is what it is. They’re not just another random rich family. They’re supposed to be special and ethereal and not subject to personnel issues. There’s no way in the world they should want to be stepping out of their realm – which is, quite literally “the realm” – and into the plebeian waters of appraisals and feedback and mandatory discrimination training and whatnot. Though all that would, as always, make a fun three-minute comedy sketch.The most almighty number of shitbag relatives have been harboured by the British royal family down the centuries. Obviously it was easier when you could just poison your errant brother or whatever, but for those that couldn’t (most of them after the 17th century), you lived with it via exile and so on, because total deroyalling torpedoed the entire idea of what it was you were born into. TheBritish dukes who had their titles removedfor fighting for Germany in the first world war were distant foreign randos. Andrew remains eighth in line to the throne.So yes: the abdication was when the Windsors opened the gate. After that it was – and will be – whack-a-mole. Every crisis will draw significant numbers of people out who would ask why you couldn’t cut off whoever was displeasing them in that moment. And why not? You got rid of one: the precedent is set. My theory is that the late Queen Elizabeth realised this, and consequently knew that to avoid making matters worse, she would have to work as queen till literally her dying day. Don’t forget that for quite some time, people seriously suggested that the crown skip the then-unsatisfactory Charles and be passed straight to William. Don’t forget that later on, people kept suggesting that Elizabeth abdicate in favour of Charles, having put in decades of exemplary service and being deserving of retirement, as though monarchy really were this ludicrous “firm” they keep telling us it is.But it isn’t. It isn’t a firm, or a small-to-medium enterprise, or a place where you pick and choose which family member gets the big jobs. They’re not the flipping Murdochs. As far as the long-termist stewardship of the thing they are above all charged with protecting goes, I think that, philosophically speaking, you have to play the cards you’re laid. Now public opinion has managed to get the king to issue a P45 so close to home, it will be that much easier to call for the next personnel change. The king won’t have too many more years in the managing director role. But William, that supposedly iron-fisted current HR director, is a very indifferently gifted individual who will probably prove to be overpromoted in the role of king. I wonder who or what he’ll cancel, under his strange, self-styled guise as protector of the mental health of the nation. I guess we’ll find out.For what infinitely negligible amount it’s worth, I’m in favour of having a royal family, mainly because they’re insanely good copy, and arguably better than having Peter Mandelson or whoever as head of state. (I’m kidding: I understand third ways are available.) Given the sheer amount of merriment/discourse they generate, they add to the gaiety of the nation – certainly to the compulsive prurience. People love to love them or love to hate them. It seems to be a complete misery machine for those involved, and certainly not one that any of us ordinaries would in our right mind want our children to marry into (I will never get over the Middleton parents’ reported keenness for Kate to take a gap year so she could switch university application to St Andrews once it was confirmedPrince Williamwould be attending – and all this after the cautionary story of Princess Diana had come to its awful end).Speaking of tragic stories, the law has decided Andrew can’t be further investigated over the late Virginia Giuffre’s allegations, with theFBI dropping its probeinto him earlier this year. The king’s statement on the de-princing appeared to hint he doesn’t entirely believe his brother’s denials, so perhaps Charles’s actions are a sort of synthesised justice, designed in part to show that no one is above the law. And yet, the royal family is above many laws – and this will only hasten the goodbye to all that.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Positive Money, Tax Justice UK, the Fairness Foundation, Equality Trust and others arecampaigningfor a windfall tax on banks’ accelerating domestic profits. Inflation has yet again raised their takings torecord heightsfor no extra effort, the same inflation that also raises the cost of living.When oil and gas prices soared in 2022, the Tory government set a 35% energy profits levy. Why not on banks, an equally unavoidable utility, they demand? Naturally British banks fight back. “Our sector underpins investment, business growth and home ownership across the country,”says their lobby group, UK Finance. It will damage their competitiveness with foreign banks. Nonsense, say the campaigners, they would only tax UK retail profits. Banks’ investment in the real economy has been dropping, as they pay growing sums to their shareholders.The crescendo of pre-budget lobbying is louder than usual: sadly a pro-tax demonstration is reported only in the Morning Star andthe Banker, while lobbyists threatening dire consequences from any new tax get good coverage. As every imaginable tax rise is rumoured, the chancellor is bombarded with warnings, the rightwing media venting more than usually at any posited increase.Gambling is the public’s most popular target. The Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) says a 50% taxcould raise £3.2bn. But the industry kick-back has been loud, calling Gordon Brown’ssupportfor the tax rise, “economically reckless”. The betting and gambling council warns40,000 jobs would go, while Betfred is threatening to close all 1,287 of its outlets. Its lobbying hit a peak this week when its spokesperson told the Commons treasury committee there was “no social ill” at all in gambling.Everyone knows property taxes are chaotically unjust, but tiptoe towards rebalancing council tax, and defenders of very expensive homes warn of calamity. A suggested tax on mansions worth more than £2m was “shrinking the economy quite dramatically and breeding a stagnant swamp” in the housing market,said a Sotheby’s estate agent. A mansion tax will force thousands of cash-poor, asset-rich pensioners to sell up,protests Knight Frank, though downsizing would probably improve their lives. Ignore estate agents’ warnings of millionaire flight,well debunkedby the LSE’s Prof Sam Friedman and by HMRC itself.Equalising national insurance on earned and unearned income is popular, but has landlords and letting agents up in arms. The rental market will collapse, they say, killing little landlords. Reforming business rates would revive high streets by charging big supermarkets and megastores more, and abolishing rates for local independents to fill empty shops. Good idea. But the supermarkets’ riposte to the chancellor warned they wouldraise food prices. That’s frightening.View image in fullscreenCampaigners wearing masks of top bank CEOs urge the government to raise bank taxes, on Westminster Bridge, London, 28 October 2025.Photograph: Jess HurdDon’t touch pensions, says the mighty pensions industry opposing speculation that everyone should get the same pension tax relief. Why do basic rate taxpayers get 20% added to their pensions by the state, while 40% and 45% taxpayers get those higher sums? Cutting the equally unwarranted 25% tax-free lump sum is greeted with the same indignation, setting off a 61% increase in pension withdrawalslast year. Don’t touch savings either. The tax-free Isa is reportedly under threatof reduction, and so it should be. None but the very wealthy have £20,000 a year to stash away.The chancellor is besieged by warnings that the slightest tax tweak will result in raising less not more from the wealthy, with any tax rise a dread danger to growth. Lobbyists may sense weakness in a government that has backed down and U-turned before. But listening to the public is no guide either. Dismalpolling by Persuasion UKfor the IPPR this week shows there is no popular way to raise the kind of money she needs to repair crippled services.The only taxes people currently back are for the rich, high earners, social media companies – but not “ordinary people”, not pensioners, small businesses, farmers or petrol car drivers. They do want to tax gambling, an exit tax for the fleeing rich, homes worth more than £2m, investments and, of course, banks. YouGov findsstrong supportfor a wealth tax on the rich, and virtually none for Tony Blair’s strange call this week to cut the top tax rate. Taxing “others” will not be enough, yet there’s no support for raising the three big universal taxes. However, note that breaking election pledges matters less than delivering visible improvement in people’s lives.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Fairness is the more popular pro-tax message, making the wealthy pay more and closing loopholes. But the grim reality is that no pro-tax message beats an anti-tax message. That means the chancellor just has to do what she thinks right. Close her ears to the cacophony of expensive lobbyists, and close her ears to the public too. This government’s contradictory messaging has left it late to rouse public opinion for collective contribution. She can only trust her own judgment as she will be vilified and savaged whatever she does. With her party sitting at 17% in the polls, what’s to lose? There is no popular option, so aim for the long-term good, taking the fairest path.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsBudget 2025OpinionTax and spendingRachel ReevesTaxLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

They’re sick of pretending to be fine with relationships that are notFri 31 Oct 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 31 Oct 2025 04.43 EDTShareLily Allen was always an enviably cool girl.When she first burst on to the music scene nearly two decades ago at 21, it was with a breezy, don’t-care London swagger. Her songs concealed big, painful feelings under flippant, deadpan lyrics and deceptively sweet melodies, which made them easier to swallow. Even this summer, when she talked on her thrillingly unfiltered podcastMiss Me?about having lost count of exactly how many abortions she’d had, she sang the words to the tune of Frank Sinatra’s My Way.In the noughties, she seemed fearless, gettingparalytic at awards ceremoniesand picking publicbeef with Madonna. However, it looked as if she might be settling into a quieter life when she married Sam Cooper and had their two daughters, but within four yearsthey’d split up. You might not immediately have guessed, when she wrote in her memoir abouta fling with Liam Gallagher, that since childhood she’d been dreaming of “two point four children, living in the country”,as she told this newspaper. But now we know what was really going on underneath.Or do we? Her new albumWest End Girltells the story of – well let’s just say,anopen marriage gone sour, rather than necessarilyheropen marriage, since like Beyoncé and Taylor Swift before her, Allen carefully blurs the question of exactly how much is about her real-life split from her second husband David Harbour last year and how much is just pure creative licence. Whoever this musical alter ego really is, she starts the title track singing dreamily about settling with her husband into a New York brownstone and finding schools for the kids, but ends it uncertainly trying to convince herself that doing whatever it takes to keep him happy will somehow work out for the best. After that, it’s downhill all the way, as she comes sadly to realise that he hasn’t even stuck to their agreement to “be discreet and don’t be blatant”, and that trying to match him at his own game as a 40-something mother of two isn’t nearly as fun as it looks.Though the guessing game of trying to match these lyrics to real life events is obviously driving a lot of downloads, I don’t think that’s why women of all ages have spent the past week listening to the album over and over on repeat, quoting scraps of it in their group chats, and arguing about whether putting “ethically non-mongamous” on your dating profile is just a fancy new pseudo-progressive name for behaving badly. Allen seems to have tapped into a deep vein of female anger about having to pretend to be fine with something you’re not, for fear that otherwise you’ll look uncool or uptight – and then he’ll leave you.It’s clearly resonating with plenty of women her age, sick of being strung along on dating apps by middle-aged Peter Pans who never seem ready to have the conversation about being exclusive. But there’s something here too for younger women, secretly wondering whether the shattering of stigma around casual hookups or infidelity or various shades of kinky sex – while undoubtedly liberating for some – has made it harder for others to admit that they just want something vanilla. It’s music for women tired of pretending to be fine with situationships in which they never know where they stand; tired of having to be a cool girl who never complains or makes demands, tired of worrying that it sounds too needy or basic to say you want more commitment or would like kids one day.“I tried to be your modern wife,” Allen sings plaintively on Relapse, “but the child in me protests.” But is it really so immature to want some stability, especially if (as Allen’s by all accounts was) your own childhood was fairly chaotic, and especially once you have (as Allen does) children yourself?For this isn’t what sexual liberation was meant to feel like. It wasn’t supposed to mean squashing your own needs anxiously down to fit some man’s fantasy – whether that involves becoming a downtrodden tradwife or one-third of a throuple – while gamely pretending you want it just as much as he does. Revolutions are liberating only when the freedoms gained are genuine freedoms, not something more closely resembling an obligation in disguise. On the album, Allen sings about her daughters looking to her for lessons about love. Well, it turns out, she’s written one: and it’s not to be shamed out of asking for what you want, even – perhaps especially – if it sounds slightly boring.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistskip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Whatever you’re doing right nowAndy BeckettIn California, daily life under Trump is marked by sporadic resistance and avoidance. Neither will defeat the autocratsFri 31 Oct 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 31 Oct 2025 05.56 EDTShareHow would you behave if your democracy was being dismantled? In most western countries, that used to be an academic question. Societies where this process had happened, such as Germany in the 1930s, seemed increasingly distant. The contrasting ways that people reacted to authoritarianism and autocracy, both politically and in their everyday lives, while darkly fascinating and important to study and remember, seemed of diminishing relevance to now.Not any more. Illiberal populism has spread across the world, either challenging for power or entrenching itself in office, from Argentina to Italy, France to Indonesia, Hungary to Britain. But probably the most significant example of a relatively free, pluralist society and political system turning into something very different remains the US, now nine months into Donald Trump’s second term.As it often does, the US is demonstrating what the future could be for much of the world. Trump’spurges of immigrants, centralisation of power, suppression of dissent, rewarding of loyal oligarchs and contempt for truth and the law are not unique. Even governments which present themselves as alternatives to populism, such as Keir Starmer’s,increasingly sharesome of its features, such as a performative severity towards asylum seekers. Yet with over three years left of Trump’s frenetic presidency, and possibly more – were he toovercome the constitutional and electoral obstaclesto a third term – life under him already provides the most unsettling picture of democracy under siege so far.Partly because populism is divisive – setting “the people” against their supposed enemies – and partly because Trump is so volatile, the domestic impact of his regime is very uneven. And so is how different groups and individuals respond to its actions. These complex, often disturbing patterns are particularly clear in California, one of the places he most dislikes, for its liberal values and multiculturalism, and where his regime has most aggressively intervened.In Los Angeles, where US marines, national guard troops and armed officers of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have beencontroversially deployedby the federal government on and off since June, some largely Latino neighbourhoods remain eerily quiet. In Boyle Heights last Wednesday morning, two of the usual hubs for shopping and socialising, Cesar Chavez Avenue and Mariachi Plaza, were almost deserted, bakeries and cafes empty, only a few of the square’s outdoor seats taken, despite a mellow autumn sun. Fear of sudden arrest, detention and deportation has kept many people indoors and away from public spaces for months.Yet in the neighbouring arts district of downtown LA, a gentrified grid of former warehouses and factories, the bakeries and cafes were busy as usual. Over pricey iced coffees and fat, artisanal sandwiches, fashionably dressed clusters of largely white people chatted about their latest cultural projects. The fact that Trump and his supporters would probably hate the whole scene, or that something approaching martial law had been imposed just up the road, did not appear to be affecting these ambitious millennials. In the US, as in other countries that are becoming or have become authoritarian, for those spared by the state, careers, social lives, leisure and consumerism carry on – and sometimes with a new intensity, as a form of escape.However, avoiding and engaging with politics are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Often, both impulses coexist in people, especially when faced with something as simultaneously provocative and exhausting as hard-right populism. Periods of passivity, of apparent acceptance of the status quo, alternate with an urge to act.View image in fullscreenProtesters at a No Kings march in Los Angeles on 19 October 2025.Photograph: Michael Nigro/Pacific Press/ShutterstockA fortnight ago, I went to aNo Kings protestin Beverly Hills, a Californian city much less associated with activism than deep wealth. I expected a small gathering of elite liberals; instead, there were a couple of thousand boisterous people, of all ages, marching back and forth for hours along the edge of a park, carrying witty anti-Trump placards and chanting, to the accompaniment of drummers and constant passing car horns. The chants were not that fluent, which suggested that the participants did not protest often, and so did their gleeful smiles, as if they were doing something unexpectedly enjoyable and naughty. The whole event was uplifting: politics coming alive for people, perhaps for the first time.But authoritarianism can provoke more jaded reactions as well. In San Francisco, traditionally a more political place, while there have been big No Kings protests, I also encountered a contempt towards Trump and his circle, for their blatant self-interest, cartoonish bullying and vast exaggerations, which risked becoming an angry apathy: a belief that the regime was a malign fact of life, like a government in a totally corrupt state or the Soviet bloc. This response, like refusing to rise to Trump’s attention-seeking, can be understood and justified as a form of conscious disengagement and as a coping mechanism. Yet while liberals and leftists brood, his regime relentlessly moves on.While I was in San Francisco, it was rumoured that he was about to send troops or federal agents to what he claimed was a failing city. Some people I spoke to there ridiculed the idea. They gestured towards the many beautiful streets, successful businesses, picturesque green spaces and extensive public transport – a quality of life which, while increasingly unaffordable for some, exceeds that of many Trump-supporting places.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Trump called off his San Francisco invasion, but the possibility of it remains, like a crude but effective TV cliffhanger. Creating a politics which can stand up to rightwing populism’s showmanship and drama in a sustained way is a project which has so far defeated Trump’s opponents, with the exception of isolated leftwingers such asZohran Mamdaniand Bernie Sanders.If Reform UK wins power, as seems increasingly possible, then British liberals and leftists will face the same challenge. Nigel Farage could launch endless eye-catching policies from Downing Street, such as the Trump-style deconstruction and politicisation of Whitehall, whichReform promisedthis week. These policies may fail or disappoint, as Trump’s often have, but make the political weather nevertheless. Unless populism’s opponents create an equally relentless and compelling movement, and draw in more of those whom populism victimises and scares into silence, then this age of autocrats will carry on. As the US shows, sporadic resistance, contempt and avoidance are not enough.Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionThe far rightICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)US politicsReform UKNigel FaragecommentShareReuse this content"

Plus, Andrew is losing everything he holds dear, including his house full of memoriesFri 31 Oct 2025 07.37 EDTLast modified on Fri 31 Oct 2025 12.22 EDTShareMondayThe clocks have gone back. Which is to say, something happened overnight for reasons that I am no closer to understanding now than I was half a century ago as a newborn babe.Every year we get the warnings and I dutifully follow the instructions on the two analogue clocks in the house. (Like everyone else, the car and oven have to fend for themselves until their time – literally – comes again in the summer). And then I stare at those two clocks trying to figure out what it means. Is this the one where I get an extra hour in bed or the one where I have one stolen from me? I know it will get dark earlier rather than later but that’s because I know it’s winter and that’s how these things go. But I don’t understand. I cannot truly make the connection between what is happening with clocks and what is happening outside. I follow a chain of thoughts and find it untethered at both ends.So I grope in metaphorical darkness twice a year, regardless of where the sun stands, knowing what to do but never why. It’s as good a biannual (semi-annual? Therein lies another tale) reminder of the essential absurdity of life anyway.TuesdayResearch has revealed that women use three times as many exclamation marks in emails as men. I know, right?!!!! The explanation is simple – like most things (with the possible exception of the clocks going back, which makes me warm to it slightly) it is because of Sexism Maths.You know, like how it takes, for example, five years of wifely “nagging” (sharing of basic intelligence) or one passing suggestion from a male friend to get a man to change his diet/minor behavioural issue? Or – let’s take it up a notch!!!! – about 30 women’s testimonies to convict one celebrity rapist? Well, this is a less consequential manifestation of the same phenomenon. Women have to use three times as many exclamation marks to be perceived as fairly as men. Which in their case means having to seem happy and amenable and friendly – a state known for unfathomable reasons as natural womanhood – so that they can get their emailed message across.It’s f!!!ing infuriating. Sometimes you feel that the clocks are doing nothing else at all but going back.View image in fullscreen‘Darling, we don’t get out of this tree for less than £10k a day. Too fabulous. Soz.’Photograph: APWednesdayDo you know what’s trending right now on social media? It’s – excuse me, I just have to retch very unInstagrammably into a bucket – oysters. Oysters. People are now into eating lumps of snot, on camera and off, and pretending this isn’t the greatest perversion, in a crowded field, the internet has ever enabled.Dear God, what is going on? Have you ever seen, smelled or tasted an oyster? Then you know I need hardly say more. For those of you who haven’t – do any one of these things for a picosecond and join us in our marrow-deep revulsion.They claim they are downing the fleshy grey lumps of horror because oysters are a healthy, sustainable way of getting protein, Omega-3s and minerals. As if a zinc tablet wasn’t infinitely handier and more appetising. So dry! So neatly rounded! So not a noxious bivalve!Why are you eating something with valves?They are really doing it, of course, because it’s such a wholly disgusting sight. The human eye and brain is a treacherous combination. Just as you can’t look away from a car crash, so too you are transfixed by the sight of a human being with free will choosing to eat phlegm. I don’t know what we’re going to do about us, I really don’t.ThursdayAnd yet. At least oyster-eating is a closed circle – you do something disgusting, I am disgusted, you do something disgusting, I am disgusted, repeat until one of us has to get back to work. The other great current trend among influencers of surging ambition and entitlement is to head out to the Amazon rainforest, Asia and the Pacific to try to contact the estimated 90 Indigenous tribes there who have chosen to stay isolated from civilisation.“All contact kills,” a report from the charity Survival International, which advocates for the rights of tribal people, said. A fairly unequivocal stance, but what are a few deaths and/or total wipeout of a population from unknown pathogens compared with clicks, eh, Survival International? Have you thought about the survival of the influencer ecology? If a twat under 25 is prevented from doing something, the ripples spread far beyond him or her – soon there could be no content to click on at all. And then everyone in the western world dies. Probably. Or something.FridayHalloween. Let’s all go as Prince Andrew – or rather, Andrew. The queen’s son has, in the wake of slowly mounting revelations and allegations about his relationship with the convicted predator Jeffery Epstein and Epstein’s currently incarcerated pimp, Ghislaine Maxwell, been stripped of his royal title and is being removed from the 30-room grace-and-favour mansion in Windsor Great Park. Royal Lodge, it was reported this week, was where he hosted Epstein, Maxwell and Harvey Weinstein months after an arrest warrant had been issued for Epstein for sexually assaulting a minor. Who, to be fair, would want to leave a home with such happy memories attached?Anyway, point is, everything that he, in his infinite unwisdom, holds dear – titles, money, free house – is gone for ever. He is suffering in a way we could wish all close friends of predators could suffer.View image in fullscreen‘I. Will. Literally. Trade. You. My. Country. For.

But human behaviour is far scarier than human appearanceFri 31 Oct 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 31 Oct 2025 14.26 EDTShareThere is something sadomasochistic about being a horror fan with a disability. For as long as I can remember, I have been drawn to the intoxicating cycle of dread-terror-release that a genuinely frightening horror film can bring – the simultaneous feeling of “I hate this and want it to end” and “This adrenaline rush is making me feel fully alive.” But I have also come to expect certain tropes that I know will make me feel a different kind of dread, which other people in the cinema may not necessarily be attuned to.Guillermo del Toro’s handsomeadaptation of Frankenstein, which received a 15-minute standing ovation in Venice this August, powerfully makes the case that we ought not to be afraid of difference. However, given that the story is widely regarded as anallegory for disability, it is disappointing that the film stars only able-bodied performers and that a creature repeatedly referred to as “deformed” is portrayed by Jacob Elordi. While the creature is shown to be gentle despite his “obscene” appearance, the audience is heavy-handedly invited to conclude that “the real monster” is his creator, Victor Frankenstein (in case you hadn’t understood the book). Unfortunately the film then drives home the point about Victor’s moral degradation by making him increasingly disabled – in a departure from the original novel, he is given a prosthetic leg, facial scarring and amputated fingers. Del Toro may have adapted the book with a great deal of panache and visual flair, but he has not understood its most basic message.The portrayal of disability in film generally, especially horror, isfamously problematic. While physical beauty is often conflated with a character’s moral goodness, villains have historically beenassociated withdisability or disfigurement:facial scarring,wheelchair use,limb difference. Because of their physical limitations, the logic goes, these characters are likely to become embittered, jealous and calculating, leading to their nefarious deeds. Suffering here does not ennoble but turns people into scheming supervillains who wish to inflict pain on those around them out of malevolence and spite. Neurodivergence and mental illness areroutinely equatedwith violence and deviance.Over the years, progress has been slow but incremental. Film-makers are more cautious about making antagonists explicitly disabled – the BFI hasrefused fundingfor films that feature facially scarred villains – but the prejudice presents itself in subtler ways. A number of recent horror films centre around someone who “doesn’t look quite right”, featuring some variation of exaggerated facial features and ungainly proportions. Minor spoilers ahead: Longlegs (Nicolas Cage in prosthetics), The Substance(Demi Moore in prosthetics), Heretic (scary lady in the basement in prosthetics), Weapons (old lady in prosthetics). In Robert Eggers’ Nosferatu, the vampire’s hands were “custom made” to be “gnarly and weathered. ‘Arthritic’ was a word we looked at,”according toOscar-nominated makeup effects designer David White. Self-mutilation resulting in disability is another common trope: see Norwegian body horrorThe Ugly Stepsister, the mother in Luca Guadagnino’s Bones and All, Brendan Gleeson’s character in The Banshees of Inisherin. In Ari Aster’s Eddington, disability is presented askarmic punishment.View image in fullscreenChristopher Lee in The Wicker Man (1973).Photograph: British Lion/Studiocanal/AllstarIn her excellent International Booker-longlisted novelHunchback, Saou Ichikawa references The History of the Body, edited by Corbin, Courtine and Vigarello: “The ‘criminalisation of the gaze’ that took hold around the dawn of the 20th century had led to the decline of the freak show, which was subsequently replaced in popularity by the Monsters of Hollywood. Now, with costumes serving as an ethical cushion, people can enjoy ogling deformity without guilt or reserve.”What is perhaps more painful, and insidious, is the portrayal of disability in films not specifically in the horror genre but which trade in a sense of discomfort: arthouse films by respected auteurs, with less emphasis on gore or jump scares than on an undercurrent of psychological unease. In these films, a disabled actor (or an actor in prosthetics) will often appear at a crucial moment as a visual signifier heightening the level of eeriness in a scene. This has happened in some of the best films ever made: the mute, paraplegic girl in Andrei Tarkovsky’s Stalker (referred to as a “mutant”), the “dwarf serial killer” in Nicolas Roeg’s Don’t Look Now, “the disabled one” in Aster’sMidsommar, the gratuitous five-second shot of a facially scarred amputee gleefully clapping along at a Nazi event in Jonathan Glazer’s The Zone of Interest (a modern masterpiece, and one of the most important films of this century). In Yorgos Lanthimos’s remarkable Poor Things, Willem Dafoe’s prosthetics-assisted “deformed … scary face” (as it is describedin the screenplay) and Emma Stone’s character’s intellectual disability are not a sign of moral depravity but are nevertheless presented as “creepy and uncanny”. The saddest thing is that these are some of my favourite films. I have no wish to publicly criticise them, but feeling excluded from them is particularly hurtful.View image in fullscreenBilly Barratt as Andy and Sora Wong as Piper in Bring Her Back (2025).Photograph: Ingvar Kenne/PAIt is exhausting never seeing yourself on screen unless you are used as shorthand for the viewer to feel uncomfortable, akin to the sound of a creaking door or spooky ambient music. There is no shortage of terrifying horror films that don’t resort to othering people who look different: classics such asThe Haunting, The Wicker Man and George Sluizer’sThe Vanishing, and recent releases such as Get Out, Saint Maud, Presence and Sinners. In the Philippou brothers’ horrifying, wonderfulBring Her Back, the character of Piper is portrayed by Sora Wong, who has limited vision, a casting decision that brings depth and richness to the role. Piper is funny and smart and a little bit mean and not defined by her disability, which is never used as a way to evoke eeriness – while she experiences ableism at the hand of other characters, the audience is on her side.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Perhaps this is not something film-makers are doing consciously; viewers may not even notice it is happening. But watching films as someone with a disability can be a singularly lonely experience. Disabled people are hugely underrepresented in film and TV, making upjust 2%of the workforce, compared with an average of more than 20% across all other industries; onlythree disabled actorshave won Oscars (compared with25 able-bodied actorswho won Oscars for “cripping up”), and onlyone directorwith a physical disability, Crip Camp’s James LeBrecht, has ever been nominated. This means we overwhelmingly see ourselves through others’ eyes, often perpetuating harmful and outdated stereotypes.The solution – in both film and publishing – is to get disabled writers, directors, actors and creatives to tell our own stories in order to bring a diverse, authentic and meaningful perspective to representation. “Nothing about us without us,” the saying goes. But for the moment, most of us are on the outside looking in, waiting to see whether we ourselves are the monster.Kathryn Bromwich is a freelance journalist and a former commissioning editor and writer on the Observer New ReviewDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Don’t expect the constitution to stop himMoira DoneganWhat is and is not constitutional is determined, in effect, by loyalists on the supreme court and their bad-faith enablersFri 31 Oct 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 31 Oct 2025 06.02 EDTShareThe news cycle has continued in a predictable arc. Last week, Steve Bannon, the far-right provocateur and one-timeDonald Trumpadviser, said in an interview with the Economist that the president would seek an unconstitutional third term. “Trump is going to be president in 28, and people ought to just get accommodated with that,” Bannon said. (He seemed to be referring to Trump winning the presidential election in 2028 – Trump’s current term will last through 20 January 2029.) “At the appropriate time, we’ll lay out what the plan is.”Like clockwork, Trump commented on the idea soon after,telling reportersfollowing him on Air Force One as he flew from Kuala Lumpur to Tokyo: “I would love to do it.”Initially, he said: “I haven’t really thought about it. But I have the best poll numbers I’ve ever had.” (This is not true; Trump’s approval has sunk considerably, witha new pollreleased this week showing him at a net -19 point approval rating, the lowest of his second term.) Still, Trump said he would be legally able to run again in a scheme in which he was placed on the ticket as a vice-presidential nominee, only for the puppet placed in the presidential slot to resign once taking office, thereby granting him the presidency. But he suggested that he would prefer to run himself, casting aspersion on the vice-presidential campaign option. “I don’t think people would like that,” he said. “It would be too cute, it wouldn’t be right.” In fact, it would also be unconstitutional, violatingthe 12th amendment’s prohibitionon anyone ineligible for the presidency to be elected as vice-president.In a notable departure from his being loath to disagree with the president about anything at all, the House speaker, Mike Johnson, on Tuesday seemed to pour water on the idea of a third Trump term, noting, correctly, that such an outcome is barred by the constitution. “Well, there’s the 22nd amendment,” he noted. Johnson said that Trump was “trolling” his political enemies; analysis atCNNand theNew York Timessuggests that Trump is using the third-term comments in part to mute awareness of his own lame-duck status.Johnson is correct that the plain language of the constitution prevents Trump from getting what he says he wants in a third term. But we are in a moment when the plain language of the constitution is being subverted, ignored and read with shocking bad faith by the rightwing legal establishment, from law professors to justices of the supreme court, who have seemed eager to nullify parts of the constitution in order to expand Trump’s prerogatives and indulge his whims. How else but as an attack on the constitutional order are we supposed to understand, to cite just one example, the supreme court’s decision toallow Trump to proceedwith his dismantling of the Department of Education – a body created by Congress, which only Congress has the power to dissolve? The prohibition posed by the constitution against a third Trump term does not seem like an especially robust defense in an era when the constitution is effectively being rewritten to grant Trump ever more power, with ever fewer opportunities for accountability. The constitution, after all, is just a piece of paper. And of the nine jurists tasked with settling on its authoritative interpretation, six of them are in the tank for a man hostile to its principles.If obviating the plain and obvious language of the 22nd amendment seems like too embarrassing a move even for this degraded and servile supreme court, consider what the court is already looking to do to the 14th amendment. The plain reading of the amendment, which has been understood and implemented in exactly one way for the past 157 years, is that the constitution confers citizenship to all persons born within the United States – what is called birthright citizenship. But after the Trump administration issued an executive order purporting to nullify this constitutional provision, the supreme courtintervenedto allow the order to go into effect, and made an unprecedented move toprevent lower courtsfrom easily blocking it.The justices were provided cover, and a degree of plausible deniability, by right-leaning law professors, who had responded to the Maga movement’s calls to end birthright citizenship by assembling a legalliteraturethat claims – through strained, misstated, far-fetched and outright wrong readings of the historical and legal record – that there is a longstanding controversy about the meaning of the 14th amendment’s citizenship clause.There is not.But their papers have created a veneer of intellectual credibility and a pretext for the Trump administration to do what it wants to do anyway: ignore the constitution. (In abriefingfiled to the supreme court, asking it to sanction Trump’s attack on citizenship, the Trump administration alludes to “[a] growing body of modern scholarship”, and cites Trump-aligned scholars whose work claiming to limit birthright citizenship the administration’s own actions had provoked.) When the supreme court finally rules on the constitutionality of Trump’s order and the future of birthright citizenship is determined, what these law professors say may well matter more than what the constitution does.And this is why the notion that Trump “can’t” run for a third term, merely because such a thing is unconstitutional, may be a bit naive, or insufficiently alert to the degree to which the American constitutional order has already collapsed. What is and is not constitutional is determined, in effect, by Trump loyalists on the court; they already have an infrastructure of bad-faith enablers who will help them launder their efforts to empower him with flimsy pretenses of legal justifiability. And we already know, too, what happens when the law says that Trump must leave office, but he doesn’t want to. Events have long since made clear that the law is no check on Trump’s power. He’ll have to be stopped by the people instead: not with a lawsuit, but with a movement.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS constitution and civil libertiesTrump administrationUS supreme courtUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Problems around royal secrecy and entitlement remain to be tackledFri 31 Oct 2025 14.21 EDTLast modified on Fri 31 Oct 2025 20.12 EDTSharePrince Andrew is no more. Henceforth the king’s younger brother will be known asAndrew Mountbatten Windsor. With the Thursday night announcement, and the news that Mr Mountbatten Windsor will quit his 30-room home in Windsor, the monarch hopes to draw a line under the shame of the former prince’s friendship with the dead sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, and alleged sexual assault of Virginia Giuffre when she was 17, which he has always denied.These “censures” – as Buckingham Palace termed them – were made necessary by Mr Mountbatten Windsor’s poor judgment and deceit, including the lie that he had broken off contact with Epstein in 2010. But the real damage was done by his grotesquely entitled behaviour and appalling choice of friends. It should not have taken the painful details in Ms Giuffre’s posthumous memoir,an extract of which was published in the Guardian, to make it obvious that the shelter this arrogant man enjoyed had to be removed.Evicted from the crown estate, Mr Mountbatten Windsor will now live on the king’s private property at Sandringham estate in Norfolk, at the king’s expense.Thursday’s statementasserted that royal sympathies lie with the victims of abuse, while avoiding any mention of perpetrators. In 2022,£12m was paid to Ms Giuffreon behalf of the then Prince Andrew, and the late queen is believed to have stumped up the cash. There was no admission of liability.Given all this, and the extent of Mr Mountbatten Windsor’s contacts with Epstein and the sex traffickerGhislaine Maxwell, it is unlikely that the latest attempt to move on from this sordid chapter will succeed. Nor should it. It is six years since the notorious BBC Newsnight interview that led to the then prince giving up his public duties. Ever since, outrage at his conduct and impunity has formed part of the febrile mix of emotions around the royal family.If and whenfiles relating to the cases against Epsteinare released in the US, there may be new questions to answer. One UK government minister, Chris Bryant, has already said that he would expect Mr Mountbatten Windsor tocooperate with any investigation. Ms Giuffre took her own life in April, but her family have made clear that their commitment to “accountability” for the wrongs done to her is ongoing.Other ministers have mostly stuck to a script that puts the king in charge of damage limitation. But the public accounts committee thought Mr Mountbatten Windsor’s tenancy of a royal palacerequired greater scrutiny. It may be this threat of renewed attention to royal finances that finally prompted action. It is highly unlikely that the king would welcome reforms that would increase transparency and accountability around royal funding and influence. Mr Mountbatten Windsor’s continued reliance on the public purse could have made them harder to resist.The Guardian has long been critical of the royal family, and Mr Mountbatten Windsor has come to represent everything that makes it hard to defend: entitled, venal and out of touch with the people it seeks to serve. The king has acted in an attempt to stop the slow haemorrhaging of support and credibility that his brother’s behaviour has caused. Yet this saga may not be over yet. The king’s actions may prove to be too little, too late. Recent events point to the need for a wider reset of Britain’s relationship with its royal family.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Yet it stood by as catastrophe loomedFri 31 Oct 2025 14.15 EDTLast modified on Fri 31 Oct 2025 20.13 EDTShareNo one can claim they did not know what would happen in El Fasher. An 18-month siege had already seen war crimes by the Rapid Support Forces, including the execution of civilians and sexual violence. Warnings of the massacres that would followwhen the city in Darfur fell– as it did on Sunday – were widespread.The reality was an even darker hell,in the wordsof UN officials. The World Health Organization says that the RSFkilled 460 people in one hospital. Satellite images appear to capture bloodstains on the ground. Footage showed fighters executing unarmed men. Other captives were taken for ransom. The UN says hundreds of civilians and unarmed fighters were raped or killed while trying to flee the city, with clear evidence of ethnically targeted violence. The horrors continue.The RSF grew out of the Janjaweed forces, which, unleashed by the Sudanese military government, committed genocide against non-Arab populations in Darfur two decades ago. “Never again,” the world insisted. But it has happened again. No one believes the RSF’spromises to hold fighters accountableare anything more than cosmetic. Meanwhile, the UN response plan for the world’s largest humanitarian crisis islittle more than a quarter funded.“I urge colleagues to study the world’s continued failure to stop this. Blood on the hands,” said Tom Fletcher, the UN humanitarian chief. But it is not merely that the world has stood by. Outsiders legitimised and funded the RSF’s evolution into a more powerful force, which ended up turning on the Sudanese Armed Forces, under Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, in April 2023. They have stoked the civil war for their own interests.The EUsent millions of eurosto Sudan to curb migration – with border policing put under the RSF’s charge. Hard questions are rightly being asked about why military equipment fromBritain,Canadaand elsewhere has reached Sudanese battlefields. Above all, there is anger at the United Arab Emirates’ role. The UAE angrily denies backing the RSF. Diplomats, analysts and satellite imagerysay otherwise. US intelligence agencies say itincreased arms shipments to Sudanthis year. Gold flowsin the opposite direction.Now that it controls Darfur’s major urban centres, the RSF, under Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo – known as Hemedti – is likely to intensify its campaign in Kordofan, and continue attempts to destabilise the SAF-held east of the country. Yet increasingly there appears to be a de facto partition; neither side can win, yet neither accepts that. Accordingly, the war is likely to continue as long as there are weapons to fuel it.At hisconfirmation hearing, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, told the Senate that he would raise with UAE leaders “the fact that they are openly supporting an entity that is carrying out a genocide”. Yet the US and UK have shown little appetite for pressuring the UAE to turn off the tap. The Trump family haslucrative tiesto the Gulf nation.Outrage at the atrocities in Darfur is now growing, however, in the US and beyond. The UAE itself is sensitive to scrutiny and criticism, having invested heavily in portraying itself as the stable, responsible and aspirational face of the region. It has had no reason to believe that people care enough about Sudan to affect it. But sustained public and cultural pressure might yet convince it that when Darfur is drenched in blood, Abu Dhabi too is tainted.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It might be the best chance Britons have of reckoning with the Troubles, 24 October). I enjoyed his article linking the TV show to Bloody Sunday until the penultimate line, where he argues that for Northern Ireland “the tension between justice and peace – the sacrifice of one so often the price of the other – is a living, ever-present reality”.How can these two things be in tension? Surely the very point of the Bloody Sunday campaign is that, for those affected, there can be no peace until there is justice. How canNorthern Irelandbe a just society when some are at peace while others are still fighting the war?Surely, instead, the tensions are within the concepts of peace and justice themselves. There are many forms of peace, just as there are many forms of justice. Political tensions in contemporary NorthernIrelandare more thanks to the plurality of these terms, than thanks to any tension between them.This is a society working towards fuller realisation of peace and justice. Arguments which suggest tension between these concepts, or that one need to be sacrificed to further the other, are arguments that ultimately discourage fuller realisation of them both.If there’s something that people in Northern Ireland might recognise, which others in the UK might not be able to understand, it is that working with the plurality of terms like peace and justice – and reckoning with the political tensions that this plurality engenders – is a never-ending labour of love, whose fruits (a truly plural society) will never be realised, but are always worth pursuing.Robbie GilmoreBelfastBravo to Jonathan Freedland for his article and his knowledge of the history and realities of life in Northern Ireland. He is one of a tiny number of British journalists who “gets” our part of the UK and has a clear understanding of why it is very different from the rest, and is treated very differently from the rest.Tens of thousands of people of a certain age are victims of the 30 years of the Troubles, either directly or indirectly, and the shadows of that war are still blighting the lives of many people, and will continue to do so for many years to come. Thanks to Jonathan for acknowledging that.Margaret Thatcher memorably said that Northern Ireland was “as British as Finchley”. We knew that was bollocks then, and we know it now. It has not changed one iota. It’s nice to have one journalist acknowledge that we in this part of the UK do actually matter.David CrossDungannon, County TyroneJonathan Freedland refers to “what were so understatedly called the Troubles”. It is a frequent English misconception to interpret “the Troubles” as understatement. It is not.In England the word “trouble” equates to “inconvenience”, but in Hiberno- English it means “sorrow”. The standard condolence on a bereavement is “Sorry for your troubles”.Stephen ButcherTullaghgarley, County AntrimJonathan Freedland rightly demonstrates the power of the arts to provide historical insight that might otherwise elude us. I recall watching the 1982 adaptation ofGerald Seymour’s novel Harry’s Game in my teens. It was tense, disturbing and provided an essential education.My teenage son is now asking questions about Irish history. Where to start? There has been so much tragedy that factual explanation seems horribly reductive. Drama helps young people understand and empathise, soBlue Lightsis certainly to be recommended.It would also be great to see a revival of Welsh National Opera’s poignant 2015production of Bellini’s I Puritani, directed by Annilese Miskimmon and updated to the time of the Troubles. Sadly, the historical underfunding of the company makes this an unlikely prospect, however timely it would be.Kate LoughSouthsea, HampshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

For a long time, I have hung on to them all – because of sentiment. The children do not want them, and who would want a 1945 contact lens or bottles from my great-grandfather, the drunken vet? Then there are valuable things: the grandfather clock from my husband’s family; the exquisite wool blanket and waistcoat (tatty and ripped) brought back from Afghanistan in the 1970s.Finally, at last, I am starting the Swedish death clean. It is taking time, because I really want to find the right person to take ownership of these things. I am letting go and there is huge satisfaction in finding the right home for all of these items.It has been startling how conversations lead to homes – for example, the friend of my husband who, because of his Parkinson’s, moved to an apartment. He mentioned that they would love a grandfather clock. How perfect that the family clock should go to him. A crafty friend took the Afghan blanket to repair and keep.

A detailed account of Auden’s affair with “Hugerl” was given by Charles Osborne in WH Auden: The Life of a Poet, published in 1979.Hugerl and Christa are both named by Osborne in his book. He discusses Glad, the posthumously published love poem that Auden wrote about them. Osborne writes that the poem should have been titled Sad. He also tells us that Hugerl and Christa were among the chief mourners at Auden’s funeral in 1973 – a public funeral, recorded by TV camera crews – and he provides a photograph as evidence. Their participation in the funeral reveals something about their complicated and unorthodox relationship with Auden.Osborne was an eccentric biographer, but his 1979 version of the Hugerl affair seems to be accurate. He deserves credit for his pioneering work.Prof Andrew BiswellManchester Metropolitan UniversityHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

It says the US Election Assistance Commission, which has been considering adding the requirement to the federal voter form, is permanently barred from taking action to do so.A message seeking comment from the White House was not immediately returned.The lawsuit brought by the Democratic National Committee and various civil rights groups will continue to play out to allow the judge to consider other challenges to Trump’s order.

Angelov is still at large.All four were also banned from entering French territory for life.The trial was the first of its kind inFrance, one of a series of similar crimes suspected of having been orchestrated by a foreign power with the aim to destabilise.The four defendants were not tried for acting on behalf of a foreign power: that aggravating circumstance was only added to France’s criminal code after the incident took place.However, the judges said the fact that foreign interference occurred was “indisputable”, and it had been aimed to “stir up public opinion, exploit existing divisions and further fragment French society”.The vandalism was staged during heightened tensions in France over the war between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas that broke out in October 2023.The wall daubed with red handprints lists 3,900 people honoured for protecting Jews during the Nazi occupation of France in the second world war.Several other red handprints were found in nearby areas of central Paris.The prosecutor’s office said a security agent had caught two people placing stencils on the memorial.Investigators identified them with security footage, then discovered that three had caught a bus to Belgium the next morning, then a flight to Bulgaria.The defendants present were quick to blame their absent accomplice, calling Angelov the “leader”, and denying any ideological motivation.Filipov swore he did not realise he was tagging the memorial, which is known as the “wall of the righteous”.He also rejected accusations that his recruitment was related to his apparent neo-Nazi affiliations, including having a swastika tattoo and appearing in social media posts giving Nazi salutes.He said he had left that behind, adding: “I’ve made bad choices in the past.”The Paris prosecutor’s office said the red handprint incident, possibly “orchestrated by Russian intelligence services”, was one of nine such suspected acts of foreign interference.Viginum, the French authority monitoring foreign interference online, said the red hand incident had been exploited by “actors linked to Russia” on X.Explore more on these topicsFranceEuropeRussiaAntisemitismnewsShareReuse this content"

In a statement, his family said he had died in hospital on Thursday in Bourganeuf, close to the small town of Felletin in central France, where he had lived for 25 years. They added: “The world of cinema loses one of its most incisive, inventive, and unclassifiable voices. We would like to thank all those who supported him throughout this long and sometimes solitary struggle.”Watkins was an uncompromising figure who clashed with the BBC after the latter failed to show The War Game on broadcast TV, and subsequently led a peripatetic film-making existence, looking overseas for backing. He was wary of the press. In a rare interviewhe spoke to the Guardian in 2000, saying he was “someone who has been working for 30 years to help shift the power balance between public and TV”. He added: “Had TV taken an alternative direction during the 1960s and 1970s and worked in a more open way, global society today would be vastly more humane and just.”Hate and warRead moreBorn in 1935 in Norbiton, Surrey, Watkins studied at Rada (Royal Academy of Dramatic Art) after doing national service, telling the Guardian: “I did not intend to point my rifle at a human being.” After making a series of short films, including Forgotten Faces, about the Hungarian uprising, Watkins joined theBBCin 1962 and was subsequently asked to make a film about the Battle of Culloden, “Butcher” Cumberland’s victory over Jacobite forces in 1746. Watkins’ resulting film, broadcast in 1964, was pioneering in its immediacy and sense of realism, using contemporary news techniques and non-professional actors.View image in fullscreenBattle of Culloden.Photograph: Collection Christophel/AlamyWatkins then followed it up with The War Game, another pseudo-documentary but this time about a nuclear strike on Canterbury in Kent. Described by Alex Cox, the film director, as a “great, passionate” film that gave a voice to ordinary people, The War Game had its scheduled 1965 broadcast cancelled, according tothe BBC’s response to a question in parliament, because it was “too horrifying” and denying that external pressure had been applied to remove it. However, the film went on to win the Oscar for best documentary in 1967, and received outspoken praise from US criticsincluding Roger Ebert, who described some scenes as “certainly the most horrifying ever put on film”. The War Game was eventually shown on TV in 1985, on the 40th anniversary of the nuclear attack on Hiroshima.View image in fullscreenStill from The War Game.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyAs a result of clashing with the BBC hierarchy, Watkins was forced to look elsewhere. In 1967 he directed the feature film Privilege, another pseudo-documentary with a radical bent, about a pop star (played by the real-life musician Paul Jones) who is manipulated into becoming a cult leader to keep the population distracted from politics. In 1971 hisUS-set film Punishment Parkwas another provocation, imagining a Hunger Games-type situation in which radicals and liberals are hunted for sport by the national guard.Watkins followed this with a biopic of the painter Edvard Munch, originally shown on Norwegian TV in 1974 but which was subsequently released in cinemas, and was described by the Guardian as “a four-hour film of extraordinary beauty”. Watkins would follow this with a series of films made in Scandinavia, culminating in The Freethinker, another lengthy portrait of a Scandinavian artist, the playwright August Strindberg. Alongside these, between 1983 and 1987 Watkins made the 873-minute documentary The Journey about ordinary people’s understanding of nuclear weapons; it is consideredthe longest non-experimental film ever made. Watkins’ final film was The Commune, a 345-minute recreation of the 1871 workers uprising in Paris using Brechtian-style techniques, first shown at the Musée d’Orsay in March 2000 and then screened on TV.Watkins was married twice, and is survived by two sons, Patrick and Gérard.Explore more on these topicsFilmOscarsTelevisionBBCAwards and prizesDocumentary filmsDocumentarynewsShareReuse this content"

According to ANP, D66 is likely to receive one more seat, putting the party on 27.All mainstream parties had already ruled out governing with Wilders, the anti-Islam firebrand whose PVV won 37 seats in 2023 then led a chaotic rightwing coalition that lasted less than a year before he torpedoed it in a row over his draconian immigration plans.However, while this is the end of the self-described “most rightwing government ever”, and there is a clear surge in support for centrist parties, experts said the far-right vote had simply shifted to smaller parties and trust in politics remains at just 4%..By parliamentary convention, the leader of the winning party takes the lead in a coalition-formation process. But with the fragmented result – in which many far-right voters deserted Wilders but chose the far-right JA21 and Forum for Democracy – it will be difficult to form a government.Jetten on Friday urged all mainstream parties to unite. “Voters have clearly indicated the need for cooperation,” Jetten said. “We want to find a majority that will eagerly work on issues such as the housing market, migration, climate and the economy.“Léonie de Jonge, an expert in far-right extremism at the University of Tübingen, said the clear win did not make the path ahead much easier. “D66 gets to initiate the formation of the government, but still I think the underlying message of the election is that the far right is not defeated,” she said. “I think the real challenge is moving forward, forming a government with the increasingly fragmented landscape that Dutch politics now constitutes.”Although a left-right coalition with the centrist Christian Democratic Appeal, VVD and GreenLeft-Labour would be strongest in the lower and upper chambers, the VVD leader, Dilan Yeşilgöz-Zegerius, said repeatedly during the campaign that ruling with the left was something she “did not see happening”.Jetten’s impressive debating style, clean-cut image and positive messaging won over enough voters for a historic win. “D66 managed to attract voters from all directions, drawing in both left- and right-leaning supporters,” said Matthijs Rooduijn, an expert on populism at the University of Amsterdam. “Many GreenLeft-Labour voters were dissatisfied with their own party leader but responded positively to Jetten and D66’s upbeat ‘It can be done’ campaign.“At the same time, D66’s tougher stance on immigration appealed to rightwing voters from VVD, NSC, and even PVV, making its current electorate more diverse. And more critical and negative about immigration.”Explore more on these topicsNetherlandsEuropeGeert WildersRob JettennewsShareReuse this content"

Israel said the bombings were in response to an attack in Rafah city that killed a soldier carrying out demolitions there.The ceasefire deal called for an international force to secure Gaza, reducing the risk of violence flaring in the short term and paving the way for the demilitarisation ofHamasand a full withdrawal of Israeli forces, which still occupy more than half of Gaza.View image in fullscreenMajed al-Ansari said establishing an international administration would ‘shift the whole process from war to the day after’.Photograph: Antonio Balasco/EPAGetting the international force in place fast, along with a new Palestinian administration, was critical for the fragile pause to become a more lasting peace, Ansari told the Guardian in an interview.“There is a need for the international community to go in, assess the damage, start thinking about reconstruction, working on reconstruction, and to formally keep the peace,” he said. “This is what will significantly shift the whole process from war to the day after.”The 20-point plan for Gaza’s future, which underpins the ceasefire, sidestepped basic details including the force’s mandate and membership. Qatar and regional allies want it to be backed by the UN, something the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said Washington was considering.Ansari said: “We’re very hopeful that if we are able to get a security council resolution and a mandate for an administration and an international force in Gaza, that we would be able to stabilise the situation.“In principle, a lot of the countries in the region and beyond have agreed to be part of this, but in practice that needs a very concrete mandate for the force.”Hammering out the terms of international missions is a complex diplomatic process that normally takes weeks or months, time Gaza may not be able to afford. The ceasefire is under daily pressure, with both parties trading accusations of violations.“There are a lot of challenges before we are able to dispense with stage one [of the deal],” Ansari said. “Including the difficulty of excavating the remains of those [hostages] who were killed and ascertaining their identities, and the violations that result in the death of Palestinians every day at the hands of IDF soldiers.”The bodies of 11 hostages are still in Gaza, after the remains of Amiram Cooper and Sahar Baruch were returned on Thursday.The Trump administration’s commitment is critical to the ceasefire’s success, and is evident in theconvoy of senior envoys heading to Israel, including the president’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and the vice-president, JD Vance.View image in fullscreenA view of Gaza City on Friday, where most buildings have been reduced to rubble.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images“The only thing that has always tipped the scales in the favour of ceasefire was US engagement,” Ansari said. That was true of all three agreements reached to halt fighting after 7 October, he added.Trump hailed the deal he sealed as one for the ages, although versions of it had been on the table for more than a year. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is widely reported to havebacked awayfrom a similar agreement in April 2024 in order to safeguard his coalition government, which includes far-right parties strongly opposed to ending the war.“We’ve had so many near-misses in achieving such a deal, [which leads to] a level of frustration and tiredness among the negotiators,” Ansari said. Qatar’s chief negotiator had not had more than two days off since 7 October, and the pressure of the work had led to colleagues being admitted to hospital, he added.In September, pressure on Qatari negotiators reached an unprecedented peak when Israel fired missiles at a meeting in Doha of Hamas officials gathered to discuss the US ceasefire proposal.The strikes killed a Qatari citizen and five Hamas members,blind-siding Qatar. They came in a week when mediators thought they were making progress, he said; Qatar had told Israel and the US that Hamas would be meeting to discuss the latest Trump proposal and had promised a response by Friday.Ansari said the missiles were aimed at Hamas leaders, but the timing suggested Qatar’sdiplomatic workon global conflicts was a secondary target. “It was designed to push us out, not only out of these [Gaza] talks, but to push us out as an internationally trusted mediator,” he said. “We were working on more than 10 mediations on the day of the attack.”View image in fullscreenRelatives of Palestinians, including children, killed by Israeli bombing on Tuesday, take away their bodies for burial.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesIsrael’s strike threatened decades of investment in diplomacy that was based, in part, on assurances that Doha was a safe and neutral place for enemies to meet, he said.Ansari heard and felt the missiles landing, in a residential neighbourhood dotted with embassies and international schools and near his daughter’s university. As the ground shook, his mind emptied of all thoughts except whether she was safe.“This was not an attack we could brush off and continue doing the work that we were doing,” he said. Qatar, which has nearly two decades of experience mediating between Israel and Hamas, made clear to the US that negotiations over Gaza were off until it got “serious assurances” that Israel would never strike its territories again.In the days that followed, Qatar underlined its diplomatic clout by concluding the first round of talks between Colombian factions and securing the release of an elderly British couple and an American citizen from Taliban captivity.Trump then made clear he wanted a halt to fighting in Gaza, probably with his eye on theNobel peace prize he openly covets, and forced Netanyahu to apologise to the Qataris both privately and publicly.Work resumed on the ceasefire, with Qatari diplomats focused on three key goals as they helped the warring parties agree the 20-point plan underlying the deal, Ansari said.He said the goals were, first, “ending the war, stopping the bloodshed”, and second, “making sure that there is no annexation or occupation as a result of anything happening on the ground”. Finally, the aim was to make sure there was no displacement of Palestinians from Gaza, he said. “We checked all these three boxes in the final document.”However, even if Trump ensures the ceasefire holds, turning his loose framework for Gaza’s future into reality on the ground will be a long and difficult process. And the plan makes only the vaguest commitment towards a future of Palestinian self-rule and sovereignty, which Netanyahu’s government has repeatedly and strongly opposed.Explore more on these topicsGazaQatarIsraelIsrael-Gaza warHamasMiddle East and north AfricaUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

Trump has called the climate crisis a “hoax” and a “con job” and has said the US will withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, which calls for countries to limit the dangerous global temperature rise.“The Green New Scam would have killed America if President Trump had not been elected to implement his commonsense energy agenda – which is focused on utilizing the liquid gold under our feet to strengthen our grid stability and drive down costs for American families and businesses,” Taylor Rogers, a White House spokeswoman, said in a statement to the Guardian.The “scam” reference relates to the climate policies of Joe Biden.“President Trump will not jeopardize our country’s economic and national security to pursue vague climate goals that are killing other countries,” she added.Earlier this year, the US state department shuttered the office that typically deals with climate issues. The position of climate envoy, which operated under Biden, has also been scrapped.Ex-EPA head urges US to resist Trump attacks on climate action: ‘We won’t become numb’Read moreIn jettisoning multilateral talks with other countries, the White House has favored an approach whereby Trump strikes deals directly with individual countries.In recent months, the US president has secured agreements from the European Union, to purchase $750bn in American oil and gas, as well as countries such as Japan and South Korea to develop rare earth materials, nuclear power and fossil fuel projects.Trump has also urged other countries to shift away from renewable energy. “If you don’t get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail,” the presidenttold leaders at a UN speech last month. “You need strong borders and traditional energy sources if you are going to be great again.”The lack of US presence at the Belém talks is a further complication to a summit that already appears troubled.Countries are meant to submit updated plans to slash planet-heating emissions at the gatheringbut the vast majority have yet to do so, while many delegates are struggling to secure accommodation in time to attend the talks in the city, which acts as a gateway to the Amazon river.“The president has made it clear he wants to withdraw from the Paris agreement so it doesn’t surprise me they aren’t sending anyone because they aren’t engaged in this,” said Todd Stern, a former lead climate negotiator for the US during Barack Obama’s presidency.“I don’t think they would add anything useful. This is a much more aggressive administration now, across the board. I think the great majority of countries aren’t going to pay attention to that, they know climate change is real, you just have to look out of the window to see it is getting worse.”An assortment of US governors, members of Congress, mayors and activists will be attending theCop30summit, with the message that subnational American jurisdictions are still pressing ahead with climate action.But they have been given no support from the US government in doing so. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democratic senator from Rhode Island, said on Thursday that he had been told “they weren’t even going to send embassy support for the US delegation, which is a fairly standard courtesy for those of us that did go”.“So at this point, I don’t think there’s any sign of [the administration attending], but who knows? This is a very mercurial administration. They can decide at the last minute to send a plane to Belém full of climate deniers and fossil fuel operatives.”One former senior state department official, speaking anonymously, said that it was preferable that the US not attend the talks so that other countries can strike a stronger climate agreement.“If the choice is no US or a US that is there as a spoiler, to wreck and disrupt things, then I think most countries would prefer there to be no US,” the former official said.Explore more on these topicsCop30Trump administrationClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

It scares the shit out of me. The ignorance, the hubris, the lies, the perfidy. [Trump] knows better, but he’s an instrument of the status quo and he’s making money, hand over fist, while the world goes to hell in a handbasket.”The legendaryStar WarsandIndiana Jonesactor, who is 83, added: “It’s unbelievable. I don’t know of a greater criminal in history.”In his second term as president, Trump has set about dismantlingclimateand clean airprotections,haltedclean energy projects, urged oil and gas companies to “drill, baby, drill” for the fossil fuels that are overheating the planet,firedhundreds of scientists whiledeleting their work, and evenbannedmentions of “climate change” and “emissions” within government.Trump’s hatred for renewables means the US is falling behind the rest of the worldRead moreTrump, who has again withdrawn the US from the Paris climate deal, has also targeted other countries’ climate policies, pressing the UK to tear down its “ugly” wind turbines in favor of more oil drilling anddemandingthat the European Union roll back its climate rules and purchase more American oil and gas.Climate change was “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world”, Trump saidduring a speech to the United Nations last month. “If you don’t get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail. You need strong borders and traditional energy sources if you are going to be great again.”Ford, a longtimeenvironmentaladvocate, said Trump’s dislike of wind turbines was because “he has just not seen a gold one” and that the president’s legacy on the climate crisis would be “a clear expression of ignorance, of hubris and purposeful subterfuge”.The world – including the US, the second largest carbon polluter –continues to lagin the effort to slash planet-heating emissions to curb the sort of disaster suffered this week by Jamaica, which has been lashed by a category 5 hurricane that scientists say was probably accelerated by a warmer atmosphere and ocean.Earlier this year, Ford himself had to be evacuated fromenormous wildfiresthat engulfed parts of Los Angeles (and were mademore likelydue to global heating), although his home in Brentwood was spared destruction, unlike those ofmany other celebrities.Rising global temperatures are wreaking havoc beyond spectacular disasters such as Hurricane Melissa and the LA fires, too,with a major study this week findingthat excess heat is now killing one person a minute around the world.“I knew it was coming, I have been preaching this stuff for 30 years,” Ford said of these climate-fueled disasters. “Everything we’ve said about climate change has come true. Why is that not sufficient that it alarms people that they change behaviors? Because of the entrenched status quo.”However, the world is increasingly embracing cleaner forms of energy, albeit at a slower pace than required to stave off escalating climate impacts, and Ford said he was hopeful that Trump’s fossil fuel-dominated vision would not prevail.“He’s losing ground because everything he says is a lie,” Ford said. “I’m confident we can mitigate against [climate change], that we can buy time to change behaviors, to create new technologies, to concentrate more fully on implementation of those policies.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump takes his ‘drill, baby, drill’ message on the campaign trail in October 2024 in Oaks, Pennsylvania.Photograph: Alex Brandon/AP“But we have to develop the political will and intellectual sophistication to realize that we human beings are capable of change. We are incredibly adaptive, we are incredibly inventive. If we concentrate on a problem we can fix it most times.”Ford spoke to the Guardian shortly before he was given a conservation leadership award at a ceremony at Chicago’s Field Museum on Wednesday evening. The award was bestowed by the foundation of the late biologist EO Wilson, who coined the term “biodiversity”. Wilson, a myrmecologist, became friends with Ford after they worked on conservation campaigns together and named a species ofantafter the actor.Wilson proposed that half of the planet be protected for nature, to stem ruinous losses to species and ecosystems, an initiative that his foundation, and Ford,continue to support. Worldwide, more than 100 countries have pledged a more modest 30% of land and seas to be preserved by 2030, and although progress has been made in the past year, barely half of this goal has been met,a new report by Wilson’s foundation shows.“We are teetering on the edge,” Ford said of the ongoing loss of nature via deforestation, pollution and other human-caused destruction.“Indigenous people are the stewards of much of the remaining standing forests and contain the hope that these precious places can be preserved. The science has proved the value in their preservation but that does not keep them from encroachment, and the protection they are granted is tenuous in some of the countries these assets exist in.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisHarrison FordDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Miteni closed down in 2018 afterone of the worst environmental scandalsin the country’s recent history: after decades of producingPfas forever chemicals, the company’s management was brought to trial for contaminating water resources in an area where 350,000 people live. In June,its former executives were found guiltyat the Vicenza court of assizes of causing environmental pollution and other charges and given prison sentences, which they are expected to appeal against.What are PFAS, how toxic are they and how do you become exposed?Read moreAnd yet, all of the company’s equipment, its patents and processes – everything needed to producePfas– is now here in Lote Parshuram MIDC, a vast industrial enclave almost 4,000 miles away, wedged between villages and groves of trees. And the factory has just started to produce forever chemicals again.View image in fullscreenThe silos of now-shuttered Miteni factory, a chemical plant accused of knowingly contaminating the water of hundreds of thousands of people in Trissino, near Vicenza, northern Italy on February 6, 2025.Photograph: Marco Bertorello/AFP/Getty ImagesOnce known for its specialism in developing processes for advanced chemicals, Miteni is now infamous for the toxic legacy it left behind. In 2011, scientists found extraordinarily high concentrations of Pfas in the plant’s wastewater. Hundreds of thousands of residents had been exposed through drinking water.The worst-affected were Miteni’s own workers. Ilario Ermetti, 69, who worked for decades in its fluorinated chemical department, showed one of the highest concentrations of Pfas ever recorded in human blood. “When the story came to light, I looked at a list of medical conditions related to Pfas, and found out I had them all,” says Ermetti.High levels of Pfas in the blood are associated with increased risk of cancer, cardiovascular diseases, liver and kidney damage, reproductive disorders and more. Ermetti is currently recovering from a recent surgical operation.View image in fullscreenFormer Miteni worker Ilario Ermetti showed a high concentration of Pfas in his blood.Photograph: Filippo TommasoliMichela Piccoli, 51, a nurse and activist withMamme No Pfas(Mothers Against Pfas), started organising after discovering her children’s blood showed high levels of forever chemicals. When she learned that Miteni’s patents and equipment were being sent to India, she was shocked.“As mothers, as women, our concern has grown,” she said. “Because our children are everyone’s children.”After Miteni went bankrupt, its assets were bought in 2019 by Viva Lifesciences, a subsidiary of the Indian chemical company Laxmi Organic Industries – the only bidder in the public auction. By early 2023, all the equipment was travelling on freight ships, heading to Mumbai. Meanwhile, Laxmi was boasting of its new acquisition to investors. Transcripts of shareholders’ meetings show that Laxmi’s management downplayed environmental concerns, with its president, Harshvardhan Goenka, stating that Miteni was “doing everything legally according to European standards”.Goenka is one of the three men on the board of Laxmi OrganicItaly, a company founded in 2021. Another is Antonio Nardone, the last chief executive of Miteni, who was found guilty of environmental pollution and false accounting at the June trial and sentenced to six years and four months in prison. According to a former mid-level manager speaking on condition of anonymity, Nardone was taking business trips to India months before the company went bankrupt.While Laxmi bought Miteni’s assets in June 2019, the environmental assessment report for the construction of the factory in Lote shows that in March 2018 the company was already planning to start producing fluorochemicals compatible with Miteni’s product list. Laxmi Organic Industries did not respond to requests for comment.By 2021, Laxmi’s strategy explicitly spelled out the goal to “capture [the] market share of Miteni” and become a leader in the production of Pfas and fluorochemicals. Shipping records show that, to get approval on the quality of the chemicals, in 2024 Laxmi started sending out samples to companies with past business relationships with Miteni, including BASF, Chemours, DuPont and FMC.Since early 2025, Laxmi’s site in Lote Parshuram has been fully operational, producing chemicals that will be used in pesticides, pharmaceuticals, dyes, cosmetics and other products.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

But although international attention is growing, in India the issue is not on the political agenda yet.“If we look at the regulations, [Pfas] is not present in those standards. It’s not recognised by the Indian government as of today,” said Rajneesh Gautam, an environmental chemist at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences. “Independent research groups across India have conducted studies in different states. But these studies are limited in scope, and there are still very few of them.”Parineeta Dandekar, coordinator of the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers, and People, says the Lote Parshuram industrial district “has a dismal environmental track record”. After it was established in 1986, “the livelihood of fisher folk communities in this region completely collapsed,” she said.The chemical district is served by a centralised wastewater treatment plant that has been at the forefront of complaints.“The local villages have always stated that it’s not working properly,” said Dandekar. “When there is no electricity, a common occurrence in rural Maharashtra state, the plant cannot function and industries release polluted water directly into the streams.” Environmental authorities have sent several warning letters to the plant in recent years.In the EU, the European Chemical Agency is examining a proposal to ban the manufacture, import and use of more than 10,000 forever chemicals. This attention may be driving the sector to the global south, according to Claudia Marcolungo, a professor of environmental law at the University of Padua. “I believe that this issue should be investigated, because the fact that Miteni’s production, patents and machinery have been transferred to a country like India should lead us to reflect, at the very least, on the power that these multinationals have to relocate in countries where there is clearly a race to the bottom in terms of environmental protection.”Miteni has closed down, but the company’s toxic legacy lives on – at the contaminated site in Vicenza, and in Lote. The health impacts linked to Pfas production are likely to affect communities that are already struggling with an unsafe environment for generations.“That region has seen enough environmental destruction already,” says Dandekar. “If more dangerous companies move in, it’s always a risk.”This investigation was supported by Journalismfund Europe and IJ4EUExplore more on these topicsPfasIndiaItalyChemical industryPollutionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

L RootFri 31 Oct 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 31 Oct 2025 12.53 EDTShareSitting at the bottom of the Gulf ofThailandabout 20 metres below the ocean surface is the HTMS Hanhak Sattru. Snappers, yellowtail fusiliers and bannerfish swim through the ship’s corridors,while barnacles, algae and young coral cling to the iron ladders and machine-gun on deck. Nearby is another wreck, the HTMS SuphairinBoth were intentionally submerged by the Royal Thai Navy in 2023 to create artificial reefs and dive sites. Their planned scuttling has enabled marine scientists to produce some of the first research on how much shipwrecks change the marine environment.There is already plenty of existingresearchthat shows that shipwrecks create a new ecosystem. But whether they pull fish from natural reefs or promote production of new fish (known as theattraction-pollution hypothesis) has historically been hard to say.“It’s hard to get that information from shipwrecks because the majority of them have gone down by accident,” explained Piers Baillie, the founder and director of the marine research centre Global Reef, located on the holiday island of Koh Tao. In this case, however, working with the navy and department of marine and coastal resources, Global Reef was able to collect data before and after HTMS Hanhak Sattru and HTMS Suphairin were sent to the bottom of the ocean.View image in fullscreenShipwrecks provide habitats to valuable and potentially threatened species, says Piers Baillie of Global Reef.Photograph: Piers Baillie/Global ReefEarly data, according to Baillie, shows that the wrecks have attracted fish from natural reefs and created a habitat for new ones to reproduce, including those that areendangered. “Like anything in science, there’s a slightly nuanced approach to things where we’ve seen potential evidence to support strongly the attraction side of the hypothesis. However, we’re also seeing that there are these juveniles arriving at the shipwrecks.”This is important because if fish are reproducing on the wreck that means they can be used as a tool to boost fish stocks in a context where numbers are depleting owing to climate change and overtourism. If the wreck is pulling fish away from a natural reef, that may have consequences for nearby natural reefs’ ecosystems, but it could also offer species a level of protection from fishing. These shipwrecks – along with a handful of others purposely sunk in the country – are popular dive sites and the presence of dive boats acts as a deterrent to fishers, he explained, while commercial vessels are unable to trawl a shipwreck.Shipwrecks already offer an alternative spot for divers to explore, reducing the pressure on natural reefs, according to Iain Suthers, professor at the School of Biological, Earth & Environmental Sciences at the University of New South Wales.Many reefs are succumbing towarming ocean temperatures, physicaldamagefrom boats, and coraldiseases. Several species that live in the clear waters of Koh Tao, such asstingrays,groupersandbamboo sharks, are also endangered. But here, in one of the most popular dive sites globally, is some of Thailand’sworstunderwater damage. More than500,000 touristsa year arrive on the country’s wooden dock, many of whom are eager to spend their days in the sea with one of the island’s 80-plus dive schools, spotting whale sharks, turtles and sweet lips. Their presence puts the natural ecosystem in danger.“We need to have a tourism industry that can see and harvest fish. We need to have these sorts of structures to improve the fishery,” Suthers said. “I think the future is in these areas of the ocean – less than 200 metres deep, such as the Gulf of Thailand – to use [artificial reefs] to facilitate the fish to harvest.”View image in fullscreenShipwrecks are popular dive sites and the presence of dive boats acts as a deterrent to fishers.Photograph: Piers Baillie/Global ReefThe country has been installing different types of artificial reefs since the1970sand has scattered thousands of structures, including other ships, along Thailand’s two main coastlines. “There’s been a lot of proactivity in terms of trying to pursue best practices for coral conservation, whether it’s active restoration [or] habitat creation, more than any other country that I have worked in or seen or even learned about,” said Dr Rahul Mehrotra, research director at Aow Thai Marine Ecology Center. Thailand has committed to the international conservation goal of protecting 30% of the world’s land and ocean by 2030 while also looking for ways to safeguard its own marine ecosystems, in part because of the tourism revenue they generate.Shipwrecks, with their nooks, passageways and air of mystery, are a way of potentially protecting them. “Artificial reefs and particularly shipwrecks are providing habitats to these valuable, heavily targeted potentially threatened species,” said Baillie whose team of six scientists and around 16 interns spends its days wetsuit-clad, oxygen tanks in tow and research questions at the ready.That such research is being supported by the government is significant, said Mehrotra. “It’s refreshing, as a conservationist and now as an ecologist, to see officials behind the nation seeming to take the future needs of the marine ecosystem seriously.” He believes that’s because of the Buddhist country’s spiritual, religious and cultural relationship with wildlife. “Its relationship with the sea and its relationship with wildlife is deeply ingrained in the identity of Thailand,” said Mehrotra. “It seems to come from an earnest place of ‘we must protect and we must understand.’ That is incredibly refreshing to find.”Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentThe alternativesFishMarine lifeThailandOceansAsia PacificfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The cotton trunks will offer “a subtle lift and enhanced fit through clever, discreet design”.How subtle the lift is presumably depends on the wearer. The pants are being launched on Friday evening by the influencers Tom Sheard andStanley Dru, who said: “Size isn’t everything, but confidence is.”For some, the product will bring to mind the codpiece, the accessory that anybody who was anybody was wearing in 15th- and 16th-century Europe.The idea was that itcovered and drew attentionto a part of the body that people were not meant to mention.View image in fullscreenM&S says the new pants offer a discreet boost and unbeatable comfort.Photograph: M&SHenry VIII – someone for whom size probably was everything – was depicted with a particularly impressive example in several portraits, including the larger-than-lifeHolbein the Younger drawingnow at the National Portrait Gallery.Historians have argued that Henry was weaponising his codpiece, creating afeeling of envyin enemies and subjects.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It cost £620 to remove the powder and there was no lasting damage.‘No regrets’: activists who sprayed Stonehenge orange proud of ‘magic trick’Read moreThe three faced charges including causing a public nuisance, which has a maximum jail of 10 years.The law has been widely criticisedas an attack on the right to protest.During his summing up, Judge Dugdale said that to find the three guilty, the jury would have had to be satisfied a conviction would be a proportionate interference in their rights to freedom of expression and protest.He said: “If individuals disagree with what our government is doing on certain matters they are entitled to protest.“For any of the defendants to be convicted, you have to be sure not just that they had committed the elements of the offence but you also have to be sure that a conviction … would be a proportionate interference with their human rights to express their opinions and protest against government inaction.”The prosecution argued the protest did not need to take place atStonehenge, which it said had no connection with the climate emergency.Naidu, who describes himself as a campaigner for human rights, social justice and peace; Lynch, a University of Exeter ecology student; and Watson, a carpenter, denied damaging an ancient protected monument and causing a public nuisance.Other protesters and lawyers have been watching the case keenly, especially the use of the public nuisance legislation.Speaking outside court, Naidu said: “It’s highly repressive legislation, it’s retrogressive, it’s going back to the times of the suffragettes when women were being treated appallingly, having their human rights violated. We’re going back to those times.”All three said they were proud of the action and one another. Naidu said: “I feel privileged to be with people like this. They are people of great integrity. I’m very proud to be part of this and blessed.”Thanking the jury, the judge said it had been an important case, with issues about freedom of expression and the right to protest at the centre of it.He said: “This was an important decision for the issues about the right to protest, the right to freedom of speech compared to the right of a world heritage site to sit unmolested by members of the public. It’s a difficult one to gauge.”The judge said for centuries juries had been asked to decide on allegations of serious crime in their communities. “It’s people from the community chosen at random who should decide if someone has committed that offence or not. There’s 12 of you, each of you brings something completely different to the decision-making process so we have a good cross-section of society.”The jury said they wanted to flag up the “brave and selfless” actions of a worker at the site, Man Chu Zah, who tried to intervene in the protest. The judge said he would recommend the worker for a high sheriff’s award.Francesca Cociani, criminal defence lawyer at Hodge Jones & Allen who represented the protesters, said: “My clients are incredibly relieved by today’s verdict that exonerated them of any wrongdoing.“The public nuisance charge in this case, which argued their protest could have caused serious distress, annoyance or inconvenience to the public, was wholly inadequate and in our view, should never have been bought and amounted to an affront to their right to protest.“It is a relief that the jury has decided to uphold the right to peaceful protest. It is a right that has long been, and should remain, an essential pillar of our democratic society but we are seeing time and time again that this right is being eroded.”Explore more on these topicsJust Stop OilEnvironmental activismStonehengeActivismCrimeProtestClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

A pair of cowboy boots, given to Starmer’s wife, Victoria, by the Trumps has also been held by the department.Under government rules, ministers cannot keep official gifts worth more than £140 unless they pay the difference between £140 and the gift’s value. The value of the necklace has not been disclosed, and Downing Street declined to give details.During the state visit, in which the Trumps were hosted at Windsor Castle, Starmer gave the president a ministerial red box embossed with the presidential seal and title, and the first lady a silk scarf designed by Ukrainian children.Though largely symbolic, the gifts exchanged between prime ministers and US presidents have triggered controversy in the past.When Gordon Brown visited Washington in 2009, he presented Barack Obama with an ornamental pen holder crafted from the timbers of the anti-slavery ship HMS Gannet. Obama’s comparatively generic gift to Brown,a DVD box set of 25 classic American films, was seen as a diplomatic blunder.View image in fullscreenGordon Brown meets Barack Obama in Washington in 2008.Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/ReutersNo world leader is likely to match the gift that Qatar gave to Trump –a $400m (£305m) luxury Boeing 747to serve as the new Air Force One – which has generated huge backlash in the US.Trump has so far avoided controversy over his own gift choices, though he has been accused of giving people fake jewellery before he entered politics.

We are the party of the left, and we have to build. And we’re starting from very humble beginnings. But this isn’t a three-, four-year project. This is a 10-20-30-40-year project.”She agreed the new party was not just one of protest. “I’m in politics because of a desire to change people’s lives for the better and that means winning state power,” she said.“That means actually running government. That means nationalising. That means building council homes, that means providing people with the good, secure jobs that they deserve.“All of those things mean winning power, and that’s what I’m committed to, but that will take building a party, organising, knocking on millions of doors, and articulating our politics.”Your Party has suffered a turbulent start, hit byrows over leadership, funds and its name, which will be permanently settled at a conference next month.Most recently, it emerged this week that the party waspreparing legal action against a group of its own foundersafter a final deadline to hand over at least £800,000 in donations passed without payment.In September, relations between Sultana and the party’s fellow founder, Jeremy Corbyn, hit a low with Sultanathreatening to hire defamation lawyersafter a row over the launch of a paid membership system. The pair later said they had reconciled and likened themselves to thenotoriously volatile Gallagher brothers.Robinson asked Sultana if she thought Nigel Farage, the leader of Reform UK, which is polling ahead of Labour, is a fascist.“Well, I think the way that him and his colleagues have behaved in parliament, where they are voting against trade union rights, where they are committed to peddle racism to attack our rights, I do think he has all the features of a fascist politician, and I think it’s important that we stop a fascist Reform government,” she said.“He’s a danger,” she added.In response, a Reform UK spokesperson told the podcast Sultana “should go back to school or buy herself a dictionary”.Explore more on these topicsZarah SultanaLabourJeremy CorbynnewsShareReuse this content"

Added to figures from other places around the country, the overall figure is around 700,” he said.He added that the toll could be much higher because killings could be happening during a night-time curfew that was imposed from Wednesday.A security source told AFP there had been reports of more than 500 dead, “maybe 700-800 in the whole country”.Amnesty International said it had received information that at least 100 people had been killed.Kitoka said Chadema’s numbers had been gathered by a network of party members going to hospitals and health clinics and “counting dead bodies”.He demanded that the government “stop killing our protesters” and called for a transitional government to pave the way for free and fair elections. “Stop police brutality. Respect the will of the people which is electoral justice,” Kitoka said.The Guardian has approached the government for comment.View image in fullscreenPeople hold rubber bullets and teargas canisters after a post-election protest.Photograph: Thomas Mukoya/ReutersTanzanians went to the polls on Wednesday in an election in which President Samia Suluhu Hassan was expected to strengthen her grip on the country amid rapidly intensifying repression and the exclusion of key opponents from the presidential contest.In April, Tundu Lissu, the vice-chair of Chadema, wasarrested and charged with treason and cybercrime offences. His party, which had led calls for a boycott of the election unless electoral systems were reformed, was later disqualified from participating.Last month, Luhaga Mpina, the leader of ACT-Wazalendo, another opposition party, was also disqualified, meaning Hassan will contest only lesser-known opponents from minor parties.Government critics were also abducted and arrested in the run-up to the election.Since Wednesday, huge crowds of protesters have attacked police and destroyed property belonging to businesses connected to the ruling party.The demonstrations were focused mainly in the port city of Dar es Salaam but have since spread across the country.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Abu Lulu, a commander in the RSF, featured in numerous videos that emerged after Sunday’s attack on El Fasher of fighters executing people in civilian clothing.Sudan’s brutal civil war – what has happened in El Fasher?Read more“The detention of Abu Lulu appears to be a PR stunt to deflect global anger and shift attention away from the militia’s responsibility for this massacre,” said Mohamed Suliman, a Sudanese researcher and writer based in Boston. “However, many Sudanese did not buy into this and launched a hashtag: ‘You are all Abu Lulu’ – meaning the entire militia acts like him.”Since the fighter’s arrest, images have been shared on social media of various RSF leaders, including the chief, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, as well as politicians considered to be linked to him, with the name Abu Lulu written underneath each of their faces.Open-source investigators theCentre for Information Resiliencesaid they had verified images that showed Hemedti’s brother and deputy, Abdul Rahim Dagalo, was present in El Fasher during the attacks.Hala al-Karib, a prominent Sudanese activist focusing on violence against women with the Strategic Initiative for Women in the Horn ofAfrica, said the focus on arresting one man was a “painful joke” intended to deflect from the scale of the violence inflicted by RSF forces in El Fasher and elsewhere.“There is absence of accountability and indifference to our humanity. Hundreds of thousands of Sudanese have perished daily, and young girls and women have been ruthlessly raped during the past three years. Still, all they do is try to silence our suffering,” she said.mapKarib said the RSF could not be trusted to investigate itself, saying it had not changed since its origins as a collection of ethnic-based militias known as the Janjaweed, who carried out massacres inDarfurduring the 2000s on behalf of the Sudanese government.A civil war between the RSF and the Sudanese army began in April 2023 after a power struggle between the two forces and the conflict quickly spread across the country.Karib said that when the former president Omar al-Bashir was imprisoned after being ousted during protests in 2019, the military-led transitional government that took power was not trusted internationally to hold Bashir accountable for crimes committed in Darfur during the 2000s and there was pressure to hand him over to the international criminal court, where he faced charges of genocide.El Fasher mapKarib said: “The international community did not trust the Sudanese government during the transition to prosecute al-Bashir. You want us to give RSF/Janjaweed credibility? This is a mockery.”Shayna Lewis, a Sudan specialist at Preventing and Ending Mass Atrocities, which works closely with Sudanese civil society, said previous investigations the RSF had claimed it would launch after serious violations had not resulted in any form of accountability.“This tactic by the RSF is a diversion,” she said. “They’re attempting to show that the massacres on the ground are the work of a few rogue soldiers rather than a systematic policy of genocide, which we have seen since the very earliest days of the war, committed by the RSF, particularly in Darfur. These claims of accountability run hollow. It’s a farce.”The UN human rights office spokesperson, Seif Magango, told reporters in Geneva on Friday that hundreds of civilians and unarmed fighters could have been killed while trying to leave El Fasher.He said: “Witnesses confirm RSF personnel selected women and girls and raped them at gunpoint, forcing the remaining displaced persons – around 100 families – to leave the location amid shooting and intimidation of older residents.”View image in fullscreenAid groups have said the children and families arriving in displacement camps from El Fasher require urgent medical help.Photograph: Mohammed Jammal/APA survivor from El Fasher, who spoke to reporters at a press conference organised by SIHA, said the RSF attacked with heavy artillery while its fighters shot at civilians and looted their homes.“Some of my brothers were killed in front of me. I don’t where my mother or father are, I don’t know where my little sister is,” he said.He said he managed to escape El Fasher in the evening but saw corpses of civilians lying along the side of the route to Tawila. Some had track marks from where cars had driven over them. “There was another group of civilians behind us but they were taken by the RSF. They were tortured, whipped and vehicles rolled over them. The RSF are merciless,” he said.The World Health Organization confirmed reports that at least 460 patients were killed in several attacks on the Saudi maternity hospital in El Fasher.A spokesperson, Christian Lindmeier, said six health care workers were taken in the first attack on the hospital. Soldiers then returned twice and “finished off what was still standing, including other people sheltering in hospital”.According to the International Organization for Migration, more than 60,000 people were displaced from El Fasher and nearby areas between 26 and 29 October.There is concern about the fate of tens of thousands of people afterMédecins Sans Frontières(MSF) raised alarm about only a few thousand arriving in the Tawila displacement camp west of El Fasher, which has previously been a key destination for displaced people in the area.“[The arrivals are] far fewer than the 250,000 civilians estimated to be in El Fasher until last month. Reports from those who fled, as well as credible sources, indicate mass killings, indiscriminate violence and ethnic targeting inside the city and on the roads to escape it,” MSF said.View image in fullscreenPeople who have fled El Fasher gather at a camp in Tawila, Sudan.Photograph: Mohammed Abaker/APMSF added that 100% of children under five, who are all being screened as they arrived, were malnourished.“They are victims of torture, gunshots on the road, travelling by night, they were forced in El Fasher to eat animal feed, which has caused really bad abdominal problems, especially in children,” said Giulia Chiopris, an MSF paediatrician in Tawila. “Our surgical teams are working non-stop.”An activist who fled to Tawila after the RSF’s attack on the Zamzam displacement camp in April said those who had arrived had to walk for at least two days. “Many men were killed and some women were tortured,” he said. “Everyone is ill or injured.”Sudanese civil society groups have reported that displaced families are also arrivingin nearby villages in north Darfur.Explore more on these topicsSudanAfricaDarfurMiddle East and north AfricaWar crimesMédecins Sans FrontièresnewsShareReuse this content"

Woody Allen comes out fightingRead moreThe director, who recentlypublished his debut novel, is believed to have struggled to source large-scale financing for his films amid theresurfacingin 2014 of an accusation that he sexually abused his daughter Dylan Farrow in 1992.The claim, which Allen hasconsistently denied, was originally made in the midst of a custody battle between Allen and Mia Farrow over Dylan and her brother, Ronan, was the subject of two investigations, which resulted in no charges being brought.The Madrid regional government evidently believes that buying into the director’s name and legacy will pay considerable dividends. “Woody Allen is one of the most multifaceted contemporary artists in the cinematic landscape, and has shaped one of the most original and highly regarded styles in film-making,” the government said in a document published online this week.View image in fullscreenRebecca Hall, Patricia Clarkson and Scarlett Johansson in Vicky Cristina Barcelona which also received €1.5m in funding from Barcelona city council and the Catalan regional government.Photograph: Allstar“An audiovisual project with the characteristics of Woody Allen’s works, a director and producer of international renown and prestige, whose feature films are shown on screens worldwide (cinema and streaming platforms), offers excellent potential for impact and constitutes an ideal channel for promoting the Community of Madrid as a tourist destination.”It noted that some of Allen’s previous works, “with similar characteristics to [this] project”, had achieved box office figures of more than $150m (£114.5m).Details of the contract, which have also been posted online, show that the €1.5m stake will be paid in three instalments between this year and 2027, and also reveal a clause stipulating that “the final title of the film must include the word Madrid”.The contract goes on to require that some of the payments will be contingent on the film premiering at “the Berlin film festival or a festival of similar international prestige”. It also says the project “will have to reflect the Madrid region in an easily recognisable way, with a small amount of the running time allowing for the visualisation of identifiable and recognisable spaces and locations”. The forthcoming film is referred to throughout as Wasp 2026, an acronym for Woody Allen Summer Project 2026.The deal is not unprecedented: Barcelona city council and the Catalan regional governmentinvested a total of €1.5m in Allen’s 2008 film, Vicky Cristina Barcelona, which starred Javier Bardem, Penélope Cruz, Scarlett Johansson and Rebecca Hall.“The filming represents a wonderful advertising campaign,” a spokesperson for the regional government said at the time. “It’s an excellent advert; since news broke that the film would be made in Barcelona, it’s been in newspapers all around the world.”The Madrid region, which is run by the rightwing, populist president, Isabel Díaz Ayuso, may not have the cinematic cachet of Paris, London or New York, but it has long been immortalised in the films of Pedro Almodóvar, who moved to the Spanish capital in the late 1960s.Last year the city held an exhibition celebrating its central place in Almodóvar’s work, titled,Madrid, Almodóvar Girl. “I grew up, I had fun, I suffered, I got fat and I flourished in Madrid,” the director has said. “And I was doing a lot of those things at the same time the city was.”Explore more on these topicsFilmWoody AllenSpainEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Now is a time for courage … If you sit there with someone who saysAdolf Hitlerwas very, very cool and their mission is to combat and defeat ‘global Jewry’, and you say nothing, then you are a coward, and you are complicit in that evil.”Extremists exploit political ‘trigger events’ to recruit people online, says studyRead moreCruz also said he had seen more antisemitism on the right in the last six months than he had seen in his entire life, claiming it was a “poison” and that the party and the country were “facing an existential crisis”.In recent weeks, reporting revealed that a group chat of young Republicansincludeda host of antisemitic comments, and texts revealed a Trump nominee – since withdrawn – whosaidhe had a “Nazi streak”.Fuentes went further on his views in a video after the podcast. “Do us all a favor,” he said. “We are done with the Jewish oligarchy. We are done with the slavish surrender to Israel, the wars, the foreign aid, the policing of antisemitism, the Holocaust religion and propaganda.”In hisvideoresponse to the podcast and to speculation that the Heritage Foundation would distance itself from Carlson, Roberts said that Christians can critique Israel without being antisemitic, and that conservatives didn’t need to “reflexively support any foreign government, no matter how loud the pressure becomes from the globalist class or from their mouthpieces in Washington”. He decried any attempts to cancel or silence Carlson and Fuentes, calling those speaking out against Carlson a “venomous coalition”.“The American people expect us to be focusing on our political adversaries on the left, not attacking our friends on the right,” Roberts said. “I disagree with, even abhor, things that Nick Fuentes says, but canceling him is not the answer either. When we disagree with a person’s thoughts and opinions, we challenge those ideas in debate.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Washington Free Beacon summed up Roberts’s take in its headline: “Heritage Foundation President: ‘Don’t Cancel Nick Fuentes,’ as Stalin Fan Fuentes Tells Jews to ‘Get The F— Out of America’.”The National Review’s Jim Geraghtywrote: “Really, Kevin Roberts?

One of the UK’s largest clothing retailers is shrugging off its rather dull image and spreading its wings internationally, even as many high street rivals suffer.You may think of Next as a place to buy reliable work clothes, a nice cushion or to kit out the kids – it is the UK’s biggest children’s clothing seller. However, it has quietly been morphing into something much bigger.Its shop on London’s Oxford Street tells some of the story – it houses not only a giant kids clothing department, but a big men’s suiting section and womenswear. Many of the parents shopping there appear to be waiting for teenage daughters who are thronging the Victoria’s Secret section upstairs and the neighbouring Bath & Body Works and Gap stores.We can expect to see an even broader range of labels appear within Next stores as, over the past five years, it has snapped up brands from Cath Kidston and FatFace to furniture group Made. It alsocontrols the UK rights to distribution of Victoria’s Secret, Bath & Body Works and Gap through joint ventures with their US parent groups. It is already selling these brands online.Profit upgrade at Next raises hopes UK shoppers still keen to spendRead moreUnder its leader, Simon Wolfson, known for producing chunky financial reports that give his detailed views on the economy as well as the Next’s performance, the company has also taken majority stakes in the UK brands Reiss and Joules, as well as smaller investments in the sofa maker Swoon, outdoorwear brand Sealskinz and quirky homeware label Rockett St George. Next has also built a plethora of licence deals, including Ted Baker, AllSaints kids ranges and Laura Ashley homeware and fashion.Last year sales of non-Next brands online in the UK topped £1bn, up from £434m five years ago and more than 40% of the business’s online sales. Overseas, non-Next products made up a fifth of the group’s £930m international sales last year.Richard Chamberlain, a retail analyst at RBC Capital Markets, says that more effort on design, quality and marketing has also helped improve the appeal of the Next brand, and some of its smaller labels, overseas.Last year the company booked £930m of sales overseas, more than double the figure in 2020. And last week, Next said a 39% surge in international sales was largely behind a muchstronger than expected performancethis summer and that the company now expects to make annual profits of £1.14bn – £30m more than expected.Emily Salter, a lead retail analyst at GlobalData, says: “Next’s range of brands and price positions allows it to cater to a wide range of consumers, including those who are focusing more on quality and trading up.”Next’s performance was helped by problems at its big rival Marks & Spencer, which was forced toclose its online businessfor several weeks after an Easter cyberattack, and Next also cited an improvement in the flow of stock from its Asian suppliers compared with last year.However, the figures indicate that Next was able to hold on to some of those new shoppers even when M&S reopened, and that it is gaining a new fanbase overseas.It is not really about Next stores. In the past five years Next has closed about 40 stores, taking its total to 457 in the UK. It has switched to larger, better-located spots, and UK retail sales are at about the same level they were five years ago.Sales of the Next brand continues to increase online, especially overseas, but that growth is being outpaced by its wholly owned, licensed and third party brands.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Next, which was founded in 1982 after the men’s tailoring firm J Hepworth & Son bought up the Kendalls rainwear stores to create a womenswear chain, has been steeped in home delivery from its early days.The Next Directory launched in 1988 to shake up the then fusty world of catalogue shopping, after the Hepworths bought the Grattan agency catalogue business.By the noughties, when online shopping began to take off, Next had all the logistical systems already in place so that it could make the transition much more smoothly than rivals. It has often led the pace on quick delivery and uses its big network of stores to offer a cheap option for picking up and dropping off parcels – something online specialists such as Asos struggle with.Chamberlain says Next’s strengths lie in its “its relatively fast, automated logistics and its well developed customer loyalty and analytics.”Explore more on these topicsRetail industryFashion industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Della Vite doubled down and shared a redacted image of the cease-and-desist letter on social media on Wednesday.The caption read: “Love letter from our friends at Champagne. As Oscar Wilde once said, ‘The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about.’ Salute!”Poppy Delevingne, 39, an actor and model,told The Timesthe campaign was meant to be “fun, cheeky and a little provocative” and they “genuinely didn’t think we’d done anything wrong”.She added: “The severity of the response was unexpected, but we were also pleased to see the campaign making an impact and getting noticed.”In the letter, which has been seen by the Times, the Comité Champagne wrote: “Any use of the internationally renowned name ‘champagne’ other than in reference to the sparkling wines entitled to this appellation constitutes an unfair exploitation of its reputation.“Moreover, such misuse risks tarnishing the name and damaging the goodwill associated with the champagne destination.”Numa Heathcote, chief executive and co-founder of Della Vite, told the newspaper: “We see this reaction as proof that modern challenger sparkling brands are reshaping the conversation around quality. If the established champagne world feels a little unsettled, it’s because a new generation of drinkers is defining luxury on its own terms and brands like Della Vite are part of that shift.”Della Vite was founded by the Delevingne sisters in 2020.Della Vite and Comité Champagne have been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsFood & drink industryMarketing & PRVeganismAlcoholnewsShareReuse this content"

The Dutch government said thatthreatened the future of European chip capacity, and removed the Wingtech chairman, Zhang Xuezheng, as chief executive.China responded by halting exports from all Nexperia’s factories inChina, prompting warnings this week that the embargo would force production lines at EU car factories to close within days.An extended blockade threatens the supply chain, because many Nexperia products manufactured inEurope– including the wafers from which chips are cut – were previously shipped to the Chinese factory for packaging and distribution.Nexperia’s interim chief executive, Stefan Tilger, wrote that he had suspended shipments to the Dongguan factory, in the southern Guangdong province, on Sunday, saying it was “a direct consequence of the local management’s recent failure to comply with the agreed contractual payment terms”, according to extracts first published by Reuters.Nexperia said it still hoped to resume shipments, and wanted to de-escalate the situation. A person with knowledge of the situation said shipments could resume if the contractual payments were made. The company will also continue to ship products to a factory in Malaysia, which is smaller than its Chinese plant.A succession ofcarmakers have warned of the risk of disruptionfrom shortages of the key components, which are crucial throughout modern cars.The automotive industry suffered from severe semiconductor shortages in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, but these affected more advanced chips, rather than the cheaper power control ones made by Nexperia. The company generally ships more than 100bn products a year, to be used in parts ranging from airbags and adjustable seats to wing mirrors and central locking.Nissan said this week it had enough chips to last until the first week of November, while rival Honda said it had suspended production at a plant in Mexico. Mercedes-Benz said it was “covered” in the short term, but it was looking for alternatives.Volkswagen signalled on Thursday that its annual profit targets were at riskwithout sufficient chips.However, Toyota, the world’s largest carmaker, told reporters at a car show in Tokyo on Friday that it was not facing a major supply problem, even if it could eventually face a hit to production.The EU’s trade commissioner, Maroš Šefčovič, is to seek further discussions with Chinese counterparts after Chinese and EU officials met in Brussels on Friday to address China’s ban on Nexperia exports and its restrictions onsupplies of rare earth minerals.Also on Friday, the bloc’s tech commissioner, Henna Virkkunen, met Nexperia’s interim boss after seeing the European chip makers Infineon, ST and NXP the day before.After the meeting, she said the dialogue with Nexperia had served to underline the EU’s needs for a new Chips Act with three lessons from the current crisis, including: better visibility of chip stocks in the pipeline, the need to invest in chip supply despite the cost, and the need for reserve stocks.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But there are plenty of things he draws the line at …Imogen TildenFri 31 Oct 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 31 Oct 2025 04.21 EDTShareAkey plot point of The Choral revolves around Roger Allam singing badly. This is the man who originated the role ofJavert in Les Misérablesback in 1985, who was Olivier-nominated for his performance inCy Coleman’s musical City of Angelsand who once contemplated a career as an opera singer.Talk me through that, I say: the bad singing. We’re at his home in southwest London. He’s very busy, filming, but a small window of time was found to meet – did I mind coming to his house? No, of course I didn’t, and here I am on a blustery Monday morning, perched on a chair next to him, sat in the corner on the sofa in a comfortable but anonymous front room looking on to a leafy street.“Well, I’m slightly relieved,” he says with a laugh. “The part in Gerontius” – that his character attempts to sing – “is the tenor solo, which is endless and terribly difficult and very high. And I – as you hear – have a baritone voice, quite a low one as well. And I haven’t sung for about 15 years. And so I was rather glad that it had to be bad!”The Alan Bennett-scripted film, directed by Nicholas Hytner, is set in 1916 in a Yorkshire factory town on the cusp of huge societal change, hollowed out by grief as its young men die in foreign fields. The choral society is at the heart of this community, but even there it’s far from business as usual: Bach’s St Matthew Passion is verboten (German music). There’s a new chorus master. And so urgent is the need for new singers, they might have to look beyond the ranks of the respectable middle-classes. Allam plays the gentle local mill owner, who funds “the choral”, and so finds a way to assuage his own grief.It’s full of glorious period detail, wit and subtle wisdom, and Elgar’s oratorio The Dream of Gerontius plays a starring role. Allam’s only prior experience of the piece had not been positive. “Not long before we started filming there was a performance in London I went along to and I’m afraid to say I found it rather boring,” he admits. “But singing it was tremendously exciting.”View image in fullscreen‘I found the chorus passages terribly moving’ … Allam, far left, in The Choral.Photograph: Nicola Dove/SonyFor the most part, it’s the actors themselves whose voices we hear. “The chorus passages I found terribly moving: the effort of singing all together and trying to make it good. My father was a vicar, so I was in his choir, and one at school, and I toyed with the idea of doing classical singing at university. Music and singing have always been a part of my life.”One of the splashiest turns in the film is Simon Russell Beale’s cameo as an inordinately pompous Elgar who, on realising this amateur choral society has rearranged and reimagined his work, retracts his permission for the performance. Does Allam know if there is any truth in Bennett’s script? Can the composer really have been, quite frankly, such a git?“I don’t know!” he says. “I think maybe Elgar was a bit pissed off that he wasn’t as revered as he thought perhaps he should be. The first performance of Gerontius had gone really, really badly. I guess it’s understandable if he pushed back at that. But as to his ‘gitacity’ – I’m not qualified to say.”View image in fullscreen‘It made people feel like they were good people; morally good for being in sympathy with the characters’ … Allam, far right, in Les Misérables (1985).Photograph: Donald Cooper/AlamyWe move to a character whose gitacity is unambiguous: Javert, the villain of Les Misérables, now back in the public eyeas the musical celebrates its 40th birthday. Allam was asked to be involved in the celebrations, he says, but wasn’t free. Did he, then a young RSC actor in his early 30s, have a sense of the phenomenon that the show was going to be?“No! The reviews were very mixed although there were some people who really loved it from the get-go. When we opened at the Barbican, it felt too long. Transferring into the West End, some bits were taken out. And straight away it was full all the time.” To what does he attribute its huge success? “It is a kind of feelgood musical in the sense it made people feel like they were good people; morally good for being in sympathy with the characters. It works the same way big spectacular melodrama works: it stirs you.”Likewise Game of Thrones, in which Allam sported a magnificent beard with Viking-style plaits. “I’m hardly in it!” he protests. “I’d just been doingFalstaff at the Globe” – for which he won an Olivier award – “so I was completely broke. It was only a couple of episodes. But it inflated the bank balance enough to get through the year.”He hadn’t seen a second of the show until the pandemic, when he and his younger son resolved to sit through the whole thing. “And some of it’s absolutely brilliant! There’s one battle scene which is just marvellous, makes you realise what a terrifying species we can be. And some of it’s just shit!”View image in fullscreen‘Some of it’s shit!’ … Allam in Game of Thrones.Photograph: HBOAllam is, as you might expect, wonderfully unfiltered. A little like one of his best-known creations, The Thick of It’sPeter Mannion: a suave but beleaguered Tory MP, and the stuff of athousand memes. “They were such glorious scripts,” he smiles of the show, whose 20th anniversary falls this year. “It was the beginning of that time – which is still going on – when politics seems to have become just about making announcements. As long as you can make announcements and get a bit of attention …”What does he think Mannion would be doing now? “Oooh, some shady business somewhere. Feathering his own nest as much as possible. But I don’t think he’d be joining Reform.”That’s the show he’s recognised by young people for – though for those younger still, it’s the charming CBeebies animation Sarah and Duck, for which he provides friendly voiceover. “On the train into town I sometimes get parents coming up to me saying thank you, because it was the only thing that would get their child to sleep, or asking me if I’d mind saying ‘Happy Birthday, Chloe’ in my Sarah and Duck voice.”Does he mind? “No, of course not! It’s sweet. It’s not like I’m being pursued down the street by rabid mothers with pushchairs.”Another voice role that sees him held in huge affection is Radio 4’sCabin Pressure, written by the comic genius John Finnemore. “That was a joy to do,” he says. Does he have a favourite episode? He reflects. “I do love otters.” He means Ottery St Mary, in which, among other things, his character, Douglas,explains the origins of the name of the Devon town, and he, Benedict Cumberbatch’s Martin and Finnemore’s Arthur consider how many hypothetical otters could be fitted into a small plane.I’d feel uncomfortable going on television and just being me. I wouldn’t like that at allMany of the roles Allam has played lean into his appeal as a languid middle-class sex symbol, quick of wit but large of heart. It’s that come-to-bed voice, perhaps, which is the clincher: deep, rich and smooth. In 2010’sTamara Drewehe was an oleaginous crime novelist who romanced Gemma Arterton – and ended up trampled to death by cows, and in French farceBoeing-Boeinghe juggled three separate fiancées. Radio 4’s ongoing Conversations from a Long Marriage sees him as Joanna Lumley’s exasperated but loving husband as the two discuss friends’ divorces, descaling kettles and whether it’s reasonable to expect dancingandsex on the same night.Yet despite this distinctive persona, Allam is not at ease as simply himself, he says. “I’d feel uncomfortable going on television and just being me. I wouldn’t like that at all.” Bookers for Celebrity Traitors or Bake Off should try elsewhere; even panel shows are not his bag, he says, despite his manifest gift for comedy and brilliant delivery of one-liners. “No, I’d hate that. I’d be no good.”It’s telling, too, that he feels most kinship not with those roles one might assume most closely mirror the real-life man, but with DI Fred Thursday in the Inspector Morse prequelEndeavour. “Having played a lot of sneery middle-class bastards, I was immediately attracted to the character because this was more from my actual family background – working class. One grandfather was a labourer on a building site, the other was a stonemason,” he says.View image in fullscreen‘Absolutely someone of my parents’ generation’ … Allam with Shaun Evans in Endeavour.Photograph: KUDOS/Itv“Thursday is absolutely someone of my parents’ generation. My mother was born in 1912, my father in 1914, his brother Fred was born in 1916. Playing him was an opportunity to explore and remember the 1960s and the lives of people like my own family.”The Choral, too, taps into this interest in the past lives of everyday people who coalesce to make beauty amid hardship. “Singing in a choir is a way of bringing communities together. Art and music, drama – these are the things we do best. And we don’t kill each other in our millions over it.”He pauses. “It made me think maybe I should join a choir or have some lessons and see where my voice is … if it still exists in some form.”The Choral is in UK cinemas from 7 November, US cinemas from 25 December and Australian cinemas from 1 January 2026.Explore more on these topicsFilmRoger AllamTelevisionAlan BennettMusicalsFirst world warfeaturesShareReuse this content"

To recall the rush of stomach-twisting fear provoked by this film, I just need one glimpse of the sweating face or shaking hands of Deborah Kerr. She plays a governess to two traumatised children in a remote house where life is so fragile that the petals fall from the roses, mysterious figures appear in the grounds and ominous screeching sounds crack the night. Freddie Francis’s shadowy, black-and-white cinematography, with all those flickering candles, sets a spooky tone, but it’s the soundtrack, using uncanny electronic noises by Daphne Oram, that really needles into your brain. Kerr’s Miss Giddens disintegrates rapidly, unable to trust her own horrifying visions, rapidly suspecting her youthful charges are possessed by evil spirits. “Oh, look, a lovely spider!” exclaims sweet little Flora. “And it’s eating a butterfly.”Pamela HutchinsonParanormal ActivityView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Universum Home Ent./Cinetext/Paramount Pictures/AllstarIt’s easy to think ofParanormal Activityas the name of a very 15-years-ago franchise, one that reinvigorated the found-footage horror genre a decade after The Blair Witch Project, resulting in six sequels and countless less effective knockoffs. But when I think back to the most intense scares I’ve experienced in the movie theater, Paranormal Activity pops up again. Back in 2009, when it gradually made its way to wide release after a festival debut a full two years earlier, it didn’t have that Blair Witch buzz mistaking its faked footage for the real thing. But Paranormal Activity did update those aesthetics for a time when home cameras had become more prevalent than ever, lending its surveillance-footage showpieces a queasy reality, untethered from “why are they still holding the camera?!” nitpicking. The genius of the movie is how much dread it conjures from so little, forcing the audience to lean forward and examine seemingly uneventful shots of people sleeping for little twitches of supernatural (that is to say, demonic) energy. I had an unlikely knot in my stomach for a surprising amount of the runtime as the movie proved that less could be more terrifying. Possession movies have never really gotten under my skin, not even The Exorcist. But the bump-in-the-night amateur investigation of Paranormal Activity did, and stayed there.Jesse HassengerRinguView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Omega/AllstarI don’t remember much about first seeing Ringu aside from getting on to the cinema floor so I could get more than just my hands between me and the screen. Since university I’ve seen an awful lot of horror, but on rewatching I can see why this gave me such extreme heebie-jeebies. Hideo Nakata’s sensation about a cursed video tape which gives you a week to live after you watch it has a slow, cold, crisply alien aesthetic to it, all growly sound design and blurred photos and angular overhead shots and a small boy and endless drip-drip silence until A MASSIVE GREAT GHOST LADY CLIMBS OUT OF THE TELLY TO SCARE YOU TO DEATH. There’s also The Scene With the Well, which I can’t write about for wobbling. The section about “brine” and “goblins” hasn’t aged well, especially if you’ve read a lot of Mr Gum, but Ringu is still A-grade unsettling and scary. I saw it again on Tuesday 28 October, at 4.23pm, by the way, just in case, just for reference.Catherine ShoardFrom HellView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Maximum Film/AlamyThe Hughes Brothers’ grisly telling of the Jack the Ripper murders is full of shadowy corners, jump scares and an unidentified villain who hunts his victims – in this case sex workers in Whitechapel – decked out in a black cloak and top hat. There are sepia tones and an impressive production design that captures the squalor of 1880s East London. It’s both campy (see Heather Graham’s attempt at a cockney accent), but also genuinely terrifying. Each one of the women is so frequently abused by johns and pimps that the killer hunting them could easily be someone they know. But much of the menace lies in how the Ripper lures them to their death. In one case his henchman plies an unsuspecting victim with grapes and offers her a carriage ride to meet his boss, disguised as a client. Johnny Depp’s haunted inspector protagonist is a more dishevelled and jaded version of his Ichabod Crane, a role he played in Tim Burton’s Sleepy Hollow two years prior to the release of this film. In From Hell, he always seems several steps behind catching the infamous murderer, who was ultimately never discovered after his spree of grim, anatomical killings.Shrai PopatThe StrangersView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rogue Pictures/AllstarOne night a few years ago, my best friend and I stayed at a cabin in the woods in rural North Carolina. All was well, a perfect weekend escape, until her phone went missing. She swore it had just been on the coffee table, but it was gone. Calls straight to voicemail. House eerily quiet. Within minutes, we huddled silently on the couch, and I felt an abyssal dread I haven’t experienced before or since. It was obvious: we were about to die. That things got so dire so quickly – breezing past “maybe you dropped it outside” straight to “axe murderer incoming” – is because of The Strangers, Bryan Bertino’s sadistically scary film starring Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman on the cabin holiday from hell. I only watched the film, partly based on the Manson murders, one time, shortly after its 2008 release. And I never will again, because with ruthless simplicity and arguably the creepiest masks of all time, Bertino tapped into a searing paranoia that apparently remains latent in my system: that you are never safe, evil strangers lurk around the corner, torture need no more justification than “because you were home”. And, crucially, that a missing phone means you’re doomed.Adrian HortonMidsommarView image in fullscreenPhotograph: A24Midsommar isn’t exactly a scary movie in the sense of pummeling viewers with jump scares, or subjecting them to scenes of slow-build anxious tension (although it does offer some of both), but instead it takes us deep into the terrifying terrain that we navigate while struggling to come to terms with a loss too big for the human psyche to bear. Young adult Dani becomes morbidly depressed after her sister Terri ends her life via carbon monoxide, killing her parents in the process, essentially making Dani an orphan in a few dreadful hours. Stuck with a boyfriend who can’t deliver the help she needs, she finds solace in a bizarre, cult-like community in rural Sweden. Ari Aster, the director, is masterful in conjuring truly horrifying scenes of grief and loss, and through the bulk of the movie he explores the befogged state in which grief-stricken individuals attempt to move toward some stable ground. The film is terrifying for daring to take us deep into a part of life that society is largely at pains to avoid as much as possible, showing just how utterly lost, bereft and desperately in need of help any of us could become in an instant. Aster really lets us feel what it is to navigate the passage by which we let go of a cherished past life that tragedy has taken away, while tentatively opening ourselves to the new life that we must somehow learn to accept and inhabit. In so doing, he goes to corners of the human psyche that define so much of our existence, yet that are so fundamentally troubling and untamable.Veronica EspositoThe ShiningView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Allstar Picture Library Limited./AlamyThe Shining has one of the lowest body counts for a horror movie – two to be exact. And we’re well past the two-hour mark when the film’s single fatal blow is committed against Scatman Crothers’ Dick Hallorann, the Overlook Hotel’s cook (who, pointedly, also happens to be the only Black character). That’s it. There’s no slasher and precious few jump scares, just a sinister history of violence that haunts a hotel built on Indigenous burial grounds, and Stanley Kubrick’s tyrannical control over our nerves, holding us hostage to every flowing tracking shot, ominous framing and jarring edit. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve watched and rewatchedThe Shining, following Jack Nicholson’s recovering alcoholic dad as he and his vulnerable family run in circles around the Overlook’s infinite corridors, obsessing over the symmetrical patterns on the walls and the carpets and what meaning they hold, trying in vain to make sense of a movie that refuses comprehension, satisfaction, closure or escape. The Shining is one of, if not the, scariest movies of all time because the fear never subsides no matter how many times we return to it, as if we too are trapped in the Overlook. “Forever and ever,” as those creepy twins say.Radheyan SimonpillaiThe ThingView image in fullscreenPhotograph: AJ Pics/AlamyI understand why many might opt for something that’s more recognisably of this world, but while watching John Carpenter’s majestically disgusting sci-fi nightmare The Thing, I’ve always been too immersed in the terrifying urgency of its storytelling to second-guess its realism. It helps that Carpenter, and his note-perfect cast of grim, grizzled men, take everything completely seriously, veering between grave-faced hopelessness and “You gotta be fuckin’ kidding” shock, as a flesh-piercing, shape-shifting alien infects and subsumes their workplace. The shrieking aggression of its pursuit scared me not just for its awful violence (a freakish reinvention of what the human body can do that remains horribly effective – physical effects last, guys!) but for its total unstoppability, a bleak example of how vulnerable our minds and bodies can be when a corruptive and superior force enters. It also fed into something more personal for me, my deep-rooted fears of infection and mutation tied to a real-world fear of contracting HIV at a time when it was less easily managed and even more stigmatised. The Thing might be out of this world, but it found a way to terrorise mine.Benjamin LeeMView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Collection Christophel/AlamyNobody dies on screen in Fritz Lang’s M, and you don’t even see any blood. Still, believe me when I warn you: watch this one with the lights on. Lang’s expressionist masterpiece about a serial killer and the corrupt police force hunting him down is considered the proto-procedural crime drama. I made the mistake of viewing the thriller in my living room, illuminated only by candles, thinking:It’s from 1931, how scary can it be?Very! In the first shot, German children sweetly sing-song a sinister version of “duck duck goose” – but these lyrics are about an at-large phantom who “chops up” kids. I immediately blew out the candles and turned on the overhead lights. From the start, the film relentlessly indulges in the anticipation of horror, rather than its execution. Viewers end up just as paranoid as the film’s frantic public. Fitting for the time period – M would be the last film Lang, an avowed antifascist, made in Germany before fleeing to Paris and then the US. (As legend goes, Lang left Berlin as a means of turning down Joseph Goebbels’ job offer to lead a film studio that churned out Nazi propaganda.)Alaina DemopolousThe DescentView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Celador Films/AllstarOne of the most rational common fears, to me, is claustrophobia. Who wants to be stuck in a tight spot, unable to move? It is also probably reasonable to be afraid of carnivorous, humanoid cave monsters. In 2005’s The Descent, Neil Marshall, the director, brilliantly, dreadfully combines those two frights into the most agonizing – and invigorating – horror film I’ve ever seen. A group of weekend spelunkers, one mourning a terrible loss, ventures into a cave for fun (unhinged) and winds up trapped, forced to confront not only their own demons but also pale, relentless predators lurking in the dark. It’s brutal, bleak and expertly staged, an operatic plunge into a gruesomely palpable nightmare. The film is such a visceral jolt that even talking about it gives me the shivers, 20 years later. Seek it out, if you dare.Richard LawsonExplore more on these topicsHorror filmsHalloweenThe ShiningMidsommarParanormal ActivityThe InnocentsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

After the riotously gory Novocaine comes Companion, which is either a violent sci-fi or an extremely accurate representation of what life will be like 30 years from now. Quaid plays Josh, a “nice guy” who starts to have trouble when his sexbot jailbreaks itself. On one hand, Companion is a film about the consequences of coercive control; on the other, it’s a chilling warning about what will happen when the AI we use realises we aren’t very polite to it.Stuart HeritageCrawl (Alexandre Aja, 2019), 1.25am, Channel 4Viewers aren’t exactly wanting for horror movies this Halloween, but if you’re looking for something under the radar that delivers actual scares, Crawl is the movie for you.

It’s a delicate balance, wringing maximum jeopardy out of the premise without becoming preposterous, but Crawl hits it confidently. Happily, a sequel is on the way … though how they up the ante from this is anyone’s guess.SHLive sportFA Cup football: Luton Town v Forest Green Rovers, 7pm, TNT Sports 1First-round tie of this year’s competition at Kenilworth Road.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV tonightThe Walking DeadAlan PartridgeSteve CooganGraham NortonScience fiction and fantasy filmsHorror filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s blazingly camp and deals in the affairs of musclebound jocks, creepy sugar daddies and women whose faces have been Botoxed to sleep. But it also contains an entertaining turn from Sarah Paulson as comically aggressive attorney Carrington Lane, plus a chance to ponder the (limited) acting chops ofKim Kardashian.

It’s a comparatively deep dive into character and backstory – we first meet Robert of Locksley as he learns archery from his father, who is subsequently executed by the sheriff. Thus radicalised, Robert hooks up with posh rebel Marian (Lauren McQueen) and begins a campaign of guerrilla warfare against the state.

Theformat remainsthe same: 456 people, green tracksuits, an aircraft hangar full of bunk beds, insultingly basic games.

The Jan Heweliusz capsized in the Baltic Sea in early 1993 and 55 people lost their lives. However, as tragic as this was, the series locates the real intrigue in the bitter aftermath. As an investigation into the accident began, suspicions of a cover-up regarding the true causes increased.

And this is awholehearted take– rampantly gothic in its green and red-themed sets and costumes, and faithfully Romantic in its exploration of life and death. Oscar Isaac’s Victor Frankenstein is a serious man (with serious sideburns), hubristically obsessed with scientific discovery, whileJacob Elordibrings pathos to the Creature, a marble-skinned innocent learning harsh lessons about humanity.Christoph Waltzas Victor’s backer and Mia Goth as his brother’s inquisitive fiancee add flourishes to a tale often told but rarely with such devotion.Friday 7 November, NetflixOne Fine MorningView image in fullscreenCompelling … Léa Seydoux and Melvil Poupaud in  One Fine Morning.An actor who always inspires empathy,Léa Seydouxis again compelling in this 2022 film.

Through a self-deprecating, witty voiceover, Kenny Dalglish relates his own rise to success as a striker with Celtic then Liverpool in the 1970s. For the uninitiated and nostalgic, there’s plenty of footage of Kenny in his pomp, but it’s the double blow of the Heysel and Hillsborough disasters that gives the film real weight. The trauma of those events still casts a shadow over him, giving his story a universality that transcends the beautiful game.Tuesday 4 November, Prime VideoThe Fantastic Four: First StepsView image in fullscreenFab foursome … Pedro Pascal The Fantastic Four: First Steps.Photograph: Marvel Studios/APThe third feature-length iteration of the super-fab foursome is thelatest attemptto rescue Marvel’s Cinematic Universe from irrelevance – and it may just succeed.

There, the mostly invisible extraterrestrial warrior faces a Native American tribe equally at home in the wilderness.

It’s also a candid exploration of gay sexuality in an era when it dared not speak its name.

So what makes it such a timeless tune?Gwilym MumfordFri 31 Oct 2025 13.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 31 Oct 2025 15.19 EDTShareFifty years ago this very day, Queen released Bohemian Rhapsody as a single. By the time it reached record stores it was already familiar to many, having received extensive radio play by the likes of Kenny Everett (“Excuse me while I scrape myself off the ceiling,”was Everett’s reactionafter its first spin). So the song climbed the charts quickly. Within a month it had gone to No 1, where it then sat for nine weeks, from the end of November to the end of January. And Bohemian Rhapsody has stayed lodged in pop music’s collective consciousness ever since. It’s a song so instantly familiar that you only need to hear that first multitracked vocal smear of “Is this the real life?” to replay all five minutes and 55 seconds of it in your head. You’re probably doing it right now, in fact.But how did it get so firmly lodged in the pop canon? After all, and this ishardly an original observation, but Bohemian Rhapsody is a deeply weird mega hit, a song that explodes all the usual rules of success. Everywhere you look there are contradictions. It’s a multimillion seller that has no chorus, numerous tempo and key changes, ambiguous and difficult-to-parse lyrics and a long running time. Musically, with its Gilbert and Sullivan operetta leanings, ithas more in common with the 19th centurythan the 20th, let alone the 21st, but it’s also the most streamed 20th-century song this century, a musical throwback that neverthelessdragged pop into the music-video age. It’s both celebrated as aqueer anthemor an extendedmetaphor for coming out, and is theBritish armed forces’ favourite song. It’s an extremely silly, borderline novelty hit that is also sort of deeply serious: “If I’m not back again this time tomorrow/ Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters.”And for a song often garlanded with the phrase “universally beloved”, Bohemian Rhapsody is disliked by plenty of people, from the critics whofamously panned it at the timeof release to the Spectator columnist whostuck the boot injust a couple of days ago (“… convinced multiple generations that operatic wailing, asinine lyrics and improbable time‑signature gymnastics remain the pinnacle of popular music”). On Reddit’s Unpopular Opinion board, there areso many variantsof “Bohemian Rhapsody is bad” that the sentiment surely no longer qualifies as an unpopular opinion. Even the extremely genial football commentator Martin Tylerhates it, for some reason.I’m not quite in the Spectator-Redditor-Tyler faction myself, but I don’t exactlyloveBohemian Rhapsody. A little of what Freddie Mercury described as its “pompous flair” definitely goes a long way for me, and bits of it are borderline unlistenable to my ears – “Scaramouche, scaramouche, will you do the fandango” is nails down a blackboard. There’s also the not-insignificant factor of just having heard it too many times – at weddings and karaoke sessions (where it remains themost popular song to perform), on greatest No 1s countdown shows, and during late-night viewings of Wayne’s World. Still, in the overplayed song stakes it doesn’t feel as fatigued as, say, Mr Brightside; that’s despite Bohemian Rhapsody having a 28-year head start in overfamiliarity on the Killers’ indie disco staple.View image in fullscreenMusical mystery … Freddie Mercury never explained the song’s lyrics.Photograph: Steve Jennings/WireImageIt’s probably not a coincidence that Bohemian Rhapsody doesn’t sound as exhaustingly overplayed as some of the worst offenders. For all its familiarity, half a century on there’s still an aura of complexity and mystery to the song. That’s evident not just in the musicianship, all those multitracked, million-part harmonies, but of course in its lyrics, which Mercury never unpacked, even reportedly to his bandmates. “People should just listen to it, think about it, and then make up their own minds as to what it says to them,” Mercury suggested, and into that vacuum interpretations have poured.Who is the man with the gun against his head, and who is the person pulling the trigger? Is it, as widely believed, Mercury coming to terms with his sexuality by killing hisold, more straight-seeming self? (I’m intrigued by the theory that it’s actually a tribute toHerschel Grynszpan, the gay Jewish teen whose assassination of a German diplomat was used as a pretext for the events of Kristallnacht – though I’ve not seen that suggested anywhere else.) And what about that pomp rock middle section? Is there a meaning to the flurry of Galileos and Figaros and fandangos, or is it just gibberish to facilitate the “tongue-in-cheek and mock-opera” feel Mercury said he was striving for? Or both?It’s a song that has inspired endless fascination: just look at itsWikipedia page, with its hundreds of citations and footnotes. And, of course, it has inspired endless musicians too – though not in a conventional way. For all its uniqueness, Bohemian Rhapsody didn’t really usher in a new sound or genre: in fact, it represents the last knockings of one, prog rock, before it was washed away by the coming tide of punk. But instead Bohemian Rhapsody invented its own subcategory of song, a multipronged showstopper that could be replicatedacross genresand generations.Today, as it nears the 3bn mark on Spotify and the 2bn mark on YouTube, it’s hard to imagine Bohemian Rhapsody ever fading into obscurity. In its singular strangeness, it feels future-proof. It’s walled off from changing tastes and genres, destined to be sung on hen dos and karaoke nights for decades to come, the unknowable song that everyone knows.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A sinister organ and a choir of voices harmonise in the style of a horror theme, replaced in short order by the sound of screaming and a stomping glam rock rhythm; instead of the shouts of “Hey!” that traditionally punctuated a glitterbeat in the 70s, there are distaff cries of “Dance!” and “Turn!” Its sound offers a corrective to the notion that whenever the National’s Aaron Dessner appears as co-producer in an album’s credits, as he does here, it means the artist in question is striving for tastefully hued indie folk – the sound he brought to Taylor Swift’s 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, Ed Sheeran’s Autumn Variations and the mistier moments of Gracie Abrams’ The Secret of Us. It also provides a backdrop over which Florence Welch can ruminate on what sounds like a very complicated relationship with fame. She says she can only become her “full size” on stage and openly relishes the control she can exert over an audience, “breathless and begging and screaming”. Equally, there appears to be a downside. “Look at me run myself ragged, blood on the stage,” she sings. “But how can I leave when you’re calling my name?”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

It crops up again and again, sometimes in visceral terms linked to the grim events of 2023, when complications from a miscarried ectopic pregnancy left Welch needing emergency life-saving surgery mid-tour – “I crawled up from under the earth, broken nails and coughing dirt, spitting out my songs so you could sing along,” opens One of the Greats, over grumbling, Velvet Underground-ish guitar courtesy of Idles’ Mark Bowen – and sometimes with a winning kind of self-deprecating humour. Music by Men details a relationship in crisis, scorns Welch’s partner, then shifts the blame on to herself. The problem with life offstage, she notes ruefully, is that “there’s not much applause”.Florence and the Machine: One of the Greats – videoIt’s a relationship that Welch is well placed to examine. Seventeen years on from the release of her debut single, Kiss with a Fist, she could reasonably claim to be the most consistently successful British alt-rock artist of her era, with the possible exception of Arctic Monkeys. At least in terms of influence over modern pop, she dwarfs Alex Turner: being sampled by Kendrick Lamar and Drake; tapped as a collaborator by Taylor Swift and Lady Gaga; hailed as an inspiration by Beyoncé; and her sound clearly in the DNA of Ethel Cain, Chappell Roan and the Last Dinner Party. It’s a position from which Welch can look back at the equivocal critical response to her early work with a degree of I-knew-I-was-right relish: on One of the Greats, she blames her early lukewarm reviews on sexism. Responding to your critics in song is a fraught business – there’s a danger of coming up with something so indignant it makes the listener wonder if they may not have had a point – but One of the Greats does it with a smart, spiky humour that feels particularly effective given that a certain high seriousness about her wilfully OTT theatricality was among the criticisms laid at Welch’s door: “I’ll be up there with the men and the 10 other women in the hundred greatest records of all time / It must be nice to be a man and make boring music just because you can.”‘The closest I came to making life was the closest I came to death’: Florence Welch on sexism, screaming and the lost pregnancy that nearly killed herRead moreOf course, wilfully OTT theatricality is what sold Welch so many albums in the first place and it’s here in spades. No one’s going to come away from Everybody Scream complaining about a paucity of big choruses and impassioned operatic vocal extemporisations. But there’s more light and shade here than you might expect, a greater desire to set the volume low than crank it up to 11: the crescendos of Drink Deep (ululating vocals) and You Can Have It All (pounding drums, discordant A Day in the Life strings) are more impactful because they’re separated by Music by Men, which sets Welch’s voice to nothing more than a strummed acoustic guitar and a very light sprinkling of piano, letting her undoubted melodic facility shine. Witch Dance and Sympathy Magic metaphorically throw the kitchen sink at you – the second reprises the thumping percussive approach of her debut album Lungs, but chucks in a huge rave-breakdown synth for good measure. They’re succeeded by Perfume and Milk, and Buckle, both relatively intimate and unadorned.“All of my peers they had such potential … I kissed them goodbye and let them drown,” sings Welch on Kraken, a line that seems to reflect her unique position among her class of 2008 indie contemporaries. More rounded musically and emotionally than the caricature version of Florence + the Machine may lead you to expect, Everybody Scream is an album that suggests she’s wearing her hard-earned status rather well.Explore more on these topicsPop and rockFlorence + the MachinereviewsShareReuse this content"

You’ve gotta get mad at The Man,” a wise man (Jack Black) once said (in School of Rock). And in 2015, four 15-year-olds in Canberra watching the Richard Linklater film at a sleepover decided they wanted to do just that, forming a rock band the morning after that has become one of Australia’s most exciting acts: Teen Jesus and the Jean Teasers – a joke name suggested by one of their uncles that stuck.The four teenagers had enough punk brio that they were soon being booked to play venues they weren’t old enough to enter unchaperoned. Adults around them would assume they were in their early 20s, when they were actually 16 or 17.“Our parents would tag along and we’d have lemonade on the rider. We’d have our little school backpacks, then go to a pub to play a show – when you look back now it was really strange. We thought we were really cool,” laughs guitarist Scarlett McKahey, now 24.“To be fair, itwaspretty cool,” adds singer Anna Ryan, 24.View image in fullscreenAt their first gig they played Nirvana covers; only a few years later, they opened for the Foo Fighters.Photograph: Bec Lorrimer/The GuardianThey got bigger and bigger, but they still felt impostor syndrome; when huge crowds lined up to see Teen Jesus play at Brisbane’s Bigsound in 2018, “I was like, what are they lining up for? Who is playing after us?” says Ryan.Their 2022 EP Pretty Good for a Girl Band was named for the backhanded praise they often heard; it included the hitGirl Sports, inspired by Stephenson who, after knocking her teeth out in a skating accident, was told by a male dentist that she should “stick to girl sports”. (The chorus kicks off with the chant: “Fuck off, fuck off!)“It was meant to be ironic, because it’s obviously deeply offensive,” says McKahey, of the EP’s title. “But people would come up after that and be like, ‘You guys ARE pretty good for a girl band!’”“People would be like, ‘Oh my god, you guys ARE my favourite girl band,’” adds Ryan.“It backfired a bit,” sighs bassist Jaida Stephenson.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningTheir debut, 2023’s I Love You, was more polished, with the wistful anthem Salt and the catchy belter Ahhhh! winning them best breakthrough artist at the Aria awards. That same year, they opened for the Foo Fighters on their Australian tour. “Our managers called us and said, ‘Guess who’s playing with the Foo Fighters?’” McKahey recalls. “And we said, who?”At their first gig (at a school fete), they’d played Nirvana covers; now they were playing with Dave Grohl.“I had to completely disconnect. I had to treat him as a regular person, because otherwise I’d throw up,” Ryan laughs.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Bec Lorrimer/The GuardianTeen Jesus later opened for Pearl Jam on their Australian tour, then joined their US arena tour. “We’d never been backstage at a stadium before Fooeys – so by the time we were touring with Pearl Jam we were like, OK, we’ve done this before,” says McKahey. “And by the time we went to America, we knew how to play those roomsandwe also knew the band – which is a fucked thing to say about Pearl Jam!”Somewhere along the way, a high school band had become one of Australia’s most exciting rock acts. “We didn’t do this because we want to become the biggest band in the world or we want to become famous. It’s just fun playing shows with our besties. And I think that energy really shows in our music,” says Stephenson.Their new album, Glory, sounds a lot grander than anything they’ve done before; ​as ​punchy and contagious as the best of I Love You​, but with ​a darker, synthy sound. There is Balcony, a taunting banger that will be loved by Wet Leg fans, and the lovely Unscarred, which has echoes of the Cranberries. Listening to it made me feel oddly hopeful, basking in its confident vulnerability; they are still sticking it to The Man.“I’m done being someone you ignore,” Ryan sings on Unscarred. “Don’t bother calling me back, don’t bother calling me back.”A four way gif of film images“I feel like the gap between being 20 and 25 is actually huge,” says McKahey. “I’ve lived a thousand lives this past four years. We’re actual professional musicians now. We’re legit. And we went into this album with so much intention and knew exactly what we wanted it to look like … it’s really good and we’re really happy.”Glory was produced by Catherine Marks, an Australian producer who has also worked with Boygenius and Wolf Alice. (“She won a freakingGrammy,” says McKahey.) They all lived together for five weeks at the studio; sleeping, eating, jamming, watching Married at First Sight, then repeat – with Marks even monitoring what music they put on during trips to the supermarket – to shape the album’s ultimate sound.“It changed so much because of her. She really made it exactly what we wanted,” says McKahey.View image in fullscreen‘When we were younger, we were in the mindset of everybody else knows best, but now we know what is best for us,’ says Ryan.Photograph: Bec Lorrimer/The GuardianHas the music industry, and the world, moved on from the days when they were only “pretty good for a girl band?” “Kind of,” says McKahey. “I also think there’s been such a rise of conservatives who think women shouldn’t be able to get abortions, or work. There’s a lot of non-male music that’s really big, which is great. But there’s also the Charlie Kirks of the world.”Generally, they have found that the music industry is not so bad; Ryan’s expectation that it might be “this terrifying place where people are going to try and wrong me everywhere I go”, they admit, was largely shaped by Alvin and the Chipmunks. But the four have learned to stand their ground: “When we were younger, we were in the mindset of everybody else knows best, but now we know what is best for us,” Ryan says.The transition from being four friends in a high school band to a professional band who happen to be childhood friends can be delicate. But none of them can imagine anything else.“We’ve been in the band for so long that I don’t even really know what it would be like without it,” says McKahey. “We all speak this language that nobody else can speak. We know each other super well. When we’re touring, if someone’s having a bad day we all can read it enough to leave them alone and not take it personally.“That’s a big thing musically too – not getting offended if your idea doesn’t work. When we were 18, we were all a bit grizzly – because we were 18. Now, it’s so easy.”Suddenly, a new voice pipes up: their drummer, Neve van Boxsel, who has been mute the entire time.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Such is the case with Fire of God’s Love, a 1973 album by the Australian nun Sister Irene O’Connor.Simple and spectral, it is a marvel of analogue pop music – a collection of airy folk songs, played largely on drum machine, acoustic guitar and synth organ, which sometimes feels more spiritually aligned with cult singer-songwriters like Princess Demeny and Mary Margaret O’Hara than most other non-secular records. Set for reissue next month by Freedom to Spend – an arm of the cult electronic label Rvng dedicated to high-quality reissues of 70s and 80s amateur synth records – Fire of God’s Love is also a quintessential winter record, perfect for the cooler months ahead.O’Connor first started making music in the 50s while living in a convent in Singapore, and released music in the 60s under the pseudonym Myriam Frances, as to avoid ruffling any feathers in her community. In Singapore, O’Connor met another nun, Sister Marimil Lobregat, who had experience working in audio technology; back in Sydney, the pair would meet at the city’s Catholic Radio and Television Centre to work on music together, recording on a four-track tape recorder. The resulting songs are devoutly religious but skirt lines between devotional music and contemporary pop; some tracks, such as album opener Fire (Luke 12:49) contain elements of dub, while others, such as Teenager’s Chorus, feel of a piece with pastoral British folk music. The whole thing feels a little like a miracle: a sweet, compelling pop record from a hugely unlikely source.Shaad D’SouzaThis week’s best new tracksView image in fullscreenRosalía.Rosalía – BerghainGerman operatics, lyrics comparing diminishing yourself for love to transubstantiation, glass-shattering falsetto, “divine intervention” courtesy of Björk, and Yves Tumor reprising Mike Tyson’s “I’ll fuck you ’til you love me” – who else has the vision?LSLankum – Ghost TownThe only act capable of making the Specials’ 1981 hit even more haunting, Lankum swap dub for rumbling drone and the “ya ya ya!” for fathoms-deep chorals.

Join the conversation in the commentsBenjamin Myers, Oyinkan Braithwaite, andGuardian readersFri 31 Oct 2025 12.30 EDTLast modified on Fri 31 Oct 2025 13.38 EDTShareBenjamin Myers, writerErik Satie Three Piece Suiteby Ian Penman is a daring and endlessly inventive portrait of the iconoclastic composer. Penman’s skill lies in his total disregard for tired cliches and tropes of music criticism, while perfectly combining the highbrow and the lowbrow – a digression on Les Dawson shows why he might just be our greatest writer on music.The Book of Bogs, edited by Anna Chilvers and Clare Shaw, draws together many environmental writers and poets – Amy Liptrot, Robert Macfarlane, Horatio Clare – in response to threats against the Walshaw Moor peatlands of West Yorkshire that inspired writers such as Emily Brontë and Ted Hughes (and yours truly). Most here agree windfarms are a good thing; Saudi companies indiscriminately plundering richly biodiverse landscapes less so. It’s an essential celebration of something that once gone can never be recovered.Silliness is important in life, too, and the 1956 novelThe Ascent of Rum Doodleby WE Bowman is very silly indeed. A satire on the machismo of mountaineering and colonial British arrogance, it outdoes Monty Python before it/they even existed. (Rum Doodle, incidentally, is the mountain in question, measuring precisely 40,0001/2ft.)A recent deep dive journey into what I can only describe as “London rooming house novels of the 20th century” led me to key discoveries by Sylvia Townsend Warner, Emeric Pressburger, Patrick Hamilton, Rosemary Tonks and Elizabeth Taylor, whoseMrs Palfrey at the Claremontperhaps most movingly combines humour with the grim inevitability of ageing and the loneliness of the city.Jesus Christ Kinski by Benjamin Myers is published by Bloomsbury (£18.99).

The emotional intelligence displayed by the author is profoundly moving – you can tell this man has been to therapy, even if his protagonist has not. An existential crisis has never looked more banal and complex at the same time. It’s a deeply human book.The Ministry of Timeby Kaliane Bradley is a very Dr Who-esque sci-fi-mystery-adventure-romance-fable. It’s part spy novel, part historical fiction, part dystopian future fantasy, and totally addictive.The two books provided the escape for which we read novels, while also offering examinations of humanity that enhance our understanding of our psyche and sense of self. They do not sugarcoat the human experience, but rather expose the shadows of this existence. There are no heroes or villains, only people being themselves, wherein good and evil always reside.Oyinkan Braithwaite, writerI am not generally into horror, butOld Soul by Susan Barkerwas beautifully written, haunting and unyielding. I was pulled in instantly. In an effort to understand what happened to his friend, Jake approaches people who have been traumatised by their own losses. Their strange accounts all point to the presence of one ageless woman. Who is she? What is she? And how can she be stopped?The Original Daughter by Jemimah Weiexplores the love between two sisters and the tensions that tear them apart. When the Yang family adopt young Arin, Genevieve welcomes her with open arms. But ambition, societal pressure and academic stress soon strain their relationship, and betrayals follow one after another. Wei’s characters are distinct, colourful, wonderfully flawed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Delivery charges may apply.Richard, Guardian readerThe Lowlifeby Alexander Baron, a recently reissued “lost classic”, was an appropriate read this summer, as I enjoyed an extended stay in east London, exploring parts of the city I was unfamiliar with.Set in post-second world war Hackney and environs, the city Baron describes is very different from the London I wandered through. Yet it also resonates in the present in its descriptions of the precariousness of people’s livelihoods.Protagonist Harryboy Boas is a dreamer who has opted out of tradition and family and left his life to fate. He is a hugely flawed character who nonetheless gains our sympathy. As Iain Sinclair says about Harryboy’s routines in his excellent introduction, there is “nothing to be done and he’s doing it on a daily basis”. Harryboy fills this nothingness with heavy lunches, lying in his room reading Zola and, especially and ruinously, trips to the dog track.The novel offers plenty of entertainment in Harryboy’s adventures, his tentative moves towards respectability, his near fall into the abyss, his illicit pleasures and his confrontation with a gang of heavies, his dreams and his schemes. Baron is wonderful in his evocation of the atmosphere of the city, and of the shabby world of the boarding house in which Harryboy spends most of his time. The London of The Lowlife is not the London I explored this summer, but it feels just as real. Moving and often extremely funny, this was a hugely enjoyable novel, and one that deserves its second life.Explore more on these topicsBooksWhat we're readingSylvia Townsend WarnerOyinkan BraithwaiteFictionBiography booksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I was living in Long Melford, Suffolk, with my foster parents, and my foster dad was trying to teach me how to read using those Biff and Chip books.My favourite book growing upI never read a book until the age of 24, so there wasn’t a favourite until I was about 25, and they usually changed with every new book I read. It started withSt Mawrby DH Lawrence, then EM Forster’sWhere Angels Fear to TreadandThe Time Machineby HG Wells, Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad, and then it was F Scott Fitzgerald’sThe Great Gatsbyfor a very long time. But that lost its place last year when I finally readThe Real Life of Sebastian Knightby Vladimir Nabokov.The book that changed meThe book that changed me as a young man was The Will to Change bybell hooks. Until I read that I didn’t really know what being perceived as a man was all about. I kind of just drifted through life never having thought about it. Or if I did, it was so surface-level that it essentially meant nothing.The writer who changed my mindBenjamin Zephaniah. I emailed him out of the blue once and we started a correspondence that built into a friendship. He and my partner at the time convinced me to do a master’s in creative writing. I was hesitant, because I’ve always considered myself not very clever. But he said I could do it. And I did.The book that made me want to be a writerThere are three:Invisible Manby Ralph Ellison,Don’t Let Me Be Lonelyby Claudia Rankine, andThe Terribleby Yrsa Daley-Ward. Ellison gave me access to the strings behind a novel, showed me the pieces it was made from. And Rankine and Daley-Ward gave me permission to write a novel however I wanted to, to shape it in any way I felt necessary.Theauthor I came back toHenry James. I tried him almost a decade ago – I think it wasWashington Square– and it seemed so dry and impenetrable that I decided I wouldn’t bother again. But I did try again, as I always do, earlier this year. I picked upThe Aspern Papersand suddenly James’s writing opened up to me, the voice on the page so strong, the sentences so satisfyingly unique and complex, that I ended up reading five novels in a row. My next isThe Bostonians.The book I rereadSelf-Relianceby Ralph Waldo Emerson. I can’t remember how I discovered it but I read it whenever my self-esteem drops to dangerous levels.The book I could never read againOscar Wilde’s The Picture of Dorian Gray. At first I remember thinking how beautiful the prose was. That changed very quickly and it all became really cloying. Once I got to all the descriptions of jewels and beautiful things from around the world I called it quits. That was the first time I had ever got that far into a novel and stopped. Even thinking about it annoys me.The book I discovered later in lifeA Good Schoolby Richard Yates. I think it’s his best novel. A friend from work had told me her favourite novel wasRevolutionary Roadso I made a note to read it. Years later I picked it up and decided to read everything Yates had written. It wasn’t until I got to A Good School that I was truly taken by that feeling of just loving something instantly and intensely.The book I am currently readingDeparture(s) by Julian Barnes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

This has mostly taken the form of essays for the literary pages of the NYRB, the LRB and, indeed, the Guardian. Attention is a collection of 24 of the best, each with a new brief introduction by Enright herself. The work is culled mostly from the past 10 years, with the latest dated “Autumn 2025”, which suggests that she was still blowing on the ink as it went to press.A decade ago most of these pieces would probably have been called “personal essays”, but that now seems redundant. Everything is personal with Enright, which is what makes you want to read her even on subjects that don’t initially appeal. The cocaine trade in Honduras, say, or the production of Samuel Beckett’s Happy Days in a sodden field in the Aran Islands. And just when you worry that things might, actually, be getting a bit too fine-grained, such as the revelation that on holiday her husband likes to study menus carefully before choosing a restaurant, while she is more likely to dive in and scream for chips, Enright lobs in a line that explodes her text. Leaving her beloved Venice after a holiday with said husband, she is struck by the thought that the next time she visits, “I do not know if the disaster will have happened or not, because one day it will happen. One of us will die; the other will remain.” And just like that we are taken to the deepest, darkest mystery not just of Enright’s marriage, but of the kind of relationship that we might long for ourselves.She expects no one to be perfect, least of all herselfMy feeling reading this collection is that each precious line needs going over twice. First for the sound and shape of the words, the second for their meaning. Luckily it turns out that this is how Enright does things too. Most of her essays about reading are in fact about rereading. When it comes to Joyce’s Ulysses which hangs over Attention like a sacred text, she maintains that it “invites meaning, then throws it back at you, multiplied”, with the result that you have to go over it again, and again. On these subsequent readings, she advocates having “a guidebook, notes, the internet at your fingertips”. She even suggests that Molly Bloom might make a bit more sense if she had inserted some full stops into her breathless monologue. There’s no reason why you couldn’t try putting them in for yourself.Enright is happy to boast about the literary tradition of which she is a distinguished sprig, with Ireland having “more decent writers per acre than any other piece of land in the world”. From here she gives us essays on Edna O’Brien and Maeve Brennan before pushing further afield to Angela Carter and Alice Munro. In the case of the latter, she refuses to repudiate Munro over the fact that the writer stood by her husband when her daughter, then in her 20s, told her that he had sexually abused her as a child. “I have read Munro all my life, and reading her again in light of these revelations, I find that I cannot take back my great love for her; it was too freely given.”She expects no one to be perfect, least of all herself, telling us unblushingly that “I love aid workers and I sort of hate aid workers because they are better than me”. Confronted with a pile of new novels, she cannot muster the desire to start reading. This is not because of any nonsense about being too distracted by modern life, but simply because she is no longer capable of the necessary acts of empathy – or “maybe I just got mean”.Yet if Enright is generous about moral imperfection, she is a martinet when it comes to the business of literature, declaring tartly that “the dictum ‘write what you know’ does not include ‘so long as it’s dull’”. She is never dull, not even when discussing dinner choices on holiday, and in her acknowledgments she thanks the original editors of these pieces for insisting on “the values of accuracy, clarity, insight and lightness”. These, then, are the terms of engagement: she will write like a sharp, funny fallen angel and we will pay attention.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

His 10th collection is informed by depression and the recovery from it: “if only some idea / could find its way / through enemy territory / then I’d at last begin / to look up at the sky”. His lyrics still meander down the page, but linguistic fireworks have been replaced by language that is straightforward, unadorned and more affecting for it. This also gives his reflections on the recent shifts in Northern Irish history and politics more bite. But it’s in its more private moments that the book really shines: “Heed my cadences then and live only for now. / Don’t ever bother about tomorrow. / Just pluck, today, life’s full-blooded roses”.View image in fullscreenForetokensby Sarah Howe (Chatto & Windus, £12.99)Ten years since winning the TS Eliot prize with her debut Loop of Jade, Howe’s second collection is a reaffirmation of the keen, probing intelligence and ability to layer telling detail that underpins her poetry. Taking on the biggest of subjects – genetics, time’s relativity, becoming a parent – as well as re-examining her mother’s occluded history in Hong Kong, there is now an anger in Howe’s tonal range, which brings a pleasing sharpness to her investigations: “child of a hoarder / I am not immune / to this mania this malaise / this inherited dream / of an archive / so complete nothing / could ever hurt again”. Foretokens is a quite brilliant return.Maryvilleby Joelle Taylor (Bloomsbury, £14.99)Taylor’s latest takes the four butch lesbian characters we met in the TS Eliot-winning C+NTO & Othered Poems, and expands into a sweeping, 50-year history of lesbian culture and LGBTQ+ rights. Maryville is framed as a television series because, as Taylor says, “I want you to see us”. The device works as both the poems and screen directions surrounding them are stuffed with urgent and memorable language: “inside / women have left their breasts at home / & brought someone else’s teeth / femmes wear their hair / like a borough wears a riot”. What lingers is the tenderness Taylor has for her protagonists; she knows that liberation never comes without a cost.Hekateby Nikita Gill (Simon & Schuster, £18.99)The first in a trilogy, Gill’s latest verse novel is a retelling of the life of Hekate, the Greek goddess of plants, witchcraft and more. We follow her from her youth, as she discovers why she’s ended up in the underworld, and what her godly powers might be. Making use of fast-flowing tercets and prose poems, it’s a propulsive read, though at times the needs of exposition contort the poetry into flatness. However, Gill is skilled enough to slow the action and allow moments of insight to surface. In Girlhood, Hekate pauses and ponders: “the shifting sands of time took my father from my features. Is that all ageing is? Leaving things you knew and once loved behind to become something brand new?”View image in fullscreenGoatsongby Phoebe Giannisi, translated by Brian Sneeden (Fitzcarraldo, £14.99)Also wrestling with the Greek gods and what their myths might mean for today is Phoebe Giannisi. Goatsong is a compilation of three recent books, all united by a style that, as perhaps befits a professor of architecture, is rigorously intellectual. Yet a focus on the physical grounds the poems: “I open my mouth to speak / but my teeth clench / you a seashell / a hidden word.” Giannisi’s work does not give up its charms easily, but is worth persisting with. Its oddity and opacity put me in mind of Auden’s The Orators. In its own way, Goatsong is saying something important: “I say take me / in your embrace / in your violence / and gently / let me go”.Rishi Dastidar’s latest publication is A Hobby of Mine (Broken Sleep Books).Explore more on these topicsBooksPoetry roundupPoetryreviewsShareReuse this content"

In a San Francisco Bart train tunnel, Don Veca took his recorder and captured a train’s metallic roar – “like demons in agony, beautifully ugly,” he remembers. That recording became one of the most chilling sounds in 2008’sDead Space.“We dropped that screeching, industrial noise at full volume right after the vacuum silence – creating one of the game’s most jarring sonic contrasts,” Veca, who made horror history as the audio director for the Dead Space games, recalls. “Our game designer hated it – but the boss loved it. Over time, it’s become iconic.”Now, almost two decades after Dead Space first terrified players into clutching their controllers, horror game designers around the world still chase that same feeling. So, how do they keep on finding new ways to scare gamers – and what makes us keep pushing start on the horror?The sound of fearAsk anyone who’s worked on a great horror game, and they’ll probably tell you the same thing: true fear starts with what you hear.Veca says it begins in the mind. “It starts with psychology – not the fear of what is, but of what might be,” he says. “Real horror isn’t a mugger with a gun. It’s the shadow behind the door, the silence that lingers too long, the certainty that something is coming … but you don’t know when, or what.”That unpredictability became the theme for Dead Space’s sound design. “We built tension like a slow tide,” Veca says. “Something could happen … something might happen … and then nothing – just a kitten in the kitchen. You laugh, the adrenaline fades, and three seconds later: claws, blood, screaming!”View image in fullscreenInfected … Dead Space.Photograph: EAJason Graves, the Bafta-winning composer behind the score for Dead Space and 2015’s Until Dawn, agrees. “Sound and music prepare the player to be scared – it’s all about the buildup, the tension, and then the release when something jumps out at you.”Graves even treated the score itself as a kind of infected organism. “In Dead Space, something has infected the crew and turned them into monsters, so I ‘infected’ the orchestra,” he says. “Unusual techniques, tapping instruments, no keys or chords – just clusters and tension.” When the player thinks it’s quiet, it might be 60 strings each playing any note they want, very softly. It becomes a living, dissonant room tone – always shifting, unpredictable.”If you doubt how much sound matters, Graves offers a test. “My daughter tried Until Dawn and kept freaking out,” he laughs, “I told her to mute it – and then she got through it fine. If the picture’s off but you still hear something, that’s what our brains are wired for. The monster under the bed, the fin on the water – your imagination fills the gaps, and that’s 10 times scarier than anything we can show.”The human elementFor cult game developer Swery – real name Hidetaka Suehiro – fear has never been about cheap shocks: it’s about the human condition. He began questioning what truly scares players when his mentor, Resident Evil creator Tokuro Fujiwara, once asked him: “What is fear in a game?”View image in fullscreenGame developer Hidetaka Suehiro, also known as Swery.Photograph: White Owls Inc.“I was in my 20s and naively answered, ‘Game over,’” Swery recalls. “He replied, ‘Then are games without a “game over” not scary? Is a haunted house where you can’t take damage not scary?’ I was at a loss. Ever since, I’ve been continually searching for the answer.”That curiosity became the foundation for 2010’sDeadly Premonition– a surreal small-town horror which blends absurd humour with existential dread. “Before crafting fear, we set a clear goal: build the town and its people,” he says, “I even wrote the story after the town existed.”“At the centre of horror there is a human being,” Swery adds. “That human, carrying an inner diversity and suffering, is fragile, and can be defeated by evil … that’s everything.”Though it’s in monsters that our fears are visualised, for Thomas Grip, game director of critically acclaimed 2015 deep-sea horrorSoma, horror is also less about villains and more about what it says about being human.“I think it’s a different kind of scary,” he says. “There’s no big twist or constant jump scares. The whole idea is that it forces you to ask uncomfortable questions: What does it mean to be human? What does it mean to be conscious? What sort of life is worth living?”Forget gore and surprises in the dark – in Soma, it’s more about using silence and philosophy to get under your skin. “The key to any horror story, no matter the medium, is that the audience fills in the blanks themselves,” Grip says. “If your story is just, ‘Here’s something scary, be scared,’ it’s not that interesting. The best horror makes you think about something deeper.”View image in fullscreenDeep sea scares … Soma.Photograph: Frictional GamesThe unknown – and twists on the familiarSomething else to play on is the fear of the unknown, and unease often comes from what isn’t shown. “You shouldn’t spell everything out,” Grip says. “The player only gets glimpses, and their imagination fills in the rest – their own fears, anxieties, and whatnot. That’s where the real fear comes from.” Even the monsters in Soma reflect that idea. “The key is familiarity,” he says. “The best monsters are ones where you think, ‘Something’s off here …’ and the more you look, the worse it gets. People react strongly to things that look infectious or unhealthy. It triggers a primal fear.”In 2021 viral indie horror hit Poppy Playtime, with its factory of cute, murderous toys, fear takes a brighter shape. “Nostalgia carries vulnerability. When we think of childhood, we think of safety – and twist those things, the reaction is visceral,” Zach Belanger, CEO of Poppy Playtime studio Mob Entertainment, says.“That’s what makes Huggy Wuggy so effective. We ask, ‘How can something feel both lovable and wrong at the same time?’” he adds, of the game’s fluffy baddie.View image in fullscreenPixel scares … Loop//Error.Illustration: Koro Pixel StudioIn 2025’s psychological horrorLoop//Error, the images themselves are made spooky by suggestion – leaving detail to the imagination in the form of a blocky, black-and-white pixelated art style. “Using pixelated visuals and the deliberate absence of colour creates unfamiliarity – your mind projects things that aren’t really there,” solo developer Koro says. “It’s like remembering a nightmare: blurry, incomplete, but emotionally sharp.”“The fear in Loop//Error doesn’t rely on horror cliches,” Koro adds, “It comes from human depth. From watching a mind collapse under its own weight, and realising that the scariest place to be trapped is yourself.”The interactive factorFinally, there’s another element that makes horror in video games so impactful: you have to take part yourself.“In a game, you’re not watching someone else flee – you’re in it, and that’s why it feels good: your heart races, but you’re still in control,” says psychologist Kieron Oakland, a specialist in cyberpsychology at Arden University.Daniel Knight, creator of 2020’s ghost-busting multiplayer game Phasmophobia, agrees. “Games put you inside the fear,” he says, of the horror game which took Twitch by storm on its release. “When you decide to open a door or step into a dark room, the fear is yours. You’re responsible for what happens next.”Grip also believes the genre endures for this reason. “In games, you make the decision to walk into danger,” he says. “That makes it personal. The fear comes from you being the idiot walking into the dark tunnel.”After all, scary movies ask what you’d do in the dark. Video games make you find out.Explore more on these topicsGamesAction gamesIndie gamesHalloweenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Inspector Morse: House of Ghosts is in Sheffield this week and Hercule Poirot in Death on the Nile reaches Northampton next week, with both shows on the road well into spring. DSI Roy Grace andDI John Rebusinvestigated deaths live last year.The latest telly cop to be let out of the box is DCI Barnaby who, in Midsomer Murders, has occupied ITV prime time for 28 years, an age that residents of the Hampshire-adjacent village here often need a lot of luck to reach.Writer-director Guy Unsworth starts with the first of Caroline Graham’s source novels, The Killings at Badger’s Drift, which also began the TV franchise in 1997. A horticulturist is found dead in her kitchen, leading Barnaby to overturn the local GP’s verdict of old age after interviewing shifty village eccentrics. On TV, British showbiz stalwarts each inhabit one oddball but three of Unsworth’s main cast of seven actors entertainingly play trios of suspects/victims, enjoyably swapping costumes and genders.All of the screen cops recently brought to stage have at some point filled ITV’s mid-evening, which is significant to the rhythms of these theatre nights. The downtown American murder rate of rural English Midsomer was partly due to another slaying being a good way of bridging the commercial break. Unsworth sensibly uses the interval to the same end and gives great fun with a stage equivalent of TV’s easy cutting, actors sliding in on trucks and Julie Legrand at one point playing two characters almost simultaneously.View image in fullscreenHomicidal panto … John Dougall and Nathalie Barclay in The Killings at Badger’s Drift.Photograph: Manuel HarlanWhile Midsomer Murders is essentially harmless entertainment, there was a scandal and production reboot in 2011 whena producer suggestedthat the series offered viewers a haven from multiculturalism. Unsworth seems quietly to acknowledge this when DS Troy, played by the British-Filipino actor James Bradwell, doing plucky work in an underwritten part, suffers some othering from Badger’s Drift bigots.Daniel Casey, following John Nettles and Neil Dudgeon as TV’s Barnabys, gamely copes with being the straight man among wits and twits. Generally loving towards its source, the adaptation is occasionally lethal, as in an allusion to how Barnaby’s annual appraisal with the chief constable might go, given the body-count on his patch. Another daring touch is verbal; the words “Constable”, in the police sense, and “Picasso”, in its art meaning (paintings are central to the subplot), are delivered in ways that would have ITV up before the regulator.Going for jokes even more than the TV show – particularly in the transposition of English countryside with behaviours from Greek tragedy – Unsworth might be daringly exploring a new genre of homicidal panto. But, as crime stories and cross-dressed comic grotesques are British theatre’s core winter forms, this may be the way to a financial killing. If you don’t watch the TV series, only book a ticket over your dead body but, for fans of the programme, there will be huge pleasures on a tour of the UK and Ireland that, fittingly, continues almost until next midsummer.AtRichmond theatre, London,until 1 November,then touringExplore more on these topicsTheatreTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

The author, a prominent member and co-founder of the Fabian Society, fashioned an absorbing storyline, equal parts innocence and mystery, while subtly suggesting that the British establishment is not always to be trusted. Now, Mark-Anthony Turnage and Rachael Hewer haveturned it into an opera, if not quite for children, then definitely of appeal to a broad family audience. By relocating the action to the 1980s they’ve shaken off the musty clouds of nostalgia that hover around its pages.Rachael Hewer’s forthright libretto is dramatically effective, though it becomes disjointed towards the end (a chorus celebrating the colour of paint representative of the national railway network feels like it wandered in from another show). For the most part, however, it possesses a fast-paced John le Carré meets the Famous Five vibe, nicely mirrored by Stephen Langridge’s lithe-limbed production. Nicky Shaw’s versatile set, lit with pinpoint precision by Mark Jonathan, employs an open and shut camera effect that shifts the action from government office to station platform in the twinkling of an eye. Costumes range from Cold-War chic to 1980s baggy, and in case you still don’t get it, props include a Rubik’s Cube.View image in fullscreenGavan Ring (centre, as Mr Perks) in The Railway Children by Mark-Anthony Turnage at Glyndebourne.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianTurnage’s energetic score, handsomely realised by conductor Tim Anderson and theGlyndebourneSinfonia, bristles with motoric effects (the composer cites Richard Rodney Bennett’s soundtrack to Murder on the Orient Express as an influence). Train noises prove fertile ground, underpinning scene changes and doing duty as a metaphor for emotional tension in general. Shifting strings, harp and flute colour more intimate moments while snippets from The Rite of Spring shadow the appearances of Tarpolski, the Russian dissident. Vividly scored, the averted accident in the tunnel sounds more convincing than it looks.The cast is strong all round, especially Jessica Cale, Matthew McKinney and Henna Mun who are entirely believable as the three children. With her soft-grained soprano, Cale conveys Bobbie’s awakening sense of responsibility as well as her mounting adolescent angst. McKinney is an enjoyably gangly Peter; Mun is cute as a button as Phyllis, who is convinced the whole story is really about her.Rachael Lloyd and Edward Hawkins share a powerful bond as parents Cathy and David, their mutual activities as whistleblowers given greater prominence here than in the book. Gavan Ring makes an endearing Mr Perks, James Cleverton lends authority to underwritten deus ex machina, Sir Tommy Crawshaw, and Bethany Horak-Hallett keeps us guessing as the devious Yolanda.The evening, however, belongs to Turnage. The Railway Children may not feel quite as effortless as his recent adaptation ofFesten, but it’s a commendable addition to the operatic canon nonetheless.Final performance on 1 November, then at theQueen Elizabeth Hall, London on 8 Novemberin a staged concert.Explore more on these topicsOperaGlyndebourneMark-Anthony TurnageClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

Here’s a medieval predecessor of The Exorcist for Halloween. This 15th-century painting shows how deeply rooted the belief in possession by demons is in the European past. The victim here looks ill and distraught, her face agonised and eyes vacant, as the little devil that lived in her is cast out. In other words it’s a realistic painting of some kind of psychological or neurological crisis. In the world of medieval Christendom that might well be diagnosed as possession by a demon. Lippi and his team portray the demon as a dark creature with wings and claws, uncannily jumping out of the victim’s mouth. People would carry on being plagued by such visions into the late 1600s.

And if you were wondering what he’s up to now, in 2022 he returned to his native South Africa to lead first Jazzart Dance Theatre and now JoburgBallet. Founded in 2001, Joburg Ballet has an eclectic rep ranging across styles, subjects and continents. Case in point, this showcase begins with cheesy grins and pointe-shoe petit allegro and ends duetting with the severed head of John the Baptist.View image in fullscreenSouth African steps in pointe shoes … Tumelo Lekana in Prologue: Camagwini from Communication of Light by Joburg Ballet.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianThe cheesy smiles are for Concerto for Charlie, by South African choreographer Veronica Paeper. Made in 1979, it’s named after Revlon’s Charlie perfume (Revlon was the sponsor). The twee neo-classicism looks dated, but I think there’s an element of knowingness going on in the twinkly dancers, who perform well. It grows on you. Hurst’s own piece Resonance feels a little old fashioned too, with its smooth, easy-on-the-eye, jazzy ballet, nice frocks and saxophone soundtrack, but then it shifts into something more unsettling, tilting between between racial antagonism and the harmony of dancing together; an interesting conjunction of prettiness and ugliness in consideration of South Africa’s history.The mixed bill also features a decent contemporary piece set to Spanish guitar by choreographer Jorge Pérez Martínez (dancer Monike Cristina is a stand-out) and a very interesting vignette from dancer Tumelo Lakana, a ritual prayer to his ancestors that honours and transcends tradition as he dances South African steps in pointe shoes.The best piece is Salomé, byDada Masilo, who sadly died in 2024 aged 39.Salomé was one of Masilo’s final works, made for this company, and the urgent energy of the dancers feels like what we’ve been waiting for – it’s as if you can see a mad itch flying through the body of Revil Yon’s John the Baptist. This is a story of seduction and power, and especially being seduced by your own power. Latoya Mokoena’s sensuously commanding Salomé is absolutely believable, and the dramatic beats are spot-on – when they bring out that silver platter it’s like Chekhov’s gun exploding. The ending, when Salomé suddenly sobers up and sees reality, feels genuinely tragic. The real tragedy is that there won’t be any more work from Masilo, but it will be fascinating to see where Hurst leads this company in the future.At Linbury theatre, Royal Opera House, London, until 2 NovemberExplore more on these topicsBalletDancereviewsShareReuse this content"

I’ve seen it numerous times and even though I know what’s coming, the stabbing knife synched with Bernard Herrmann’s score always freaks me out.More recently, I went through a phase of watching Japanese and Korean horror films. I had to stop watching them because they weren’t good for my heart condition, but none of them affected me like the Psycho shower scene. Music set to visuals intensifies the audio experience and other senses. Surrendering to the film-maker’s interpretation of what the sound represents holds you in a heightened state of expectation of the unexpected, which reallyisscary.View image in fullscreen‘Shivers down my spine’ … Cosey Fanni Tutti.Photograph: Chris CarterStephen O’Malley, Sunn O)))Abruptum – Evil (1991)I bought this infamous seven-inch from my friend Odin in 1992 – he was one of the first people to have DIY living room black-metal distros in the States. We didn’t know what this was or which speed to play it, 33rpm or 45rpm. It’s really messed up, demented, improvised doom/black metal saturated with agony and torture. There were lots of rumours and stories about their now deceased leader Tony Särkkä, known as IT, some of which have since been validated by Dan Swanö, the engineer. Back then, we heard it was a recording of someone named IT being tortured and electrocuted during the vocal sessions.There are always criticisms when black metal is exposed to the wider world but I believe darkness is infinitely deeper in the light – and the mainstream is far more messed up today than that obscure dungeon of a scene was in the early 90s.View image in fullscreen‘Cathartic’ … Witch Fever, with Amy Walpole, right.Photograph: Frank FieberAmy Walpole, Witch FeverSloppy Jane – Jesus and Your Living Room Floor (2021)I was drawn to Sloppy Jane’s album Madison because it was recorded in a cave. Jesus and Your Living Room Floor is open to interpretation, but I think it’s a song about loneliness and wanting to be remembered after you die. Some of the lyrics describe dying in really grotesque ways, but then there’s more mundane imagery such as a plastic horse.Having been brought up in a charismatic Christian church – essentially, a cult – until I was 16, I can relate to the religious aspects. I find the song cathartic. It’s a ballad, essentially, but dark, gothic and sad and I love the strange, underground atmosphere. I listen to it all the time.View image in fullscreen‘Deeply disturbing’ … Sparky’s Magic Piano (1947).Photograph: Records/AlamyStephen Mallinder, Cabaret VoltaireHenry Blair – Sparky’s Magic Piano (1947)This was part of a series of mini musical plays featuring a little boy, Sparky, who was trying to master the piano.

The BBC used to run Children’s Favourites on Saturday morning radio, playing music that grownups felt kids would like, often 40s and 50s novelty tunes, which I found deeply disturbing. Even now they trigger a PTSD response.Sparky’s Magic Piano fascinated me and terrified me. When Sparky’s mother was out of the room, the piano would start talking to him in a voice produced by a Sonovox, a primitive vocoder. I think that was the catalyst for my ongoing preoccupation with manipulating voices, but as a five-year-old I was convinced it was a small boy trapped inside a piano for eternity.TheOGM, Ho99o9Herbie Hancock – Paint Her Mouth, from the Death Wishsoundtrack (1974)My dad was a big fan of action films, so I saw Death Wish when I was a kid. We lived in an urban environment that was kinda like the New York depicted in the film, with gangs, muggings and home invasions, so I could relate to it. To me that was much scarier than Halloween or Nightmare on Elm Street.Later on in life I stumbled across the soundtrack, and if you hear it in isolation, it’s truly chilling. Herbie Hancock’s a genius but what I love about this is he gets so much out of so little – like the little snare drum sound or minimalist synthesiser, an echo or some strings. It just feels like darkness, or like someone’s following you, so you need to clutch your purse or have your keys out when you get to your door.Tatiana Shmayluk, JinjerAgatha Christie – Опиум для никого (1994)When I was young, scary cartoons or movies didn’t scare me much. Then, after my older brother introduced me to rock music, I listened to this one afternoon in winter when my parents had gone to work and really got the chills. It’s Russian darkwave. The title translates as Opium for No One. It’s more gothic and melancholy than horrifying, but the words are really dark. “I paint my lips black with shoe polish … the stars shine beautifully at me and hell looks attractive.” Then: “Kill me, kill yourself, you won’t change anything.”At nine years old I didn’t know what it was about and painted pictures in my head. I was born in Russia but grew up in Ukraine, and in those countries in the 90s the music got pretty depressing. Now, I live in California. All my friends have left Ukraine, and when I call my mom, sometimes I hear bombing.Taylor Momsen, the Pretty RecklessJohn Williams–Main Title, Theme From Jaws(1975)I was 10 or 11 when I first saw Jaws and the film would not be what it is without John Williams’s theme. For me, it’s the king of horror themes because of its simplicity. With just two notes and slightly varying the velocity, it creates incredible anxiety. You sense that something is coming, and the two notes replicate the primal simplicity of the shark’s mind.The difference between Jaws and zombie or monster films is that the threat – a shark attack – is real. I love to swim. For a long time I had a house in Maine and would swim in the ocean for hours. God forbid, if that music’s in your head and something touches your foot you start to freak out. You can’t not think: “Shark!”View image in fullscreen‘Convincingly scary’ … William Von Ghould of Creeper.Photograph: Harry SteelWilliam Von Ghould, CreeperNick Cave and the Bad Seeds – Stagger Lee (1996)I remember bringing the Murder Ballads album home in my 20s and my housemate telling me to turn this track off because it was scaring him. Stagger Lee is sort of an update on an American folk ballad, but it’s nothing like the original. It’s extremely graphic, but the scary thing is that the villain is human. Cave is inhabiting a murderous character, but is very convincing. It’s got that crazy, violent line: “I’ll crawl over 50 good pussies just to get one fat boy’s asshole” – it’s probably more shocking now than it was back then. Like a great horror film, the song takes your breath away. We play with a lot of dark, Halloween-type bands but nothing’s as convincingly scary as this.Cassy Brooking (AKA Cassyette)Ethel Cain – Perverts (2025)Ethel Cain [AKA Hayden Anhedönia] came up on my Spotify and slowly seeped into all my playlists. Her album Perverts is the most scary modern music I’ve heard, and quite a departure from her previous stuff. The whole album is drone music, with minimal layers, but she lets each sound linger, which puts you on the edge of your seat.At first I had mixed feelings about it because it’s so genuinely creepy, but her music is infused with guilt and sin and takes you on a journey. It makes me feel deeply, like some sort of exposure therapy. The track Pulldrone reminds me of American Horror Story, one of my favourite TV series, and it’s got the creepiest voice, like a prayer. I love the album, but it’s so terrifying I still can’t listen to it the whole way through.Jamie Stewart, Xiu XiuDiamanda Galás – Schrei x (1996)In my 20s, a friend introduced me to the album Diamanda Galás did with Led Zeppelin’s John Paul Jones [The Sporting Life, 1994]. On the cover he’s driving a cool classic car and she’s leaning across the hood with an insane look on her face, holding a knife. From that moment I wanted to listen to her. To me she’s one of the most intense musicians in history, but Schrei x is her most extraordinarily relentless and frightening work. It’s a genuinely wild, feral music, all a cappella and live.View image in fullscreen‘Music as a flight of harpoons’ … Diamanda Galás.Photograph: Logan WhiteI’m amazed this gut-wrenching use of the human voice happened in a space, with people witnessing it. For a long time when I listened to it I was in disbelief. The other day I listened to it in the gym. It’s a funny record to listen to on the StairMaster.Diamanda GalásIannis Xenakis – Mycenae-Alpha (1978)This is the first sound work Xenakis created for the Upic computerised composition tool he developed to turn hand drawings into electronic music. As a Greek resistance fighter, he had half his face blown apart by shrapnel and was imprisoned many times. His music is ferocious and difficult to perform but extremely innovative.The violence in Mycenae-Alpha attracted me instantly. I realised the composer was a master warrior who used music as a flight of harpoons. I had been working on my first vocal pieces and had already performed Wild Women with Steak-knives (the Homicidal Love Song for Solo Scream) [which appeared on Galás’s 1982 debut The Litanies of Satan], so this work was a confirmation that I was headed in the right direction. An experimental singer needs to have 400 screams at her disposal, so Mycenae-Alpha can be a compositional model.The Mycenaeans were a Greek warrior elite. Their strategy in warfare was unparalleled and their massive walls and architecture were so formidable as to imagine their creation by the hand of a Cyclops. Mycenae-Alpha is as terrifying as the drawings from the giant hand that composed it.Sade Sanchez, LA WitchKrzysztof Penderecki–The Devils of Loudun (1969)This is an opera by a Polish composer based on Aldous Huxley’s book of the same title, which was based on real events in the 17th century. A load of nuns underwent mass hysteria and were all convinced that they were being possessed by demons. There were public exorcisms and people burned alive.The story alone is scary enough and you can hear it in the music, such as the way the main nun goes insane. It’s very cleverly done, with organ, flutes, vocal, a choir and crazy effects such as strange laughter and human noises. It’s not easy to listen to – it’s sung in German, it’s unsettling and spooky – but it’s also really beautiful. You really feel you’re experiencing the women’s despair, highs and lows.View image in fullscreen‘Mass hysteria’ … LA Witch, with Sade Sanchez, right.Photograph: Marco HernandezSpencer Charnas, Ice Nine KillsJohn Carpenter – Halloween soundtrack (1978)In terms of musical impact on horror cinema, John Carpenter’s soundtrack to Halloween is up there with Jaws and Psycho. When they were making Halloween, the film didn’t have a score and the reaction was very bland. John said a20th Century Fox executive told him: “There’s nothing scary about this movie.” Then, when it came out, the same executive called him and said it was tremendous, and John explained that all he had done was add the score.If you listen to Bernard Herrmann’s score for Psycho or Harry Manfredini’s for Friday the 13th, they’re orchestral. The Halloween score is very stripped down, usually no more than a synthesiser, but it’s really unsettling. It conjures up the fear of the unknown, or unseen; an unsettling feeling that something’s wrong.View image in fullscreen‘Unsettling’ … Spencer Charnas of Ice Nine Kills.Photograph: Awaiting credit infoTakiaya Reed, Divide and DissolveShostakovich String Quartet No 8 in C minor (1960)My father played this in the house when I was a child and I was terrified. Much later, I read about Shostakovich’s experience of going to Dresden in 1960 – one of the most heavily bombed cities in the second world war – and feeling the weight of genocide and fascism. He wrote this in three days, like an outpouring. I realised I’d been terrified as a child because I’d picked up a sense of dread or fear from what he was writing about. It has dynamics and energy as well as the power to make people weep. I still find it very moving and uncomfortable, but it’s great to feel.View image in fullscreen‘Diabolical smile’ … Johannes Eckerström, centre, with Avatar.Photograph: Johan Carlén‘Not many people in metal look like me’: Divide and Dissolve, the doom band celebrating Indigenous sovereigntyRead moreJohannes Eckerström, AvatarSumio Shiratori – Moomin soundtrack(1990)As a child I was always drawn to scary things, such as Michael Jackson’s Thriller video with zombies or reruns of The Addams Family or The Munsters, and I loved the songs. Nothing freaked me out like Moomin, the Japanese anime TV series of the Finnish children’s book. It was basically horror for children, featuring a weird ghostly figure called Mårran (the Groke), who radiated cold and had a diabolical smile. However, the author had a great respect for children’s intellect and used her to represent themes of loneliness and loss.The song worked a bit like the theme from Jaws – as soon as you heard the double-bass notes, you knew trouble was coming. The synthesisers are very of their time, but to hear it as a child was to be paralysed by fear. Much later, you reach a point where darker things stop being unpleasant and start to feel exciting.Creeper’s album Sanguivore II: Mistress of Death, Witch Fever’s Fevereaten and Avatar’s Don’t Go in the Forest are all released today (31 October).

As that production now hits the UK, we go behind the scenes (and thrones)Arifa AkbarFri 31 Oct 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 31 Oct 2025 07.55 EDTShareAsinger and dancer inJapan, Marie Sugaya first heard about a musical featuring King Henry VIII’s wives through a friend on a cultural exchange in London. “She spoke of Six so highly that I thought if it were ever to come to Japan, I’d love to be involved. But it was a faraway idea, just a dream.”Similarly, Airi Suzuki, an actor and “pop icon” famed across Japan, travelled to Britain to watch the show last year, purely as a punter. Neither Sugaya nor Suzuki imagined they would ever take to the same stage to perform the Tudor-era musical-cum-rock concert themselves. But they are part of an all-Japanese lineup of queens who are taking over Vaudeville theatre for a week-long run which producers think is the first of its kind: a West End show, translated into Japanese and performed in Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya as part of a sold-out tour, now brought back to the West End with a cast who sing in Japanese (with English captions).It is the latest twist in the life of this feted musical “queendom”, originally arising out of the Edinburgh fringe of 2017, now a global phenomenon. The UK production was performed in Japan at the start of this year followed by its Japanese iteration.View image in fullscreen‘Different in every country’ … Airi Suzuki as Catherine Howard.Photograph: Umeda ArtsWhen co-producers Kenny Wax and Andy Barnes saw the latter, along with co-creators Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss, they felt it had an irrepressible energy that deserved to be experienced in London. “We thought it’d be wonderful for the queendom to do something different,” says Wax. “Six likes to be different; we often do crazy things.”Sugaya plays Anne of Cleves, the fourth wife of King Henry VIII whose marriage ended in annulment (at least she escaped with her head intact) while Suzuki is Catherine Howard, the wife who replaced Anne of Cleves in Henry’s affections but was beheaded less than two years after their marriage, aged only 18 or 19.View image in fullscreenDream role … Marie Sugaya as Anne of Cleves.Photograph: Umeda ArtsBoth actors are sitting in a rehearsal room in London wearing branded T-shirts and speaking of being “super excited to be here”.“Six lasts 80 minutes and it is 80 minutes in which these queens jump out of their oil paintings to speak their own truths, their own histories and individualities,” says Suzuki. “Catherine Howard’s message hasn’t really changed in all these centuries: as humans we all have our own value.”The first piece of music she connected to from the show was, in fact, All You Wanna Do, her character’s solo, which became the entry point for her. Sugaya, also a vocal coach and sailor who was working on a boat a few weeks before being cast for the show, feels a natural affinity with Cleves: “She was also someone who did what she wanted to do. She felt the same sort of freedom [as Sugaya].“There is great value to doing the show in a different language from its original,” she adds. “It feels like a good opportunity to prove we do it with the same passion.”Their characters are an amalgam of the historical and personal. “I am playing 50% Catherine Howard and 50% myself,” Suzuki says, and Sugaya agrees: “Theshow is not only different in every country but different with every cast because of this 50-50 mix.”View image in fullscreen‘These women are given the opportunity to stick two fingers up to Henry’ … Kenny Wax.Photograph: Umeda ArtsWhile Tudor history is not ubiquitously known in Japan, many are aware of this musical and are well versed on the fate of these queens, says Hiroko Murata, director of Umeda Arts theatre and producer of the Japanese Six. “We have two different types of audience in Japan – the Six fans who don’t know the history but love the music and those who do know the history. Theatregoers in Japan really love stories about the throne and the royal family. They are familiar with Shakespeare too.” That means they know about about British royal history.A key theme is giving historical women a voice, says Wax, as well as empowering today’s girls and women. “We talk about it very much as the show being ‘her-story’ rather than ‘his-story’. These women are given the opportunity to tell the story of their lives with Henry, and almost, dare I say it, stick two fingers up to him.”View image in fullscreenSonim as Catherine of Aragon.Photograph: Umeda ArtsFor Sugaya, that message is clear. “History is obviously written around men, and the women [so often] just become accessories. There are a lot of layers behind history. The important thing here is that each person has their own individual history, so there is the importance of making your own history, and also making yourself regal, in a way.”Is this message evident for Japanese audiences, and does its feminism resonate today, especially given the recent election of the first female prime minister, Sanae Takaichi? Murata says the Japanese Six is “not screaming about empowerment or feminism as a show – audiences can take on that sort of message and ignite that feeling of feminism themselves in their hearts”. But at the same time, she speaks of empowerment and extends an open invitation to Takaichi to see the musical for herself.Aside from appealing to diehard Six fans, the run is likely to pull in the West End’s substantial international audience as well as Japanese tourists, says Wax. The international reach of the musical on the whole has been phenomenal, he adds. Currently 15countries are licensed to perform it with more unlicensed, non-replica shows further afield. It has been staged in far-flung terrain, from Korea and China to Singapore and the Philippines. “So many already know the music. Its soundtrack has been streamed 1.1bn times – second only to Hamilton in musical theatre streaming.”View image in fullscreenSold-out tour … the Japanese version of Six.Photograph: Umeda ArtsFor Sugaya, it is incredibly emotional to be performing in the West End, not least because the friend who first told her about it will be in the audience. “She’s coming back to London to watch it with me on stage this time. It’s very moving,” says Sugaya.

Now, a new initiative to offer pathways into cybersecurity could help them put these talents to usePaid for byAbout this contentAimée Grant CumberbatchFri 31 Oct 2025 08.22 EDTLast modified on Fri 31 Oct 2025 08.29 EDTShareThe superfast evolution of technology can create a digital divide between parents and their teens. Gen X and millennials may have had their childhoods transformed by tech, but they’re now parenting generations Z, Alpha and Beta who are traversing entirely different online landscapes, particularly in the world of online gaming.At the same time, cyber-attacks are increasingly in the news, with major players in an array of industries falling victim. Among those under investigation for these hacks are young people with advanced digital skills. In fact,according to the National Crime Agency, one in five children engage in behaviours that violate the Computer Misuse Act, which criminalises unauthorised access to computer systems and data. The figure is higher for those who game, standing at 25%.This is why Co-op is taking a different approach to prevention. As part of its long-term strategy to support young people in putting their tech skills to good use, Co-op has partnered withThe Hacking Games, which is dedicated to helping brilliant gamers get jobs in cybersecurity.This joined-up approach matters because, as former National Crime Agency senior officer and director of 4D Cyber Security, Greg Francis, explains: “It takes a digital village to raise a digital native.” Early intervention is key and parents have an important role to play. “Parents are paramount because they’ve got so much influence, but they can’t be passive, and they need to have a basic understanding of the hacker’s world,” says Francis, who is also a cyber ambassador for The Hacking Games. So where should you start?Take a judgment-free interestFirst, know that an interest in hacking isn’t necessarily cause for dismay.“Ethical hacking is a fast-developing world, and it is understandable that children may be interested in it as an exciting way to use the skills they have developed online,” says Lynn Perry, chief executive of children’s charity Barnardo’s, which is partnering with Co-op to raise funds to support creating positive futures for young people.Keeping conversations open is vital, as is starting them early. “The best time to start is today,” says Perry. “As soon as your child starts showing an interest in online technology, it’s time. Conversations should be frequent and age-appropriate, so that an open dialogue is maintained.”View image in fullscreenSeemingly harmless activities can be the first step on a pathway to cybercrime.Composite: Stocksy/Guardian DesignShe recommends getting involved with your child’s online life when they’re young. “Use technology together and discuss what to do if something unusual or scary pops up. As they get older, they will need more independence, but regular dialogue will still allow children to lead the conversation, ask questions, and share concerns.”For those who came of age in a much more basic digital era than their children, understanding the sophisticated world of online gaming – dominated by titles such as Roblox, Minecraft and Call of Duty – can feel impossible. But both Francis and Perry emphasise that you don’t have to know everything to be able to provide support.Parents of keen gamers should check age ratings and make use of parental controls, including friends-only features to keep in-game chat functions safer. Online initiativeAsk About Games, has detailed information on the most popular games and guides for setting up safety controls.It’s also worth asking if your young gamer has ever been “booted” offline. Booting is a form of DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) in which a gamer hacks another gamer’s IP address and floods it with so much data that it shuts down their internet. To online gamers, booting can seem like a harmless way to get one up on their online rivals, but it’s serious. As Francis explains: “What they don’t realise is that that is a contravention of the Computer Misuse Act.” In fact, DDoSing/booting can beone of the first stepson the pathway to cybercrime that Francis has identified in his work with the multi-agency Prevent programme.Asking questions goes hand in hand with observing red flags such as excessive time gaming online, social isolation, unexplained tiredness, unusual equipment or new technology purchases (especially if you don’t know how they’re being paid for) and multiple email addresses. Just one of these signs isn’t necessarily serious but, collectively, they can be cause for concern.Mary* has first-hand experience of these red flags. “I had a son who was hacking on the darknet. He would lock himself in his room, avoid sleeping, and I literally had no idea what he was doing,” she says. “I met a cybersecurity expert and told him about the challenges I was having with my son. It turned out he was on the darknet trying to enter into the crypto world; he was 13 at the time.”View image in fullscreenMentorship from a trusted source can lead to talented young people using their skills in a positive way.Composite: Getty Images/Guardian DesignA new route for young neurodivergent peopleFor neurodivergent young people in particular, gaming and spending time online can have a major upside when it comes to things such associalisation, and providing ameans to switch off and regulate their emotions. At the same time, it is important to remember that for all of these benefits, the downsides ofinternet or gaming addiction, as well as the associated risk ofbeing lured into cybercrime, remain significant.However, as more than 50% of tech workersself-identify as neurodivergent, according to the Tech Talent Charter, there is a huge opportunity for young neurodivergent people in the sector. That’s why The Hacking Games is directly aimed at “digital rebels” with “raw talent” and “unconventional minds,” matching them with cybersecurity jobs and mentors, as well as providing community via a Discord group chat.In fact mentorship and awareness of career pathways can be transformative, as Mary attests. “The cyber expert supported my son as a trusted source, and then finally ended up mentoring him for me,” she says. “He spent time getting my son to understand that his skills could be put to great use, so he could see the positive side of using his skills on the internet, and as a result, my son also ended up helping others.”While this issue may seem alarming, there are ways for parents to intervene at every stage. Ensuring you remain curious and compassionate, rather than judgemental, is key to helping your child stay on the right path. Here are some top tips for parents who are concerned about their children.1Conversations about online gaming safety should start early and be compassionate rather than condemnatory. Staying calm helps keep communication open.2You don’t need to know everything but healthy curiosity goes a long way. Ask questions about which games your kids are playing and where they’re hanging out online. Think of it this way: you’d ask these questions about who they’re playing with on the playground, so you should ask the same for their online community. Look out for red flags such as strangers friending them, people offering them free things, and being invited to new worlds or games without their friends. These are all grooming red flags.3Be proactive. Game age ratings are useful and there for a reason, but the best way to judge what is appropriate for your child is to take turns at playing games with them yourself, or at least to watch them as they play. And when it comes to pathways into cybercrime, it is worth remembering too that children and young people are just as likely to be recruited on Minecraft as on Call of Duty. Any game with a community or “freemium” options is tantalisingly easy for young people to want to find that extra in-game money or cheat to get the better equipment. That’s how it can start.4Look out for red flags such as social isolation, excessive time spent gaming online, lack of sleep, unexplained tech purchases and multiple email addresses.5Speak to your child’s school. Ask how they’re encouraging digital responsibility and check in with the computer science teacher, who will often know which students need dedicated outlets for their skills. It may be an early chance for them to channel their talents in a positive direction through programmes such asCyberFirstandCyber Choices, or coding communities such asGirls Who Code.*Mary’s name has been changed to protect her family’s anonymityFind out moreHelp keep children and young people safe online with Barnardo’s online safety guidanceExplore more on these topicsFrom Play To Purposeadvertisement featuresShareReuse this content"

Itschocolate,not yet commercially available, is made with techniques that have previously been used to synthesize other bioactive products like certain plant-derived pharmaceuticals for commercial sale.I’m terrible on the field. But my amateurism might actually have benefitsRead moreA few days later, it arrives. The morsel, barely bigger than a coffee bean, is supposed to be the flavor equivalent of a 70%-80% dark chocolate. I tear open its sealed packet and a chocolatey aroma escapes – so far, so good. I pop it in my mouth.Slightly waxy and distinctly bitter, it boasts those bright, fruity dark chocolate notes. I’m no expert, but I enjoyed it – and found it basically indistinguishable from regular dark chocolate.Globally, humans consume more than7mmetric tons of chocolate per year, and our appetite is only growing. In the US, chocolate demandsurgesin October in advance of Halloween; the National Retail Federation estimated a$3.9bnUS spend on Halloween candy this year, with chocolate options like Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups and M&Ms dominating.But the chocolate market has grown volatile in recent years. Cacao trees – which provide chocolate’s essential ingredient – are particularly vulnerable to drought and disease. Additionally, unpredictable weather related to the climate crisis has caused production shortfalls and inconsistent harvests in key chocolate-producing regions in west Africa.View image in fullscreenThe National Retail Federation estimated a $3.9bn US spend on Halloween candy this year, with chocolate options dominating.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesChocolate prices reached a historic high of $12,000 per metric ton in 2024, though the rising costs have not truly deterred consumers, explains Bloomberg Intelligence market analyst Ignacio Canals Polo.Big confectionery companies like Mondelez, Mars and Nestlé are most heavily affected by price hikes. Canals Polo says they are “trying to adjust their portfolios to rely less on cocoa” by “shrinkflating” their products; reformulating recipes to use cheaper ingredients, such as vegetable oil instead of cocoa butter; and promoting non-chocolate confections, like biscuits, gummy candy or chocolate-free spins on classic products – think KitKats enrobed inflavored cream coatings.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’This volatility represents an opportunity for the lab-grown product. California Cultured takes cuttings from regular cacao plants and cultivates the cells on plates containing a nutrient-rich medium made mostly of sugar and plant extracts. The company then grows specific cell types, such as those that produce cocoa butter or cocoa flavanols, explains Alan Perlstein, the company’s CEO. After that comes harvesting, fermenting, drying, milling and packaging the product into, functionally, a lab-grown cocoa powder to be used in confections like bars and drinks.Other companies, such as Nukoko and ChoViva, are developing chocolate alternatives made from ingredients includingfermented fava beansor sunflower seeds. Scientists are experimenting with chocolate made fromground cacao huskstypically discarded in the conventional chocolate-making process.California Cultured is still waiting onFoodand Drug Administration approval to launch its chocolate to market. But it has established its first commercial partnership with the Japanese confectionery company Meiji, which makes Hello Panda and Chocorooms. Perlstein says California Cultured’s processes can facilitate “more interesting flavors, aromas or experiences”.View image in fullscreenCalifornia Cultured has established a commercial partnership with the Japanese confectionery company Meiji, which produces the Hello Panda snack.Photograph: David Tonelson/AlamyInitially, lab-grown chocolate may be more expensive, but Perlstein hopes the price difference will disappear within three years of becoming available. If scaling these processes up is feasible, Americans could be seeing chocolate products with a “lab-grown” designation on shelves as soon as nextHalloween. But will people buy them?“I think in certain niche sectors, like tech, it’s going to be very, very cool to be like, ‘It’s lab-grown chocolate – you can have more control, you can geek out on the very fine nuances,’” says Eagranie Yuh, a former chocolatier and chocolate educator. But Yuh also thinks “most people have a visceral response” to the idea of lab-grown food. A 2023 Germansurveyof 727 people found that food‑technology neophobia – a fear of the new – strongly influenced attitudes about lab-grown meat, though even the wary were at least willing to try it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Yuh says the human narrative behind products can also be important for chocolate consumers, such as knowing that ingredients were responsibly grown and processed by people who were fairly paid.I tried to not procrastinate for a week. Here’s what helped the mostRead moreIt’s unclear how consumers will react to lab-grown products or when they will become available. But chocolate lovers will probably face questions of cost – financial, ecological and ethical.There could be ecological benefits to lab-grown chocolate. Cacao trees are often farmed on deforested land, degrading soil and requiring heavy doses of fertilizer and pesticides. But “the socioeconomic consequences of rolling out [lab-grown chocolate] at large scale could be huge for the smallholder farmers in West Africa”, who rely on cacao sales for their livelihood, says Sophia Carodenuto, a political geographer specializing in global food systems at the University of Victoria.“Lab-grown chocolate may be innovative, but it can’t replace the heritage, livelihoods and soul behind real cocoa,” says Shirley Temeng-Asomaning, founder and CEO of Chocolate Mall, a Ghana-based confectionery company. “My hope is that science will complement and not compete with the farmers who built this industry, and that technology helps make chocolate more sustainable, not less human.”For his part, Perlstein believes the demand for chocolate is “infinite” – and big enough to support new players.“The demands of cocoa are just so ravenous – even if every single cocoa farmer were to expand production constantly year after year, which would be impossible, there would still be a huge demand,” he says, citing the growth of newer chocolate-consuming markets such as China, India and Africa.Demand may exist, Carodenuto says, but “what is needed is for the market to pay more for ethical and ecologically sustainable cocoa”.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyChocolateHalloweenFood (global)Food (Environment)ShareReuse this content"

And what do people want? I’ve been asking myself these questions since closing our restaurantRovifor renovations this summer, taking the opportunity to rethink some of the things we do.It has become clear to me that the restaurant world I’ve known for decades is radically changing through a combination of factors: people’s working patterns, health obsessions, the falling out of love with alcohol and the falling in love with pastries and bread, but, predominantly, the affordability of it all.The numbers are genuinely frightening: in my restaurants, utility costs are up more than 50% since 2019; chocolate prices have doubled; olive oil is up 121%; even spring onions are up 55% – spring onions! Meanwhile, customers are feeling the squeeze just as hard:52% of UK consumershave cut non-essential spending, with 72% of those naming “eating out” as one of their cuts. With London renters now spending an average of41.6% of their income on rentalone, something has to give.My first panicky instinct was: we’re all fighting to survive in an industry that’s eating itself. But step outside and you’ll notice something unexpected. Everyone’s facing the same brutal economics, but the responses are all over the place. Some solutions are radical, some simple, some totally bonkers – and some are really working.Rotisserie chicken is suddenly everywhere:Norbert’sin East Dulwich;Cocotteexpanding beyond its Notting Hill site;Chick’n’Sourspivoting toward rotisserie; newcomers such asChicken Shop. It hits every pressure point: affordable protein, simple prep, fast turnover. Half a chicken and sides for £15 feels like good value when everything else has become expensive and fiddly.This city is often driven by immigrants who arrive with skills, recipes and a bloody-minded determination to make something workThe Yellow Bitternwent in the opposite direction. Instead of making things easier and more affordable, they made them harder and more expensive. Eighteen seats behind Kings Cross station, doorbell entry, a portrait of Lenin watching you eat a £50 lunch, closed for dinner, no cards, no website. When customers didn’t spend enough one day, the chef posted on Instagram asking them to “justify their presence”. Sounds mad, but everyone’s talking about it.The grocery shop-restaurant hybrid is another solution that’s spreading fast, particularly at the higher end. Places likeCorner Shop 180,Honey & SpiceandLeila’s Shopmake the profit margins more manageable by hedging their bets and offering a new kind of dining alongside the shopping experience. It seems obvious when you say it like that, but it’s surprisingly hard to actually do.View image in fullscreenYotam Ottolenghi tucking into the lamb tantuni at Mersin Tantuni London.Photograph: Chaya MayaReading Jonathan Nunn’s bookLondon Feeds Itselfmade me realise what I’m seeing in restaurants is part of something much larger. Nunn writes about how London feeds itself “in so many unusual ways – in its warehouses, mosques, community centres, and even in baths – spaces where monetary transaction is peripheral or even completely absent”. This city has always nourished itself creatively, often driven by waves of immigrants who arrive with skills, recipes and a bloody-minded determination to make something work.I go to Turkish restaurants for some of the best meals in the city. My test kitchen has become obsessed with tantuni (see recipe, below)– we’ll disappear for lunch and come back debating the lavash flatbread, the spice of the butter, whether there wasenoughyoghurt sauce. Right now,Neco Tantuniin Enfield andMersin Tantuniin Dalston are winning.The story of Mangal in Dalston shows how this evolution works. Ali Dirik moved from Istanbul in 1987 and openedMangal I, a real charcoal-cooking restaurant not seen here before. Then he openedMangal IIin 1994, which offers so much of what London wants: small plates, good wine, sharing everything. His son Ferhat runs it now, and has kept his father’s original Adana kebabs while adding dishes like grilled ox heart with sumac and wild garlic. It’s Turkish, but also completely London: that willingness to evolve while staying true to what you are.This pattern is repeating across London. In New Malden, Korean families have built something incredible – a whole strip of restaurants servingpajeonandbulgogito their community. Now, places such asCah Chiare packed with Londoners who’ve figured out that this is some of the best food in the city. In Elephant and Castle, Filipino families opened canteens in community centres before graduating to restaurants likeSarap Filipino Bistroin Soho (since closed but looking for a new home), bringing dishes such assisigandadoboto adventurous London palates.The restaurants thriving now aren’t the ones recreating old models with higher prices. They’re the ones who’ve figured out new models entirelySome of the most innovative responses combine food with community building.Migrateful, founded in 2017, trains refugees and migrants to become cookery teachers, running classes across London where participants learn to cook dishes from Syria, Afghanistan, Eritrea and beyond, while hearing the stories behind the recipes. It’s not so much a restaurant – though the food is extraordinary – as about creating opportunities and cultural exchange simultaneously. Since launching, it has supported more than 200 chefs and served more than 15,000 students.During Covid, we proved how adaptable our industry could be. We became grocers, takeaway specialists and community kitchens overnight. Even restaurants you would normally book weeks ahead – Gymkhana, Lyle’s, Hoppers – started offering meal kits. That same ingenuity has evolved – people building businesses from the ground up with adaptability built in, rather than having to retrofit it during a crisis.The restaurants thriving now aren’t the ones trying to recreate the old model with higher prices. They’re the ones who have figured out new models entirely: the chicken specialists, the doorbell restaurants, the grocery-restaurant hybrids, the community teachers, the cultural translators. They’re not waiting for things to get easier; they’re making excellence work within the constraints they have.I think I’ve been looking at this all wrong. The frantic booking apps, the eye-watering costs, the constant pressure to innovate … These aren’tjustsigns of an industry in crisis. They are signs of an industry that’s more alive and creative than it has ever been.The spring onions will cost what they cost. But people who care about feeding others well keep finding new ways to do it. That’s what resilience looks like.The question isn’t whether London’s restaurant scene will survive – it’s what brilliant, unexpected form it will take next.Pumpkin muhammara with peppers and date molasses (pictured above)This is based on the muhammara we serve at Rovi. The traditional Syrian version is made of roasted red peppers, walnuts and pomegranate molasses, but this one swaps half the peppers for pumpkin, which makes it creamier and less sharp. Look for delica pumpkin if you can find it, or any firm-fleshed, deeply orange squash such as onion squash or crown prince. We usepilpelchuma(a fermented pepper paste) for the topping, but rose harissa works just as well. You can roast the pumpkin and peppers the day before, which makes this ideal for parties when you need something mostly hands-off.Prep30 minCook50 minServes6-81 smalldelica pumpkin(900g), halved and deseeded6 red peppers(800g)60ml olive oil1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed2½ tbsp lemon juice80g walnuts, lightly toasted and roughly chopped2 tbsp date molasses, plus 1½ tsp extraFine sea salt and black pepper50g pilpelchuma, or rose harissa1 tsp cumin seeds, roughly crushed½ tspaleppo chilliTo serveSeeded crackers or pitta breadHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Place the pumpkin halves cut side down on a lined oven tray, arrange the red peppers alongside and drizzle both with a tablespoon of oil. Roast for 25-30 minutes, by which time the peppers’ skin should be blistered and blackened in places. Lift them off the tray, put them in a bowl and cover with a plate to steam. Continue to roast the pumpkin for another 20-25 minutes, until softened, then leave to cool completely.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Using a spoon, scoop out the flesh of the pumpkin halves, and discard the skin and any hard caramelised bits. You should end up with about 400g roast pumpkin flesh.To make the muhammara, put the pumpkin and 200g of the peppers in a food processor. Add the garlic, 2 tablespoons of lemon juice, 50g of the walnuts, 2 tablespoons of the date molasses, 1¼ teaspoons of salt and a good grind of pepper. Pour in 170ml water and blitz until completely smooth and silky.Chop the remaining pepper flesh into 1cm pieces and put these in a bowl with the remaining 3 tablespoons of oil, ½ tablespoon of lemon juice, the extra 1½ teaspoons of date molasses, the pilpelchuma (or harissa) and ¼ teaspoon of salt. Mix well.To assemble, spread the muhammara on a platter, followed by the chopped pepper mix and all its oil. Scatter over the remaining walnuts, cumin seeds and aleppo chilli, then serve with plenty of seeded crackers or pitta.Lamb and aubergine tantuni with garlic yoghurt and burnt butterView image in fullscreenThere’s a spot in east London calledMersin Tantunithat my team and I love – small, always busy, with a griddle visible from the street. Tantuni is Turkish street food from Mersin on the southern coast: finely chopped lamb or beef cooked on a griddle until crisp at the edges, mixed with tomatoes and peppers, then wrapped in the thinnest possible lavash bread and rolled like a cigar. It’s cut into fat rounds, doused in burnt butter and arrives at your table still sizzling. This version adds aubergine, which soaks up the lamb fat and spices, going soft and almost creamy. The burnt butter – with cumin and aleppo chilli – is what makes it feel authentic. Lavash is available in Middle Eastern supermarkets; you want the thinnest you can find, warmed briefly over the hot lamb so it softens and picks up the juices without going soggy.Prep30 minCook40 minServes2 as a main or 4 as a snackFor the lamb1 tbsp olive oil300g lamb shoulder, cut into 1cm pieces1 large or 2 small aubergine(300g), cut into 1cm piecesFine sea salt and black pepper1 small garlic clove, peeled and crushed¼ tsp smoked paprika1 tsp cumin seeds, lightly ground in a mortar1½ tbsp pine nutsFor the garlic yoghurt100g Greek yoghurt1 small garlic clove, peeled and crushed1 tsp lemon juiceFor the sumac onions1 red onion(125g), peeled and thinly sliced1 tbsp lemon juice¾ tsp sumac10g picked parsley10g picked mint, roughly tornFor the burnt butter40g unsalted butter¼ tsp cumin seeds, lightly crushed1 tspaleppo chilli⅛ tsp smoked paprikaTo serve2 lavash bread or 4 of the thinnest flatbreads you can getPut the oil in a large saute pan on a medium- high heat and, once hot, add the lamb, aubergine, ½ teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, for 15 minutes, until golden. Stir in the garlic, paprika and cumin, cook for another 30 seconds, then pour in 200ml water, stir well and cover with a lid. Turn down the heat to medium, and cook for another 20 minutes, until the water has evaporated and the lamb is tender. Stir in the pine nuts and cook for another 3 minutes.Meanwhile, put all the yoghurt ingredients in a bowl with a tablespoon of water and a good pinch of salt. Mix well and set aside at room temperature.For the sumac onions, put the onions, lemon juice, sumac and ⅛ teaspoon of salt in a bowl. Mix gently with a spoon and set aside to cure until bright pink. Add the parsley and mint just before serving.Put the butter in a small saucepan on a medium heat and cook for 3-4 minutes, until the milk solids have browned at the bottom of the pan and the butter smells nutty. Add the cumin, aleppo chilli and paprika, cook for 30 seconds more, then take off the heat.To assemble, briefly dunk the lavash over the hot lamb to soften and soak up some of the fat and juices. Divide the lamb between the two lavash, arrange half the sumac onions on top (sav the rest for serving) and roll like a cigar with the seam side down.Using a serrated knife, cut the tantuni into 4-5cm pieces and arrange these seam side down on a serving platter. Spoon over the yoghurt and pour over the hot butter. Serve with the remaining sumac onions on the side.Explore more on these topicsRestaurantsFoodLondonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That means the best Android phone for you could still be the one in your hand.If your battery doesn’t last as long as it used to, replacements are often available from the manufacturer or third parties, and start at about £50, depending on the make and model. If your Android is slow or apps won’t install, check you have enough free storage – ideally at least 2GB. Space can be freed up by uninstalling unused apps or content, clearing out your messaging storage, offloading photos and videos to the cloud, and deleting music and podcasts you no longer listen to.For more, read our guide onhow to make your smartphone last longerWhen to replace your AndroidIf your phone’s worn out, broken beyond repair or no longer receives crucial security updates, it’s time to upgrade. Most older Androids received only three years of software support from release date – not from purchase – with newer, better models getting five to seven years. Replacing a phone that has stopped receiving security updates is essential because it will be more vulnerable to hackers and cybercriminals.The best Android phones in 2025View image in fullscreen‘Offers almost everything that Google’s top-tier phones do’: the Google Pixel 10.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianBest Android for most people:Google Pixel 10View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian128GB, £799 at Argos128GB, £799 at AmazonThe Pixel 10 has set a new bar for what you should expect from a flagship phone. It’s the best choice for most people with its balance of cost, size and features.It looks and feels great, with satin aluminium sides and Google’s standout camera bar protruding from the glass back. The 6.3in OLED screen is crisp and bright, and its 120Hz refresh rate keeps scrolling smooth.A rapid ultrasonic under-screen fingerprint scanner and 2D face recognition make it easy to unlock the Pixel 10. It feels very responsive, coming with the same Tensor G5 chip as Google’s most expensive phones, along with 12GB of RAM and at least 128GB of storage. The battery will last up to two days of general use between charges, too.The Pixel 10 is one of the first Android phones to build inQi2support into the back. As well as fast and easy wireless charging, this opens up compatibility with magnetic accessories, including those made for Apple’s MagSafe iPhones, such as wallets, phone grips, stands and car mounts.The phone runs some of the best Android software you can get and is guaranteed monthly security and feature updatesuntil at least August 2032. This year, Google introduced a collection of useful new advanced AI tools, too, most of which run locally for speed and privacy.Highlights include various Gemini, writing, translation, dictation and image-editing tools. The most advanced is Magic Cue, which runs in the background pulling data from your calendar, Gmail, maps, notes, screenshots, contacts and messages to suggest information when you need it. If a friend texts to ask when your flight is due to land, Magic Cue will show the time and date directly on the messages screen to quickly paste into your conversation. Or when you phone a business to check where your delivery is, the system will present a card in the phone app, pulling the order details straight from Gmail.Finally, Google has also righted one of the few wrongs of2024’s Pixel 9by giving the Pixel 10 three cameras on the back, including a new 5x telephoto camera. That makes it one of the best camera systems available, including some great features such as Auto Best Take and Add Me for group photos, plus the new AI Camera Coach, which can guide you to taking a better photo.Why should you buy it?The Pixel 10 offers almost everything that Google’s top-tier phones do, but at a lower price. It has a great triple rear camera (with 5x optical zoom), cracking software, cutting-edge AI tools and a high-quality screen, all packed into a manageable size.Buy if:you want a premium, Google AI-packed phone with a good camera for slightly lessDon’t buy if:you want a massive screen or the very best camera on an AndroidRead our fullGoogle Pixel 10 review: the new benchmark for a standard flagship phoneScreen:6.3in 120Hz FHD+ OLED (422ppi)Processor:Google Tensor G5RAM:12GBStorage:128 or 256GBTested battery life (with overnight standby):48 hoursCamera:48MP, 13MP UW, 10.8MP 5x, 10.5MP selfieDust and water resistance:IP68 (1.5m for 30 minutes)Dimensions:152.8 x 72 x 8.6mmWeight:204gBest Android for camera:Google Pixel 10 ProView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian128GB, £999 at John Lewis128GB, £999 at ArgosThe Pixel 10 Pro takes everything that is good about theregular Pixel 10and turns it up a notch. Its 6.3in OLED is slightly brighter, slicker and crisper, making it one of the very best on a phone. The polished aluminium sides look and feel expensive, while the rapid fingerprint and face scanners feel responsive.And Qi2 support opens up compatibility with a large collection of magnetic chargers and accessories.It has the Tensor G5 chip, 16GB of RAM and at least 128GB of storage, plus up to two days of battery life. The 10 Pro also comes with a year’s subscription toGoogle AI Pro– usually costing £18.99 a month – which provides access to the more powerful Gemini Pro, image- and video-generating models, and 2TB of cloud storage.It comes with the same Android software and AI tools as the regular Pixel 10, with supportuntil August 2032.The biggest upgrade is in the camera, adding more powerful sensors including a 50MP main, 48MP ultra-wide and 48MP 5x telephoto camera, the latter of which can stretch to 10x with a crop zoom. This trio can make the most out of practically any lighting condition or environment.But the 10 Pro is also the first to include generative AI directly in the camera. Zoom to a maximum of 100x magnification, and a local genAI model will process the image, adding back the detail and sharpness lost by digital zoom. It’s not perfect, but the results can be very impressive.Why should you buy it?The Pixel 10 Pro has the best camera on an Android phone, plus top software, cutting-edge AI tools and a high-quality screen that’s large but not enormous (if a huge screen is what you want, look toGoogle’s Pixel 10 Pro XLinstead).Buy if:you want the best camera on a phone that’s still relatively pocketableDon’t buy if:you want a massive screen or super-long battery lifeRead our fullGoogle Pixel 10 Pro review: one of the very best smaller phonesScreen:6.3in 120Hz QHD+ OLED (495ppi)Processor:Google Tensor G5RAM:16GBStorage:128, 256 or 512GBTested battery life (with overnight standby):48 hoursCamera:50MP, 48MP UW, 48MP 5x telephoto, 42MP selfieDust and water resistance:IP68 (1.5m for 30 minutes)Dimensions:152.8 x 72 x 8.6mmWeight:207gBest Android forbattery life and a big screen:Samsung Galaxy S25 UltraView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian256GB, £1,249 at Samsung256GB, £1,249 at Carphone WarehouseIf money is no object and you want the biggest and best screen on an Android coupled with superb battery life, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra lives up to its name.The huge 6.9in screen is the brightest and best around, wrapped in a titanium frame with tiny bezels. Four cameras on the back rival the Pixel 10 Pro for the best, including 3x and 5x telephoto cameras. Inside, it has the fastest Android chip available, 12GB of RAM and at least 256GB of storage, while its two-day-plus battery life helps it go the distance.The S25 Ultra has great software with support until 2032, so you can keepusing it for longer with proper care. The phone is packed with loads of the most advanced AI tools – which are still a bit hit and miss – plus a stylus for handwriting and doodling on the screen.Despite being thin and not too heavy, the S25 Ultra is super-sized, which means it requires two hands to use most of the time and might be a struggle to fit in pockets. It also launched at an eye-watering price, which has come down a little but still tops most competitors. Look outfor deals on the refurbished market.Why should you buy it?The S25 Ultra is the reigning superphone champ with the best screen, the fastest chip, very long battery life and more cameras on its back than any other, plus plenty of AI features and even an integrated stylus.Buy if:you want the superphone with the best screen, long battery life and all the extrasDon’t buy if:you don’t want a huge phone at a high costReadour fullSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra review: still the superphone to beatScreen:6.9in 120Hz QHD+ OLED (500ppi)Processor:Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for GalaxyRAM:12GBStorage:256, 512GB or 1TBTested battery life (with overnight standby):58 hoursCamera:200MP, 50MP 0.6x, 10MP 3x, 50MP 5x, 12MP selfieDust and water resistance:IP68 (1.5m for 30 minutes)Dimensions:162.8 x 77.6 x 8.2mmWeight:218gBest smallAndroid:Samsung Galaxy S25View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian256GB, £709 at Argos128GB, £799 at SamsungA truly small flagship Android doesn’t exist, but Samsung’s regular Galaxy S25 is the most manageable you can get.It has a great and relatively small 6.2in screen, slim bezels and flat aluminium sides, and it weighs only 162g, making it feel nice and compact. Despite being much cheaper, the regular S25 has the same super-quick chip as its much larger S25 Ultra sibling, plus plenty of RAM and at least 128GB of storage. A decent triple camera, including a 3x telephoto zoom, is on the back.The S25 also runs the same Android version as the rest of Samsung’s top phones, including loads of AI tools and support until 2032, so you’re not missing out just because it’s smaller.The only downside of the more compact size is a smaller battery. It will still last a solid day, but not much more. You can also find better cameras on slightly larger rivals.Why should you buy it?The S25 is the last great Android flagship at this size, and it doesn’t skimp on features despite its compact and lightweight frame.Buy if:you want a smaller flagship phoneDon’t buy if:you need very long battery life or a big screenReadour fullSamsung Galaxy S25 review: the smallest top-tier Android leftScreen:6.2in 120Hz FHD+ OLED (416ppi)Processor:Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for GalaxyRAM:12GBStorage:128, 256 or 512GBTested battery life (with overnight standby):37 hoursCamera:50MP, 12MP 0.6x, 10MP 3x, 12MP selfieDust and water resistance:IP68 (1.5m for 30 minutes)Dimensions:146.9 x 70.5 x 7.2mmWeight:162gBest value Android:Google Pixel 9aView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian128GB, £449 at John Lewis128GB, £449 at ArgosGoogle’s latest A-series Pixel is the best yet, squeezing almost everything great about the Android-maker’s high-end phones into a relatively affordable handset.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

It’s sleek, but looks a bit generic compared with Google’s previous standout camera designs. It still looks and feels good and has full IP68 water resistance, plus an optical fingerprint scanner and face unlock.The 9a has the same Tensor G4 chip aslast year’s top Google phones, keeping it snappy in operation, while the battery lasts a good two days between charges. It only has 8GB of RAM, which isn’t particularly noticeable in day-to-day use but does curb some of Google’s more advanced AI tools. The 9a still has great software, including Gemini, which will be supported for afull seven years from release– almost unheard of at this price.The best part is the camera. While it only has a main camera and an ultrawide one on the back, it shoots better photos than many phones twice the price. In fact, it’s only a smidgen behind the regular Pixels in low light. The 9a even has Google’s popular Best Take and Add Me AI features, plus full access to Magic Editor and other tools.A few corners have been cut, though, including the plastic back rather than glass, an older generation of scratch-resistant glass on the screen, and the lack of support for Android’s built-in spatial audio system for headphones.Why should you buy it?The Pixel 9a offers a top-tier experience at a much cheaper, mid-range price, making it the best value flagship Android by a mile.Buy if:you want an excellent Android with flagship experience and a great camera for lessDon’t buy if:you want a telephoto cameraReadour fullPixel 9a review: Google’s cut-price Android winnerScreen:6.3in 120Hz FHD+ OLED (422ppi)Processor:Google Tensor G4RAM:8GBStorage:128 or 256GBTested battery life (with overnight standby):57 hoursCamera:48MP, 13MP ultrawide, 13MP selfieDust and water resistance:IP68 (1.5m for 30 minutes)Dimensions:154.7 x 73.3 x 8.9mmWeight:186gThe best of the restView image in fullscreenSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 7View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian256GB, £1,599 at AO256GB, £1,799 at SamsungBest for:a book-style foldable phone:Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 7 is a remarkable device. It fits a large 8in screen inside an incredibly thin body, which folds like a book to transform it from a tablet to a phone.It weighs just 215g and is only 8.9mm thick when folded, with a large, slick and bright 6.5in screen on the outside. It looks and feels just like a regular slab phone. But open it up and you’ll reveal a huge, high-quality internal screen in a body that’s just 4.2mm thick – barely thicker than the USB-C port and slimmer than even the new breed of ultra-thin phones such as the S25 Edge.It’s ready for films, books, browsing and serious multitasking with up to eight apps open on screen at once. The Fold 7 has Qualcomm’s top Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, 12GB of RAM and at least 256GB of storage, helping it fly along regardless of what you’re doing. A battery life of almost two days rivals big slab phones, while five cameras, including a trio of quality cameras on the back (with a 200MP main and 3x telephoto cameras), do a good job of capturing life.The foldable phone has a rapid fingerprint scanner in the power button and runs the same quality Android asSamsung’s top S25 phones, including the Now bar, Gemini and other AI tools. In addition, it offers multiple modes that really take advantage of the folding form in ways that rivals don’t, and software support will last until 31 July 2032.But while the Fold 7 is water resistant, it’s not dust resistant. Like all foldables, the internal screen is softer than regular hardened glass, so it must be treated with care. It’s very expensive and repairs are just as pricey, so make sure you get insurance.Why should you buy it?The Fold 7 is super thin and light. Its outside offers a high-quality screen and all the trimmings of a regular phone, yet it also packs a huge internal screen with power to spare. It feels like the two-in-one future.Buy if:if you want the best phone-tablet hybrid without the bulk or compromise (other than cost)Don’t buy if:you’re rough with your phone or need extended camera zoomRead our fullSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 review: the thinner, lighter and better folding AndroidOutside screen:6.5in 120Hz FHD+ OLED (422ppi);inside screen:8in 120Hz QXGA+ OLED (368ppi);processor:Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy;RAM:12GB;storage:256, 512GB or 1TB;tested battery life (with overnight standby):47 hours;camera:200MP, 12MP UW, 10MP 3x; 10MP+10MP selfie;dust and water resistance:IP48 (1.5m for 30 minutes);dimensions folded:158.4 x 72.8 x 8.9mm;dimensions unfolded:158.4 x 143.2 x 4.2mm;weight:215gSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 7View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian256GB, £979 at AO256GB, £1,049 at SamsungBest for:a flip-style foldable phoneThe Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 takes a big and bright 6.9in OLED screen and folds it in half to fit more easily in your pocket. New in this generation is a bigger outside screen that fills the front of the phone when closed, which can be used for accessing a selection of apps, widgets and Gemini without opening the handset.The Flip is particularly attractive in blue with a good wallpaper on the outside screen, and it’s been slimmed down to only 6.5mm thick when open. The phone feels responsive with solid performance and a great fingerprint scanner in the power button on the side. But battery life is a little on the short side, lasting a day or so, meaning it can’t keep up with larger slab phones for staying power.The dual rear cameras are solid, but the lack of a telephoto camera means you’re limited to wide and ultra-wide shots. The Flip’s party piece is the ability to shoot selfies using the main cameras, with the outside screen acting as a viewfinder.It runs some of the best Android software available with lots of AI tools, including Google’s Gemini, Circle to Search and the Now bar for keeping up with ongoing activities, such as sports, music playback or timers. With software support until 31 July 2032, the Flip 7 is the all-round best flip phone on the market.This is a relatively iterative update, though, solast year’s Flip 6is worth looking at if you can find a good deal. As with other folding devices, the Flip 7 is water- but not dust-resistant, and its internal screen is softer and more fragile than a regular phone, so accidental damage insurance will be prudent.Why should you buy it?The Galaxy Z Flip 7 is a great-looking clamshell that squeezes a huge screen into your pocket. It has great software and support as standard.Buy if:you want a big screen in a compact formDon’t buy if:you’re rough with your phone or need the best cameraRead our fullSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 review: great-looking and fun, but iterative AndroidOutside screen:4.1in 120Hz OLED (345ppi);inside screen:6.9in 120Hz FHD+ OLED (397ppi);processor:Samsung Exynos 2500;RAM:12GB;storage:256 or 512GB;tested battery life (with overnight standby):36 hours;camera:50MP, 12MP ultrawide, 10MP selfie;dust and water resistance:IP48 (1.5m for 30 minutes);dimensions folded:85.5 x 75.2 x 13.7mm;dimensions unfolded:166.7 x 75.2 x 6.5mm;weight:188gOther Androids to considerView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianGoogle Pixel 10 Pro XL: it offers everything that’s great about the 6.3in Pixel 10 Pro, but with a super-size 6.8in screen and longer battery life.Google Pixel 9 Pro:last year’s standard Pro Pixel is still a contender for the best smaller phone and will get updates until at least August 2031, so it is still worth buying at a decent discount.Google Pixel 9 Pro XL:the predecessor to this year’s Pro Pixel was also great, with updates until at least August 2031, making it worth looking at on a deal or refurbished.Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge:its exquisite, super-slim form is quite something, but comes at the cost of camera and battery life.Samsung Galaxy S25+: this middle-of-the-pack Samsung flagship is good, but it’s bettered at either end by its siblings and costs more than rivals.

This means the more recently the phone was launched, the better the buy.From smash-proof cases to updates: how to make your smartphone last longerRead moreBroadly, there are two types of refurbished Android: those that manufacturers, includingSamsung, refurb and sell almost as new, and those refurbished by third parties that come in various grades or conditions (see our guide below).Do not buy:any model older than 24-36 months old, because you’ll get only a few years of software support before you’ll have to replace it. Older Android phones get less than five years of support from when they were first released, not from when you bought them.any phone without access to the Google Play Store and Google’s services, which are needed for most mainstream apps in the UK.Quick GuideA buyer’s guide to refurbished phonesShowSeveral third-party retailers offer refurbished phones, including the UK high street chainsCeXandGameand online stores such asmusicMagpieandEnvirofone. Marketplaces likeAmazonandeBayand refurb specialistBack Marketalso have a wide range. And some phone operators, includingO2,giffgaff,EEandVodafone, sell refurbished iPhones.The condition of the phone is among the most important things to consider before parting with any cash. This is graded as follows:Grade A– virtually identical to a new phone on the outside, usually with the original box and accessories. These are often customer returns rather than trade-ins and are the most expensive.Grade B– in full working order but typically with light scratches, dents or nicks, and may come with original accessories.Grade C– in full working order but visibly worn and typically sold without original accessories.Grade D– also known as “for spares and repairs” or similar. These are broken devices sold for people to fix or gut for parts.Once you’re satisfied with the condition of the phone, be sure to also size up the device’s:Battery health– batteries wear out, typically only maintaining up to 80% of their original capacity after 500 full-charge cycles (about two to three years of nightly charging). Has it been replaced?Charging port– check for signs of damage, as these are among the first parts to break.Buttons– do they all work without pressing too hard? Broken buttons make phones difficult to use and can be expensive to fix.Fingerprint scanner– is the fingerprint reader functioning as it should? Scratches or repairs can cause them to be faulty.Network locks– check the phone works with the provider of your choice, as some are originally sold locked to certain networks and must be unlocked before being used on another.Unauthorised parts– not all repairs are done by the manufacturer or using certified parts, which can affect performance.Check it isn’t stolen– check the phone’s 15-digit IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number against adatabase of stolen devicesthrough a service such asCheckMENDor similar.Warranty– what kind of warranty does the retailer offer on its refurbished phones?Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.How we selectedFlagship phones come at a premium, so you should expect the very best technology and performance throughout years of use. When I chose which phones to test, I considered:Performance– a top-tier chip and snappy performance are essential to keep a phone fast throughout its useful life.Software– should be up to date and come with a minimum of five years of Android updates from release, ideally longer.Great displays– you should expect high-quality displays with high brightness for outdoor use, high pixel density to keep things crisp and high refresh rates to keep scrolling smooth.Cameras– are the main battleground for the flagship phone manufacturers, so expect the best with multiple lenses and plenty of features.Battery life– should stand up to hard use, at least lasting when used all day.Build quality– top-tier phones aren’t cheap, so they should be made to last with high-quality, ideally recycled materials, scratch-resistant glass and proper water resistance.Sustainability– accidents happen, and even the longest-lasting batteries do wear out, so phones should be repairable with real options for replacement batteries, screens and other parts.Quick GuideHow I testedShowWe combine real-world testing with various tools, such as benchmarking systems that perform standardised tasks. These help us  evaluate a phone,  measure its performance, confirm that it works as expected and compare it with its competition and predecessors.We use the phones at different times and in various environments, from firing off emails on packed commuter trains to weekends spent shooting photos in national parks, and everything in between. We do everything a typical smartphone user would, such as messaging, browsing, using apps, listening to music, watching videos, playing games and navigating the real world. That gives us a good impression of how a smartphone handles the rigours of day-to-day life – plus, it shows us how long the battery lasts and the strength of its wireless performance.The findings from our general use of the phones are combined with the results from specific tests for things such as the camera zoom, video playback and charging, to inform the reviews and help us rank the devices.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Why you should trust meI’ve been reviewing consumer electronics for 18 years, with more than a decade spent as the Guardian’s gadget expert. In that time I’ve seen all manner of tech fads come and go, smartphone giants rise and fall, the cutting edge morph into the mainstream, and I have poked, prodded and evaluated more than 1,000 devices –sometimes to destruction.Samuel Gibbs is the Guardian’s consumer technology editorThis article was originally published on 24 October 2024.

The last time I wrote to you was in the midst of our Australian winter, as the wind tippity-tapped tree-branch morse code on the windows and I tried to summon spring with the might of several tins of summer tomatoes and some inspiration from the Feastrecipe archives.Well, allegedly, our spring has sprung, though you wouldn’t be able to tell, seeing as one of the challenges – or joys – of living in Melbourne is that this city’s concept of “seasons” is a little more fluid than most. Blustery winds have kept the trees dancing, wreaking havoc on the darling buds of May – sorry, October – and sending enthusiastically woven “cobwebs” and otherHalloweenparaphernalia flying.But I can guess which vegetable is going to be on your supermarket shelf, no matter which side of the international date line you are on: pumpkin! This is the time of year when European eaters are reaching for pumpkins to make soups and curries, while many across the Atlantic are mostly just carving them up. So, how to find more things to do with pumpkin than souping or sculpting? It helps to remember that pumpkin is also known as winter squash – and what’s summer squash? Courgettes or, as I say, zucchini. So anything courgettes were doing in the warmer days, pumpkins and butternut squash can do once the trees start dancing.Georgina Hayden’s sun-drenchedroast courgettes with preserved lemon(pictured below) could be swapped with roast chunks of pumpkin, treated in pretty much the same way and timed for closer to 30 to 40 minutes in the oven. Similarly, Tom Hunt’ssummer squash scarpaccia, a crunchy, gluten-free option for pizza lovers that harnesses the power of polenta, can be pumped up with thinly sliced pumpkin instead.View image in fullscreenAlso works with pumpkin … Georgina Hayden’s roast courgettes with feta and preserved lemon.Photograph: Emma Guscott Photography/The GuardianThe moisture and sweetness in these seasonal squashes is what makes them such a fabulous addition to fritters and loaves. Between you and me, mypumpkin and chickpea fritters(pictured top) are a total riff on mychickpea and zucchini free-for-all fritters. And just imagine Yotam Ottolenghi’scourgette and tomato loafmade with grated pumpkin and jarred peppers instead. Delish!I even love slipping pumpkin – and courgettes, for that matter – into sweet bakes. Thomasina Miers’scourgette, pistachio and lemon syrup cake, for instance, could easily be made with grated pumpkin instead. I find grating pumpkin on a box grater better for baking, because it breaks up more of the pumpkin’s cell structure and helps access more of its naturally sweet juiciness. You’ll have similar success with Ravneet Gill’smini courgette and olive oil cakes, and they may even be a lovely alternative to offer trick or treaters … if you’re feeling generous enough to share, that is.If you’ve always found pumpkin a little on the mushy side, treat it like a standing rib roast and leave it in a cool, dry place for a month or so to cure, dry out and intensify in sweetness; just remember to give it the odd turn every now and then, a tip I learned from Aussie chef Simon Bryant, one half of legendaryThe Cook & The Chef.My week in foodView image in fullscreenBoo!

And it’s only right to have them in a s’more, the American classic that’s also now part of the festivities over on this side of the pond. Digestive biscuits are typically the go-to, but I like to add extra flavour, depth and texture by using ginger oaty biscuits instead. These are quick to put together and don’t require any chilling. Ideally, the s’mores would be made over a real fire, but a blowtorch or hot grill will do the job, too.Ginger biscuit s’moresPrep5 minCook30 minMakes9100g unsalted butter25g honey130g plain flour120g caster sugar45g oats2 tsp ground ginger½ tsp bicarbonate of soda½ tsp salt9 squaresdark chocolate9 marshmallowsFlaky sea saltHeat the oven to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5 and line two oven trays with baking paper. Melt the butter and honey in a saucepan, then leave to cool a little.In a bowl, mix the flour, sugar, oats, ground ginger, bicarb and salt. Make a well in the middle, pour in the melted butter mix, and stir until it all comes together into a thick dough. Roll the dough into 18 balls weighing roughly 25g each, then flatten them a little and arrange on the lined trays (if you want them to be perfectly round, use a biscuit cutter slightly larger than the biscuits to shimmy them into shape).Bake for 15 minutes until well browned. Once they’re cool enough to handle, transfer to a rack to cool completely.To make the s’mores, put a square of chocolate on the base of half the biscuits and top with a marshmallow. Blowtorch the tops or place under a hot grill until the marshmallow is lightly browned and softened. Sprinkle a bit of sea salt on top, then sandwich with another biscuit.Explore more on these topicsFoodThe sweet spotMarshmallowsBiscuitsDessertBakingBonfire NightrecipesShareReuse this content"

I found it’s a place where you don’t have to hurtle down ski slopes or dance like crazy at après-ski parties. In fact I was amazed when I took the 20-minute cable car from the city centre up 2,000 metres to an area where locals were sitting in deckchairs on the snow reading books and sipping hot chocolate in the strong Tirolean sunshine. You can ski to your heart’s content on slopes just half an hour from the famousImperial Palacein the city centre. The city authoritiesprovide some guided free walks and winter activities, including a cross-country skiing taster if you have a Welcome Card provided by your hotel. Then again, you can just sit and sample strong Austrian coffee orGerschtnsuppe (soup with barley, smoked meat and vegetables) at riverside cafes and pubs.GinaProfileReaders' tips: send a tip for a chance to win a £200 voucher for a Coolstays breakShowGuardian Travel readers' tipsEvery week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels.

For skiers the resort village of Pradollano is at 2,100 metres, from which cable cars and chairlifts reach up close to the 3,000-metre summits. It’s a fantasticski resort, Europe’s most southerly, but is still very much under most people’s radar. There are 112km of pistes and 134 slopes, most of which are well above 2,000 metres so snow is fairly reliable. This year it’s opening on 29 November with ski passes from €38. It’s little more than an hour’s drive to Motril and the Mediterranean. You really can ski in the morning and go to the beach in the afternoon.Stephen McCannPeaks of the Balkans, Albania and MontenegroView image in fullscreenHrid lake in Montenegro.Photograph: Mikhail Kokhanchikov/AlamyLast year I enjoyed a brilliant winter trip in the Albanian Alps and in Montenegro. Highlights included the walk to and from the spectacular Grunas waterfall inTheth national parkin Albania, and the hike to 1,970-metre Hrid lake in Montenegro’s Prokletije national park. We skied and walked a section of the 120-milePeaks of the Balkans trailand spent some time in the lively town of Plav, which included a folk song and karaoke night with some locals where I taught one group a version of Last Christmas to great applause.NickThe Alps in infrared, AustriaView image in fullscreenFurx is a great base for walks.Photograph: Ingeborg Kuhn/AlamyWe stayed at the lodgeJagdhaus(€220 a night, sleeps up to 6) at Furx in western Austria.

I’d had a bad day, and was thinking, “F-everybody.” My wife’s sister was hosting a party that night and I had two costume options – Jesus, or Homelander, the psychopathic superhero from Amazon Prime seriesThe Boys. Because of my state of mind, I went with Homelander. I’d already bought the costume, complete with its stars and stripes cape.We live in Greenville, Ohio and the party was a short drive across town. My wife, Chelsey, was behind the wheel, dressed as Starlight, another superhero from The Boys, and my kids were in the back of the car in their Iron Man and dragon outfits. Chelsey took a turn down a road as we neared her sister’s house and that’s when I saw flames shooting out of another house.I said, “Honey, pull over and call 911.” As I leapt out, Chelsey said, “What are you doing?” The kids were both staring from the back seat. “Don’t worry,” I said, “I’ll be right back”, and took off towards the burning house.There were people out front, including some big dudes. I ran up and asked, “Is anybody inside?” The biggest guy looked at me and said, “I’m not sure.” I was shocked, and said, “What? Why is everybody just standing out here like they’re at a hog roast?” Pulling open a screen door, I hollered, “Is anybody in here?” I heard the sort of noise someone makes when they get hit in the stomach and lose their breath – a kind of wheezing sound.I felt kind of like a douche – I’d have been much more comfortable in jeans and a T-shirt“I’ll be right back,” I said again, and dived in, thinking, “This is going to be really tough.” As I did so, my cape hooked on a bannister and for a moment I was caught. Then the Velcro gave out and the cape floated back to the street, where a woman caught it. It looked cool, actually. I said, “Hold that – I’m going to need it later.”Experience: I’ve been on television more than 2,500 times (but you won’t know my face)Read moreInside, I was immediately surrounded by flames. The costume was polyester, which melts if it gets too hot, and I knew I’d have to be quick. Along a short hallway I found a stairwell, and at the top I could see the silhouette of what looked like a person lying down. Running up, I found an unconscious man. I’m 5ft 9in and he was pretty big compared with me, but there was no time to try to wake him – it was so hot and the smoke and flames were closing in. I just grabbed him by his shirt and his belt loops, and made for the door, cradling him like a 6ft baby.Outside, I carried him to the kerb and did sternum rubs on him. Finally, he came to, but when he saw the cops and fire department pulling up, he leapt to his feet and took off. The police caught and questioned him. The house wasn’t his – it was empty while being sold, and I gather he’d broken in and passed out. I don’t know what caused the fire – there was no electricity, so perhaps he’d lit a small one and it had got out of hand. He left that night after refusing medical treatment, but apparently someone heard him say he owed me his life. I’ve not met him since.By then, firefighters had swept the house and established there had been no one else in there. Several people asked which superhero I was. I said, “He’s really more of a super jackass” – helping people is not something Homelander typically does. I hadn’t set out that night to save anyone myself, but I don’t think the costume affected my actions – I’ve helped people out of car wrecks before, I just think it’s what you should do.If anything, I felt kind of like a douche – I’d have been much more comfortable going into that house in jeans and a T-shirt. But I still retrieved my cape so we could go on to the party. We were close enough to sit out at the back and watch the fire being put out.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

When I heard Antony Starr, who plays Homelander on the show, had shared my story on social media, I couldn’t believe it. He wrote: “I never been a prouder parent.” As for my own children – five years on, they’re proud of me, too. One of them still tells kids at school that his dad’s a superhero. Given Homelander’s true nature, I’ll just have to make sure he never watches the show.As told to Chris BroughtonDo you have an experience to share?

I love Bonfire Night. I grew up in a village where people would start constructing a bonfire on the school playing fields in the last weeks of October. The baked potatoes would glisten in tinfoil in the big round barbecues dusted off from summer; the inevitable drizzle would mix with firework smoke, making everything smell pleasingly petrochemical.It’s fitting that floral fireworks can be found at this time of year too. In my garden, a few bright orange nasturtiums usually hang on, flashing like embers among the murk of the soil. Salvias, dahlias and asters, too, their flashy colours bright stalwarts against dim mornings and a month that literally begins with “No”.People go wild about putting their garden to bed, but leaving perennial herbaceous growth helps invertebrates and provides interest and textureBut what if you want to host a little Bonfire Night shindig in the garden this year? I have no idea about buying fireworks – go to your local shop for that. But making your garden party-ready in the depths of autumn? Let’s fire(work) away!First, clear away the vestiges of summer. I’ve still got a couple of deckchairs lurking around. These may end up becoming your seating – more on that later. But algae-collecting water-play tables and mouldering trampolines – into the shed or on to Facebook Marketplace they go.Around this time of year people go wild about putting their garden “to bed”, but leaving perennial herbaceous growth that isn’t likely to sprout too high on the stem (Verbena bonariensisand fennel are guilty of this, and I tend to cut back any that are getting vigorous) helps invertebrates and provides more interest and texture than tucked-in, bare beds.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Sow green manure in your garden and you’ll reap the benefitsRead moreBonfires are, obviously, far from good for the environment. But there are an increasing number of smokeless firepits on the market, offering all the glow with less of the carbon footprint.If you’ve got permanent seating that stays out all year, get a brush and a damp cloth to clean it, then dig out your less precious blankets and cushions to cosy it up.Lighting is crucial. Candles will fare better inside lanterns, but jam jars will do. You can string them up around the garden with thin wire. Solar-powered fairy lights are increasingly available in warm white; I’d recommend charging up the sensor for a few sunny days before use and taking them down afterwards, as squirrels and foxes will nibble through the wires.If you have an outdoor kitchen, then you can have a full-blown Bonfire Night feast.

Since the day I lost her, my life has been turned completely upside down. There is no peace, no normal any more. I feel numb and empty, like I’m existing rather than living.”The prosecution of Webber has not helped. “In lots of ways this really doesn’t feel like justice,” McCready added. “This is hard to explain, but we should not have had to put up such a fight. It has drained us when we should and could be grieving our daughter.”McCready said the family were relieved at least that because Webber had admitted the assault, there had been no trial. But she said: “This is far too little too late given everything that flowed from this.”Beck joined the army aged 16 in 2018. She was sexually assaulted by Webber during an exercise in Hampshire in July 2021. She reported what had happened to her bosses but the police were not informed and Beck was encouraged to accept a letter of apology from Webber.Later that year she did not report that another man – a male line manager – was bombarding her with texts and voice messages, apparently having lost faith in the complaints procedure. She was found dead at a barracks in Wiltshire in December 2021.At the end of the inquest in February, the coroner Nicholas Rheinberg strongly criticised “systemic” flaws in the way the army had investigated the sexual assault, saying the senior officers involved had sought the least serious punishment for the attacker.View image in fullscreenLeighann McCready with her daughter, Jaysley Beck, who was sexually assaulted in the army and later killed herself.Photograph: Family handoutAfter the coroner’s conclusions, Beck’s family, supported bythe Centre for Military Justice, asked Wiltshire police to investigate. They passed on a file to the Service Prosecuting Authority, which charged Webber.Asked why she thought it had taken so long to get to this point, McCready said: “Jaysley was disbelieved, dissuaded from reporting and then urged to accept a letter of apology – the army ensured nothing else was done – and because the chain of command breached their own rules in not reporting it to the police.“I told the army about her sexual assault allegation very shortly after she died, at a meeting, but nothing happened. Even after the army’s own internal inquiry established that something bad had happened at the hands of Michael Webber, nothing happened.“Even after the inquest, it was for us to write to Wiltshire police to ask them to investigate, and it was only that, finally, that resulted in the case being sent to the Service Prosecuting Authority. At every stage we have had to push for this ourselves.”The month after the end of the inquest, the Ministry of Defenceannounced a new specialist tri-service teamto take the most serious complaints outside the single service chain of command. It has also announced that anindependent armed forces commissioneris to be brought in. But Beck’s family feel there is a lack of detail.McCready said: “There have been a lot of empty promises. We wrote before the inquest to the MoD to ask them to look again at how to improve army complaints and nothing happened. Then they rocked up at the inquest to say that they still did not need to changethe complaints system, and they only agreed to bring about some changes after a public outcry following the inquest’s conclusions.“They have finally said they will introduce a more independent complaints scheme but we are concerned it may not really amount to very much. We are still waiting to see what it looks like anyway, eight months on from the inquest.”Beck’s mother said that until there was “proper change”, she would advise young women not to join the armed forces.She said: “They [those in charge] protect themselves and not the soldiers. That is what happened to Jaysley. Army recruits are at such a vulnerable age when they first join up, and as females they are in such a minority, surrounded by lots of men.“Jaysley’s [army] friends talked about the vile and degrading behaviours they had to put up with. I would urge anyone going through anything like this to speak up, get outside help and not to suffer in silence.

As with similar resolutions in previous years, the text makes no mention of a referendum on self-determination that includes independence as an option, which is the solution long favoured by the pro-independence Polisario Front and its allies, includingAlgeria, Russia and China.Western Sahara is a phosphate-rich stretch of coastal desert the size of Colorado that was under Spanish rule until 1975. It is claimed by Morocco and Polisario Front, which operates from refugee camps in south-western Algeria and claims to represent the Sahrawi people indigenous to the disputed territory.The US, which sponsored the resolution, led 11 countries in voting in favour, while three countries – Russia, China and Pakistan – abstained. Algeria, Polisario’s primary benefactor, opposed the measure.UK swings behind Morocco’s autonomy proposal for Western SaharaRead moreMike Waltz, the US ambassador to the UN, said the vote had been “historic” and would “build on the momentum for a long, long overdue peace in Western Sahara”.Amar Bendjama, the Algerian ambassador to the UN, said that while the resolution was an improvement on previous iterations, it “still has a number of shortcomings”.“It is below, below, I say, of the expectations and the legitimate aspirations of the people of Western Sahara, represented by the Polisario Front,” he said.The resolution says “genuine autonomy under Moroccan sovereignty could constitute a most feasible solution”.The measure also renews the UN peacekeeping mission in Western Sahara for another year, as has been done for more than three decades. Prior extensions, however, have not included a reference to Morocco and its allies’ preferred outcome.The UN resolution calls on all parties involved to “seize this unprecedented opportunity for a lasting peace.” Depending on progress, it asks António Guterres, the secretary general, to review the peacekeeping mission’s mandate within six months.The shift could unsettle a long-stalled process that for decades has eluded resolution, despite a UN peacekeeping mission that was designed to be temporary. Demonstrations have ensued in Sahrawi refugee camps in Algeria this week, where people have vowed not to give up their fight for self-determination.Morocco controls nearly all of Western Sahara, except for a narrow strip known as the “free zone” that lies east of a Moroccan-built sand wall.A 1991 ceasefire was meant to pave the way for a referendum on self-determination, but fighting over voter eligibility prevented it from taking place.Over the years, Morocco has transformed the disputed territory, constructing a deepwater port and a 656-mile (1,055-km) highway. State subsidies keep food and energy prices low, and the population has ballooned as Moroccans settle in cities such as Dakhla and Laayoune.Polisario withdrew from the ceasefire in 2020 after clashes near a road Morocco was paving to Mauritania.The group has since regularly reported military activity, while Morocco has mostly denied open conflict. TheUnited Nationscalls it “low-level hostilities”.In response to the draft resolution, Polisario said that it would not join any process aiming “to ‘legitimise’ Morocco’s illegal military occupation,” saying peace “can never be achieved by rewarding expansionism”.Morocco’s Foreign Ministry did not respond to questions before the vote but its king, Mohammed VI, said afterwards that the move was “opening a new and victorious chapter in the process of enshrining the Moroccan character of the Sahara, which is intended to bring this issue to a definitive close”.The conflict is the driving force in north African diplomacy. Morocco considers support for its autonomy plan as a benchmark for how it gauges its allies.Last October, UN envoy Staffan de Mistura suggested partitioning Western Sahara, a proposal neither side accepted. He urged Morocco to clarify what autonomy would entail and warned a lack of progress might raise questions about the United Nations’ role and “whether there is space and willingness for us to still be useful.”The push to reassess the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara comes as the United States slashes funding for UN programmes and agencies, including peacekeeping.US officials are taking an a la carte approach to funding, picking which operations and agencies they believe align with Trump’s agenda and which no longer serve US interests. They argue that the UN’s budget and agencies are bloated. They pledge to halt new contributions pending a review of every UN agency and programme.Explore more on these topicsWestern SaharaAfricaMoroccoUnited NationsAlgerianewsShareReuse this content"

Abu Lulu, a commander in the RSF, featured in numerous videos that emerged after Sunday’s attack on El Fasher of fighters executing people in civilian clothing.Sudan’s brutal civil war – what has happened in El Fasher?Read more“The detention of Abu Lulu appears to be a PR stunt to deflect global anger and shift attention away from the militia’s responsibility for this massacre,” said Mohamed Suliman, a Sudanese researcher and writer based in Boston. “However, many Sudanese did not buy into this and launched a hashtag: ‘You are all Abu Lulu’ – meaning the entire militia acts like him.”Since the fighter’s arrest, images have been shared on social media of various RSF leaders, including the chief, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, as well as politicians considered to be linked to him, with the name Abu Lulu written underneath each of their faces.Open-source investigators theCentre for Information Resiliencesaid they had verified images that showed Hemedti’s brother and deputy, Abdul Rahim Dagalo, was present in El Fasher during the attacks.Hala al-Karib, a prominent Sudanese activist focusing on violence against women with the Strategic Initiative for Women in the Horn ofAfrica, said the focus on arresting one man was a “painful joke” intended to deflect from the scale of the violence inflicted by RSF forces in El Fasher and elsewhere.“There is absence of accountability and indifference to our humanity. Hundreds of thousands of Sudanese have perished daily, and young girls and women have been ruthlessly raped during the past three years. Still, all they do is try to silence our suffering,” she said.mapKarib said the RSF could not be trusted to investigate itself, saying it had not changed since its origins as a collection of ethnic-based militias known as the Janjaweed, who carried out massacres inDarfurduring the 2000s on behalf of the Sudanese government.A civil war between the RSF and the Sudanese army began in April 2023 after a power struggle between the two forces and the conflict quickly spread across the country.Karib said that when the former president Omar al-Bashir was imprisoned after being ousted during protests in 2019, the military-led transitional government that took power was not trusted internationally to hold Bashir accountable for crimes committed in Darfur during the 2000s and there was pressure to hand him over to the international criminal court, where he faced charges of genocide.El Fasher mapKarib said: “The international community did not trust the Sudanese government during the transition to prosecute al-Bashir. You want us to give RSF/Janjaweed credibility? This is a mockery.”Shayna Lewis, a Sudan specialist at Preventing and Ending Mass Atrocities, which works closely with Sudanese civil society, said previous investigations the RSF had claimed it would launch after serious violations had not resulted in any form of accountability.“This tactic by the RSF is a diversion,” she said. “They’re attempting to show that the massacres on the ground are the work of a few rogue soldiers rather than a systematic policy of genocide, which we have seen since the very earliest days of the war, committed by the RSF, particularly in Darfur. These claims of accountability run hollow. It’s a farce.”The UN human rights office spokesperson, Seif Magango, told reporters in Geneva on Friday that hundreds of civilians and unarmed fighters could have been killed while trying to leave El Fasher.He said: “Witnesses confirm RSF personnel selected women and girls and raped them at gunpoint, forcing the remaining displaced persons – around 100 families – to leave the location amid shooting and intimidation of older residents.”View image in fullscreenAid groups have said the children and families arriving in displacement camps from El Fasher require urgent medical help.Photograph: Mohammed Jammal/APA survivor from El Fasher, who spoke to reporters at a press conference organised by SIHA, said the RSF attacked with heavy artillery while its fighters shot at civilians and looted their homes.“Some of my brothers were killed in front of me. I don’t where my mother or father are, I don’t know where my little sister is,” he said.He said he managed to escape El Fasher in the evening but saw corpses of civilians lying along the side of the route to Tawila. Some had track marks from where cars had driven over them. “There was another group of civilians behind us but they were taken by the RSF. They were tortured, whipped and vehicles rolled over them. The RSF are merciless,” he said.The World Health Organization confirmed reports that at least 460 patients were killed in several attacks on the Saudi maternity hospital in El Fasher.A spokesperson, Christian Lindmeier, said six health care workers were taken in the first attack on the hospital. Soldiers then returned twice and “finished off what was still standing, including other people sheltering in hospital”.According to the International Organization for Migration, more than 60,000 people were displaced from El Fasher and nearby areas between 26 and 29 October.There is concern about the fate of tens of thousands of people afterMédecins Sans Frontières(MSF) raised alarm about only a few thousand arriving in the Tawila displacement camp west of El Fasher, which has previously been a key destination for displaced people in the area.“[The arrivals are] far fewer than the 250,000 civilians estimated to be in El Fasher until last month. Reports from those who fled, as well as credible sources, indicate mass killings, indiscriminate violence and ethnic targeting inside the city and on the roads to escape it,” MSF said.View image in fullscreenPeople who have fled El Fasher gather at a camp in Tawila, Sudan.Photograph: Mohammed Abaker/APMSF added that 100% of children under five, who are all being screened as they arrived, were malnourished.“They are victims of torture, gunshots on the road, travelling by night, they were forced in El Fasher to eat animal feed, which has caused really bad abdominal problems, especially in children,” said Giulia Chiopris, an MSF paediatrician in Tawila. “Our surgical teams are working non-stop.”An activist who fled to Tawila after the RSF’s attack on the Zamzam displacement camp in April said those who had arrived had to walk for at least two days. “Many men were killed and some women were tortured,” he said. “Everyone is ill or injured.”Sudanese civil society groups have reported that displaced families are also arrivingin nearby villages in north Darfur.Explore more on these topicsSudanAfricaDarfurMiddle East and north AfricaWar crimesMédecins Sans FrontièresnewsShareReuse this content"

The pair discusses how congress delegates drove the wave of the African independence movements that followed, the parallels between 1945 and 2025, and what Pan-African activists today can learn from the experiences of those at the talks.Chris also speaks to fellow MancunianKeisha Thompson, a programme manager for the Guardian’s Legacies of Enslavement programme. They discuss the way she grew up under the Pan-African shadow of the congress, what Pan-Africanism offers in terms of identity, and how to navigate the multiple visions of Pan-Africanism that exist in this moment.To find out more about what Pan-Africanism might look like in the future, Chris speaks toSteven Golding, a professor of Garveyism, about recent moves towards political and economic pan-Africanism. The pair discusses the self-proclaimed Pan-Africanist Ibrahim Traoré, the charismatic leader of Burkina Faso dominating social media, and the idea that Pan-Africanism should not be judged through a European lens.Finally, Chris attends a Manchester dance show being held bySee My Worldin commemoration of the 80th anniversary of the congress, and talks to local attendees about what Pan-Africanism means to them today.This bonus episode follows a six-part series for theCotton Capitalproject, which looks at the Guardian’s links to transatlantic slavery and the legacies of that history.

Added to figures from other places around the country, the overall figure is around 700,” he said.He added that the toll could be much higher because killings could be happening during a night-time curfew that was imposed from Wednesday.A security source told AFP there had been reports of more than 500 dead, “maybe 700-800 in the whole country”.Amnesty International said it had received information that at least 100 people had been killed.Kitoka said Chadema’s numbers had been gathered by a network of party members going to hospitals and health clinics and “counting dead bodies”.He demanded that the government “stop killing our protesters” and called for a transitional government to pave the way for free and fair elections. “Stop police brutality. Respect the will of the people which is electoral justice,” Kitoka said.The Guardian has approached the government for comment.View image in fullscreenPeople hold rubber bullets and teargas canisters after a post-election protest.Photograph: Thomas Mukoya/ReutersTanzanians went to the polls on Wednesday in an election in which President Samia Suluhu Hassan was expected to strengthen her grip on the country amid rapidly intensifying repression and the exclusion of key opponents from the presidential contest.In April, Tundu Lissu, the vice-chair of Chadema, wasarrested and charged with treason and cybercrime offences. His party, which had led calls for a boycott of the election unless electoral systems were reformed, was later disqualified from participating.Last month, Luhaga Mpina, the leader of ACT-Wazalendo, another opposition party, was also disqualified, meaning Hassan will contest only lesser-known opponents from minor parties.Government critics were also abducted and arrested in the run-up to the election.Since Wednesday, huge crowds of protesters have attacked police and destroyed property belonging to businesses connected to the ruling party.The demonstrations were focused mainly in the port city of Dar es Salaam but have since spread across the country.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The RSF now controls all major urban centres in Darfur, a development that raises the possibility the country could face partition.Sudan mapWhat has happened in El Fasher this week?In a statement on Sunday, the RSF said it had “extended control over the city of El Fasher from the grip of mercenaries and militias”. The day after, the Sudanese army chief, Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, confirmed that his forces had withdrawn from the city “to a safer location”, effectively conceding its loss.Since then the RSF has been accused of killing hundreds of unarmed civilians in ethnically motivated attacks. The group has also been accused of hunting down specific individuals, detaining civilians, and releasing them only after receiving ransom payments – a pattern consistent with what happened after the RSF took over other major cities.Yale University’s Humanitarian Research Lab has said the level of violence is comparable to the first 24 hours of the Rwandan genocide.How do we know about what is going on?International journalists are not on the ground in Darfur, and news agencies have been unable to reach residents in El Fasher, where the Sudanese Journalists’ Syndicate reports that communications have been cut off under a media blackout.Much of what is known about the atrocities has instead come to light from video footage – much of it filmed by the RSF themselves – geolocated by journalists and human rights analysts; testimony from survivors who escaped to the nearby town of Tawila; and, crucially, satellite image analysis conducted by the Yale lab.El Fasher sitesVideos have emerged showing“dozens of unarmed men being shot or lying dead, surrounded by RSF fighters”, according to the UN. Separately, footage shared by pro-democracy activists appeared to show bodies scattered on the ground alongside burnt-out vehicles.In a report released on Tuesday, the Yale lab said El Fasher “appears to be in a systematic and intentional process of ethnic cleansing of Fur, Zaghawa and Berti indigenous non-Arab communities through forced displacement and summary execution”. Analysts also identified what appeared to be “door-to-door clearance operations” across the city, where militants went house to house committing a series of acts of violence.The Yale team said satellite images also showed large “clusters” consistent with adult human bodies and red discoloration on the ground.Who are the RSF and what are the origins of Sudan’s civil war?The RSF was officially formed in 2013 from the remnants of the Janjaweed militia, deputed by Sudan’s former authoritarian leader Omar al-Bashir to suppress a tribal rebellion in the Darfur region. That operation ended with the genocide of up to 300,000 people.A civil war between the RSF and the Sudanese army began in April 2023 after a power struggle between the two forces, and the conflict quickly spread across the country.View image in fullscreenA displaced woman rests in Tawila after fleeing El-Fasher.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesBoth sides have been accused of a litany of human rights violations and war crimes against civilians. The US, UN and others have also determined that the RSF has committed genocide and mass rape against ethnic Masalit and non-Arab communities in Darfur.In August that year, famine was declared in the Zamzam camp for displaced people, south of El Fasher. In April, the RSFkilled as many as 2,000 peoplewhen it seized the camp, which at the time housed 500,000 people.What role is the international community playing?The world appeared to be placing some focus on Sudan earlier this year when a conference held in London brought together 17 countries, as well as the EU and African Union,to discuss the conflict. It was accompanied by some new pledges of aid, and was billed as an effort to build a new consensus on a way forward. But there was widespread criticism that some of the countries at the conference were allegedly involved with the conflict, most notably the United Arab Emirates.Sudan’s military governmenthas accused the UAE of supplying arms to the RSF, which the Emiratis have denied. In April, a leaked UN experts’ report found “multiple” flights from the UAE, as transport planes made apparently deliberate attempts to avoid detection as they flew into bases in Chad, where arms smuggling across the border into Darfur has been monitored.The UAE’s relationship with the RSF can be traced back to the 2015 Yemen war, where the RSF was used to recruit fighters who were sent to Yemen to fight for the Saudi and UAE forces. The UAE’s interest in Sudan is also down to its gold, most which has ended up in the UAE in recent years.Explore more on these topicsSudanAfricaMiddle East and north AfricaexplainersShareReuse this content"

The town centre has been annihilated and now resembles a demolition site.Among the crumpled buildings and streets filled with zinc sheets from roofs and other dangerous debris are people traumatised, bewildered, grieving and desperate for help. Families with children who appear to be setting up residence in a bus shelter and others scouring the debris for food are indications of an unfolding humanitarian crisis.Some had come to Black River, the parish capital, from nearby devastated areas hoping to find aid, only to discover a scene of utter devastation.View image in fullscreenA flooded roadside home.Photograph: Ina Sotirova/The GuardianSpeaking through tears, Beverly Stephens, who survived the storm with her son and elderly mother who is unable to walk, asked the Guardian to “tell the world thatJamaicaneeds help”.Having sought refuge in a room that had a reinforced roof, she said, she and her son spent three hours holding a door that the wind seemed intent on ripping off.The death toll from the storm, which hit Jamaica, Cuba, Haiti and the Dominican Republic hardest, is thought to be 50 – 19 in Jamaica and 31 in Haiti – and is expected to rise. Communication networks remain largely down in Jamaica and Cuba and the full scale of the damage could take days to confirm.Map of hurricane’s path over JamaicaAbout 462,000 people were without power in Jamaica, the country’s information minister said on Friday night.The hurricane tied with a 1935 record for the most intense Atlantic storm ever to make landfall when it hit Jamaica on Tuesday, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.One woman in Black River told the Guardian she was on the way to the police station to report a death. Another, choking back tears, said she had lost everything.Annette Royal, who was visiting Black River from the western parish of Westmoreland, said every house in her area was hit.“The country mash up,” she said. “We need food, we need water, we need shelter, we need everything to survive, because if we don’t get all of things we will suffer in Jamaica.”View image in fullscreenA ruined church in Black River.Photograph: Natricia Duncan/The GuardianAston McCatty, a religious education teacher, said it was clear it would take “billions upon billions” to rebuild.Pointing across the road to a demolished parish church, he said: “You are looking at hundreds of years of history, in one day totally destroyed. How do you rebuild all of this? Nobody in Jamaica can say they have ever seen anything like it.”In the nearby tourism community of Treasure Beach, residents were also stunned by the unprecedented power of Melissa, which had swept away an entire beachfront restaurant, leaving no trace of its existence, and dragged tombstones out of their place.Allan Daley, 67, a fisher, said his house lost part of its roof and his boat was severely damaged by a large shipping container smashing into it.“I am 67, I went through hurricanes, including Gilbert [in 1988], and I have never seen anything like this,” he said. “It was the hardest wind I ever felt in my life.

We don’t have electricity, we need material like zinc, board, cement, steel, nails,” he said.Tourists caught up in the storm were also on the beach on Thursday assessing the damage. Sri Sudevi, from Islington in London, and her daughter Rachel Dimond, who had come to Jamaica for a two-week holiday, said they had to flee their accommodation and head to the hills when it became clear the hurricane was going to be a major threat.Describing the people of Treasure Beach as strong, resilient and friendly, Sudevi said she had been having a wonderful holiday before Melissa struck.Dimond, who was stranded in Treasure Beach in 2020 during the Covid-19 crisis, said that during the hurricane she was particularly concerned about not being able to communicate with family in the UK after she lost power and mobile phone and internet services.But she said: “Treasure Beach people look after each other, they keep each other safe, so I knew that I was in safe hands. If I have to be anywhere for a hurricane, I’d be in Treasure Beach.”View image in fullscreenBritish tourists Sri Sudevi, right, and Rachel Dimond.Photograph: Ina Sotirova/The GuardianNear the beach, Candace Dryden, a local chef who was leading a World Food Kitchen operation to provide hot meals and drinking water to residents who had no power or running water, said: “A warm plate of food will remind people that they’re still home.”She said: “We’re just a little bit uncomfortable right now but we still have each other and we’re still here cooking with love.”Theresa Rodriguez-Moodie, the chief executive of the Jamaica Environment Trust, said Melissa’s strength and slow movement were “clear signs of climate change”.“The science shows that while we may not see more storms overall, the ones we do get are becoming stronger, wetter and more destructive. Category 4 and 5 hurricanes are now more frequent in our region,” she said.“For theCaribbean, this means more intense storms like Melissa, longer recovery times and greater social and economic strain. If global emissions aren’t drastically reduced, these kinds of events will become more of the norm.”Leaving St Elizabeth in the late evening, heavy-duty military vehicles stacked with mattresses and other supplies could be seen navigating the difficult roads to bring what people hope will be relief for those caught in Melissa’s aftermath.Explore more on these topicsJamaicaHurricane MelissaCaribbeanAmericasHurricanesnewsShareReuse this content"

Aside from Carney, he met Japan’s new prime minister,Sanae Takaichi, and is expected to hold talks with the South Korean president, Lee Jae-myung, on Saturday.Carney is reportedly aiming to restart broad engagement with China – Canada’s second-biggest trading parter – after years of tension and amid a rapid deterioration of Canada’s ties with the US since Trump won his second term in the White House.Under Trudeau, the Chinese government detained and executed Canadian nationals and interfered in federal elections, according to Canada’s security authorities.US officials defended Trump’s departure from the summit straight after his talks with Xi – a decision critics say demonstrated his lack of engagement with Apec countries, which together account for 40% of the world’s population and 50% of trade.When asked why Trump had left on the eve of the leaders’ summit, Casey Mace, a senior administration official, said the US’s contribution in Gyeongju had been “very strong and robust”.Washington’s engagement in the region was in evidence in Malaysia, where the US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, met his counterparts from China and India on Friday at the start of an Asean defence summit.In a post on X, Hegseth said he had told his Chinese counterpart, Dong Jun, that the US would “stoutly defend its interests” and maintain the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific. He also voiced concern about Chinese military activities in disputed areas of the South China Sea and around Taiwan.The US and India signed a 10-year defence cooperation framework that Hegseth hailed as “a cornerstone for regional stability and deterrence”.Xi’s first encounter with Takaichi was potentially the most awkward of his round of bilateral meetings. Japan’s first female prime minister is hawkish on China’s military buildup in the region and has targeted wealthy Chinese people in calling for a crackdown on foreigners who buy up property and other assets in Japan.Takaichi and Xi said they wanted to build a “strategic and mutually beneficial relationship”, despite longstanding differences over historical and territorial issues.“Japan and China share responsibilities for the peace and prosperity of the region,” Takaichi said. “While there are various pending issues and challenges between our countries, I hope we can reduce those and increase dialogue and cooperation.”Xi reportedly said he wanted to keep communicating with Takaichi to keep bilateral ties “on the right track”.Takaichi is a historical revisionist who has sought to play down Japanese atrocities in occupied China and other parts of Asia before and during the second world war, and has made pilgrimages to Yasukuni, a shrine in Tokyo that honours Japan’s war dead, including class-A war criminals.Takaichi, who skipped a visit to Yasukuni shortly before she became prime minister, told parliament last week that Japan would increase defence spending to 2% of GDP by the end of March, two years earlier than planned.Tokyo and Beijing have yet to resolve several sources of bilateral friction, including Chinese import restrictions on Japanese seafood and agricultural products – imposed after Japan startedreleasing treated wastewaterfrom the damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in August 2023 – and a long-running territorial dispute over theSenkaku/Diaoyu islandsin the East China Sea.Explore more on these topicsApec summitMark CarneyCanadaXi JinpingChinaInternational tradeAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

This was the most powerful storm to strike the island nation, packing winds of up to 185mph at its peak.Western parts ofJamaicawere worst hit, with 90% of homes in the town of Black River losing their roof or being destroyed entirely. Roughly three-quarters of the country lost electricity, with at least 19 people known to have lost their lives at the time of publication. The cleanup operation was hampered by thunderstorms even after Melissa cleared to the north. The hurricane continued northwards, but was a slightly weakened category 3 storm by the time it made landfall in Cuba. Nonetheless, the storm continued to bring winds of up to 120mph and torrential rains.Melissa mapHaiti was particularly badly affected by flash floods and landslides, with at least30 people believedto have been killed as a result.Melissa has continued its journey north-east towards Bermuda and the Bahamas, and is expected to transition into a post-tropical system as it rapidly moves into the Atlantic.Meanwhile, in the Indian Ocean, Cyclone Montha moved into south-east India over the last few days. The storm made landfall on Tuesday, with the state of Andhra Pradesh largely affected. Ahead of the storm, authorities evacuated 38,000 people from low-lying areas, with schools closed and relief camps set up in preparation. Rainfall totals of 200-250mm were seen as the system moved inland, resulting in widespread flooding. Current estimates put the damage at 53bn rupees ($603m), with the farming sector particularly badly hit as at least 120 animals were killed.Finally, prolonged torrential rain in Vietnam has led to the flooding of homes, farmland and the Unesco world heritage sites in Hue and Hoi An at the start of this week. The highest 24-hour rainfall recorded was about 1,700mm, which resulted in a major river reaching its highest level since 1964, at 5.62 metres. Residents used boats to traverse the streets, with authorities evacuating residents and more than 40,000 tourists. At least 10 people have been killed, and eight others are missing. More than 128,000 houses have flooded, some inundated in more than three metres of water. Additionally, Vietnam’s environmental ministry reported that more than 12,300 acres (5,000 hectares) of crops have been destroyed and more than 16,000 cattle have died. Moreover, landslides in the mountainous regions have blocked roads and mountain passes, leaving drivers stranded.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentWeather trackerHurricanesHurricane MelissaJamaicaAmericasCaribbeanHaitianalysisShareReuse this content"

A further 20 people were injured, it added.“It is a sad moment for the country,” said Laurent Saint-Cyr, the head of the transitional presidential council of Haiti, the Caribbean’s most populous nation.InJamaica, the death toll rose to 19 but search and rescue efforts were continuing, said the information minister, Dana Morris Dixon. The island’s toll had earlier been four.Tropical storm conditions were occurring onBermudalate on Thursday, as the category 2 storm moved past the western side of the territory, packing maximum sustained winds of 100mph (155km/h). The storm is moving in a north-easterly direction at a speed of 38mph (61km/h)Residents in Bermuda had remained calm as the storm was expected to give the island a relatively wide berth. Authorities said they would close its causeway Thursday night and shut schools and ferries on Friday “out of an abundance of caution”.Kingston, Jamaica’s capital, was spared the worst damage and the main international airport has reopened to allow flights carrying critical aid to land.

It was the country’s strongest hurricane since records began in 1851. The storm carried sustained winds of 185mph, far above the minimum for a category 5 storm, the strongest classification for hurricanes.The British government said on Thursday that it was chartering flights to the island. “The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office has chartered a limited number of flights from Jamaica for British nationals who are unable to fly home commercially,” it said in a statement.Hurricane Melissa has been intensely destructive, estimated to have caused billions of dollars, but accurate forecasting and government advice meant many people who were able to reach shelters were protected.0:58Before-and-after views show Hurricane Melissa damage to Jamaican town – videoIn easternCuba, authorities had evacuated about 735,000 people from their homes as the storm approached.

The Dutch government said thatthreatened the future of European chip capacity, and removed the Wingtech chairman, Zhang Xuezheng, as chief executive.China responded by halting exports from all Nexperia’s factories inChina, prompting warnings this week that the embargo would force production lines at EU car factories to close within days.An extended blockade threatens the supply chain, because many Nexperia products manufactured inEurope– including the wafers from which chips are cut – were previously shipped to the Chinese factory for packaging and distribution.Nexperia’s interim chief executive, Stefan Tilger, wrote that he had suspended shipments to the Dongguan factory, in the southern Guangdong province, on Sunday, saying it was “a direct consequence of the local management’s recent failure to comply with the agreed contractual payment terms”, according to extracts first published by Reuters.Nexperia said it still hoped to resume shipments, and wanted to de-escalate the situation. A person with knowledge of the situation said shipments could resume if the contractual payments were made. The company will also continue to ship products to a factory in Malaysia, which is smaller than its Chinese plant.A succession ofcarmakers have warned of the risk of disruptionfrom shortages of the key components, which are crucial throughout modern cars.The automotive industry suffered from severe semiconductor shortages in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, but these affected more advanced chips, rather than the cheaper power control ones made by Nexperia. The company generally ships more than 100bn products a year, to be used in parts ranging from airbags and adjustable seats to wing mirrors and central locking.Nissan said this week it had enough chips to last until the first week of November, while rival Honda said it had suspended production at a plant in Mexico. Mercedes-Benz said it was “covered” in the short term, but it was looking for alternatives.Volkswagen signalled on Thursday that its annual profit targets were at riskwithout sufficient chips.However, Toyota, the world’s largest carmaker, told reporters at a car show in Tokyo on Friday that it was not facing a major supply problem, even if it could eventually face a hit to production.The EU’s trade commissioner, Maroš Šefčovič, is to seek further discussions with Chinese counterparts after Chinese and EU officials met in Brussels on Friday to address China’s ban on Nexperia exports and its restrictions onsupplies of rare earth minerals.Also on Friday, the bloc’s tech commissioner, Henna Virkkunen, met Nexperia’s interim boss after seeing the European chip makers Infineon, ST and NXP the day before.After the meeting, she said the dialogue with Nexperia had served to underline the EU’s needs for a new Chips Act with three lessons from the current crisis, including: better visibility of chip stocks in the pipeline, the need to invest in chip supply despite the cost, and the need for reserve stocks.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Donald Trump’s team has contended that operations like RFA, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Voice of America are poorly run and a waste of government resources.Long a thorn in Beijing’s side, RFA’s closure comes after theUS president met Chinese leader Xi Jinping on a trip to Asia.Radio Free Asia will begin shutting down overseas bureaus, laying off and paying severance to staff members, most of whom have been on unpaid leave since last March, Fang said, leaving open the possibility that the organisation could restart operations in the future.“However drastic these measures may seem, they position RFA, a private corporation, for a future in which it would be possible to scale up and resume providing accurate, uncensored news for people living in some of the world’s most closed places,” Fang said.Pentagon reporters have now turned in their badges – but plan to keep reportingRead moreWith its own journalists and contractors in Asia, RFA has reported aggressively on stories some governments don’t want to see – the repression of Uyghurs in China, the aftermath of the 2021 military coup in Myanmar and the plight of defectors in North Korea. The outlet had been growing; visitors to its website increased 20% between 2023 and 2024.Shutting the broadcaster, which produced news in multiple Asian languages, “is a gift to dictators like Xi Jinping” especially “at a time when Beijing has worked quite assiduously to control what stories can and can’t get told the country”, said Sophie Richardson, co-executive director of the Network of Chinese Human Rights Defenders.Nicholas Burns, the US ambassador to China under president Joe Biden, wrote on X that shuttering RFA was a “major mistake” that “will prevent us from telling the truth to the Chinese people and countering Beijing’s propaganda.”RFE/Radio Liberty, similar to RFA as a private corporation funded by the government, said its own news services were staying up, “and we plan to continue reaching our audiences for the foreseeable future”, the organisation said this week. It operates in eastern Europe, central Asia and the Middle East. The service had launched its own lawsuit against the administration.‘We have nothing now’: Myanmar’s exiled media face existential crisis after Trump severs aidRead moreRFE/Radio Liberty says it received its last federal funding in September. It is operating on reserves, and has taken cost-cutting steps like cutting contracts with freelancers, reducing programming and placing some staff members on partially paid leave.It was not immediately clear why the two organisations are taking different approaches. While having the same governing and funding structure, RFA and RFE/Radio Liberty are headquartered in North America and Europe respectively, and are governed under different labour laws.Voice of America,which has concentrated on providing news about the United States to audiences in other countries, had been operating on a very limited basis since its funding was cut off and has essentially stopped due to the government shutdown.

The undercover operation,later revealed to be dubbed internally by the paper as “undercover Jew”, made international headlines after it backfired.In August, Birenbaum launched defamation proceedings against the restaurant’s owner, Hesham El Masry, and staff memberTalaat Yehia.Court documents obtained by Guardian Australia show he is disputing the allegation that his intention was to provoke an antisemitic incident, and that he was defamed in a series of social media posts on the restaurant’s account implying that was the case.Birenbaum’s statement of claim, released this week, included screenshots of a since deleted social media post that the restaurant posted in the aftermath of the incident. A number of allegations made in this post were later retracted and apologised for by the restaurant.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailBirenbaum, who is being represented by Giles George, alleged in his statement of claim that the first post implied he made “baseless accusations of antisemitism against staff” and that it was “to stir up controversy”.Daily Telegraph takes action after ‘mind-blowingly stupid’ stunt … by tracking down leaker | The Weekly BeastRead moreThe claim says the post caused “people to shun and vilify Birenbaum, to an extent unknown to him”, and that he was “subjected to a workplace investigation” after the incident.Stewart O’Connell from O’Brien Criminal and Civil Lawyers, which is acting on behalf of the restaurant, said they had made attempts to peacefully settle the matter outside court.The respondents are yet to file their defence to the claims.What did the posts say?Screenshots show that the restaurant said Birenbaum had come to the premises and ordered a hibiscus tea with “no fuss”. They wrote that he then “lingered” near the counter, leading a staff member to ask if there was anything else he wanted.In since retracted statements, the post went on to say that Birenbaum responded: “Do you have a problem with me because I’m Jewish?” and “you’re intimidating me, you’re making me feel unsafe”.The post said it was then that the staff member tried to disengage from the conversation by walking outside, and found a camera crew from the Daily Telegraph waiting.“It is very easy to infer that they had attended Cairo Takeaway along with the instigator in an attempt to manufacture a story,” the restaurant wrote of the incident.However in a subsequent post, the restaurant apologised and retracted it’s re-telling of some of the events, saying it reflected their perceptions at the time but wanted to clarify now that “emotions had settled”. They wrote that Birenbaum did not “verbally taunt” or become “verbally confrontational” with staff.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We hope that other parties involved have also learned from this and will never engage in such a divisive and distressing stunt.”The post also said that the restaurant is “unapologetically and transparently pro-Palestinian”, and that Birenbaum’s prominent wearing of pro-Israel symbols while carrying a heavy bag and “acting strangely” had caused the staff to feel uncertain and unsafe.It also noted the “extraordinary escalation of conflict between Israel and Palestine” and that it had caused enormous distress to both communities.“We would never consider entering a Jewish establishment wearing prominent Palestinian flag symbols during this time.”Birenbaum has not denied in the statement of claim that he went to the restaurant alongside the reporters or that it was for a story.In February, Ben English, the editor of the Daily Telegraph,said the newspaper “never intended to provoke an incident at the Cairo Takeaway restaurant”but acknowledged “our approach could have been better handled”.English said the paper had visited multiple venues across Sydney in an attempt to report on “the rise of antisemitism and … how it is affecting the daily lives of Jewish people in Sydney”.Explore more on these topicsNew South WalesAntisemitismAustralian medianewsShareReuse this content"

Her body was found the next day, and her family want answersDaisy DumasFri 31 Oct 2025 17.33 EDTFirst published on Fri 31 Oct 2025 10.00 EDTShareThe appeal of Lizard Island is its remoteness. TheGreat Barrier Reefisland, 250km from Cairns in Queensland’s tropical north, is known for its impressive snorkelling, with giant clams nestled among the coral. It also has a scientific research station.Tourists are mostly kept at bay by its inaccessibility and eye-wateringly high accommodation prices.But a week ago, on the west of the island, Suzanne Rees, a healthy and active 80-year-old, died alone. She had possibly just watched her luxury cruise ship, the Coral Adventurer, sail away without her.The keen gardener and bushwalker from Sydney had intended to hike to the island’s historical summit, Cook’s Look, with other passengers on the second day of their 60-day circumnavigation of Australia. But on Saturday, feeling the heat, she turned around early. She never made it off the island and back to the ship.Authorities were not alerted until five hours after the Coral Adventurer left Lizard Island at 3.40pm local time. The next day, Sunday,Rees was found deadclose to the walking trail.How she died, and why her absence from the ship was not immediately flagged, are the questions being asked by her grieving family, other cruise passengers, industry experts and authorities.Coral Adventurer route map‘Then the ship left’Rees and her fellow passengers boarded Coral Expeditions’ 120-guest Coral Adventurer in Cairns on Friday 24 October. Balcony rooms on the cruise were priced at $86,400 per person, according to Clean Cruising, with a 46-member crew on board the 94.5-metre purpose-built vessel.VesselFinder satellite tracking data shows the ship left Cairns at about 5.30pm, arriving at Lizard Island at 8.30am on Saturday.Rees was among a group of passengers who headed to the island to hike but, according to her daughter Katherine Rees, she had cut her walk short.Grieving daughter of cruise ship passenger left behind on remote Australian island says ‘there was a failure of care’Read more“We understand from the police that it was a very hot day, and Mum felt ill on the hill climb. She was asked to head down, unescorted,”Katherine Rees said on Thursday.“Then the ship left, apparently without doing a passenger count. At some stage in that sequence, or shortly after, Mum died, alone.”The Bureau of Meteorology’s closest weather station, about 30km away, recorded a high temperature of 31.9C that day.View image in fullscreenSuzanne Rees, 80, who died on Lizard Island.A sailor on a nearby boat, Traci Ayris, told News Corp Australia she heard headcounts for snorkellers and that the ship had left soon after the presumed last hikers had returned from the island.VesselFinder shows the Coral Adventurer left Lizard Island at 3.40pm, tracking north-westerly.When Rees didn’t show up for dinner at about 6pm, the alarm was raised on board. Several bow-to-stern searches were conducted, with Rees initially believed to have gone overboard.The Coral Adventurer made a sudden about-turn at 8.43pm on Saturday. At that time, it was about 114km from Lizard Island off Cape Melville. The cruise ship sailed south, retracing its path.At 9pm, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (Amsa) was notified by the ship’s master that Rees was missing.Queenslandpolice were alerted later that night.The Coral Expeditions chief executive, Mark Fifield, said in a statement this week that “a search and rescue operation was launched on land and sea”.By midnight, a helicopter search for Rees was under way on Lizard Island, according to Rob Siganto, the owner of the South Pacific II fishing and charter boat.He told Australia’s national broadcaster, the ABC, that he was moored nearby and, listening on the radio, heard the helicopter crew discussing Rees’ last known location, “halfway” up the scrub-covered hill.TimelineCoral Adventurer timelineShowTimes are in local Queensland time.24 October 20255.30pmCoral Adventurer departs Cairns.25 October 20258:30amCoral Adventurer arrives on the western side of Lizard Island.25 October 20253:40pmCoral Adventurer leaves Lizard Island, tracking north-westerly towards Cape Melville.25 October 20258:43pmBetween Barrow Reef and Unison Reef off Cape Melville national park, the ship makes a sudden about turn and begins heading south.26 October 20253:25amCoral Adventurer arrives back at Lizard Island.26 October 20256:55pmCoral Adventurer leaves Lizard Island for the second time, again heading towards Cape York.27 October 202512:15amCoral Adventurer passes the point at which it previously turned around.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The Coral Adventurer’s tracking data shows it had returned to Lizard Island by 3.25am on Sunday. A team on a smaller boat had reportedly been sent ahead to look for Rees, but the search was eventually called off until daybreak.Shortly after the aerial search resumed on Sunday morning, Ayris said, Rees’ body was found at about 9.30am. The Coral Adventurer left Lizard Island for a second time at 6.55pm.‘It seems there was a failure of care’Katherine Rees said her family was “shocked and saddened that the Coral Adventurer left Lizard Island after an organised excursion without my mum, Suzanne”.“From the little we have been told, it seems that there was a failure of care and common sense.”The Coral Expeditions chief executive said on Thursday that exactly what happened was yet to be established.“We have expressed our heartfelt condolences to the Rees family and remain deeply sorry that this has occurred,” Fifield said in a statement.“The circumstances of her tragic death are the subject of official investigations. We are fully cooperating with those investigations to determine the facts. For this reason, it would be inappropriate to comment further on the investigations while they are under way.“We continue to provide our full support to the Rees family through this difficult time.”The police are preparing a report for a coronial inquiry, which Katherine Rees hopes “will find out what the company should have done that might have saved Mum’s life”. Amsa and WorkSafe Queensland are also investigating.On Friday, the Coral Adventurer was close to Prince of Wales Island in the Torres Strait. Amsa said it intended to board the ship when it arrived in Darwin. Part of the investigation would focus on why Rees may not have been accounted for during boarding, a spokesperson said.‘Count the people’David Beirman, an adjunct fellow in management and tourism at the University of Technology Sydney, said any failure to account for all passengers was “very unusual”.“One of the standard things they always do when there is a shore excursion, of any sort, is they count the people who are leaving and they count the people who are coming back. It’s basic common sense,” he said.“For whatever reason, it appears they didn’t do it as effectively as they might have done on this occasion.”Former Coral Expeditions passengers have expressed surprise that a passenger could seemingly be unaccounted for.“We have cruised the Kimberley coast on this small ship,” one wrote on Facebook.“We had our names checked off a list when boarding the tender boat and checked off again when boarding the ship. It is beyond belief that the captain and crew would leave without everybody on board.”Another Facebook user said she had travelled with Coral Expeditions in May and there were “so many checks” – including a number assigned to each passenger that was ticked off upon returning to the vessel.“Many of [us] also watched for older solo travellers, making sure they weren’t alone,” the traveller wrote.Map showing location of Lizard Island in relation to Queensland coast and CairnsDespite the protocols, Beirman said there were “plenty” of cases of passengers being left behind. Notable examples include the case ofeight passengers who scrambled to meet their shipafter being left behind in São Tomé and Príncipe last year.But the Great Barrier Reef, in particular, has a history of maritime misadventure.In 1998, Tom and Eileen Lonergandied after their tour boat leftwhile they were scuba diving on the Great Barrier Reef. Officials believe they drowned or were eaten by sharks.In 2008, a British holidaymaker and his American girlfriend, who survived for 19 hours in shark-infested waters off the reef, told how arescue helicopter failed to spot themwaving frantically for help.In 2011, officials investigated a dive boat company that accidentallyleft behind a US touristsnorkelling at the reef.Explore more on these topicsQueenslandCruisesTourism (Australia)Great Barrier ReefnewsShareReuse this content"

It promised to make changes after the environment minister, Murray Watt, said the website was “not meeting many users’ expectations”, and the federal opposition said it had affected the ability of Queenslanders to prepare for recent rains. On Friday, the BoM reverted to the former colour scheme on the radar and weather map to match the old website in response to backlash.The public-facing aspect of the site, which cost $4.1m on its own, was the tail end of an almost decade-long IT overhaul known as Robust, which cost the bureau $866m.The bureau confirmed to Guardian Australia the total cost of the website was around $86m, accounting for public facing and back-end elements.Sign up: AU Breaking News email“Improving the security, stability and resilience of this supporting infrastructure and data was the work of the Robust program,” the spokesperson said. “The total cost of the program was $866m, with approximately 10% of that investment connected to the overall website and its supporting systems.”“The re-design of the bureau website (the interface experienced by the public) cost $4.1m.”The website is supported by a network of technology infrastructure, security controls, data integrations, geospatial viewers and content management systems, the spokesperson said, and receives and displays data from a network of over 7,000 observation assets covering 11% of the globe.The Nationals leader, David Littleproud, said the cost was “unbelievable” and a waste of money.Bureau of Meteorology apologises for new website and promises changes after ‘flawed’ updateRead more“Australians deserve to know, why was so much money spent and what improvements were actually made?”“The Australian public, and those who rely so heavily on the BoM website to protect their livestock and machinery during storms and floods, deserve answers.”Consulting firm Accenture received $78m in a contract for the website aspect of the overhaul. BoM has faced criticism in the past few years for the nine contract extensions made on the Accenture contract – which was originally supposed to cost $31m.Deloitte also received $35m for its work on the site – a contract that was originally supposed to cost $11m.Accenture was approached for comment. Deloitte declined to comment.BoM said in response to a question on notice last year that amendments to the contracts were made as a result of “dependency delays due to ICT infrastructure and environment availability, extensions of the contract utilising planned and existing contract options and additional technology integration interface work made at bureau request.”At the time, Greens senator Barbara Pocock pushed the agency to explain why there were no penalty clauses in the contracts to recoup funds from the firms for cost blow-outs and delays. The agency said in response that penalty clauses are unenforceable in contracts, and the performance of the vendors did not warrant remedies.“Robust program contracts, include contract remedies to guide the management of vendor performance,” the BoM said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

These specific financial remedies have not been applied because the performance of vendors has been consistent with their commitments under each respective contract.”Robust was considered critical for the agency after a “serious cyber intrusion” onthe BoM’s site in 2015revealed a range of vulnerabilities in its systems.The BoM only revealed the full cost of the project earlier this year, despite parliamentarians pushing for the release of the cost earlier. Then-CEO Andrew Johnson told the Senate in March 2024the cost was looking to be nearly $1bn.The total cost of Robust was budgeted to be $788.4m, with the final cost arriving $77.6m over budget. The overrun was met with existing BoM appropriations, the agency told parliament earlier this year.Pocock, who has been interrogating BoM on the project the past few years, said the bureau is a “vital public service” but millions were wasted on the project, which was unacceptable.“There’s a real question here about value for money and whether the BoM’s culture and leadership are fit for purpose for an agency as essential as the BoM,” she said.“We need a bureau that builds public expertise, not one that outsources to expensive contractors delivering poor results. As the climate crisis intensifies, accurate and timely weather information is absolutely critical.“Lives and livelihoods depend on the bureau getting it right.”After initially shrugging off some of the criticism as akin to that faced after the 2020 mobile app refresh – which now records more visitors annually than the desktop website – BoM has spent much of the past week explaining to users how to find features from the old site on the new site.Some of the claims of missing features highlighted by politicians this week, including by Littleproud, proved erroneous once the agency provided links on the site to enquiring media.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

But they have been paying websites that promote their inducements, link to their pages and instruct people on how to bypass the BetStop service, which is designed to block registrants from gambling.How Australians became the world’s biggest gamblersRead moreThe websites, whose URLs occasionally reference Australian cities, are paid a commission if readers follow their recommendations and gamble with overseas agencies, which are predominately based in the Dutch Caribbean island of Curaçao.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailIn some cases, they appeal to addicts who may want to resume betting before their self-exclusion period expires. Lifting this ban early requires a statutory declaration confirming a registrant has received counselling from a qualified professional.One website – promoting a gambling business that offers up to $10,800 in “welcome bonuses”, which is illegal in Australia – suggests people registered with BetStop may have made a “rash decision” and provides advice to continue gambling.Another site claims offshore bookmakers offered “an enhanced level of security”.Regulators in Australia havewarned the opposite is true.BetStop, which was launched in August 2023, allows people to be blocked from gambling, and bookmakers are also banned from contacting them. The scheme, which has 45,000 registrants, only applies to Australian companies.Under Australian law, offshore gambling companies are banned form targeting Australian consumers and encouraging them to gamble.But there are no restrictions on third-party affiliates promoting their products in return for payment.Australia’s media regulator has been concerned about affiliate marketers promoting illegal gambling services for many years. But the targeting of people listed on BetStop is a relatively new tactic.“This is a deeply concerning and opportunistic practice that attempts to undermine the purpose of the national self-exclusion register”, an Australian Communications and Media Authority (Acma) spokesperson said.The websites, which Guardian Australia has chosen not to name to protect consumers, promote a lack of regulation and generous inducements. One promotes offshore companies as having to adhere to “less challenging gambling laws”.Most websites acknowledge they are affiliated with the bookmakers they promote, and some confirm they receive commissions from them.Nerilee Hing, a professor at CQUniversity who has researched affiliate marketing in the gambling industry, said targeting people who had registered with BetStop was “a clear example of predatory practices that aims to attract the most vulnerable”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

An inquiry led by the late Labor MP Peta Murphy called for the practice to be banned.Consumer advocate Lauren Levin said blocking access to offshore gambling websites was ineffective as they merely returned with slightly different URLs. She instead said banks should be stopped from sending money to unlicensed gambling operators.In Australia,Gambling Help Onlineis available on 1800 858 858.

Guardian Australia requested the latest figures from coroners in each state and territory but Western Australia and South Australia declined to provide them.Paul Silva, an organiser of Saturday’s rally whose uncle David Dungaydied in prisonin 2015, said each death sent a ripple effect through the community.“The old saying is you hurt one, you hurt all,” he said.“We really feel it as First Nations people … and we feel it physically.”The proportion of Indigenous people in NSW prisons has also reached a record high, according to the state bureau of crime statistics and research.New figures show the Indigenous prison population jumped by 26% over the past six years, despite a 12% drop for non-Indigenous inmates during the same period. The disproportionate rates were largely due to more Aboriginal people being denied bail, the data shows.The core advice of the royal commission was that prison should be a last resort.Tickner, now the chair of the Justice Reform Initiative, said he was “staggered” by the failure to address the drivers of incarceration, including mental health, substance abuse, unemployment and children dropping out of school.View image in fullscreenThe former Aboriginal affairs minister Robert Tickner, right, with Paul Keating and Patrick Dodson in 1992.Photograph: National Archives Of Australia/PR IMAGE“We are letting governments off the hook, giving governments their own get out of jail free card because they can turn their backs on the problem and continue to fail to invest in those underlying issues,” Tickner said.“Unless we … get more effective alternatives to incarceration for many Aboriginal people, sadly nothing is going to change.”The minister forIndigenous Australians, Malarndirri McCarthy, said the number of First Nations deaths in custody in NSW this year was “deeply distressing”.“The royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody made clear that reducing First Nations incarceration rates is the best way of reducing deaths in custody,” she said.“State and territory governments have a responsibility to make decisions that align with their commitments under the national agreement on Closing the Gap, including to reduce the over-representation of First Nations adults and youths in custody.”Guardian Australia has sought comment from the NSW premier, Chris Minns.Children under 14 are incapable of evil and should be protected from criminal responsibility, NSW review findsRead moreA NSW government spokesperson previously said a review of Aboriginal deaths in custody, which will make recommendations on how to reduce deaths in corrective services, was due to report back next year.Only two-thirds of the royal commission’s recommendations have been implemented, according to a 2018reviewby Deloitte Access Economics.Another recommendation was the removal of hanging points from prisons. Yet a Guardian Australiainvestigation this yearfound there have been at least 64 deaths from known ligature points in Australian prisons since 1991.Coroners in Western Australia haveexpressed dismayabout the amount of money set aside for addressing ligature points across the state’s prison system – in one case calling it a “parsimonious” amount.Between 2005 and 2025, the WA government allocated $29.6m to a ligature minimisation program across the state. But according to a response to a question on notice from the WA Greens leader, Brad Pettitt, in August, there is no longer specific money set aside.“Instead it is integrated across capital works, maintenance, infrastructure upgrades and operational procedures” the response from the WA minister for corrective services states.Explore more on these topicsIndigenous AustraliansIndigenous affairs reportingNew South WalesAustralian police and policingPrisonsDeaths in custodynewsShareReuse this content"

Angelov is still at large.All four were also banned from entering French territory for life.The trial was the first of its kind inFrance, one of a series of similar crimes suspected of having been orchestrated by a foreign power with the aim to destabilise.The four defendants were not tried for acting on behalf of a foreign power: that aggravating circumstance was only added to France’s criminal code after the incident took place.However, the judges said the fact that foreign interference occurred was “indisputable”, and it had been aimed to “stir up public opinion, exploit existing divisions and further fragment French society”.The vandalism was staged during heightened tensions in France over the war between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas that broke out in October 2023.The wall daubed with red handprints lists 3,900 people honoured for protecting Jews during the Nazi occupation of France in the second world war.Several other red handprints were found in nearby areas of central Paris.The prosecutor’s office said a security agent had caught two people placing stencils on the memorial.Investigators identified them with security footage, then discovered that three had caught a bus to Belgium the next morning, then a flight to Bulgaria.The defendants present were quick to blame their absent accomplice, calling Angelov the “leader”, and denying any ideological motivation.Filipov swore he did not realise he was tagging the memorial, which is known as the “wall of the righteous”.He also rejected accusations that his recruitment was related to his apparent neo-Nazi affiliations, including having a swastika tattoo and appearing in social media posts giving Nazi salutes.He said he had left that behind, adding: “I’ve made bad choices in the past.”The Paris prosecutor’s office said the red handprint incident, possibly “orchestrated by Russian intelligence services”, was one of nine such suspected acts of foreign interference.Viginum, the French authority monitoring foreign interference online, said the red hand incident had been exploited by “actors linked to Russia” on X.Explore more on these topicsFranceEuropeRussiaAntisemitismnewsShareReuse this content"

Woody Allen comes out fightingRead moreThe director, who recentlypublished his debut novel, is believed to have struggled to source large-scale financing for his films amid theresurfacingin 2014 of an accusation that he sexually abused his daughter Dylan Farrow in 1992.The claim, which Allen hasconsistently denied, was originally made in the midst of a custody battle between Allen and Mia Farrow over Dylan and her brother, Ronan, was the subject of two investigations, which resulted in no charges being brought.The Madrid regional government evidently believes that buying into the director’s name and legacy will pay considerable dividends. “Woody Allen is one of the most multifaceted contemporary artists in the cinematic landscape, and has shaped one of the most original and highly regarded styles in film-making,” the government said in a document published online this week.View image in fullscreenRebecca Hall, Patricia Clarkson and Scarlett Johansson in Vicky Cristina Barcelona which also received €1.5m in funding from Barcelona city council and the Catalan regional government.Photograph: Allstar“An audiovisual project with the characteristics of Woody Allen’s works, a director and producer of international renown and prestige, whose feature films are shown on screens worldwide (cinema and streaming platforms), offers excellent potential for impact and constitutes an ideal channel for promoting the Community of Madrid as a tourist destination.”It noted that some of Allen’s previous works, “with similar characteristics to [this] project”, had achieved box office figures of more than $150m (£114.5m).Details of the contract, which have also been posted online, show that the €1.5m stake will be paid in three instalments between this year and 2027, and also reveal a clause stipulating that “the final title of the film must include the word Madrid”.The contract goes on to require that some of the payments will be contingent on the film premiering at “the Berlin film festival or a festival of similar international prestige”. It also says the project “will have to reflect the Madrid region in an easily recognisable way, with a small amount of the running time allowing for the visualisation of identifiable and recognisable spaces and locations”. The forthcoming film is referred to throughout as Wasp 2026, an acronym for Woody Allen Summer Project 2026.The deal is not unprecedented: Barcelona city council and the Catalan regional governmentinvested a total of €1.5m in Allen’s 2008 film, Vicky Cristina Barcelona, which starred Javier Bardem, Penélope Cruz, Scarlett Johansson and Rebecca Hall.“The filming represents a wonderful advertising campaign,” a spokesperson for the regional government said at the time. “It’s an excellent advert; since news broke that the film would be made in Barcelona, it’s been in newspapers all around the world.”The Madrid region, which is run by the rightwing, populist president, Isabel Díaz Ayuso, may not have the cinematic cachet of Paris, London or New York, but it has long been immortalised in the films of Pedro Almodóvar, who moved to the Spanish capital in the late 1960s.Last year the city held an exhibition celebrating its central place in Almodóvar’s work, titled,Madrid, Almodóvar Girl. “I grew up, I had fun, I suffered, I got fat and I flourished in Madrid,” the director has said. “And I was doing a lot of those things at the same time the city was.”Explore more on these topicsFilmWoody AllenSpainEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

According to ANP, D66 is likely to receive one more seat, putting the party on 27.All mainstream parties had already ruled out governing with Wilders, the anti-Islam firebrand whose PVV won 37 seats in 2023 then led a chaotic rightwing coalition that lasted less than a year before he torpedoed it in a row over his draconian immigration plans.However, while this is the end of the self-described “most rightwing government ever”, and there is a clear surge in support for centrist parties, experts said the far-right vote had simply shifted to smaller parties and trust in politics remains at just 4%..By parliamentary convention, the leader of the winning party takes the lead in a coalition-formation process. But with the fragmented result – in which many far-right voters deserted Wilders but chose the far-right JA21 and Forum for Democracy – it will be difficult to form a government.Jetten on Friday urged all mainstream parties to unite. “Voters have clearly indicated the need for cooperation,” Jetten said. “We want to find a majority that will eagerly work on issues such as the housing market, migration, climate and the economy.“Léonie de Jonge, an expert in far-right extremism at the University of Tübingen, said the clear win did not make the path ahead much easier. “D66 gets to initiate the formation of the government, but still I think the underlying message of the election is that the far right is not defeated,” she said. “I think the real challenge is moving forward, forming a government with the increasingly fragmented landscape that Dutch politics now constitutes.”Although a left-right coalition with the centrist Christian Democratic Appeal, VVD and GreenLeft-Labour would be strongest in the lower and upper chambers, the VVD leader, Dilan Yeşilgöz-Zegerius, said repeatedly during the campaign that ruling with the left was something she “did not see happening”.Jetten’s impressive debating style, clean-cut image and positive messaging won over enough voters for a historic win. “D66 managed to attract voters from all directions, drawing in both left- and right-leaning supporters,” said Matthijs Rooduijn, an expert on populism at the University of Amsterdam. “Many GreenLeft-Labour voters were dissatisfied with their own party leader but responded positively to Jetten and D66’s upbeat ‘It can be done’ campaign.“At the same time, D66’s tougher stance on immigration appealed to rightwing voters from VVD, NSC, and even PVV, making its current electorate more diverse. And more critical and negative about immigration.”Explore more on these topicsNetherlandsEuropeGeert WildersRob JettennewsShareReuse this content"

At the time, 28 employees were present at Laboratoires Pourquery, five of whom were slightly injured.Residents described hearing a deafening noise. “They blew out two security windows in the laboratory,” one witness told thenewspaper Le Progrès.“There were several men, perhaps three or four, carrying Kalashnikovs and fake armbands … we saw them load their vehicle, a small van, before fleeing.”Video taken by residentsappeared to showtwo people, dressed all in black, hovering near a white van parked outside the laboratory. One calmly tossed a ladder over the fence, while another brandished what appears to be an assault rifle. Soon after, another person is seen scaling the ladder to throw parcels over the fence. Police did not detail what exactly was taken from the laboratory.The suspects, believed to be seasoned criminals, were detained shortly afterwards in the neighbouring town of Vénissieux, a source close to the case told Agence France-Presse. A woman, described by police as an accomplice to the robbery, was also arrested, while assault rifles, handguns and explosives were seized.Mediareportedthat it was the second time thieves had targeted the laboratory, following an attempted robbery in May.The heist in Lyon comes days after thievescarried out a flagrant raidon the Louvre, breaking into one of the museum’s most ornate rooms and escaping with crown jewels worth an estimated €88m (£76m). Seven peoplehave sincebeen arrested, but the stolen gems, which include an emerald and diamond necklace that Napoleon I gave to his second wife, Marie Louise, and a diadem set with 212 pearls and nearly 2,000 diamonds that had once belonged to Empress Eugénie, the wife of Napoleon III, have yet to be recovered.The robbery at the world’s most-visited museum – the biggest since the Mona Lisa was stolen in 1911 – left much of the world reeling at its audacity and prompted a reckoning in France, with the Louvre directoracknowledgingthere was “highly insufficient” security camera coverage of the outside walls of the vast building.As the frantic search for the gems continue, a spotlight has been recast on the spate of robberies targeting precious metals across the country. Last month, thieves – believed to be using an angle grinder and a blowtorch – forced their way into Paris’s Natural History Museum, making off withhistoric gold sampleswith a street value of €600,000. Prosecutors said recently that a 24-year-old Chinese national had been arrested in Barcelona.In early October, a museum in Mialet, a small village in southern France,reportedthat about 100 gold Huguenot crosses had been stolen. And less than 24 hours after the Louvre heist, the small town of Langres said that several silver and gold coins had gone missing from acollection datingfrom 1790 to 1840.On Friday, the count of Paris, whose great-grandmother once wore the sapphire tiara that was stolen from the Louvre, pleaded for the return of the jewels.“For our family, for the French people, it’s important that these jewels return to their display case at the Louvre,” Jean d’Orleans, a direct descendant of French kings, told Reuters. “It’s priceless heritage … we need to recover that.”Explore more on these topicsFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Israel said the bombings were in response to an attack in Rafah city that killed a soldier carrying out demolitions there.The ceasefire deal called for an international force to secure Gaza, reducing the risk of violence flaring in the short term and paving the way for the demilitarisation ofHamasand a full withdrawal of Israeli forces, which still occupy more than half of Gaza.View image in fullscreenMajed al-Ansari said establishing an international administration would ‘shift the whole process from war to the day after’.Photograph: Antonio Balasco/EPAGetting the international force in place fast, along with a new Palestinian administration, was critical for the fragile pause to become a more lasting peace, Ansari told the Guardian in an interview.“There is a need for the international community to go in, assess the damage, start thinking about reconstruction, working on reconstruction, and to formally keep the peace,” he said. “This is what will significantly shift the whole process from war to the day after.”The 20-point plan for Gaza’s future, which underpins the ceasefire, sidestepped basic details including the force’s mandate and membership. Qatar and regional allies want it to be backed by the UN, something the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said Washington was considering.Ansari said: “We’re very hopeful that if we are able to get a security council resolution and a mandate for an administration and an international force in Gaza, that we would be able to stabilise the situation.“In principle, a lot of the countries in the region and beyond have agreed to be part of this, but in practice that needs a very concrete mandate for the force.”Hammering out the terms of international missions is a complex diplomatic process that normally takes weeks or months, time Gaza may not be able to afford. The ceasefire is under daily pressure, with both parties trading accusations of violations.“There are a lot of challenges before we are able to dispense with stage one [of the deal],” Ansari said. “Including the difficulty of excavating the remains of those [hostages] who were killed and ascertaining their identities, and the violations that result in the death of Palestinians every day at the hands of IDF soldiers.”The bodies of 11 hostages are still in Gaza, after the remains of Amiram Cooper and Sahar Baruch were returned on Thursday.The Trump administration’s commitment is critical to the ceasefire’s success, and is evident in theconvoy of senior envoys heading to Israel, including the president’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and the vice-president, JD Vance.View image in fullscreenA view of Gaza City on Friday, where most buildings have been reduced to rubble.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images“The only thing that has always tipped the scales in the favour of ceasefire was US engagement,” Ansari said. That was true of all three agreements reached to halt fighting after 7 October, he added.Trump hailed the deal he sealed as one for the ages, although versions of it had been on the table for more than a year. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is widely reported to havebacked awayfrom a similar agreement in April 2024 in order to safeguard his coalition government, which includes far-right parties strongly opposed to ending the war.“We’ve had so many near-misses in achieving such a deal, [which leads to] a level of frustration and tiredness among the negotiators,” Ansari said. Qatar’s chief negotiator had not had more than two days off since 7 October, and the pressure of the work had led to colleagues being admitted to hospital, he added.In September, pressure on Qatari negotiators reached an unprecedented peak when Israel fired missiles at a meeting in Doha of Hamas officials gathered to discuss the US ceasefire proposal.The strikes killed a Qatari citizen and five Hamas members,blind-siding Qatar. They came in a week when mediators thought they were making progress, he said; Qatar had told Israel and the US that Hamas would be meeting to discuss the latest Trump proposal and had promised a response by Friday.Ansari said the missiles were aimed at Hamas leaders, but the timing suggested Qatar’sdiplomatic workon global conflicts was a secondary target. “It was designed to push us out, not only out of these [Gaza] talks, but to push us out as an internationally trusted mediator,” he said. “We were working on more than 10 mediations on the day of the attack.”View image in fullscreenRelatives of Palestinians, including children, killed by Israeli bombing on Tuesday, take away their bodies for burial.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesIsrael’s strike threatened decades of investment in diplomacy that was based, in part, on assurances that Doha was a safe and neutral place for enemies to meet, he said.Ansari heard and felt the missiles landing, in a residential neighbourhood dotted with embassies and international schools and near his daughter’s university. As the ground shook, his mind emptied of all thoughts except whether she was safe.“This was not an attack we could brush off and continue doing the work that we were doing,” he said. Qatar, which has nearly two decades of experience mediating between Israel and Hamas, made clear to the US that negotiations over Gaza were off until it got “serious assurances” that Israel would never strike its territories again.In the days that followed, Qatar underlined its diplomatic clout by concluding the first round of talks between Colombian factions and securing the release of an elderly British couple and an American citizen from Taliban captivity.Trump then made clear he wanted a halt to fighting in Gaza, probably with his eye on theNobel peace prize he openly covets, and forced Netanyahu to apologise to the Qataris both privately and publicly.Work resumed on the ceasefire, with Qatari diplomats focused on three key goals as they helped the warring parties agree the 20-point plan underlying the deal, Ansari said.He said the goals were, first, “ending the war, stopping the bloodshed”, and second, “making sure that there is no annexation or occupation as a result of anything happening on the ground”. Finally, the aim was to make sure there was no displacement of Palestinians from Gaza, he said. “We checked all these three boxes in the final document.”However, even if Trump ensures the ceasefire holds, turning his loose framework for Gaza’s future into reality on the ground will be a long and difficult process. And the plan makes only the vaguest commitment towards a future of Palestinian self-rule and sovereignty, which Netanyahu’s government has repeatedly and strongly opposed.Explore more on these topicsGazaQatarIsraelIsrael-Gaza warHamasMiddle East and north AfricaUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

The cotton trunks will offer “a subtle lift and enhanced fit through clever, discreet design”.How subtle the lift is presumably depends on the wearer. The pants are being launched on Friday evening by the influencers Tom Sheard andStanley Dru, who said: “Size isn’t everything, but confidence is.”For some, the product will bring to mind the codpiece, the accessory that anybody who was anybody was wearing in 15th- and 16th-century Europe.The idea was that itcovered and drew attentionto a part of the body that people were not meant to mention.View image in fullscreenM&S says the new pants offer a discreet boost and unbeatable comfort.Photograph: M&SHenry VIII – someone for whom size probably was everything – was depicted with a particularly impressive example in several portraits, including the larger-than-lifeHolbein the Younger drawingnow at the National Portrait Gallery.Historians have argued that Henry was weaponising his codpiece, creating afeeling of envyin enemies and subjects.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There has been a shift,” he said.Giuffre’s sister-in-law, Amanda Roberts, said: “To put that acknowledgment out for survivors is huge. We haven’t seen that from anyone, and to acknowledge that there are survivors in this situation is an acknowledgment that abuse did occur.“It is the very first step for that justice for survivors. It is first the acknowledgment that something went on here. There was real trauma that happened to these young girls.”In a posthumous memoir, Giuffre – who died earlier this year – repeated allegations that, as a teenager, she had sex with Mountbatten Windsor on three separate occasions. He has always denied any wrongdoing. He settled a civil case with Giuffre for a reported £12m with no admission of liability.Amanda described the statement by the palace as a “victory” and “vindication for our sister”.“We’re just so exceptionally proud of her, but then the sorrow hits because you wish she was here to share this moment together with her – a moment that she has been waiting for, for a very long time,” she added.Women’s rights campaigners and advocacy groups also welcomed the move by the royal family, with some saying it sent an important message to survivors of abuse.Gemma Sherrington, chief executive of Refuge, said it was “incredibly powerful to see survivors recognised so directly in a statement from the palace”, adding that it sent a message that “survivors matter, that their experiences are believed, and that they deserve to be at the heart of national conversations about abuse”.Penny East, the chief executive at the Fawcett Society, said “it is a welcome acknowledgment that the real victims here are not embarrassed politicians or disgraced princes, but the women and girls who were sexually assaulted by entitled, misogynistic men.”However, she added: “Removing a title, or moving house can never be viewed as true accountability or sufficient punishment. Indeed, one brave woman, Virginia Giuffre, has lost her life. It was a terrible tragedy, and a reminder of the profound impact sexual assault has on women and girls.”Describing Giuffre’s character and fight for justice, Sky said she was a “strong warrior” who could also be cheeky and goofy.“This is an ordinary girl from an ordinary family that did something extraordinary and I think this is something the world should be proud of.“She was this strong warrior who refused to back down and refused to stay silent and we are finally getting that acknowledgment that she truly was a world hero.”The palace declined to comment.In the UK,Rape Crisisoffers support for rape and sexual abuse on 0808 802 9999 in England and Wales, 0808 801 0302 inScotland, or 0800 0246 991 inNorthern Ireland.

She died at the scene from stab wounds after the attack on 22 July 2024.March, 47, of Surrey Quays, south-east London, admitted her murder on the seventh day of his trial after an expert no longer supported his claim of diminished responsibility.Odysseos was among the women whose deaths were included in the Guardian’sKilled women count– a project highlighting the toll and tragedy of femicide in the UK. She was described as a “brilliant mother” who “completely doted” on her daughters.View image in fullscreenAlana Odysseos was pregnant with her third child.Photograph: Family Handout/PAJurors in March’s trial were not told that he had been convicted of murder before. He was 21 when he fatally stabbed 17-year-old Andre Drummond in the neck at a McDonald’s restaurant in Denmark Hill, south London, in January 2000.He was released on a life licence in early 2013, and recalled to jail later that year after he stamped on the stomach of another pregnant girlfriend in July. He was released again in February 2018.March also had convictions for assault and criminal damage in 1995.The court was told Odysseos had known about March’s murder conviction, and safeguarding checks had been made by probation services. But when the defendant said their relationship had ended amicably, no further checks were made.Hours before killing Odysseos, March had argued with her about whether to abort their unborn child, with the victim heard to say: “I don’t want to kill my baby.”On Friday, Mr Justice Murray jailed March for life with a minimum term of 42 years. He rejected calls from Odysseos’s family and the prosecution for a whole-life order but noted that, given his age, March may never be released.March had appeared in court by videolink from Belmarsh prison, having initially refused to come to the Old Bailey.View image in fullscreenKaren Cronin (left) paid tribute to her daughter outside the court.Photograph: Ben Whitley/PAOdysseos’s mother, Karen Cronin, said: “Alana, my beautiful kind and loving daughter, left this earth in the most callous and brutal way imaginable.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You took Alana, you took the baby she was carrying, the child she was excited about. I fear if you are ever released you will kill again.”DI Aytac Necati, who led the investigation, said March had been unhappy with the news that Odysseos was pregnant, leading to an escalation in the controlling and coercive behaviour she endured during their short relationship.Prosecutor Louise Oakley argued for a whole-life order – meaning March would never be released – given the “exceptionally high” level of offending.Previously the court had heard how police were alerted by members of the public in Lynmouth Road who found Odysseos outside her home wearing a nightie and dressing gown and clutching her right side.Bleeding from multiple stab wounds to her body, she pointed at the defendant standing nearby and shouted: “Shaine stabbed me, he stabbed me.

They had argued that the US Department of Agriculture’s suspension of Snap benefits due to kick in on Saturday was unlawful.Snap, the nation’slargest anti-hunger initiative, provides assistance to nearly 42 million – one in eight – low-income Americans each month. The USDA has said insufficient funds exist to pay full benefits, as issuing food stamps costs the public purse between $8.5bn and $9bn every month.The Trump administration contends the agency lacks authority to pay them until Congress passes a spending bill that will ending the enduring government shutdown which began on 1 October.Trump lambasted the decisions on Friday,writingon Truth Social that he does “NOT want Americans to go hungry just because the Radical Democrats refuse to do the right thing and REOPEN THE GOVERNMENT.”“I have instructed our lawyers to ask the Court to clarify how we can legally fund SNAP as soon as possible. It is already delayed enough due to the Democrats keeping the Government closed through the monthly payment date and, even if we get immediate guidance, it will unfortunately be delayed while States get the money out,” he wrote.“If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding, just like I did with Military and Law Enforcement Pay.”The plaintiffs in the civil case being heard in Rhode Island are represented by the liberal legal advocacy group Democracy Forward. The group argued that the federal government’s decision to suspend the nutritional benefits was wrong and unlawful, as the USDA still had funds available to fulfill its obligation to fund the Snap program.Such available funding includes $5.25bn in contingency funds that Congress has previously provided for the USDA to use when “necessary to carry out program operations”, the plaintiffs said.Aside from the contingency funds, the plaintiffs argued that a separate fund with about $23bn in it could also be utilized to avoid what would be an unprecedented suspension of Snap benefits.In theMassachusettscase, the US district judge Indira Talwani in Boston gave the administration until Monday to say whether it would partly pay for the benefits for November with contingency money or fund them fully with additional funds.It wasn’t immediately clear how quickly the debit cards that beneficiaries use to buy groceries could be reloaded after the ruling. That process often takes one to two weeks.The rulings are likely to face appeals.In their challenge, the Democratic-led states argued that the agriculture department has the legal authority – and available funds – to at least partly maintain the program during the shutdown.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The government has acknowledged that it has billions of federal dollars left, including emergency funds especially marked for Snap, but top officials have maintained they are unable to tap into those reserve funds.The administration warned that a court order requiring it to use emergency reserves to fund Snap would be “operationally fraught”, arguing it could take weeks to deliver benefits and might leave families with less than half their normal monthly allotment. In court filings, officials noted that such a partial payment “has never been made – and for good reason”.The argument appears to contradict the department’s lapsed-funding plan,releasedin late September, which stated that Congress’s “evident” intent was for Snap operations to continue during a government shutdown and pointed to “multi-year contingency funds” that could be tapped in the event the closures dragged on. The plan has been removed from the department’s website.The USDA’s website now carries a strikingly partisan notice, accusing Senate Democrats, incorrectly, of shutting down the government to provide healthcare to undocumented immigrants and trans Americans. “Bottom line, the well has run dry,” the notice says. “At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01.”The administration’s refusal to intervene underscored a broader strategy during the shutdown, now the second-longest in US history. Throughout the impasse, Trump has selectively reprogrammed federal funds to protect priorities central to his political agenda – such as paying troops and law enforcement officers, including those involved in immigration enforcement – while allowing other programs like Snap to starve.Bracing for the loss of federal nutrition assistance, food banks and pantries, already stretched thin amid rising food prices, were bracing for a surge in demand. Officials in states such as Virginia, Maryland, Louisiana, Hawaii and Minnesota have announced plans to tap state and local funds to provide food aid and assist food banks in the interim.The governors ofNew York,Delaware,OregonandVirginiahave declared the looming crisis a state of emergency, while states set aside millions to help offset the lapse of federal benefits.“Unlike Washington Republicans, I won’t sit idly by as families struggle to put food on the table,” New York’s governor, Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, announced on Thursday.In California, the Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, said he would deploy theCalifornia national guardunder his command to support food banks and announced$80min state support to fill the Snap gap.Reuters and the Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS federal government shutdown 2025HungerRhode IslandMassachusettsFoodUS federal government shutdownsnewsShareReuse this content"

        "Content": "17.54 EDTThe day so farThe White House announced a new rule restricting the ability of credentialed journalists to freely access the offices of press secretaryKaroline Leavittand other top communications officials in the West Wing, near the Oval Office. A memorandum issued late today bans journalists from accessing Room 140, also known as “Upper Press”, without a prior appointment, citing the need to protect potentially sensitive material. It said the change would take effect immediately.Donald Trumpannounced that he has renovated the bathroom inside the Lincoln bedroom at the White House, and shared an image of the lavish white-and-black-marbled remodel.Trump has renovated other parts of the White House, including his heavily criticized demolition of the East Wing to build a $300m ballroom, paving over the Rose Garden and decorating the Oval Office with gold.Trump’s request to add a documentary proof of citizenship requirement to the federal voter registration form cannot be enforced, a federal judge ruled.US district judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly in Washington DC uled that the proof-of-citizenship directive is an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers, dealing a blow to the administration and its allies.Trumpis set to sit down withNorah O’Donnell, aCBSanchor,this afternoon in what would be the president’s first interview with the network since its parent company Paramount settled a $16m lawsuit with him.It comes as CBS is in the midst of a deliberate reposturing aimed, at least in part, to the center and the right.Trumpsaid that the US and Canada will not restart trade talks, but that Canadian PM Mark Carney had apologized to him for an Ontario political ad that featured Ronald Reagan saying tariffs spell disaster.New York’s Democratic governor Kathy Hochul called on the Trump administration to“release emergency nutrition assistance for the 3 million New Yorkers set to lose their Snap benefits tomorrow”.Hochul said that her administration “remains prepared for the worst” and is “fast-tracking over $100 million for food banks and pantries” and hasdeclared a state of emergency.It comes as two federal judges ruled almost simultaneously this afternoon that the Trump administration must continue to fund Snap, the nation’s biggest food aid program, using contingency funds during the government shutdown. The rulings came a day before the US Department of Agriculture planned to freeze payments to the program, which serves about one in eight (or 42 million) Americans.The US will not send any high-level officials to the upcomingCop30 climate summit in Brazil, a White House official told Reuters, alleviating some concern among world leaders that Washington would send a team to scupper the talks.Public tours in the White House will resume in December, according to a statement from the office of the first lady. They had been suspended indefinitely in August amid construction forTrump’s controversial $300m ballroom project.Trumpdenied that he is considering strikes insideVenezuela, even amid reports that his administration may expand its counter-drug campaign in the Caribbean. It comes as the UN high commissioner for human rights said today that US military strikes against boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean allegedly carrying illegal drugs from South America are “unacceptable” and must stop.The presidentreaffirmed that the US would resume nuclear testing, and did not answer directly when asked whether that would include the traditional underground nuclear tests common during the cold war. “You’ll find out very soon, but we’re going to do some testing,” Trump told reporters onboard Air Force One as he flew to Palm Beach, Florida, when asked about underground nuclear tests. “Other countries do it. If they’re doing to do it, we’re going to do it, okay?”A Republican-dominated Ohio panel adopted new US House districts thatcould boost the GOP’s chances of winning two additional seats in next year’s electionsand aid Trump’s efforts to hold on to a slim congressional majority. You can view the maphere.Trump called on the Senate to scrap the filibuster, so that the Republican majority can bypass Democrats and reopen the federal government.Thefilibusteris a way for a relatively small group of senators to block action by the majority. The filibuster rule allows a minority of 41 senators to prevent a vote on most kinds of legislation. The Senate majority leader, John Thune, a Republican known for defending Senate traditions, has repeatedly rejected proposals to weaken or remove the 60-vote rule.Share"

Nonetheless, Poulin said, she hoped the amount awarded to her client sends “a clear message that Maine juries are willing to hold medical providers accountable when they fail to meet minimum standards of care”.“There are so many and yet so few words to capture the impact of this result,” Poulin added in a statement to the Guardian. “Watching Lyndsey continue to push year after year, uphill, against the odds, to get justice for her daughter was beyond inspiring. This result was possible because of her unbelievable perseverance and determination to obtain justice for Jazzy.“I hope that this verdict will finally bring some peace and closure for the tragic loss of this beautiful, innocent 15-year-old girl.”Jazzy was initially diagnosed with pneumonia after becoming ill on 14 July 2021, according toreportingfrom the Maine news outlet WMTW.A doctor with the Mid Coast Medical Group later concluded Jazzy had gynecomastia, which is an increase in breast tissue that is frequently found in men who use anabolic steroids, asnotedby Maine’s Portland Press Herald.Jazzy subsequently died of cardiac arrest on 1 August 2021, a little more than two weeks after she first indicated she felt sick. It was later determined that Jazzy’s death resulted from a buildup of fluid stemming from acute lymphoblastic leukemia, which Sutherland’s attorneys contended was a common kind of pediatric cancer that responds well to treatment if diagnosed appropriately. Sutherland ultimately sued Mid Coast, alleging negligence in the death of Jazzy, who lived in Maine’s New Gloucester area.Obamacare insurance prices will jump up 26% next year, report predictsRead moreAttempts to contact Mid Coast Medical Group for comment were not immediately successful. But WMTW reported that Mid Coast’s attorneys maintained that medical personnel are tasked with making many decisions daily, and honest mistakes should not be punished.Mid Coast’s attorneys also argued that another provider who first saw Jazzy had some responsibility as well.Jurors sided with Sutherland after a trial that began on Monday.Sutherland testified during the trial, according to thePress Herald.“I don’t want anybody [else] to have to do this,” Sutherland reportedly said on the witness stand while discussing why she was pursuing her lawsuit. “Nobody should have to do this.”Explore more on these topicsMaineUS healthcareUS justice systemnewsShareReuse this content"

It says the US Election Assistance Commission, which has been considering adding the requirement to the federal voter form, is permanently barred from taking action to do so.A message seeking comment from the White House was not immediately returned.The lawsuit brought by the Democratic National Committee and various civil rights groups will continue to play out to allow the judge to consider other challenges to Trump’s order.

Nonetheless, a Republican majority on the board voted toreopenthe investigation last year. On the night of the 2024 presidential election, the board voted to subpoenaa slew of documents. This summer, the board passed a resolution asking the justice departmentto interveneand help them get the documents. The subpoenas issued last year seek records related to voter lists, chain of custody forms, ballot images, security seals and ballot scanner paperwork.The30 October letterfrom the department’s civil rights division, obtained by the Guardian, asks Fulton county to turn over a slew of records that were subpoenaed by the state election board. The letter’s existence wasfirst reportedby the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.“Transparency seems to have been frustrated at multiple turns inGeorgia,” Harmeet Dhillon, a Trump ally who leads the civil rights division, wrote in the letter. She also said the voting section had received correspondence from “voter transparency advocates” of “multiple instances of government obstruction of transparency requests, including high-resolution ballot scans, signature verification documentation, and various metadata requests”. She asked the county to turn over the records within 15 days.A spokesperson for the Fulton county elections board did not immediately return a request for comment. A justice department spokesperson declined to comment beyond what was in the letter.The department’s request comes as the justice department has asked 40 states to turn over voter roll information and has sued eight states that have refused. The White House also recently hired Kurt Olsen, a lawyer who worked on cases seeking to overturn the 2020 election results to work on voting issues. Heather Honey, another prominent election denier whose misleading research was used to sow doubt about the 2020 election results, has also been appointed to an election-related role in the Department of Homeland Security.To justify its request, the justice department cited a provision of the Civil Rights Act that requires election officials to retain election records and gives the attorney general the right to request them. The law requires records be retained for 22 months after a federal election – a period that has long elapsed since the 2020 contest.The letter also said the department also needed the records to comply with two federal statutes, the National Voter Registration Act and the Help America Vote Act.Justin Levitt, a law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, said the federal statute that allows Department of Justice to request election records requires the department to provide a “basis” for requesting them. That was absent in Dhillon’s letter, he said.“In DoJ’s letter, I see a purpose: we want to check up on what you did,” he said. “But the letter just cites a general swath of federal statutes without saying anything about why there’s a basis to believe that the records they’re seeking will shed light on a federal statutory violation. [The] DoJ doesn’t just get to go fishing because it’s curious.”Explore more on these topicsUS elections 2020GeorgiaUS politicsTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

It also flagged wire transfers made by Epstein to Russian banks.JP Morgan’s report said it had flagged about 4,700 transactions, totalling more than $1bn, that were potentially related to reports of human trafficking involving Epstein,the New York Timesreported. The report, filed during the last Trump administration, also flagged sensitivities around Epstein’s “relationships with two U.S. presidents”.Lawsuits against banks with Epstein ties may shed new light on financier’s crimesRead moreThe report was included in a release of previously sealed court records that were made public on Thursday after requests from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. The documents included other SARs that JPMorgan filed in the years before Epstein’s 2019 arrest about large cash withdrawals, the New York Times reported.The 2019 report did not detail the nature of the transactions or why they were suspicious. But it identified transactions with Leon Black, the co-founder of the private equity firm Apollo Global Management who left the company in 2021; the hedge fund manager Glenn Dubin; the lawyer Alan Dershowitz; and trusts controlled by the retail tycoon Leslie Wexner.The report identified $65m of wire transfers from the mid-2000s that appeared to move between multiple banks linked to Wexner’s trusts but it did not provide details about the transactions involving Black, Dubin or Dershowitz.None of the individuals named in the report have been charged with crimes in relation to Epstein.JP Morgan’s 15-year relationship with Epstein, a convicted sex offender, has become a source of major legal and political scrutiny.The unsealed documents were part of a 2023 litigation filed by the US Virgin Islands, where Epstein owned a private island and conducted most of his financial affairs, and on behalf of his victims.JP Morgan settledthe cases without admitting liability.Patricia Wexler, a spokesperson for JPMorgan, said the release of the SARs showed that the bank had alerted regulators about Epstein.She said: “The SARs do confirm what’s been inferred all along: the bank filed SARs about Epstein early on, and specifically when it exited Epstein from the bank in 2013 – and repeatedly between 2013 and 2019, as required.“It does not appear that anyone in the government or law enforcement acted on those SARs for years.”Devon Spurgeon, a spokesperson for Dubin, said the transactions in question were unrelated to Epstein’s crimes, and Dershowitz, who was one of Epstein’s lawyers, said the only funds he received from Epstein were payments for legal services, according to the New York Times.A representative for Black did not want to comment.

Now, it will be up to Bari Weiss, CBS News’s editor in chief, who has no previous background in television, to help decide what comes next for the show, which has struggled to attract viewers.On Monday, CBS Evening News co-anchor John Dickerson – one of the network’s best-known personalities –announced he would leave the networkat the end of the year, leaving behind his fellow anchor, Maurice DuBois.While the network has not addressed DuBois’ fate, network insiders expect that CBS News will return to a single anchor format. The question now is whether Weiss and Tom Cibrowski, the network president, will choose an internal candidate, or hire from the outside, as they put their imprint on a ratings-challenged show that, like its rivals, is struggling with the challenges of the digital age.Network management had attempted to shake things up by introducing a new format for the show in January. In addition to having co-anchors, the show pivoted to a formula that prioritized longer, more deeply reported stories rather than hard news run-downs from Washington. Rather than jolting the show out of its long-time position in third place, trailing both ABC World News Tonight and the NBC Nightly News in viewers, the audience dropped off even further.CBS News staffers lose jobs in ‘bloodbath’ as part of sweeping cuts from ParamountRead moreIf the network chooses to promote from within, Tony Dokoupil, the morning show co-anchor, stands as good a chance as anyone. Norah O’Donnell, who anchored the show from 2019 to 2024, has also been mentioned.But Weiss seems interested in hiring an external candidate and has shown interest in several top anchors. The problem is that many of them are already under contract at their existing networks for several more years.Bret Baier, the Fox News anchor, is one of those external options, but the evening news anchor made clear this week that he is signed with Fox through 2028. Another candidate, Anderson Cooper, the CNN anchor, is also under contract at the network – though he has a pre-existing relationship with CBS News through his role as a correspondent on 60 Minutes.Weiss has also expressed interest in another Fox anchor, Dana Perino, the Guardian has learned. But Perino, like Baier, is under contract for several more years – into the next decade, in her case – and cannot sign with a rival network.Perino appeared on Weiss’s Honesty with Bari Weiss podcast in May, and the two were effusive in praising each other. “The private Dana is even more gracious and shining than the public one,” Weiss said. “You are a person who models, frankly, just classy behavior, the kind of class that I think a lot of people have forgotten.”Perino described herself as “a huge fan” of Weiss and her wife, Nellie Bowles, and said that their website the Free Press is “one of the best things that has kept me more informed and smarter, and also super entertained”.In chatter among employees, another name that has come up – but isn’t likely in serious consideration – is Shepard Smith, a former Fox News anchor, who resigned suddenly from the network in 2019. He signed with financial network CNBC to anchor a nightly newscast, but the experiment failed and he left the network in 2022. Since then, Smith has kept a low profile.From CBS to TikTok, US media are falling to Trump’s allies. This is how democracy crumbles | Owen JonesRead moreEven if Weiss can land a big-name outsider, it’s an open question whether it would actually make a difference. CBS News has gone through a host of evening news anchors – since 2011, the show has been hosted by Katie Couric, Scott Pelley, Anthony Mason, Jeff Glor and O’Donnell, in addition to the current pairing – but none have been able to change the evening news pecking order. And with every switch behind the anchor desk, “you have sent viewers away each time”, said a former CBS News executive who requested anonymity to speak candidly.Generally, viewers tend to stick with their evening news show of choice and seem unwilling to try out the competition. While NBC recently had a change in the anchor chair, with Tom Llamas replacing longtime anchor Lester Holt, ABC has seen continuity with David Muir leading the show since 2014. This season,Muir’s show has averaged 7.5 million viewers, comfortably ahead of NBC (5.7 million viewers) and far ahead of CBS (3.7 million viewers).“She’s got a disaster on her hands at the Evening News and she’s got to fix the Evening News, and that’s got to be her new project,” said Tom Bettag, a lecturer at the University of Maryland’s journalism school who spent 22 years at CBS News, including a five-year stint as executive producer of the nightly show under Dan Rather.While the show’s ratings aren’t what they were, Bettag said the show is still essential to the identity of the network, not to mention a reliable source of advertiser revenue. “If they have a really strong Evening News, it lifts the whole place,” he added.CBS News employees – who were not authorized to comment – were less specific about what needs to change on the evening show and who the network should pick to anchor. “What they need is someone who plays a very good anchor man and hopefully has journalistic chops and a very talented show-runner,” one staffer told the Guardian, while another was more concise: “We need to just do a damn newscast. Don’t overthink it.”The CBS Evening News may not hold the place in society it once did, but what Weiss (and Cibrowski) decide to do with the show could hint at her longterm strategy and provide an early signal of whether she might be successful in turning around the network’s fortunes.“I wouldn’t say it’s the most important decision, but it’s probably the most telling decision, about where she’s taking the direction of the company,” the former CBS News executive said.Explore more on these topicsCBSUS television industryTelevision industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Starbucks Workers United, a union representing baristas at the chain, has won elections atmore than 650of its locations in 45 states and the District of Columbia, representing more than 12,000 workers.Butit has yet to obtain a contract.StarbucksWorkers United claims company management started to “majorly stonewall” the union; Starbucks claims the union walked away from the bargaining table.A strike authorization vote called by Starbucks Workers United began last Friday, 24 October, and will continue until Sunday 2 November. About 70 pickets have been planned in 60 cities across the US.Starbucks to cut 900 jobs and close dozens of North American stores as sales struggleRead moreMany Starbucks baristas say they are struggling to make ends meet. Sabina Aguirre, a barista in Columbus, Ohio, said she made less than $16 an hour. “That’s not sustainable for a day-to-day life,” she said. “If I didn’t have help with my rent, I would be homeless right now. That’s the reality of my situation.“It’s also the reality of the situation for a majority of the people I work with. Most Starbucks workers that I talk to on a day-to-day basis are one or two paychecks away from homelessness, and that shouldn’t be the reality of people who are working at a job that claims to support their workers.”Late last year, Starbucks workersheldfive days of escalating strikes at stores across the US ahead of Christmas to demand finalizing a first union contract. But the action that workers are currently considering could pave the way for even larger strike actions, hitting more store locations nationwide.“All the way back in 2021, workers organized around issues like needing better wages, better take-home pay, better hours, so they can actually make their ends meet, access the benefits they need and have better staffing so the floor can run better,” said Silvia Baldwin, a Starbucks barista in Philadelphia. “Since then, the company has also egregiously violated labor law, so workers are organizing around the company to actually making right those violations and making workers whole. Those are still the main issues that workers are fired up about.”Baldwin, a bargaining delegate, said negotiating with Starbucks in 2024 for a period of months rendered some progress. Tentative agreements were reached covering 80-90% of the contract, she claimed, until they reached economic issues and settling unfair labor practice charges.“The company really started to take a turn into bad faith bargaining,” added Baldwin. “The CEO regime changed.Brian Niccol was brought in. And around that same time the presidential election took place, Trump came into office, and the company began to majorly stonewall our bargaining committee and put forward proposals that were just extremely unserious.”Unionized workers at Starbucks “are highly motivated, highly engaged, love doing their job and want it to be as good as it should be”, Baldwin said, and they can tell “the company exactly what it’s going to take to turn things around. If Brian Niccol wants to actually fix this company, you should listen to our union.”It would take less than one average day’s sales to finalize the contract, the union has claimed. Niccol, the CEO, had a total compensation over the past year of$97.8m, whereas themedian annual salaryfor a Starbucks employee in 2024 was $14,674.The company has been under pressure for months, andannouncedearlier this year a slate of store closures around the US, including 59 union stores, as part ofcost-cutting restructuringdue to lagging sales.If authorized, the strike will be closely watched throughout the US labor movement.“It’s clear that bargaining has stalled. Thousands of Starbucks workers have voted to unionize, and they aren’t yet protected by a binding contract,” Rebecca Givan, a labor law professor at Rutgers University, said. “A strong showing in their strike-authorization vote will tell Starbucks management that these workers are serious about taking action if a contract isn’t agreed soon.“Demonstrating that this national, dispersed campaign can lead to first contracts will send a message to workers nationwide that they can organize and win material gains, backed up with an enforceable contract.”A spokesperson for Starbucks, Jaci Anderson, claimed the firm’s transformation campaign, known as Back to Starbucks, was working.“Workers United, which represents around 4% of our partners, chose to walk away from the bargaining table. If they’re ready to come back, we’re ready to talk. Any agreement needs to reflect the reality that Starbucks already offers the best job in retail,” Anderson wrote in an email. “Hourly partnersearnmore than $30 an hour on average in pay and benefits and we’re investing over $500m to put more partners in stores during busy times.“The facts show people like working at Starbucks. Partner engagement is up, turnover is nearly half the industry average and we get more than 1m job applications a year.”Explore more on these topicsStarbucksUS unionsFood & drink industrynewsShareReuse this content"

The Dutch government said thatthreatened the future of European chip capacity, and removed the Wingtech chairman, Zhang Xuezheng, as chief executive.China responded by halting exports from all Nexperia’s factories inChina, prompting warnings this week that the embargo would force production lines at EU car factories to close within days.An extended blockade threatens the supply chain, because many Nexperia products manufactured inEurope– including the wafers from which chips are cut – were previously shipped to the Chinese factory for packaging and distribution.Nexperia’s interim chief executive, Stefan Tilger, wrote that he had suspended shipments to the Dongguan factory, in the southern Guangdong province, on Sunday, saying it was “a direct consequence of the local management’s recent failure to comply with the agreed contractual payment terms”, according to extracts first published by Reuters.Nexperia said it still hoped to resume shipments, and wanted to de-escalate the situation. A person with knowledge of the situation said shipments could resume if the contractual payments were made. The company will also continue to ship products to a factory in Malaysia, which is smaller than its Chinese plant.A succession ofcarmakers have warned of the risk of disruptionfrom shortages of the key components, which are crucial throughout modern cars.The automotive industry suffered from severe semiconductor shortages in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, but these affected more advanced chips, rather than the cheaper power control ones made by Nexperia. The company generally ships more than 100bn products a year, to be used in parts ranging from airbags and adjustable seats to wing mirrors and central locking.Nissan said this week it had enough chips to last until the first week of November, while rival Honda said it had suspended production at a plant in Mexico. Mercedes-Benz said it was “covered” in the short term, but it was looking for alternatives.Volkswagen signalled on Thursday that its annual profit targets were at riskwithout sufficient chips.However, Toyota, the world’s largest carmaker, told reporters at a car show in Tokyo on Friday that it was not facing a major supply problem, even if it could eventually face a hit to production.The EU’s trade commissioner, Maroš Šefčovič, is to seek further discussions with Chinese counterparts after Chinese and EU officials met in Brussels on Friday to address China’s ban on Nexperia exports and its restrictions onsupplies of rare earth minerals.Also on Friday, the bloc’s tech commissioner, Henna Virkkunen, met Nexperia’s interim boss after seeing the European chip makers Infineon, ST and NXP the day before.After the meeting, she said the dialogue with Nexperia had served to underline the EU’s needs for a new Chips Act with three lessons from the current crisis, including: better visibility of chip stocks in the pipeline, the need to invest in chip supply despite the cost, and the need for reserve stocks.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He is not at fault in this incident,” the statement read.Lawson had returned to the pits on the opening laps of the race having taken damage. When he emerged he was confronted with two marshals running across the track having been clearing debris from the opening corners directly in front of him.“Mate. Oh my god, are you kidding me? Did you just see that?” he said to his engineer on team radio. “I could have fucking killed them.”After the race he was outraged that the marshals had been placed in such danger apparently without being informed that he was out of time with the rest of the field after pitting early.“I honestly couldn’t believe what I was seeing,” he said. “It’s pretty unacceptable. We can’t understand how on a live track marshals can be allowed to just run across the track like that. I have no idea why, I’m sure we’ll get some sort of explanation, but it really can’t happen again.”At the time the marshals had been prepared to be given the all-clear to collect debris from the opening corners, however when Lawson took his stop the FIA race director rescinded the clearance to enter the track. Why the marshals still proceeded to do so remains the subject of an FIA investigation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSport in FocusFree weekly newsletterSign up to Sport in FocusEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Elena Rybakina, the 2022 Wimbledon champion, finally caught fire after a year of near misses, bulldozing through her opponents to win a title in Ningbo, China that solidified her spot in Riyadh among the eight best players in the world.Just as significant as Rybakina’s qualification, though, was its consequences for the player she usurped. Mirra Andreeva, the 18-year-old prodigy who won WTA 1000 titles in Dubai and Indian Wells this year, had seemed like a sure bet to qualify in singles for the finals. Her failure to do so underscores the fact that this year has been the toughest and most competitive women’s tennis season in years.Cameron Norrie hails ‘biggest win’ after roaring back to beat Carlos Alcaraz in ParisRead moreAt the top, Aryna Sabalenka and Iga Swiatek have further strengthened their claims as the two greatest players of their generation. While the former put together another supremely consistent year as the best player in the world,winning her fourth grand slam titleat the US Open and reaching the Australian and French Open finals, the latter captured the one tournament she never imagined she could win, earning her sixth grand slam title at Wimbledon.Still, the other top players have allowed them no rest and the intense competition has inspired countless epic high-stakes matches throughout the year. It took consecutive colossal performances from Madison Keys against Swiatek and Sabalenka to finally win her first grand slam title at the Australian Open. In Paris, Coco Gauff outsmarted Sabalenka in a dramatic, wind-afflicted three-setter to win her second grand slam title aged just 21. Two days earlier, Sabalenka ended Swiatek’s three- year reign inanother unforgettable duel.At the US Open, women’s semi-final day turned out to be one of the best days of tennis this year as Sabalenka overcame Jessica Pegula in a breathless, high-quality battle before Amanda Anisimova continued her long-awaited breakthrough season by dragging herself past Naomi Osaka to reach a second consecutive grand slam final. EvenSwiatek’s 6-0, 6-0 demolitionof Anisimova in the Wimbledon final turned out to be part of one of the most compelling storylines this year. Two months later, Anisimova showed her toughnessby exacting revengeon the Pole at the earliest opportunity in New York.View image in fullscreenIga Swiatek enters the WTA Finals as a Wimbledon champion.Photograph: Robert Prange/Getty ImagesThis may have been a great year for women’s tennis on the court, but on the eve of another finals, the eternal question remains whether the tour can provide its talent with a strong enough platform to turn the sport into a thriving product again. As the Women’s Tennis Association’s flagship event, in recent years this tournament has reflected the tour’s struggles. It should actually be in the middle of a 10-year residency in Shenzhen but the Covid-19 pandemic and the WTA’s fleeting objections tothe disappearance of Peng Shuailed to the cancellation of their agreement after the first edition in 2019.The event then bounced between different countries each year, with various difficulties, a period that also left the WTA in a deep financial hole. Its inevitable embrace of Saudi Arabia addressed some of those financial issues and in recent years the organisation has been restructured. In 2023, the private equity firm CVC Capital Partners acquired a 20% stake in the WTA’s new commercial arm, WTA Ventures. Last August, it appointed Portia Archer as its chief executive.For all the recent changes at the WTA, which included a significant image rebrand at the beginning of the year, it remains to be seen if it can put itself on the right path. Aside from changing the graphics of their website alongside a beige new slogan – Rally The World – not so much has changed to its public offering since that rebrand. The WTA marketing budget remains a fraction of that of the men’s Association ofTennisProfessionals (ATP) and it shows in its paltry output on social media and lack of original content on YouTube.Eight years after initiating its own bespoke subscription-based streaming product, WTA TV, the service still does not have its own app or a global presence. This also contrasts starkly with Tennis TV, the ATP’s streaming platform, which suffocates viewers with content. A particularly concerning development at the WTA, which does not reflect well on the organisation’s judgment, was the decision to end itsWTA Insider initiative, one of the few ways that it effectively showcased the storylines within the sport. Otherwise, the WTA has been dire at marketing its players and their personalities for so long.At a time when women’s sport is enjoying significant growth and momentum around the world, the WTA should be leading the way. Instead, it is still stunted by its own problems and the path forward is unclear. What is certain, though, is the quality provided by the athletes on the court. As play begins on Saturday, with Gauff attempting to defend her title in a brutal field composed of the best players in the world, there will be more great tennis to come.Explore more on these topicsTennisWTA FinalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Many racehorses never get that chanceElizabeth BanickiOn Breeders’ Cup weekend the thoroughbred is celebrated. My aging friend reminds me that the same industry too often steals dignity from the young horses who run for our entertainmentFri 31 Oct 2025 04.30 EDTLast modified on Fri 31 Oct 2025 09.11 EDTShareMy beloved friend Pancho is an off-track thoroughbred who has been with me for 24 years. In his youth, in the early 2000s, he soldiered through a vigorous mid-level career on the competitive tracks of Southern California. At nearly 28 now his life is approaching its natural end. Our life together riding trails has been the purest gift. But his slow decline forces me to face the unsettling possibility of euthanasia. It’s a decision that haunts me constantly, like a whispering djinn. Some days are good, some are not. Though I dread the day I may walk into the barn and he lets me know he needs my help to die I am consoled only by the dignity of his life. He’s privileged where many thoroughbreds of his day and thousands since were not. As it was back then, as it is now and will continue to be, for the young racehorse who dies on the track there is no dignity in the end.Horses helped shape the world as we know it. Now we run them to death | Elizabeth BanickiRead moreAs thoughts of Pancho’s creeping decline weighed on me, I took a job at a large equine hospital to fill gaps in my knowledge and learn how best to care for him as health problems arise. But after a while I admitted to myself that the more sincere reason I am there is to observe other horses die. It may sound dark or morbid, but it hardly compares with the deaths I’ve witnessed before: young racehorses with shattered legs or hearts that burst mid-stride, collapsing before an audience in the name of sport.Since my work began at the clinic, I have held horses’ heads while they were humanely euthanized. A horse’s eyes and body are their complete language. I’ve learned that when a horse is ready to die, whether due to old age or prolonged pain and illness, they accept death, welcome it even, much as people do. These deaths are generally tranquil, “peaceful death”. The horse’s soul is ready to leave.Sometimes though a horse is not ready to die. A young healthy horse may fight even as the overdose of bright pink barbiturates is pushed into their jugular. In the moments before their heart stops, they may stagger and set backwards. Their heads high and flight-ready, bodies braced stiff with fear, and eyes wide and wild before they drop to the ground dead. Some racetrack veterinarians administer a mild sedative prior to euthanasia, which works to confuse the mind and lessen the horse’s ability to physically respond to what’s happening to it. It is meant to relax the horse so that it accepts death with less fight. But this sedative is not designed to kill pain, and it takes time to have an effect, quite a bit more time in fact than euthanasia itself. For a horse who is exerted to the extreme from running and consumed by fear and pain, is more time spent standing on a broken leg ultimately more humane, especially considering the sedation makes standing precarious even for a horse on four good legs? When the death screen goes up around the doomed horse on the track, public inquiry stops. But the horse dies whether we see it or not. There is no humanity in taking an innocent horse’s life for a sport, so in the context of racing the term humane euthanasia doesn’t work.None of this is to say that euthanasia is not, in many circumstances, an appropriate way to end an animal’s suffering. But how a horse gets there, and for what purpose, matters. In racing, the horses are not old or sick, and they have no agency in what happens to them. Their lives – unlike Pancho’s, lived fully into age and rest – are only just beginning. They wouldn’t die if not for the misfortune of being bred and made to run toward it. In the world of racing, euthanasia is used loosely, as a tool for managing a business. Insurance payouts are built into the calculus of ownership. It remains a fact that no other equine sport accepted by the public as civilized kills young, healthy horsesat the obscene rate horse racing does. In a sense, the sport has hijacked the language of humane euthanasia to justify the unethical – an act of moral sleight of hand made necessary by an industry built on the exploitation of the young.My heart will be crushed the day I say goodbye to Pancho and if it is humane euthanasia we face, in that tremendous decision I will make on his behalf, I will find peace knowing that he knows I do it from a place of true love and compassion.And, believe me, they know.Elizabeth Banickiworked for two decadesas an exercise rider in the horse racing industry.Explore more on these topicsHorse racingHorsesBreeders' CupUS sportscommentShareReuse this content"

Derrick Henry rushed 119 yards on 19 carries, and accomplished another career milestone when he became the 17th player inNFLhistory to eclipse the 12,000-yard career rushing mark.For the Dolphins, De’Von Achane had 14 carries for 67 yards, while Jaylen Waddle caught six passes for 82 yards.The Dolphins (2-7) outgained the Ravens 226 yards to 109 and held them to 1 of 6 on third down in the first half, but Miami trailed 14-6 at the break because of a slew of mistakes.On Miami’s second drive, rookie Tahj Washington fumbled at the Dolphins’ four-yard line, and Andrews caught a two-yard TD from Jackson on fourth down on the Ravens’ ensuing possession.Achane led the Dolphins back down the field with runs of 19 and 22 yards, but a false start by offensive lineman Larry Borom on fourth-and-one forced Miami to kick a field goal, which Riley Patterson missed from 35 yards out.The Ravens’ offense answered again. Jackson escaped the grasp of linebacker Jaelan Phillips and connected with Isaiah Likely for a 35-yard pickup, which set up Andrews’ 20-yard score – aided by two Dolphins defenders running into each other in coverage – that put Baltimore ahead 14-3.Jackson, a two-time MVP, connected on his first nine passes of the second half before he finally missed DeAndre Hopkins on a deep throw in the final minute of the third quarter. The game was out of reach by then, and Jackson had already thrown his fourth TD – a nine-yard toss to Bateman that put Baltimore up 28-6.Tua Tagovailoa, who completed 25 of 40 passes for 261 yards with an interception, led the Dolphins 80 yards down the field early in the fourth, a promising drive that included two fourth-down conversions. But receiver Malik Washington fumbled at the 10, and Dolphins fans began to exit Hard Rock Stadium en masse with more than 10 minutes remaining.“You’re playing with fire when you’re giving the ball back to that offense,” Miami head coach Mike McDaniel said of his team’s three turnovers in the game.Miami’s only points were Patterson’s field goals of 49 and 43 yards. They also sustained a pair of key injuries. Linebacker Chop Robinson exited the game in the second quarter with a head injury and was later ruled out due to a concussion. Rookie running back Ollie Gordon II injured an ankle in the first half and did not return.Explore more on these topicsNFLBaltimore RavensMiami DolphinsUS sportsShareReuse this content"

The WBC was set to have a purse bid on Friday for a fight between Cameron and fellow British boxer Sandy Ryan.In December 2023, Amanda Serranoalso relinquished her WBC titleafter they refused to allow her to compete in bouts under the same rule-set as men’s boxing, with 12 three-minute rounds.The WBC president, Mauricio Sulaimán, had said earlier in 2023 that they would not sanction 12 three-minute rounds in women’s bouts. “[In] tennis women play 3 sets, [in] basketball the basket is shorter and the ball smaller and those are not contact sports. We stand by the safety and wellbeing of the fighters,” he wrote on X.Most women’s title fights have 10 rounds of two minutes each, and Cameron was one of more than two dozen boxers – including Serrano – who launched a campaign in 2023 to have the choice to compete under the same rules as men.Cameron, who holds a 21-1 professional boxing record, made clear her protest goes beyond personal preference, framing it as a fight for future generations of female boxers. “I’m proud of my accomplishment in becoming a WBC champion, but it’s time to take a stand for what’s right and for the future of the sport,” she added.Cameron is not stepping away from boxing entirely, however, with her promoters MVP saying she plans to pursue other championship opportunities and marquee bouts while maintaining her insistence on competing in three-minute rounds.Explore more on these topicsBoxingnewsShareReuse this content"

It was usual to have a team review after a big tournament and after the Euros in 2022 we came together in the Club England meeting room at St George’s Park, the team’s headquarters.The emotional security that I felt within England was bolstered by the culture and values that had underpinned and contributed to our success. Non-collegiate behaviour was not tolerated. We came back together to the news that Hannah Hampton had been dropped from the squad: her behaviour behind the scenes at the Euros had frequently risked derailing training sessions and team resources.We split off into groups and reported back on what had gone well – which was pretty clear, given we had won – what hadn’t and what we could do differently in the future.The only negative that each group reported back on was that behaviour, which was overwhelmingly considered disruptive and unreliable, with a risk of being destructive, taking energy and time from coaches who needed to work with the rest of the team on set-pieces, mentality and of course goalkeeping sessions. It affected us all in a domino effect to an extent that was extremely unusual in a successful elite team environment. It also completely contradicted my professional values, which included preserving everything I had, mentally and physically, for performance and for a goalkeeper union where everyone, whatever their role, had the space and support to be great at their job.“I accept this was negative,” Sarina acknowledged. “This has been dealt with and it’s not appropriate to speak about one individual any more,” she said, drawing a line under it. I had often shut down conversations in camp about it too.View image in fullscreenMary Earps and Sarina Wiegman address the press before England’s World Cup quarter-final against Colombia in 2023. Wiegman later replaced Earps as the Lionesses first-choice goalkeeper.Photograph: David Gray/AFP/Getty ImagesIn the spring of 2023 Sarina called me to bounce the idea of bringing Hannah back into the squad. Sarina now routinely called me into leadership meetings and would take my opinion into consideration on team matters beyond goalkeeping. I was happy to be part of those conversations and no matter whether you were among the more experienced or junior players in her squad, feeling like you had a say was a part of our success.“It doesn’t make me feel comfortable,” I said in response to the idea of a return, not needing to remind her of the disharmony that the squad had felt before. I felt protective of the good energy we now had in goalkeeper training and the morale of the wider team.View image in fullscreenHannah Hampton (top) and Mary Earps during an England training session in October 2024.Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Action Images/ReutersI wished that this situation wasn’t what it was but I had been asked my opinion, precisely because the decision would affect my work and performance space, too, and I was both expected and needed to be honest. The progress and development of younger players had become a huge feature of my professional value set in football. Equally, to reward certain behaviour went against those same fundamental values of creating a healthy and happy space for players of all experience to work and thrive, not least in a team environment before a World Cup. I saw, too, that other hard-working keepers would miss out on that space as a result.“I think everyone deserves a second chance,” Sarina said, and another call followed a few weeks later with a wider group, in which she reiterated the same, confirming she wanted to bring her back in. There was a genuine concern about fixing something that wasn’t broken but we respected the manager’s decision and with Hannah back in the squad I kept my focus on retaining my standards and those within the group.In April 2024 as we filed out of a team meeting in the hotel’s conference room, Sarina called me back: “Mary, can I have a word?” she said, in front of everyone.That was unusual and I felt embarrassed being singled out. I didn’t know if it was intentional or if it was her way of making an example of me. I hoped it wasn’t, but, like at school, when you’re asked to stay behind you tend to know exactly what’s coming. And you know that the fact you had been called back is going to be the talk of the town. I hated that.“What have I done?” I asked, genuinely wanting to understand this energy shift. I felt devastated before anyone else had even uttered a word.“I want to give someone else experience,” Sarina confirmed. She didn’t want me to be upset but she was matter-of-fact about her choice. I had to respect that, but we could be frank enough with each other that I thought I could explain that I didn’t understand or agree with it.“I don’t get it,” I said. “It’s a qualifier match. And bad behaviour is being rewarded.”View image in fullscreenEngland’s goalkeeping union – Hannah Hampton (left), Ellie Roebuck (second right) and Mary Earps (right) – with goalkeeping coach Darren Ward in Basel in June 2022.Photograph: Lynne Cameron/The FA/Getty Images“Everything you’ve said, we’re aware and we’ve taken into consideration,” Darren Ward, the goalkeeping coach, replied. “This is still what we want to do.” So they had thought what I was thinking too.Now this felt unjust. My eyes welled with tears. It was a choice that went against my core values. I couldn’t get my head around it because when my values were compromised, the strain always felt heavy enough to keep me up at night. When this kind of a decision compromised my football, I was sleepless.The affinity I had for Sarina and this job – one I’d given every last cell of myself to – was being destroyed, the trust and respect evaporating.I thought my days of rejections were over, but here I was again at the peak of my career facing another huge blow. I tried to remain positive, to be grateful for all the things I had in my life, all the amazing opportunities, the incredible people, the sport I loved, but I also felt utterly dejected. And because I knew where that could take me, because I carried the lessons I had learned when I’d moved from darkness into light before, I realised for the first time I didn’t have to let anyone else crush my spirit again. I had a choice with England too. I wasn’t entitled to keep my place if Sarina didn’t want me to but I was entitled to decide what happened next. I could do what other people do if they’re no longer enjoying their job: I could leave, I could retire.In April 2025 I went to St George’s Park with my head up, even if I was working extra hard to keep it that way, not knowing exactly how things were going to play out but at peace with the fact that it would most certainly be my last camp there as an England player.Mary Earps says she told Wiegman she was rewarding Hampton’s ‘bad behaviour’Read moreA day in, earlier than usual, I had a message to meet: “Mary, Sarina wants to talk to you.”I went to room 206, a bedroom that had been converted into a meeting space where our conversations usually took place, at the allocated time.I felt sick and anxious as I took my seat with her and Darren.Then came the words I’d waited over 12 months to hear: “I’ve decided Hannah’s the No 1 for now.”I felt the weight of my heart sink to the floor and the relief that I had finally had clarity lift from my shoulders all at once.“She’s a little bit ahead of you,” Sarina continued. “It’s nothing you’ve done or done wrong.”“I expected this,” I said. I had 30 seconds to say my piece. I told her I wasn’t surprised by what she’d just said, that it had been a long time coming, but I felt extremely disappointed, nonetheless.Then I said: “I just think you could have been more direct and honest from the jump.” She wasn’t happy with that.“No, I don’t think that’s fair. I always communicate openly. We’ve only just made this decision,” she cut in.That sounded like bullshit to me.Darren didn’t look up from the floor the whole time.“Respectfully,” I said, “we’re going to have to agree to disagree. You’ve made your decision. I’ve had to make one too. This will be my last camp, I’m internationally retiring.”Sarina wasn’t at all shocked – we’d already discussed the fact I needed to consider my future. She said she could see I’d been thinking about it for some time and now asked me why. “It doesn’t align with my morals and values to continue,” I said. “I’d like to graciously step aside. I’d rather Khiara [Keating, the Manchester City goalkeeper] get the experience. I’ve had my time in the sun.”View image in fullscreenSarina Wiegman gestures towards Mary Earps in a huddle on the Wembley pitch after the Finalissima win over Brazil in 2023.Photograph: Naomi Baker/The FA/Getty ImagesI continued with honesty but my voice broke as I said: “I used to feel invincible here but I don’t feel that way any more.” That saddened me the most of all.I told her that playing for my country had been the greatest privilege of my life but I couldn’t bear to look back on it as a place where I cried in my room, where I didn’t recognise myself. I said I no longer felt supported there and that the goalkeeper dynamic had been too unhealthy for too long.“I know it’s hard but you have so much more to give and your level is so high,” she said.“I know my level is high, that’s not the question,” I said, defiant in the truth. The reality, I told her, was that none of it made sense any more: “It’s better for the team if I move on.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I knew that no matter how much I said, they wouldn’t understand because it wouldn’t fit their agenda. From where they stood it looked better for me to be there, in the background, during the Euros that summer and to be dropped entirely afterwards.“Do you want to sleep on it?’ Sarina asked. “I want you to reconsider. You have so much more to give,” she said again. “This isn’t the end of your England career.”The words and actions didn’t match. “I don’t want to sleep on it,” I said. I’d been sleeping on it for so long. I wanted to make the most of my last camp.“It’s been a good run,” I added with a slight smile. They half-laughed at the pragmatism.We’d been sat there now for 20 minutes. To my surprise, they both thanked me for my honesty.“That took incredible bravery,” Darren said, looking up for the first time. It felt like the most frank thing he’d said to me in over a year.They asked if I’d spoken to any of the girls about it.“Not yet,” I said. There were two important games that week and I felt the bare minimum professional conduct was not to burden them. I walked away, and didn’t start either game, but later that week I had another text, this time directly from Sarina: “Mary, could I have 10 minutes?” I headed back to room 206.“I was thinking about what you said and I don’t accept your retirement,” she said. “I don’t want you to go.” I had told her in the earlier meeting that I knew it was time for younger keepers like Khiara to step up. Now she told me: “She will have her time. This is your time now.”View image in fullscreenMary Earps makes a spectacular save during the World Cup quarter-final against Colombia at Stadium Australia in August 2023.Photograph: Zac Goodwin/PAI was stunned. It was a 180-degree turn – she had changed my role for over a year and put me on the bench, my brain had done a mental Olympics trying to figure out what to do for the best, for everyone, now I was being told it was my time?Then, she added: “I also don’t think it’s the right thing for you to go.”“What do you mean?” I asked.“I just worry what people will say. I think it’s better that you stay for the tournament, win a trophy then go.”I’d been clear that I wanted to get off at the next stop, now I felt like I was being manipulated into staying.Out of the blue, two days before my league semi-final playoff in May and two weeks before the next England camp, Sarina texted me asking for my decision. I was totally focused on not derailing my PSG season and wasn’t expecting it yet. Besides, mentally, I wasn’t at all convinced I wanted to change this enormous decision I’d thought so long and hard about.If I was really being asked to reconsider, I asked her for a definitive reason as to why I’d lost my spot. “There has to be a reason beyond just the high level of competition between us,” I said.“Distribution and defending the space,” she answered.I thanked her for the clarity of response. The PSG game was at 9pm on Sunday. She said she needed an answer by 1pm on Monday. I felt pressured but I agreed.The way this next bit played out is the only part of my retirement that I wish I had done differently, where I wish, more than anything, that I had stayed true to myself, that I’d stuck to my intuition.It was 11am and I was in my Paris apartment when Sarina and I spoke. We’d won our match the night before, and a place in the final. I’d barely slept, fuelled by adrenaline, thinking about that and the conversation I had to have.View image in fullscreenMary Earps accepts the Fifa Golden Glove award at the 2023 Women’s World Cup despite England’s defeat in the final.Photograph: Cameron Spencer/Getty ImagesI felt completely up against it and I couldn’t shake her words of warning from camp about it being better for me that I stay.Dubiously, I told her: “OK, I’ll continue.” She was pleased. Then, before we left the call she offered up, in passing: “Well done, I saw you won last night.” I was glad she’d noticed, as it reinforced what she’d said. Then she said she hadn’t watched it.With that, I knew instantly that I’d made the wrong choice; I immediately wished I hadn’t uttered the words. I had committed to something and someone who didn’t seem committed to me; whose words, where I was concerned, still didn’t match their actions, and I’d known it all along. Backtracking was entirely the wrong choice from me and for everyone involved and I felt my body fill with immediate regret. Now I had to either live with it or fix it. I felt trapped.My head had been in a hole that I needed to dig myself out of. How could I ring the manager back and say, “I know I said I’ll continue but it was a mistake”?I was going to the Champions League final to watch my England teammates play for Arsenal. Maybe I could meet Sarina there and talk to her face to face. I messaged to ask if she was going, telling her I needed to talk. She replied saying she wasn’t. England camp was due to start two days later on the Monday; she suggested we speak at lunchtime then.This couldn’t wait. I arrived back in Paris late on the Sunday night and hit her number on my phone.“I can’t do it,” I said.“Wow,” came the reply. Her only word shook me. “I can’t believe it,” she said. “I’m so disappointed. What made you change your mind?”“I don’t think I ever really did,” I replied.I couldn’t have been more honest.View image in fullscreenI had been all along.They say that life puts you in the same situation over and over again and if you approach it in the same way it will deliver you the same lessons too. Sarina had given me the confidence to fulfil the potential I always believed I had inside myself and now our journey together was ending with me having the confidence to say no to her.This is an edited extract from Mary Earps: All In by Mary Earps (Bonnier Books, £22).

Wolves faced Chelsea on 24 December two years ago in the first Premier League Christmas Eve match since 1995, but that was a Sunday, allowing the game to start in the afternoon, which would not be possible this year because it is a working Wednesday.Palace have since asked for Tuesday 23 December to be considered, with EFL sources indicating they favour that date on the grounds of fairness, given that Palace’s game at Leeds two days earlier kicks off at the same time as Arsenal’s trip to Everton. However, Arsenal are understood to have pushed back during talks with the EFL against the prospect of both teams playing two games with one day’s rest in between and are adamant the tie should be in the original slot. A decision is expected next week.When it was suggested that the quarter-final could be moved to help Palace, Arteta said: “I don’t think that’s fair, because we have other competitions as well we have to try to accommodate. We knew at the start of the season the competitions that each club is playing in … On balance we have to try to accommodate the best possible way for everybody.”Asked whether 23 December could be an option, he said: “No, there are others. There are others, believe me, there are other options much better than this one. We already suggested that.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And everybody has a responsibility for the players … It’s dangerous, irresponsible to say that you should play Sunday-Tuesday-Thursday.” He said he was “really upset” wider scheduling issues had not been resolved by the leagues and governing bodies.Arteta, who stressed that player welfare and supporters were the key factors in determining scheduling, warned that clubs could consider pulling out of competitions if issues with fixture congestion were not resolved. He said: “I hope we don’t go [that far]. If we have that big piece of paper with those two principles there in front before we make any decision, all of us in our industry, we won’t get there. If we don’t and we just ignore that, then anything is possible.”Gabriel Martinelli remains sidelined and William Saliba is a doubt for Saturday’s trip to Burnley, where Arsenal hope to make it nine successive victories in all competitions, owing to an ankle injury. Arteta is hopeful the injured trio Martin Ødegaard, Kai Havertz and Noni Madueke could return after the next international break. “I’m excited because they are tremendous players,” he said. “I see them work every single day, how desperate they are to be part of the team.”Explore more on these topicsArsenalnewsShareReuse this content"

The head coach admitted that six defeats in seven games was unacceptable before Aston Villa’s visit on Saturday and denied making excuses for Liverpool’s worst domestic run in 72 years.Slot accepted the pressurewas on before his makeshift teamexited the Carabao Cupagainst Crystal Palace on Wednesday. That pressure to arrest the slide, however, is not, he insisted, coming from Liverpool’s owner, Fenway Sports Group, FSG’s chief executive of football, Michael Edwards, or the sporting director, Richard Hughes, after a summer transfer outlay of almost £450m.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead more“They say similar things,” said Slot, whose team next week face Real Madrid in the Champions League and travel to Manchester City in the Premier League. “I speak mainly to Richard and once in a while to the others. They also see similar things as what I see. For me the conversations haven’t changed a lot. We always talk about the game and it’s always nicer to talk about the game if you have won than if you have lost.”Slot believes Liverpool “have an unbelievable squad if they are all fit and all ready for the programme we are facing”. He said the summer investment in players such as Florian Wirtz and Alexander Isak, who is expected to be sidelined again against Villa through injury, had left the club “in such a good place for the short-term future and the long-term future”.Asked why his team were taking so long to gel, he replied: “You don’t really help me. ‘Why, why, why?’ I give an explanation and people say I’m coming up with excuses. I can come up with five or six reasons why we are not winning as much or losing as much as we do but, as I say every time, there are never enough excuses to have a run of form as we had now. No matter if I could come up with 200 excuses, when you are Liverpool you cannot lose – for me – five out of six, but the reality is six out of seven [Slot was discounting the Palace defeat from Liverpool’s recent run].“There will never be enough reasons but when I came last season all players were fit, and all players had – as a minimum – one year of Premier League experience. So they know what it is to play during the week and then go toBrentford on Saturday. And they were all fit and stayed fit. We had our issues in pre-season [this summer] with players not being fit and players who came in later. It has been more of a struggle to keep them fit or get them all fit.”Only Burnley (21) have faced more big chances from open play this season than Liverpool (19). The league leaders, Arsenal, have faced two. Yet Slot denies the champions have been too open and claims there is no reason to sacrifice his attacking principles for a more pragmatic style after 10 games without a clean sheet. “I don’t see us conceding a lot of chances so I don’t see a reason to change our playing style completely but we need to do better in not conceding goals,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He has lost 19 of his 52 games since signing a two-and-a-half-year contract and last season took United to 15th, their lowest Premier League finish. The Portuguese was asked whether he had worried about completing 12 months in charge.Ruben Amorim’s year at United: renaissance of hope on a long, difficult journeyRead more“To lose so many games, that was so hard for me,” he said, “because this isManchester United. Putting all the attention on the Europa League and not winning, that was massive. So I had some moments where I struggled a lot, and I was thinking: ‘Maybe it’s not meant to be.’ Today is the opposite … Today I feel that it was the best decision in my life [to join], and I want to be here.”Amorim has drawn scrutiny for his 3-4-3 formation and refusal to change it. The 40-year-old outlined why he trusts it. “When I started thinking about the system, nobody was playing 3-4-3, so I can understand how to rotate players,” he said.“Even in the way we buy players, if you have a clear idea how to play, it’s easy for you to [say]: ‘This is the guy that I want.’ And that can help you. When [today] is 4-3-3 and tomorrow is a 4-4-2, it’s harder to make the characteristics right for the players, so I try to use all this knowledge to search for the right players.”Amorim was asked whether he would like to sign a midfielder in January. “A lot of things can happen. We have the World Cup, some players who are not playing, they will ask to leave, so I have to manage everything,” he said. “And then we want to bring players that we can see have a big future in Manchester United.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The omens were not good forWrexhamgiven Frank Lampard’s side had scored 34 goals in 12 games before arriving in north Wales and the home side had won only one of their previous seven.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead moreBut Moore turned the contest on its head with two goals in the space of nine second-half minutes, the Wales striker capitalising on a couple of excellent Josh Windass assists. Moore then took his tally for the season to nine – from yet another Windass assist – seven minutes from time, his fine left-footed strike adding to his earlier right-foot finish and header.Coventry made the final moments interesting as Tatsuhiro Sakamoto pulled a goal back from 20 yards in the 88th minute, but Wrexham held on to move up to 11th in the table.Wrexham were seeking to end their Carabao Cup hangover after losing at home toWelsh rivals Cardiff on Tuesdayand Windass wasted the first opportunity after seven minutes. Coventry’s first chance was a wayward Liam Kitching header, while Matt Grimes curled a free-kick wide.Wrexham showed far greater intensity than they had done against League One Cardiff and fashioned promising moments. Carl Rushworth spilled a Matty James corner and Dominic Hyam hooked the ball over his shoulder for Kitching to clear in a crowded six-yard box. Rushworth redeemed himself after James sent Windass scampering into the channel to find Lewis O’Brien, the goalkeeper saving well with an outstretched foot.View image in fullscreenLewis O’Brien races to congratulate Kieffer Moore after his third goal for Wrexham.Photograph: Ben Roberts/Danehouse/Getty ImagesCoventry took advantage of that escape and struck moments later as Wrexham stood off Sakamoto and the Japanese winger delivered a searching pass for Mason-Clark to sweep home on the half-volley after staying onside.Luke Woolfenden’s looping header was tipped over by Arthur Okonkwo as Coventry scented more success. Wrexham responded, with Liberato Cacace unable to keep his volley down and O’Brien’s 25-yard attempt safely gathered by Rushworth.Max Cleworth shot just wide of the far post as Wrexham continued to press after the break, although the home side breathed a sigh of relief after Mason-Clark surged forward and Haji Wright was off target.Wrexham’s endeavour was rewarded on the hour when Issa Kaboré fed Windass down the right and the sliding Moore met his cross to beat Rushworth from close range. It got better for Wrexham nine minutes later as Windass again found the room to pick out a cross to the far post this time and Moore, peeling off his marker, headed home brilliantly. Moore completed his first hat-trick for more than seven years with another polished finish, after running on to a through ball down the left.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was an extensive process and involved the club talking to Thomas Frank before theysettled on Enzo Maresca.The feeling was that Maresca’s positional game and focus on possession made him most suited to Chelsea’s squad of technicians. Frank, who had performed brilliantly at Brentford, had to wait for his next opportunity. Overlooked by Manchester United after they fired Erik ten Hag, it arrived whenTottenham hired the Daneafter sacking Ange Postecoglou last summer.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead moreNow Frank and Maresca meet with both in big jobs. Theirs is not a rivalry yet but they had some close duels last season. Frank’s Brentford were unfortunate tolose 2-1 at Stamford Bridgelast December and had the better chances when theydrew 0-0 with Chelseain April.Those were two decent games, made more interesting because of the tactical differences between the coaches. Frank is more of a pragmatist, more willing to be direct, play on the break and wait for opportunities to unveil an array of clinical set-piece routines, whereas Maresca veers towards dogmatism. The Italian comes from the Pep Guardiola school; he prizes dominance of the ball.Chelsea’s average of 59.7% possession this season is bettered only by Liverpool in the Premier League. Frank mixes it up more. Spurs are not instinctively a defensive side – they are seventh in the possession rankings, ahead of Manchester United and Newcastle – but it is telling that their best performances have come in games where they have ceded the initiative. They were excellent with a back five in theSuper Cup against Paris Saint-Germain, implemented an outstanding counterpress when they won2-0 at Manchester Cityand destroyed Everton with set pieces last Sunday.Those experiences suggest Spurs should sit back when they hostChelsea. Tottenham, after all, have one win from their past seven home league games. The numbers are awful. Spurs’ record of 13 points from their past 18 home outings is the worst of any team to have been in the top flight throughout that period.This is a hard game to read. Spurs are five points off first place and unbeaten in the Champions League. Chelsea are world champions and reached the quarter-finals of the Carabao Cup this week. However, fans of both sides remain unconvinced by Frank and Maresca. Spurs supporters have grumbled about a lack of creativity when the onus is on their team to attack; Chelsea’s moan about their young side’s immaturity, indiscipline and toils against low blocks.The reality is that both managers are doing fine. Chelsea could slip to 12th if they lose to Spurs but there is context to their indifferent results. Injuries to Cole Palmer and Levi Colwill have taken a toll. A disrupted pre-season, caused by the club going all the way at the Club World Cup, cannot be overlooked.View image in fullscreenChelsea have won their past four league games against Tottenham, including 4-3 at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium last season.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianYet there is room for improvement, especially when it comes to keeping 11 players on the pitch. Liam Delap’s ludicrous dismissal during Wednesday’sCarabao Cup victory against Wolveswas Chelsea’s sixth red card in nine games, including Maresca’s banishment from the touchline during the win over Liverpool.Maresca was furious with Delap, who is banned for the trip to Spurs. But he is also pondering how to make his team more incisive against low blocks. The goals have dried up for João Pedro and more consistency is required from Chelsea’s young wide players.Frustration mounted during last weekend’s 2-1 home defeat by Sunderland. Chelsea had 68.4% possession, their highest of the campaign, but their xG was 0.97. Sunderland’s switch to a back five flummoxed Maresca. Régis Le Bris had done his homework. Statistics showing it is one win from the six league games when Chelsea’s possession has been at its highest this season suggests their core identity is being weaponised and turned on them.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThis is not a new issue. It was no wins from the four league games in which Chelsea had their most possession last season, highlighting a weakness when Maresca’s quest for control is taken to extremes. The danger is drifting into sterile domination, to borrow Arsène Wenger’s phrase. José Mourinho’s line about the team with the ball having the fear also comes to mind.Maresca disagrees but it is worth recalling that Chelsea had 33.5% possession when they produced their best performance under the Italian and thrashed PSG in the Club World Cup final. Variety is a strength. Chelsea have plenty of fast attackers and are pulsating when they have space to attack.Will Frank grant them freedom? Chelsea punished Postecoglou’s gung-ho tactics on their past two trips to theTottenham HotspurStadium. Frank will surely be smarter. Is a switch to a back five on the cards? Chelsea have conceded from three long throws this season. Spurs could have Kevin Danso chucking balls into the box. They will note that Chelsea have improved at offensive set pieces but are conceding too many chances.Being so direct does not necessarily fit with Spurs’ traditions. But with James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski missing there is a heavy creative burden on Mohammed Kudus. Xavi Simons, targeted by Chelsea last summer, has not done enough since joining from RB Leipzig. Spurs are predictable in open play. Their forwards remain inconsistent.But this is one game where the ends may justify the means. Spurs fans will not mind if a defensive approach ends a four-game losing run against Chelsea. Victory would ignite Frank’s reign. How he would love to win this duel with Maresca.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueChelseaTottenham HotspurfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now Wolves are at risk of drowning in the Premier League, bottom after taking two points from their opening nine games and without a win in six months. Supporters have made their anger plain but the Wolves head coach insists he is au fait with the pressure. “I remember in Porto after a draw it was impossible to go into a restaurant to eat with my family,” Pereira says. “This is football.”For Wolves supporters, this campaign has descended into one big, fat told-you-so. Wolves have been stuck in a negative cycle and after another slow start fans are worried this will be the season they fail to escape and spiral into the Championship. Pereira rescued them after arriving last Christmas but much of his credit has evaporated. With every game comes increased pressure. “I’m a fighter,” he says. “The pressure is what I put on myself. I don’t feel the pressure, believe me. The pressure is important to be alert … if you don’t feel anything, you’re too relaxed. If you don’t accept the criticism or pressure, you must go to another job.”Clash of styles awaits as Frank and Maresca face off in growing rivalryRead moreWolves have seen this film before. They waited until last December to dispense with Gary O’Neil and Julen Lopetegui left of his own volition on the eve of the previous season. Before him, Bruno Lage made it until the beginning of October. Nuno Espírito Santo left by mutual consent in May 2021 after four largely golden years and Fosun, Wolves’s Chinese owner, pines for stability. It will not get it if bad results continue, with Saturday’s trip to Fulham the next hurdle. The soul-destroying thing for supporters is they saw this coming. It has been signposted for a while.The decision to reward Pereira with a three-year contract in September amid a poor start looks peculiar now but had long been mooted. Wolves prioritised the summer transfer window and believed this season could be different. Matheus Cunha, Rayan Aït-Nouri and Nélson Semedo departed but they retained Jørgen Strand Larsen, rejecting a bid from Newcastle totalling £55m, which would have earned them handsome profit, and convinced him to sign a new contract. It feels like deja vu given O’Neil and his staff were given fresh contracts the previous summer.Wolves are haemorrhaging goals – only West Ham have conceded more in the top flight – and have been punished for slow starts and careless finishes. They surrendered leads against Brighton and Tottenham and after clawing back to 2-2 from two goals down at home to Burnley last Sunday they conceded a stoppage-time winner. They have given up seven points across three of their past four league games with goals conceded in the 86th minute or later. In the Carabao Cupagainst Chelsea on Wednesday, after dragging themselves back into the game from 3-0 down, they allowed 10-man opponents to re-establish a two-goal buffer.View image in fullscreenJørgen Strand Larsen holds his head in his hands after missing a chance. The forward has scored only one league goal this season.Photograph: Jacob King/PAStrand Larsen’s one league goal has come from a penalty against Burnley and only Nottingham Forest have scored fewer league goals. Bart Verbruggen, whose own goal gave Wolves the lead against Brighton last month, has as many league goals for Wolves as any Wolves player. This time last year O’Neil could point to a wretched run of fixtures. This season Wolves have been beaten by all three promoted teams.Pereira has struggled to land on his best team and flip-flopped with his selections, some more curious than others. João Gomes and André, the Brazil midfielders and probably Wolves’ most talented players, have been dropped. He has not named the same defence since an alarming defeat at Bournemouth in the second game. Since then Pereira has flitted between systems and personnel, switching from his favoured 3-4-3 to a four-man defence. Sam Johnstone has replaced José Sá as his first-choice goalkeeper. Toti Gomes, named club captain at the start of the season, has played one league minute since being withdrawn at home to Leeds. The same goes for Emmanuel Agbadou, a January signing integral to their upturn last season.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Strand Larsen became the latest, after Hugo Bueno, João Gomes, Matt Doherty and Sá. In a season where experienced performers such Kyle Walker, arguably the best player on the pitch at Molineux last weekend, Granit Xhaka and Jordan Henderson have driven impressive team performances, it feels a salient point. Those kinds of signings fly in the face of Wolves’ policy to generally recruit younger players with resale value.A lot of Wolves’ problems go back to recruitment. There have been several success stories but there is not much wriggle room. Jackson Tchatchoua, Ladislav Krejci, Jhon Arias, Fer López, David Møller Wolfe and Tolu Arokodare arrived without Premier League experience. Johnstone’s signing from Crystal Palace last August was the last time they did a deal with another Premier League club.Wolves want to give Pereira time to turn things around. Despite results, it is hard to argue the players are not playing for the Portuguese, given the way they stirred against Burnley and salvaged some credit at home to Chelsea. Last season under O’Neil Wolves felt there were more problems permeating the squad, chiefly ill-discipline, disharmony and a lack of belief from players and staff. “It’s the first time in my career I am facing this kind of situation,” says Pereira, this his 14th club. “I am resilient. I have confidence in the work, in my players and that we have the conditions to tackle the situation.”The lights briefly went off as Pereira fielded questions about his future inside a room at Wolves’ Compton training base on Friday. Has he been pleasantly surprised by the internal support given the shelf life of managers in this era?“You know why?” he says. “Because they work every day with me and my staff. They know the way that we are working, fighting, trying to find solutions, to keep the spirit, to defend the club. And because we proved that last season in a few months that we can get results and play good football. This season has been more difficult. Today is what we must live by. Tomorrow: be focused to compete at our level and try to get the result. The future? I don’t know if I will be there or not.”Explore more on these topicsWolverhampton WanderersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The late kick-off may cause travel issues for Newcastle fans, with public transport limited on the holiday.The league cited the expansion of European competition in explaining its schedule. The last time Boxing Day was a Friday, in 2014, there was a full top-flight programme.APremier Leaguespokesperson said: “The Premier League would like to acknowledge the circumstances that have led to a reduced number of matches on Boxing Day this season – impacting an important tradition in English football. There are now several challenges to Premier League fixture scheduling rooted in the expansion of European club competitions, which led to a revision of our domestic calendar ahead of last season, including changes to the FA Cup. This ultimately left the Premier League as a 33-weekend competition – fewer than previous seasons, despite being a 380-match competition since 1995.“With fewer weekends to work with, the league is bound by how the calendar falls. The league can give an assurance that next season there will be more Premier League matches on Boxing Day as the date falls on a Saturday. As with previous years, and in keeping with our commitment to clubs, special arrangements have been made to allow more time between games played across the festive period. This will allow greater time for players to recover with the rest periods between rounds 18, 19 and 20 being increased to ensure that no club plays within 60 hours of another match.”There will be seven Premier League games on Saturday 27 December, starting with Nottingham Forest hosting Manchester City at 12.30pm. Five games kick off at 3pm and Aston Villa are at Chelsea for a 5.30pm kickoff.The last games of round 18 are the next day, with Sunderland v Leeds at 2pm before Crystal Palace host Tottenham at 4.30pm.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Then came the words I’d waited 12 months to hear’Read moreThe book, offering the fullest explanation of Earps’s decision to quit international football in May, is the first to reveal tensions inside the England women’s squad during an unprecedented three-year period of success including winningtwo European Championshipsandgetting to a World Cup final. Earps is also candid about her struggles with weight, binge-eating and alcohol.Earps played every game of the Euros in England in 2022 and the Women’s World Cup in Australia in 2023, when she was named goalkeeper of the tournament after saving a penalty in the final. She wasnamed 2023 BBC Sports Personality of the Year. Hampton was a member of the squad for those tournaments but was dropped for a period after the 2022 Euros.In an interview with the Guardian to accompany the serialisation, Earps says of Hampton: “I think we had different ideas of what being a teammate should be. I think there was a mismatch, a misalignment, of values.”Asked to elaborate on what the disruptive behaviour was, Earps said: “I don’t want to go into the specifics because it’s not my place … She is a very good goalkeeper and I’ve tried to draw a line under all that. I have messaged her privately to say: ‘Look, no bad blood.’”View image in fullscreenMary Earps (left) and Hannah Hampton during an England training session in July 2022.Photograph: Lynne Cameron/The FA/Getty ImagesThe Guardian revealed in October 2022that Hampton was dropped by Wiegman because of her behaviour and attitude at England camps. Wiegman would not be drawn on the reasons, saying after the Guardian story: “She has to do something personal that I would not like to comment on.”Hampton spoke later about the impact the story had on her and said she felt like quitting football. “It was harder to find that fight in me to prove people wrong, but somehow I managed it,”she told Elle in June. “I had all my friends and my family around me at the time to guide me in the right direction and keep me going. It’s worked out for the best – I’ve got a lot to thank them for.”Hampton returned to the squad in 2023. Earps writes that Wiegman consulted Earps about restoring Hampton. Earps says she told her it “doesn’t make me feel comfortable” but the England coach said “everyone deserves a second chance”.View image in fullscreenMary Earps is settled in Paris: ‘I’m going to play as long as I can, because I bloody love this game.’Photograph: Laura Stevens/The GuardianHampton went on to play some matches and in April 2024 Wiegman told Earps she planned toplay Hampton in a Euros qualifier. “I don’t get it,” Earps says she told Wiegman. “It’s a qualifier match. And bad behaviour is being rewarded.”In April 2025 Wiegman said Hampton was now her first-choice goalkeeper, leading to Earpsdramatically retiring from international footballshortly before this year’s Euros in Switzerland. The Lionessesretained the trophywith Hampton in a starring role.Earps’s autobiography, published next week, covers Earps describing being bullied as a young player, criticism of her weight by coaches, and lows during lockdown which led to “shovelling down biscuits instead of meals” and binge-drinking vodka. Earps says she never came close to trying to take her life but thought of how she might end it “more often than I would have liked”.She also talks about her partner Kitty, who lives with her in Paris while Earps plays for Paris Saint-Germain, and navigating difficulties with her parents, who struggled with Earps’s sexuality. She also reveals she has frozen her eggs in the hope of becoming a mother one day. “I’m 32 now, don’t look a day over 18! I’m going to play as long as I can, because I bloody love this game.”In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is1-800-273-8255.

And by “it” we mean any kind of success against the All Blacks. With that, of course, comes credibility on the world stage, a status they still enjoy.On Saturday night, UK and Ireland time, afternoon in the United States, Ireland take on New Zealand at Soldier Field in Chicago. Before any considerations of team news and vibes, the words Ireland, New Zealand and Soldier Field will transport many a rugby fan back not quite nine years. On 5 November 2016, Ireland, at the 29th time of asking, finally prevailed over the All Blacks, 111 years after their first shot at them.And how. No ugly scrap by a plucky underdog here, but an exhilarating 40 points and five tries under a Chicago sun.Having a ball-player is important but England also need a bit of beef, and that’s Freeman | Ugo MonyeRead moreEven more poignant than the result in front of delirious Irish expats was the way Ireland lined up when facing the haka. Anthony Foley, the beloved No 8 when Ireland and Munster first emerged from the amateur era to stake a claim to pre-eminence in the professional one, had died suddenly in his sleep three weeks earlier. As the All Blacks performed their pre-match ritual, Ireland stood in a figure of eight, quiet, emotional and resolute, in one of the more beautiful moments in sport. How could they not win after that?Ireland had already tasted success in Europe by that point, a grand slam and two Six Nations wins, not to mention the European titles won by Ulster, Munster and Leinster, but the All Blacks are the standard. If we include that win in 2016 (followed two weeks later by defeat to same in Dublin), the ledger since reads five wins apiece. Parity indeed. In the current world rankings, the All Blacks are second, 0.19 ranking points ahead of Ireland in third.Furthermore, that ledger read Ireland five, New Zealand three not so long ago. And then thequarter-final, in Paris, of the World Cuphappened, a fabulous weekend for rugby fans in general, the darkest of days if you were an Irish one. For all Ireland’s success of late, they have yet to plot a path past a quarter-final. New Zealand, of course,know that roadonly too well.Not that anyone really knows where the current teams stand. Both might be considered in transition, or about to enter such a phase. The latest Ireland debutant is likely to be Leinster prop Paddy McCarthy, who takes a place on the bench. Alongside him will sit last season’s new boy, Sam Prendergast, who makes way for the man who first attempted to replace Johnny Sexton at fly-half, Jack Crowley, the latter rewarded for his excellent form for Munster.View image in fullscreenCaelan Doris working on his fitness after months out but he will be on the bench against New Zealand.Photograph: Dan Sheridan/Inpho/ShutterstockCaelan Doris will also sit on that bench. Ireland’s captain last season makes his comeback from a shoulder injury sustained six months ago in Leinster’s Champions Cupsemi-final defeat to Northampton. Bundee Aki, shaking off an injury himself, is another big hitter on the bench. Dan Sheehan will captain the side.For New Zealand, Beauden Barrett returns from injury to play fly-half in one of four changes to the side that finished the Rugby Championship with victory over Australia. Josh Lord comes in at lock for the injured Patrick Tuipulotu.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Jones is back in town with the Japan team, attempting to mastermind a repeat of possibly the greatest upset of all time. No one should need reminding of the day Japan beat the Springboks under a Brighton sun, the year before Chicago 2016.The pair meet at Wembley on Saturday. The Springboks, top of the world rankings with thelatest Rugby Championship titlein their kit bag, are not going in lightly, packed with familiar names, but they do offer a debut to Zach Porthen, the 21-year-old tighthead. Jones makes two changes to the Japan side that lost narrowly to Australia in Tokyo last weekend.Meanwhile, in Edinburgh, Scotland prepare for their latest shot at beating New Zealand for the first time (32 attempts, 120 years) when they host the improving USA.

The most storied jockey of the past 40 years will effectively head into retirement after the main card at the Breeders’ Cup at Del Mar on Saturday, when he will have three chances to add a farewell Grade One winner to nearly 300 on his record already. Racing may not see a career quite like it again.Alongside Lester Piggott and perhaps John McCririck over the past half-century, “Frankie” registers with pretty much everyone, no surname required. People know who he is, even if they have no interest at all in what he does. In a world that has been fragmented by social media and the internet, Dettori may well be the last racing figure who will ever enjoy such instant name-recognition across a broad swathe of the British population.Breeders’ Cup 2025: all-conquering O’Brien arrives with sights on new recordRead moreDettori’s lifetime in the sport, after all, dates back to an era when A Question Of Sportregularly pulled in more than 10 million viewers, and a three-year stint as a team captain was more than enough to establish him as the bubbly, irrepressible face of racing. His last year on the show was 2004, which was also the year when he won the Flat jockeys’ title for the third and final time. As far as much of the British public is concerned, however, he has probably been the champion in most years since.It is, in many respects, a hard-won celebrity, a double-edged reward for events both on and off the track that have repeatedly pushed Dettori onto the front pages, ever sincethe unforgettable afternoon at Ascot in 1996when he defied odds of 25,000-1 to ride all seven winners on the card.In June 2000, he waspulled from the burning wreckage of a light aircraftby his fellow rider, Ray Cochrane, after a crash on takeoff in which the plane’s pilot was killed. When he finally ended his quest for a Derby winner in 2007, that too was headline news.View image in fullscreenFrankie Dettori kisses his mount, Mark of Esteem, after their triumph in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes, one of the winner’s in Dettori’s record-breaking afternoon at Ascot in September 1996.Photograph: Adam Butler/PAAnd if everyone loves a winner, they often love a flawed hero and a comeback even more. A six‑month ban after a failed drug test for cocaine would have been the end of most jockeys in their 40s, more than enough time for owners and trainers to find a younger alternative. For Dettori, though, suspension in December 2012 was a bridge to a renewed association with John Gosden in Newmarket, and a fresh succession of champions and Classic winners, including Enable, Golden Horn and Stradivarius.The public highs and lows have beenan essential part of Dettori’s story, up to and including the humiliating admission in March that he was filing for bankruptcy after a prolonged dispute with HMRC over unpaid taxes, a situation that Dettori tried, and failed, to keep private.View image in fullscreenFrankie Dettori aboard Stradivarius (right) winning the Gold Cup at Royal Ascot in 2018.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThere have been so many twists to the tale, in fact, that it can be easy to forget that without Dettori’s immense, generational talent, there would be no story at all. It was clear from his earliest days as a teenage apprentice that there was an instinctive rapport between horse and rider whenever Dettori was in the saddle.Horses ran for him, and improved for him. In 1990, he was the first teenager since Piggott to reach 100 winners in a season, and also announced his arrival at the highest level with a Group One double at Ascot, on the same card that he would charge through unbeaten just six years later.The famous flying dismount, copied from the legend of American racing Ángel Cordero Jr, was added to Dettori’s repertoire in 1994, and the buzz from riding a big-race winner has never left him. Nor has the gift of knowing, with something akin to clairvoyance, where to sit, when to strike and where the gaps will appear.But what now for the public face of British racing? It will not be easy to finally let go, whether or not Dettori fulfils his apparent desire to take “a few rides in South America, which is something I’ve always wanted to do”. It is not, after all, an ambition that he has mentioned until now.Butthe calamitous decisionto accept the tax advice that led to his dispute with HMRC means that Dettori will not draw down the curtain on his career with enough money in the bank to kick back and take things easy.View image in fullscreenFrankie Dettori, winner of the 2004 Ascot Gold Cup, does his trademark leap as he dismounts from Papineau.Photograph: Frank Baron/The GuardianHe has already been confirmed in a new role as a “global ambassador” with the football super-agent Kia Joorabchian’s burgeoning Amo Racing operation.Dettori told Matt Chapman on At The Raceson Friday this was the main reason for his departure now, as well as being able to finish at the Breeders’ Cup. “These opportunities don’t come along very often. I like the setup – this is a young team with big ambitions,” explained the jockey.Joorabchian, himself, was gushing in his praise for his new recruit at Del Mar on Thursday. “He’s an icon, he is a true legend of the sport,” Joorabchian said. “When you talk about great sportsmen like the LeBron Jameses, [Steph] Currys, Messis and Pelés and people like that, Frankie is that to horse racing. When you go into Royal Ascot, you see a statue there, you know that he’s made a big impact on so many lives across the world.“He’s not here to entertain people, he’s here to actually work and he will be working with us very closely. He will be involved in all aspects of our business [but] he won’t be a racing manager. He is a global ambassador.”Reality TV is another possibility, although earlier outings on Celebrity Big Brother and I’m A Celebrity … have tended to reveal a moodier side to Dettori’s character, behind the ebullient public persona. On both shows, he was an early casualty of the public vote.It may be that Dettori himself does not really know what he will do and how he will fill his time once his race-riding days are over. And for another 24 hours at least, he remains a top-level professional jockey, focused on three rides at one of the most prestigious and glamorous events in the calendar.A five-year-old filly called Argine will be Dettori’s final Grade One mount in the Breeders’ Cup Mile, the same race in which he registered his first Breeders’ Cup success in 1994. Her form at home in Japan suggests that she has something to find to figure, but few riders in history have ever risen to an occasion like Lanfranco Dettori.For one final time, cue Frankie?Elliott can make it pay with Found A FiftyThe top-level season over jumps in Britain and Ireland opens with the Grade One Betvictor Champion Chase at Down Royal on Saturday and Gordon Elliott’sFound A Fifty(2.40) is a fair price at around 11-2 to take this first step up to three miles in his stride.The eight-year-old is Jack Kennedy’s pick from three runners from the yard, has won six of his 11 starts over fences and looked to have every chance of staying beyond two-and-a-half miles when successful in a Grade Two at Fairyhouse in April.Wetherby 1.15Lightning Flashmade a solid start over fences in a handicap at Chepstow last month and posted a useful time too, so a 5lb rise is the weights looks more than fair.Ascot1.30Chasing was always likely to be whenNo Questions Askedshowed his full potential and Ben Pauling’s gelding has been found a good opportunity to make a winning start over fences.Wetherby1.50Though she was a fortunate winner of the Champion Hurdle in March,Golden Aceran to a similar level at Punchestown a few weeks later and a repeat of that form should be enough here.Ascot2.05The front-runningSans Bruitended last season in outstanding form and his impeccable jumping could make him very difficult to peg back.Wetherby 2.22A seven-length defeat under 12st and a considerate ride was a commendable performance byTake No Chanceson her return to action at Chepstow last month to action and the step back up in trip as she returns to Graded company should suit.Wetherby 2.57Djelo’sform tailed off a little in Grade One events at Cheltenham and Aintree in the spring but he enjoyed a generally progressive novice campaign and has run well fresh in the past.Ascot 3.10Harry Derham’sWashingtonis approaching the veteran stage but remains lightly raced for a nine-year-old and showed that he is still capable of winning off a mark in the low 130s when successful off 128 at Chepstow last time.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Saturday racing tipsShowNewmarket12.32 Dancing Flower 1.07 Sacred Ground 1.42 Dunkeld Dreamer 2.17 Grizedale 2.50 Expert Agent 3.25 Gethin 4.00 Silver TrumpetWetherby12.40 Wilstar 1.15 Lightning Flash 1.50 Golden Ace 2.22 Take No Chances 2.57 Djelo (nb) 3.30 Pure Gold 4.05 Red DeltaAyr12.48 Moon Phases 1.23 Everyday Champagne 1.58 Whistle Stop Tour 2.29 Too Cool Forshrule 3.04 Thereisnodoubt 3.40 Ruby Island 4.15 HelsgetawayAscot12.55 At The Oche 1.30 No Questions Asked 2.05 Sans Bruit 2.35 Soomaroy 3.10 Washington 3.45 Le Coq Hardi (nap) 4.20 BatharaNewcastle3.35 Educate 4.10 The English Rogue 4.45 Popty Ping 5.15 Kirkdale 5.45 Cressida Wildes 6.15 Why Because 6.45 Quercus 7.15 YaahobbyWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Wetherby 3.30Having progressed by the run since a win at Uttoxeter in the summer,Pure Goldimproved again to win at Hexham in early October and she could notch a fourth win in five runs here.Ascot 3.45Henry de Bromhead shows a healthy level-stakes profit on the select group of handicap chasers he sends to Britain in the early months of the season and the 6-1 shotLe Coq Hardicould further improve his record.Graffard aims for treble with GoliathLashkari, trained by Alain de Royer-Dupré and with the great Yves Saint-Martin in the saddle, took the first running of the Breeders’ Cup Turf in 1984 and French-trained runners were regularly the star names in the European challenge in the early years of the meeting. Miesque and Goldikova picked up five miles between them. Six Perfections, Domedriver, In The Wings and Miss Alleged also returned home as Breeders’ Cup winners and who could forget André Fabre’s 133-1 shock with Arcangues in the 1993 Classic?Since there were only two turf races to aim at until 2007, it was a hugely impressive record, which makes France’s miserable strike rate in recent seasons all the more perplexing. Fabre’s Talismanic, in the 2017 Turf, was the last French-trained winner at the meeting.In 2025, however, there is a new French champion trainer in town. Francis-Henri Graffard has won 149 races in France this year, and tops the prize-money table with more than €12.5m (£11m). In second place is Fabre, the champion 30 times in the past, with 99 winners and less than half of Graffard’s prize-money earnings.In the last month alone, Graffard haswon the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe with Daryz, the Champion Stakes at Ascot with Calandagan, who also took the King George at the same track back in July. On Saturday he will attempt to complete a unique treble whenGoliath(21.41) goes to post for a compelling renewal of the Breeders’ Cup Turf.View image in fullscreenFrancis-Henri Graffard celebrates Calandagan’s Champions Stakes triumph.Photograph: Steven Paston/PAA win for Goliath, who has been supplemented for the race at a cost of $200,000, would give Graffard a complete set of wins in the world’s three most prestigious mile-and-a-half races on turf in 2025, with three different horses.The most obvious rivals standing in Goliath’s way are Minnie Hauk, the Oaks winner and Arc runner-up, and the evergreen gelding Rebel’s Romance, who is also racing for a slice of history as only the third horse – after Beholder and Goldikova – to win at three Breeders’ Cups.Minnie Hauk is a sure-fire favourite after a near perfect season but it is a campaign that started back at Chester in early May and there has to be a concern that this could be a race too far after a hard-fought duel with Daryz in Paris four weeks ago.Rebel’s Romance is all but certain to run his race and will join the all-time global top-10 money earners with a third Turf success. This looks like the strongest field he has faced at the meeting, however, and Goliath has only 1lb to find with Charlie Appleby’s runner on Timeform’sratings.The standout performance on Goliath’s record remains the 2024 King George at Ascot, which was run at an end-to-end gallop. With Silawi, the frontrunning Canadian International winner, also in Saturday’s field, the Turf could be set up for a return to Goliath’s best form, and at around 8-1 he appeals as one of the strongest bets on Saturday’s card.Del Mar 19.00:A wide open running of the Filly & Mare Sprint, butHope Road’sGrade One-winning form at Saratoga in August could prove to be the strongest on offer.Del Mar 19.41:US-trained sprinters have taken three of the last four runnings of what is an unusual test for European runners.Ag Bullet,the Jaipur winner at Saratoga in June, could make it four from five.Del Mar 20.21:Straight No Chaser beatBentornatoby half a length in last year’s Sprint, but Jose D’Angelo’s colt comes here relatively fresh after a single run in 2025 and posted an impressive trial at Churchill Downs in September.Del Mar 21.01:Dorth Vaderwas closing at the line when touched off by the now retired Thorpedo Anna, last year’s Distaff winner, in the Personal Ensign at Saratoga in June and looks big at around 5-1.Del Mar 22.25:The Classic lost its favourite earlier in the week when Sovereignty, the Kentucky Derby winner, was ruled out, leaving Japan’sForever Youngas the top-rated runner in the race.

Whether your priority is battery life, camera, screen size, software support or value for money, there is more to choose from than ever. And if you’re thinking of buying Apple instead, we havea guide for iPhones, too.At a glanceBest Android for most people:GooglePixel 10128GB, £799 at ArgosBest Android for camera:Google Pixel 10 Pro128GB, £999 at John LewisBest Android for battery life and big screen:Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra256GB, £1,249 at SamsungBest smallAndroid:Samsung Galaxy S25256GB, £709 at ArgosBest value Android:Google Pixel 9a128GB, £449 at John LewisReplace or spruce up?New models typically have faster chips and better cameras, but the differences between generations are shrinking with each year. That means the best Android phone for you could still be the one in your hand.If your battery doesn’t last as long as it used to, replacements are often available from the manufacturer or third parties, and start at about £50, depending on the make and model. If your Android is slow or apps won’t install, check you have enough free storage – ideally at least 2GB. Space can be freed up by uninstalling unused apps or content, clearing out your messaging storage, offloading photos and videos to the cloud, and deleting music and podcasts you no longer listen to.For more, read our guide onhow to make your smartphone last longerWhen to replace your AndroidIf your phone’s worn out, broken beyond repair or no longer receives crucial security updates, it’s time to upgrade. Most older Androids received only three years of software support from release date – not from purchase – with newer, better models getting five to seven years. Replacing a phone that has stopped receiving security updates is essential because it will be more vulnerable to hackers and cybercriminals.The best Android phones in 2025View image in fullscreen‘Offers almost everything that Google’s top-tier phones do’: the Google Pixel 10.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianBest Android for most people:Google Pixel 10View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian128GB, £799 at Argos128GB, £799 at AmazonThe Pixel 10 has set a new bar for what you should expect from a flagship phone. It’s the best choice for most people with its balance of cost, size and features.It looks and feels great, with satin aluminium sides and Google’s standout camera bar protruding from the glass back. The 6.3in OLED screen is crisp and bright, and its 120Hz refresh rate keeps scrolling smooth.A rapid ultrasonic under-screen fingerprint scanner and 2D face recognition make it easy to unlock the Pixel 10. It feels very responsive, coming with the same Tensor G5 chip as Google’s most expensive phones, along with 12GB of RAM and at least 128GB of storage. The battery will last up to two days of general use between charges, too.The Pixel 10 is one of the first Android phones to build inQi2support into the back. As well as fast and easy wireless charging, this opens up compatibility with magnetic accessories, including those made for Apple’s MagSafe iPhones, such as wallets, phone grips, stands and car mounts.The phone runs some of the best Android software you can get and is guaranteed monthly security and feature updatesuntil at least August 2032. This year, Google introduced a collection of useful new advanced AI tools, too, most of which run locally for speed and privacy.Highlights include various Gemini, writing, translation, dictation and image-editing tools. The most advanced is Magic Cue, which runs in the background pulling data from your calendar, Gmail, maps, notes, screenshots, contacts and messages to suggest information when you need it. If a friend texts to ask when your flight is due to land, Magic Cue will show the time and date directly on the messages screen to quickly paste into your conversation. Or when you phone a business to check where your delivery is, the system will present a card in the phone app, pulling the order details straight from Gmail.Finally, Google has also righted one of the few wrongs of2024’s Pixel 9by giving the Pixel 10 three cameras on the back, including a new 5x telephoto camera. That makes it one of the best camera systems available, including some great features such as Auto Best Take and Add Me for group photos, plus the new AI Camera Coach, which can guide you to taking a better photo.Why should you buy it?The Pixel 10 offers almost everything that Google’s top-tier phones do, but at a lower price. It has a great triple rear camera (with 5x optical zoom), cracking software, cutting-edge AI tools and a high-quality screen, all packed into a manageable size.Buy if:you want a premium, Google AI-packed phone with a good camera for slightly lessDon’t buy if:you want a massive screen or the very best camera on an AndroidRead our fullGoogle Pixel 10 review: the new benchmark for a standard flagship phoneScreen:6.3in 120Hz FHD+ OLED (422ppi)Processor:Google Tensor G5RAM:12GBStorage:128 or 256GBTested battery life (with overnight standby):48 hoursCamera:48MP, 13MP UW, 10.8MP 5x, 10.5MP selfieDust and water resistance:IP68 (1.5m for 30 minutes)Dimensions:152.8 x 72 x 8.6mmWeight:204gBest Android for camera:Google Pixel 10 ProView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian128GB, £999 at John Lewis128GB, £999 at ArgosThe Pixel 10 Pro takes everything that is good about theregular Pixel 10and turns it up a notch. Its 6.3in OLED is slightly brighter, slicker and crisper, making it one of the very best on a phone. The polished aluminium sides look and feel expensive, while the rapid fingerprint and face scanners feel responsive.And Qi2 support opens up compatibility with a large collection of magnetic chargers and accessories.It has the Tensor G5 chip, 16GB of RAM and at least 128GB of storage, plus up to two days of battery life. The 10 Pro also comes with a year’s subscription toGoogle AI Pro– usually costing £18.99 a month – which provides access to the more powerful Gemini Pro, image- and video-generating models, and 2TB of cloud storage.It comes with the same Android software and AI tools as the regular Pixel 10, with supportuntil August 2032.The biggest upgrade is in the camera, adding more powerful sensors including a 50MP main, 48MP ultra-wide and 48MP 5x telephoto camera, the latter of which can stretch to 10x with a crop zoom. This trio can make the most out of practically any lighting condition or environment.But the 10 Pro is also the first to include generative AI directly in the camera. Zoom to a maximum of 100x magnification, and a local genAI model will process the image, adding back the detail and sharpness lost by digital zoom. It’s not perfect, but the results can be very impressive.Why should you buy it?The Pixel 10 Pro has the best camera on an Android phone, plus top software, cutting-edge AI tools and a high-quality screen that’s large but not enormous (if a huge screen is what you want, look toGoogle’s Pixel 10 Pro XLinstead).Buy if:you want the best camera on a phone that’s still relatively pocketableDon’t buy if:you want a massive screen or super-long battery lifeRead our fullGoogle Pixel 10 Pro review: one of the very best smaller phonesScreen:6.3in 120Hz QHD+ OLED (495ppi)Processor:Google Tensor G5RAM:16GBStorage:128, 256 or 512GBTested battery life (with overnight standby):48 hoursCamera:50MP, 48MP UW, 48MP 5x telephoto, 42MP selfieDust and water resistance:IP68 (1.5m for 30 minutes)Dimensions:152.8 x 72 x 8.6mmWeight:207gBest Android forbattery life and a big screen:Samsung Galaxy S25 UltraView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian256GB, £1,249 at Samsung256GB, £1,249 at Carphone WarehouseIf money is no object and you want the biggest and best screen on an Android coupled with superb battery life, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra lives up to its name.The huge 6.9in screen is the brightest and best around, wrapped in a titanium frame with tiny bezels. Four cameras on the back rival the Pixel 10 Pro for the best, including 3x and 5x telephoto cameras. Inside, it has the fastest Android chip available, 12GB of RAM and at least 256GB of storage, while its two-day-plus battery life helps it go the distance.The S25 Ultra has great software with support until 2032, so you can keepusing it for longer with proper care. The phone is packed with loads of the most advanced AI tools – which are still a bit hit and miss – plus a stylus for handwriting and doodling on the screen.Despite being thin and not too heavy, the S25 Ultra is super-sized, which means it requires two hands to use most of the time and might be a struggle to fit in pockets. It also launched at an eye-watering price, which has come down a little but still tops most competitors. Look outfor deals on the refurbished market.Why should you buy it?The S25 Ultra is the reigning superphone champ with the best screen, the fastest chip, very long battery life and more cameras on its back than any other, plus plenty of AI features and even an integrated stylus.Buy if:you want the superphone with the best screen, long battery life and all the extrasDon’t buy if:you don’t want a huge phone at a high costReadour fullSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra review: still the superphone to beatScreen:6.9in 120Hz QHD+ OLED (500ppi)Processor:Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for GalaxyRAM:12GBStorage:256, 512GB or 1TBTested battery life (with overnight standby):58 hoursCamera:200MP, 50MP 0.6x, 10MP 3x, 50MP 5x, 12MP selfieDust and water resistance:IP68 (1.5m for 30 minutes)Dimensions:162.8 x 77.6 x 8.2mmWeight:218gBest smallAndroid:Samsung Galaxy S25View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian256GB, £709 at Argos128GB, £799 at SamsungA truly small flagship Android doesn’t exist, but Samsung’s regular Galaxy S25 is the most manageable you can get.It has a great and relatively small 6.2in screen, slim bezels and flat aluminium sides, and it weighs only 162g, making it feel nice and compact. Despite being much cheaper, the regular S25 has the same super-quick chip as its much larger S25 Ultra sibling, plus plenty of RAM and at least 128GB of storage. A decent triple camera, including a 3x telephoto zoom, is on the back.The S25 also runs the same Android version as the rest of Samsung’s top phones, including loads of AI tools and support until 2032, so you’re not missing out just because it’s smaller.The only downside of the more compact size is a smaller battery. It will still last a solid day, but not much more. You can also find better cameras on slightly larger rivals.Why should you buy it?The S25 is the last great Android flagship at this size, and it doesn’t skimp on features despite its compact and lightweight frame.Buy if:you want a smaller flagship phoneDon’t buy if:you need very long battery life or a big screenReadour fullSamsung Galaxy S25 review: the smallest top-tier Android leftScreen:6.2in 120Hz FHD+ OLED (416ppi)Processor:Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for GalaxyRAM:12GBStorage:128, 256 or 512GBTested battery life (with overnight standby):37 hoursCamera:50MP, 12MP 0.6x, 10MP 3x, 12MP selfieDust and water resistance:IP68 (1.5m for 30 minutes)Dimensions:146.9 x 70.5 x 7.2mmWeight:162gBest value Android:Google Pixel 9aView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian128GB, £449 at John Lewis128GB, £449 at ArgosGoogle’s latest A-series Pixel is the best yet, squeezing almost everything great about the Android-maker’s high-end phones into a relatively affordable handset.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

It’s sleek, but looks a bit generic compared with Google’s previous standout camera designs. It still looks and feels good and has full IP68 water resistance, plus an optical fingerprint scanner and face unlock.The 9a has the same Tensor G4 chip aslast year’s top Google phones, keeping it snappy in operation, while the battery lasts a good two days between charges. It only has 8GB of RAM, which isn’t particularly noticeable in day-to-day use but does curb some of Google’s more advanced AI tools. The 9a still has great software, including Gemini, which will be supported for afull seven years from release– almost unheard of at this price.The best part is the camera. While it only has a main camera and an ultrawide one on the back, it shoots better photos than many phones twice the price. In fact, it’s only a smidgen behind the regular Pixels in low light. The 9a even has Google’s popular Best Take and Add Me AI features, plus full access to Magic Editor and other tools.A few corners have been cut, though, including the plastic back rather than glass, an older generation of scratch-resistant glass on the screen, and the lack of support for Android’s built-in spatial audio system for headphones.Why should you buy it?The Pixel 9a offers a top-tier experience at a much cheaper, mid-range price, making it the best value flagship Android by a mile.Buy if:you want an excellent Android with flagship experience and a great camera for lessDon’t buy if:you want a telephoto cameraReadour fullPixel 9a review: Google’s cut-price Android winnerScreen:6.3in 120Hz FHD+ OLED (422ppi)Processor:Google Tensor G4RAM:8GBStorage:128 or 256GBTested battery life (with overnight standby):57 hoursCamera:48MP, 13MP ultrawide, 13MP selfieDust and water resistance:IP68 (1.5m for 30 minutes)Dimensions:154.7 x 73.3 x 8.9mmWeight:186gThe best of the restView image in fullscreenSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 7View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian256GB, £1,599 at AO256GB, £1,799 at SamsungBest for:a book-style foldable phone:Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 7 is a remarkable device. It fits a large 8in screen inside an incredibly thin body, which folds like a book to transform it from a tablet to a phone.It weighs just 215g and is only 8.9mm thick when folded, with a large, slick and bright 6.5in screen on the outside. It looks and feels just like a regular slab phone. But open it up and you’ll reveal a huge, high-quality internal screen in a body that’s just 4.2mm thick – barely thicker than the USB-C port and slimmer than even the new breed of ultra-thin phones such as the S25 Edge.It’s ready for films, books, browsing and serious multitasking with up to eight apps open on screen at once. The Fold 7 has Qualcomm’s top Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, 12GB of RAM and at least 256GB of storage, helping it fly along regardless of what you’re doing. A battery life of almost two days rivals big slab phones, while five cameras, including a trio of quality cameras on the back (with a 200MP main and 3x telephoto cameras), do a good job of capturing life.The foldable phone has a rapid fingerprint scanner in the power button and runs the same quality Android asSamsung’s top S25 phones, including the Now bar, Gemini and other AI tools. In addition, it offers multiple modes that really take advantage of the folding form in ways that rivals don’t, and software support will last until 31 July 2032.But while the Fold 7 is water resistant, it’s not dust resistant. Like all foldables, the internal screen is softer than regular hardened glass, so it must be treated with care.

New in this generation is a bigger outside screen that fills the front of the phone when closed, which can be used for accessing a selection of apps, widgets and Gemini without opening the handset.The Flip is particularly attractive in blue with a good wallpaper on the outside screen, and it’s been slimmed down to only 6.5mm thick when open. The phone feels responsive with solid performance and a great fingerprint scanner in the power button on the side. But battery life is a little on the short side, lasting a day or so, meaning it can’t keep up with larger slab phones for staying power.The dual rear cameras are solid, but the lack of a telephoto camera means you’re limited to wide and ultra-wide shots. The Flip’s party piece is the ability to shoot selfies using the main cameras, with the outside screen acting as a viewfinder.It runs some of the best Android software available with lots of AI tools, including Google’s Gemini, Circle to Search and the Now bar for keeping up with ongoing activities, such as sports, music playback or timers. With software support until 31 July 2032, the Flip 7 is the all-round best flip phone on the market.This is a relatively iterative update, though, solast year’s Flip 6is worth looking at if you can find a good deal. As with other folding devices, the Flip 7 is water- but not dust-resistant, and its internal screen is softer and more fragile than a regular phone, so accidental damage insurance will be prudent.Why should you buy it?The Galaxy Z Flip 7 is a great-looking clamshell that squeezes a huge screen into your pocket.

This means the more recently the phone was launched, the better the buy.From smash-proof cases to updates: how to make your smartphone last longerRead moreBroadly, there are two types of refurbished Android: those that manufacturers, includingSamsung, refurb and sell almost as new, and those refurbished by third parties that come in various grades or conditions (see our guide below).Do not buy:any model older than 24-36 months old, because you’ll get only a few years of software support before you’ll have to replace it. Older Android phones get less than five years of support from when they were first released, not from when you bought them.any phone without access to the Google Play Store and Google’s services, which are needed for most mainstream apps in the UK.Quick GuideA buyer’s guide to refurbished phonesShowSeveral third-party retailers offer refurbished phones, including the UK high street chainsCeXandGameand online stores such asmusicMagpieandEnvirofone. Marketplaces likeAmazonandeBayand refurb specialistBack Marketalso have a wide range. And some phone operators, includingO2,giffgaff,EEandVodafone, sell refurbished iPhones.The condition of the phone is among the most important things to consider before parting with any cash. This is graded as follows:Grade A– virtually identical to a new phone on the outside, usually with the original box and accessories. These are often customer returns rather than trade-ins and are the most expensive.Grade B– in full working order but typically with light scratches, dents or nicks, and may come with original accessories.Grade C– in full working order but visibly worn and typically sold without original accessories.Grade D– also known as “for spares and repairs” or similar. These are broken devices sold for people to fix or gut for parts.Once you’re satisfied with the condition of the phone, be sure to also size up the device’s:Battery health– batteries wear out, typically only maintaining up to 80% of their original capacity after 500 full-charge cycles (about two to three years of nightly charging). Has it been replaced?Charging port– check for signs of damage, as these are among the first parts to break.Buttons– do they all work without pressing too hard? Broken buttons make phones difficult to use and can be expensive to fix.Fingerprint scanner– is the fingerprint reader functioning as it should? Scratches or repairs can cause them to be faulty.Network locks– check the phone works with the provider of your choice, as some are originally sold locked to certain networks and must be unlocked before being used on another.Unauthorised parts– not all repairs are done by the manufacturer or using certified parts, which can affect performance.Check it isn’t stolen– check the phone’s 15-digit IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number against adatabase of stolen devicesthrough a service such asCheckMENDor similar.Warranty– what kind of warranty does the retailer offer on its refurbished phones?Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.How we selectedFlagship phones come at a premium, so you should expect the very best technology and performance throughout years of use. When I chose which phones to test, I considered:Performance– a top-tier chip and snappy performance are essential to keep a phone fast throughout its useful life.Software– should be up to date and come with a minimum of five years of Android updates from release, ideally longer.Great displays– you should expect high-quality displays with high brightness for outdoor use, high pixel density to keep things crisp and high refresh rates to keep scrolling smooth.Cameras– are the main battleground for the flagship phone manufacturers, so expect the best with multiple lenses and plenty of features.Battery life– should stand up to hard use, at least lasting when used all day.Build quality– top-tier phones aren’t cheap, so they should be made to last with high-quality, ideally recycled materials, scratch-resistant glass and proper water resistance.Sustainability– accidents happen, and even the longest-lasting batteries do wear out, so phones should be repairable with real options for replacement batteries, screens and other parts.Quick GuideHow I testedShowWe combine real-world testing with various tools, such as benchmarking systems that perform standardised tasks. These help us  evaluate a phone,  measure its performance, confirm that it works as expected and compare it with its competition and predecessors.We use the phones at different times and in various environments, from firing off emails on packed commuter trains to weekends spent shooting photos in national parks, and everything in between. We do everything a typical smartphone user would, such as messaging, browsing, using apps, listening to music, watching videos, playing games and navigating the real world. That gives us a good impression of how a smartphone handles the rigours of day-to-day life – plus, it shows us how long the battery lasts and the strength of its wireless performance.The findings from our general use of the phones are combined with the results from specific tests for things such as the camera zoom, video playback and charging, to inform the reviews and help us rank the devices.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Why you should trust meI’ve been reviewing consumer electronics for 18 years, with more than a decade spent as the Guardian’s gadget expert.

And one day, my audiologist delivered the verdict: after years in war zones standing too close to things that went boom, I had moderate high-frequency hearing loss. I needed hearing aids. The option she showed me cost $7,000.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The sticker shock hit harder than the diagnosis. In the US, insurance typically won’t cover hearing aids, which meant I was on the hook for the full cost, out-of-pocket. I found a compromise at Costco: theJabra Enhance Pro 20sfor $1,600. I spent the next month acclimating to their digital processing until it finally sounded normal.Today, there’s another option:Apple’s AirPods Pro 3. At $249, they promise to help the28.8 million Americanswho need hearing assistance but for reasons of cost, stigma or just plain stubbornness, are not using any. The FDA first approved their predecessor, the AirPods Pro 2, for use as over-the-counter hearing aids in September 2024, but the newer version are supposed to boast even better fidelity. When a friend gave me a pair for my birthday, I had the perfect opportunity to see how they perform in real life.Apple’s AirPods Pro 3View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of Amazon$249 at Amazon$249 at WalmartThe tool we refuse to useNearly 50 million Americanshave some form of hearing loss, but only 16% of adults ages 20 to 69 who could benefit have ever used hearing aids. The consequences cascade: adults with hearing loss face 58% higher odds of unemployment and earn 25% less when employed. Untreated hearing loss is the single largest modifiable risk factor fordementia, according to the 2020 Lancet Commission.The average American waits seven to 10 years after noticing symptoms before seeking help. Cost is the primary barrier, with traditional hearing aids running between $2,000 and $7,000. The other barrier is stigma; nobody wants to look old.Measuring your hearing lossView image in fullscreenPhotograph: clubfoto/Getty ImagesBefore you can use AirPods as hearing aids, you can either complete a 10-minute self-test to identify where you have hearing loss, or upload the results of a professional audiogram performed by an audiologist. Since I just completed one of those 18 months ago, I compared the lab results to what Apple could accomplish.My clinical test showed classic noise-induced damage: mild to moderately-severe sensorineural hearing loss, worst in the high frequencies where consonants live. The iPhone test, conducted in my quiet home office, nailed the pattern but softened the severity. It measured my loss at 33-34 dBHL (decibels Hearing Level) average, versus my audiologist’s 35-45 dBHL.AirPods Pro 3 review: better battery, better noise cancelling, better earbudsRead more“The AirPods are not going to be as good as going into a booth and having calibrated equipment, but I have to admit – it’s pretty darn good,” said Dr David Zapala, PhD, president of the American Academy of Audiology. “Much better than earlier iterations and other devices … Normal audiograms have plus or minus 5 dB, so a 10 dB decibel difference is within the range of test variation.”Switching between my professional audiogram and Apple’s self-generated profile for a full day revealed some differences. The iPhone settings made sibilants slightly muddier: sibilant “s” sounds lost their edge and hard consonants like “k” and “d” sounded a bit percussive. But conversations remained clear. My partner didn’t seem to notice whether I was hearing her any differently regardless of which devices I used.Can AirPods really compete with hearing aids?View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Christopher Allbritton/The GuardianSound quality:The Jabras aim for “acoustic transparency”, meaning the hear-through sound is nearly identical to listening with the open ear. And they more or less deliver after the adjustment period. They handle restaurants moderately well, isolating conversation from the background clanks and clatters.The AirPods create what I’d call “amplified reality”. They sound crisp and clear, but with a digital sheen that never quite disappeared.Battery life:This was no contest: my Jabras run 24 to 30 hours per charge, the AirPods hit maybe 10 hours max. That’s not necessarily a dealbreaker, as you can pop them into the charging case and get about three more hours from a 15-minute charge up, but it’s a major caveat to keep in mind if you don’t have convenient charging opportunities within your schedule.The occlusion effect:This is that annoying muffled sound that happens when you have a blocked, or “occluded” ear canal, and it can make your voice sound really weird as it resonates in your skull. Both devices try to address this, but they handle it differently.The Jabras don’t fully close your ears and allow outside sound to blend in with the amplified sound, so voices and other noises sound more natural. The AirPods, though, seal your ear canal, so any outside sound – including your own voice – has to be processed digitally. It sometimes makes your own voice sound unnaturally loud.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Christopher Allbritton/The GuardianSocial perception:The Jabras are nearly invisible. Just a tiny clear wire snakes down into my ear from the bodies hanging behind my ears.

People generally assume I’m listening to music, and there have been times where people seemed reluctant to speak to me, thinking I wasn’t listening to them, or on a call. But once I explained that I’m using them as hearing aids, the conversation proceeded normally. (They usually expressed some surprise that AirPods can do that.)Real-world failuresIn a crowd:At a dinner party or at a bar, the Jabras can manage overlapping conversations. The AirPods struggle, however, sometimes amplifying the wrong voice or creating confusing audio soup when multiple people speak.Music:Naturally, the AirPods demolish the Jabras. In addition to amplifying voices and conversation, the AirPods will use the same audiogram to improve media streaming. Listening to Miles Davis’s Kind of Blue, every instrument sparkled. The Jabras rendered music but sounded like a tiny AM radio in my ears. No thanks. But then, they are not really designed for high-fidelity music.CostMy $1,600 Jabras included three years of unlimited adjustments, cleanings, and support. The AirPods ($249) offer no professional support. If you can’t fine-tune the amplification for your specific hearing loss pattern, there is no expert to help, just Apple’s algorithms and trial-and-error.‘Two pairs aren’t enough’: the things our Filter experts swear by when they’re off dutyRead moreWho should buy whatView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Christopher Allbritton/The GuardianConsider AirPods Pro if you:Have mild to moderate hearing lossNeed situational rather than all-day assistanceAlready use an iPhone or AirPods regularlyWant to test whether hearing aids help before making a bigger investmentStick with traditional hearing aids if you:Have moderate to severe lossNeed all-day batteryCan afford the higher costWant professional supportIf you’re on the fence, try themThe AirPods Pro 3 are not perfect hearing aids, but for $249, they’re an excellent first stop for the 28 million Americans with untreated hearing loss. They’re affordable, accessible, and their ubiquity is helping to dissolve stigma.I still mostly wear my Jabras, which are purpose-built tools built for a single job. But I keep AirPods in my pocket for music, calls, and those times I just don’t feel like dealing with something stuck deep inside my ear canal. Sometimes, 80% of the performance for 15% of the cost is fine.If you suspect you might benefit from them, give them a try. They may just unlock that distant conversation with your grandchild or punchline you missed at dinner.“When I encourage people to use them, I’m pretty much telling them, look, try the simple thing first,” says Zapala. “Try the AirPods. You’re not risking a lot of money and not risking a lot of time. If it doesn’t work, you’re still going to like listening to music through them.”Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThe Filter USGadgetsAppleHeadphonesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In a San Francisco Bart train tunnel, Don Veca took his recorder and captured a train’s metallic roar – “like demons in agony, beautifully ugly,” he remembers. That recording became one of the most chilling sounds in 2008’sDead Space.“We dropped that screeching, industrial noise at full volume right after the vacuum silence – creating one of the game’s most jarring sonic contrasts,” Veca, who made horror history as the audio director for the Dead Space games, recalls. “Our game designer hated it – but the boss loved it. Over time, it’s become iconic.”Now, almost two decades after Dead Space first terrified players into clutching their controllers, horror game designers around the world still chase that same feeling. So, how do they keep on finding new ways to scare gamers – and what makes us keep pushing start on the horror?The sound of fearAsk anyone who’s worked on a great horror game, and they’ll probably tell you the same thing: true fear starts with what you hear.Veca says it begins in the mind. “It starts with psychology – not the fear of what is, but of what might be,” he says. “Real horror isn’t a mugger with a gun. It’s the shadow behind the door, the silence that lingers too long, the certainty that something is coming … but you don’t know when, or what.”That unpredictability became the theme for Dead Space’s sound design. “We built tension like a slow tide,” Veca says. “Something could happen … something might happen … and then nothing – just a kitten in the kitchen. You laugh, the adrenaline fades, and three seconds later: claws, blood, screaming!”View image in fullscreenInfected … Dead Space.Photograph: EAJason Graves, the Bafta-winning composer behind the score for Dead Space and 2015’s Until Dawn, agrees. “Sound and music prepare the player to be scared – it’s all about the buildup, the tension, and then the release when something jumps out at you.”Graves even treated the score itself as a kind of infected organism. “In Dead Space, something has infected the crew and turned them into monsters, so I ‘infected’ the orchestra,” he says. “Unusual techniques, tapping instruments, no keys or chords – just clusters and tension.” When the player thinks it’s quiet, it might be 60 strings each playing any note they want, very softly. It becomes a living, dissonant room tone – always shifting, unpredictable.”If you doubt how much sound matters, Graves offers a test. “My daughter tried Until Dawn and kept freaking out,” he laughs, “I told her to mute it – and then she got through it fine. If the picture’s off but you still hear something, that’s what our brains are wired for. The monster under the bed, the fin on the water – your imagination fills the gaps, and that’s 10 times scarier than anything we can show.”The human elementFor cult game developer Swery – real name Hidetaka Suehiro – fear has never been about cheap shocks: it’s about the human condition. He began questioning what truly scares players when his mentor, Resident Evil creator Tokuro Fujiwara, once asked him: “What is fear in a game?”View image in fullscreenGame developer Hidetaka Suehiro, also known as Swery.Photograph: White Owls Inc.“I was in my 20s and naively answered, ‘Game over,’” Swery recalls. “He replied, ‘Then are games without a “game over” not scary? Is a haunted house where you can’t take damage not scary?’ I was at a loss. Ever since, I’ve been continually searching for the answer.”That curiosity became the foundation for 2010’sDeadly Premonition– a surreal small-town horror which blends absurd humour with existential dread. “Before crafting fear, we set a clear goal: build the town and its people,” he says, “I even wrote the story after the town existed.”“At the centre of horror there is a human being,” Swery adds. “That human, carrying an inner diversity and suffering, is fragile, and can be defeated by evil … that’s everything.”Though it’s in monsters that our fears are visualised, for Thomas Grip, game director of critically acclaimed 2015 deep-sea horrorSoma, horror is also less about villains and more about what it says about being human.“I think it’s a different kind of scary,” he says. “There’s no big twist or constant jump scares. The whole idea is that it forces you to ask uncomfortable questions: What does it mean to be human? What does it mean to be conscious? What sort of life is worth living?”Forget gore and surprises in the dark – in Soma, it’s more about using silence and philosophy to get under your skin. “The key to any horror story, no matter the medium, is that the audience fills in the blanks themselves,” Grip says. “If your story is just, ‘Here’s something scary, be scared,’ it’s not that interesting. The best horror makes you think about something deeper.”View image in fullscreenDeep sea scares … Soma.Photograph: Frictional GamesThe unknown – and twists on the familiarSomething else to play on is the fear of the unknown, and unease often comes from what isn’t shown. “You shouldn’t spell everything out,” Grip says. “The player only gets glimpses, and their imagination fills in the rest – their own fears, anxieties, and whatnot. That’s where the real fear comes from.” Even the monsters in Soma reflect that idea. “The key is familiarity,” he says. “The best monsters are ones where you think, ‘Something’s off here …’ and the more you look, the worse it gets. People react strongly to things that look infectious or unhealthy. It triggers a primal fear.”In 2021 viral indie horror hit Poppy Playtime, with its factory of cute, murderous toys, fear takes a brighter shape. “Nostalgia carries vulnerability. When we think of childhood, we think of safety – and twist those things, the reaction is visceral,” Zach Belanger, CEO of Poppy Playtime studio Mob Entertainment, says.“That’s what makes Huggy Wuggy so effective. We ask, ‘How can something feel both lovable and wrong at the same time?’” he adds, of the game’s fluffy baddie.View image in fullscreenPixel scares … Loop//Error.Illustration: Koro Pixel StudioIn 2025’s psychological horrorLoop//Error, the images themselves are made spooky by suggestion – leaving detail to the imagination in the form of a blocky, black-and-white pixelated art style. “Using pixelated visuals and the deliberate absence of colour creates unfamiliarity – your mind projects things that aren’t really there,” solo developer Koro says. “It’s like remembering a nightmare: blurry, incomplete, but emotionally sharp.”“The fear in Loop//Error doesn’t rely on horror cliches,” Koro adds, “It comes from human depth. From watching a mind collapse under its own weight, and realising that the scariest place to be trapped is yourself.”The interactive factorFinally, there’s another element that makes horror in video games so impactful: you have to take part yourself.“In a game, you’re not watching someone else flee – you’re in it, and that’s why it feels good: your heart races, but you’re still in control,” says psychologist Kieron Oakland, a specialist in cyberpsychology at Arden University.Daniel Knight, creator of 2020’s ghost-busting multiplayer game Phasmophobia, agrees. “Games put you inside the fear,” he says, of the horror game which took Twitch by storm on its release. “When you decide to open a door or step into a dark room, the fear is yours. You’re responsible for what happens next.”Grip also believes the genre endures for this reason. “In games, you make the decision to walk into danger,” he says. “That makes it personal. The fear comes from you being the idiot walking into the dark tunnel.”After all, scary movies ask what you’d do in the dark. Video games make you find out.Explore more on these topicsGamesAction gamesIndie gamesHalloweenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Yet it stood by as catastrophe loomedFri 31 Oct 2025 14.15 EDTLast modified on Fri 31 Oct 2025 20.13 EDTShareNo one can claim they did not know what would happen in El Fasher. An 18-month siege had already seen war crimes by the Rapid Support Forces, including the execution of civilians and sexual violence. Warnings of the massacres that would followwhen the city in Darfur fell– as it did on Sunday – were widespread.The reality was an even darker hell,in the wordsof UN officials. The World Health Organization says that the RSFkilled 460 people in one hospital. Satellite images appear to capture bloodstains on the ground. Footage showed fighters executing unarmed men. Other captives were taken for ransom. The UN says hundreds of civilians and unarmed fighters were raped or killed while trying to flee the city, with clear evidence of ethnically targeted violence. The horrors continue.The RSF grew out of the Janjaweed forces, which, unleashed by the Sudanese military government, committed genocide against non-Arab populations in Darfur two decades ago. “Never again,” the world insisted. But it has happened again. No one believes the RSF’spromises to hold fighters accountableare anything more than cosmetic. Meanwhile, the UN response plan for the world’s largest humanitarian crisis islittle more than a quarter funded.“I urge colleagues to study the world’s continued failure to stop this. Blood on the hands,” said Tom Fletcher, the UN humanitarian chief. But it is not merely that the world has stood by. Outsiders legitimised and funded the RSF’s evolution into a more powerful force, which ended up turning on the Sudanese Armed Forces, under Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, in April 2023. They have stoked the civil war for their own interests.The EUsent millions of eurosto Sudan to curb migration – with border policing put under the RSF’s charge. Hard questions are rightly being asked about why military equipment fromBritain,Canadaand elsewhere has reached Sudanese battlefields. Above all, there is anger at the United Arab Emirates’ role. The UAE angrily denies backing the RSF. Diplomats, analysts and satellite imagerysay otherwise. US intelligence agencies say itincreased arms shipments to Sudanthis year. Gold flowsin the opposite direction.Now that it controls Darfur’s major urban centres, the RSF, under Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo – known as Hemedti – is likely to intensify its campaign in Kordofan, and continue attempts to destabilise the SAF-held east of the country. Yet increasingly there appears to be a de facto partition; neither side can win, yet neither accepts that. Accordingly, the war is likely to continue as long as there are weapons to fuel it.At hisconfirmation hearing, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, told the Senate that he would raise with UAE leaders “the fact that they are openly supporting an entity that is carrying out a genocide”. Yet the US and UK have shown little appetite for pressuring the UAE to turn off the tap. The Trump family haslucrative tiesto the Gulf nation.Outrage at the atrocities in Darfur is now growing, however, in the US and beyond. The UAE itself is sensitive to scrutiny and criticism, having invested heavily in portraying itself as the stable, responsible and aspirational face of the region. It has had no reason to believe that people care enough about Sudan to affect it. But sustained public and cultural pressure might yet convince it that when Darfur is drenched in blood, Abu Dhabi too is tainted.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But they’re finding it hard to beat a player who breaks all the rulesFri 31 Oct 2025 13.46 EDTLast modified on Fri 31 Oct 2025 20.01 EDTShareEvery year is election year in the US, but the contests of 2025, which reach their climax on Tuesday, will be especially revealing. These “off-year” battles – a smattering of governors’ races, statewide referendums and the election of a new mayor in the country’s biggest city – will tell us much about the national mood 12 months after Americans returnedDonald Trumpto the White House and one year before midterm contests that could reshape the US political landscape. Above all, though, they will reveal the division, the confusion and sheer discombobulation Trump has induced in the US’s party of opposition.The verdict on Trump’s first 10 months in office will be delivered most clearly in the two states set to choose a new governor: New Jersey and Virginia. By rights, these should be relatively easy wins for the Democrats. Both states voted for Kamala Harris a year ago, and the current polls are grim for Trump. This week,an Economist/YouGov surveyregistered Trump’s lowest rating of his second term – 39% of Americans approve of him, while 58% disapprove – the lowest number they’d recorded for him bar one poll in his first term. Trump’s handling of the economy gets especially low marks, and a plurality of voters blame the continuing government shutdown, now in its second month, on Trump and his party. If an off-year election offers an opportunity to kick an unpopular incumbent, then Tuesday should be plain sailing for Democrats.And yet, the contest in New Jersey, for one, is looking far from comfortable. Democrats there are mindful that a year ago Trumpsurged in the state: after losing to Biden by a whopping 16 points in 2020, he trailed Harris by just six. Current polls show the Democratic candidate for governor ahead, but only narrowly:one surveyput her just one point aheadof her Republican opponent. The party is funnelling serious money into the contest and deploying its biggest guns: Barack Obama will campaign in New Jersey on Saturday.It may work. But the fact that, after all that voters have seen from Trump these past 10 months – the power grabs; the wild on-again, off-again moves on tariffs; the failure to shrinkinflation; theindulgence of corruption; the vanity projects, including the demolition of the East Wing of the White House to make room for a gilded Trump ballroom – a Republican is even competitive in a state such as New Jersey should be troubling Democrats. And, if my conversations in Washington and New York this week are anything to go by, it is.The problem is that, even after a decade in which Trump has dominatedUS politics, Democrats are still not sure how to confront him, or even, more fundamentally, what they should really be. Take the mayoral contest in New York City, which is exposing the depth of the divide.The frontrunner is Zohran Mamdani, a 34-year-old newcomer who came from nowhere to storm his way to the Democratic nomination. Hugely charismatic and a master of social media, he has energised voters who had long regarded the Democrats as stale and tired: in the Democratic primary earlier this year,turnout was highestamong those between ages 25 and 35. His chief opponent is the man he beat in that primary, the former Democratic governor of the state and scion of one of the party’s most storied families: Andrew Cuomo.Their clash captures what Cuomo, now running as an independent, calls the “quiet civil war” among Democrats in almost cartoonishly stark terms. Mamdani is a socialist beloved by the young, but feared by the old – and by those alarmed by his refusal to denounce the slogan “globalise the intifada”, a phrase they believe sanctions attacks on Israel-associated, meaning Jewish, targets in the US and elsewhere. Cuomo is 67, previously endorsed by the party establishment and tainted by thebullying and sexual harassment scandalthat drove him out of office in 2021.LiveNew York mayoral frontrunners Zohran Mamdani and Andrew Cuomo clash during debate – videoIt is a divide that is both ideological and generational. Plenty of younger Democrats see Mamdani as radical and inspiring, drawn to his message of “affordability” of housing and public transport. They see Cuomo as the embodiment of an exhausted, morally compromised centrism that cannot beat Trump. Meanwhile, many older Democrats see Mamdani as radical and untested, carrying too little experience and too much ideological baggage – the same leftist liabilities that the right ruthlessly exploits and ultimately always leads to Democratic defeat. I got a glimpse of that divide when, ata live event in Manhattanfor the Unholy podcast, I asked Hillary Clinton whether, if she had a vote in New York City, she would cast it for Mamdani, who is, let’s not forget, the official Democratic nominee for mayor: “You know what? I don’t vote in this city. I’m not involved in it. I have not been at all even asked to be involved in it, and I have not chosen to be involved in it.”If Mamdani wins, and either of the comparatively moderateDemocratsrunning in New Jersey and Virginia loses, then the party’s progressive wing will take that as confirmation that its approach – the path of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders – represents the party’s best hope. But if all three win, and especially if the gubernatorial candidates improve on Harris’s performance in 2024, then the moderate wing will be buoyed, and the argument inside the Democratic party will rage on. In fact, it’s a fair bet it will rage on whatever happens.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Whatever you’re doing right now | Andy BeckettRead moreAnd that is because the age of Trump has been utterly confounding for his opponents. How do you play against a player who breaks all the rules of the game? If you stick to the old ways of doing politics, if you obey the traditional proprieties and conventions, you cast yourself as part of the very establishment or deep state or elite that Trump has so profitably railed against for 10 years. But if you don’t, if you disrespect past norms, then you become part of the problem, the danger, Trump represents, weakening the guardrails that keep democracy on track.An example of that dilemma is on display in California. The state’s ambitious governor,Gavin Newsom, has tabled a ballot initiative – a referendum – that would redraw the boundaries of California’s congressional districts to give the party about five more seats in the House of Representatives in time for next year’s midterm elections. It’s retaliation for a Trump-approved gerrymander in Texas that will hand Republicans a similar advantage in that state. Democrats have hailed Newsom’s move as an act of resistance, fighting Trumpian fire with fire. And so it is. But it also burns away one more democratic norm, turning boundary changes into a routinely partisan battleground.Democrats are struggling because there are no good options when fighting a nationalist populist unafraid to wreck democracy. If you stay high while he goes low, you lose – and he is free to wreak further destruction on the democratic system. But if you sink to his level, you risk damaging the very thing you want so desperately to protect. The havoc of Donald Trump is never confined to Trump. It engulfs his opponents too.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistGuardian newsroom: Year One of Trumpism: Is Britain Emulating the US?

California has just lost four seats to congressional reapportionment. Texas has gained four.Reapportionment has not gone well forDemocrats. In addition to the four from the Golden state, New York has lost two seats. Minnesota, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Illinois each lost one. Blue states surrendered those seats – and electoral college votes – to red states where the Republican party draws the lines: Florida, Utah, Idaho, Georgia, North Carolina and Texas.PresidentGavin Newsom, needing to make up those 11 electors in a re-election campaign against Donald Trump Jr while also defending his party’s slender lead in the House, calls California’s Democratic leadership. Texas will already gain four seats, he tells them. California will lose them. Democrats are going to have to draw a 47-1 congressional map. If not, Republicans could win another trifecta. Trump Jr could win. Democracy itself is on the line.Very little in this scenario is fanciful. If population trends continue, Sun belt migration will cost blue states a dozen seats in the US House. Newsom will be a favorite for the Democratic nomination. Texas and Florida will gain additional seats, no gerrymander required. And the partisan calculus in 2031 could look a lot like it does in 2025: without a big boost from California, Democrats might not have any hope to hold the US House.Should Californians vote to redistrict and fight Texas’s fire with fire? | Moira DoneganRead moreNewsom and other proponents of California’s proposition 50 – a measure that would allow Democrats to redraw the state’s congressional districts – insist that they are only asking voters to replace California’s bipartisan commission-drawn map as a temporary solution to an urgent crisis within American democracy. The 48-4 map, they promise, is purely retaliatory, and designed to restore partisan balance and match the five seats stolen first by Texas. The commission – designed to ensure fair districts – would supposedly be restored to power after the 2030 census.It’s difficult to believe that’s true. Those additional California seats will not be any less important to Democrats in five years. After all, the exact electoral concerns driving Newsom and Democrats to act in 2025 will still be with us when the next round of redistricting begins, after the 2030 census. Indeed, after reapportionment – and if the US supreme court further weakens the Voting Rights Act in a case from Louisiana this term, placing seats held by Black Democrats across the south in jeopardy – the Democrats’ partisan prospects might even be worse.Now put a Trump scion or another Maga acolyte on the ballot. Combine that with the electoral college boost the Republican party will receive after apportionment and their long-term edge on the US Senate map. Won’t California Democrats insist, again, that democracy depends on a radical gerrymander? Might partisans approve another power grab in the name of democracy?California voters face a difficult choice this fall. Many citizens, rightly concerned about the authoritarian turn of the national GOP, will support proposition 50 as a counterweight. Yet it’s worth considering this: once politicians gain power over redistricting, they’re loath to hand it over voluntarily.California voters, after all, created the state’s independent commission for precisely this reason: the politicians could not be trusted to do it themselves. In the 1980s, the Democratic representative Phil Burton called the state’s Picasso-style cartography his “contribution to modern art”. He offered the same justification as Newsom: this power play was needed to counteract Republicans. But voters hated this gerrymander so much that a statewide repeal vote succeeded in 1982.This rebuke taught Democrats a curious lesson: they’d simply guarantee themselves the number of seats they wanted by working with Republicans to gerrymander the state. After the 2000 census, the two parties agreed on a fair split of the delegation behind closed doors. Voters had no say at all – and the seats were so locked in that despite a tumultuous decade in politics, only one incumbent lost a re-election bid.Voters didn’t like this much, either. They finally took the pen away from politicians, over the course of two initiatives in 2008 (affecting state legislative districts) and 2010 (affecting Congress). The commission voters established is the gold standard for reform. Commissioners are put through an arduous process to ensure fairness. No state provides more public input. The commission has inspired nonpartisan reformers nationwide, who have pointed to its success when winning anti-gerrymandering initiatives in Michigan, Colorado, Utah, Ohio, Missouri and elsewhere.And while competitive elections have dwindled nationwide, they’ve dramatically increased in California. Instead of one congressional seat changing hands each decade, 15 seats flipped from 2012 to 2020. In 2022, five seats were within 5 percentage points, and another two were within 8 percentage points. In 2024, eight seats were within 5.1 percentage points. Those competitive seats would be wiped away on the new map – which not only flips GOP seats blue, but also strengthens three other Democratic incumbents.It is no small thing for a state to lose all of its competitive seats. It becomes almost impossible to hold lawmakers accountable. In districts this safe for one side, good luck changing your representative even if you want to.This gerrymander does net Democrats five seats nationally. One could argue that’s a fair trade-off. But in the end, it doesn’t actually create a level national playing field – now or long-term. Proposition 50 counters Texas. But with Missouri, Ohio, Florida, Kansas, Indiana, North Carolina and Kentucky redrawing next, that’s an additional 10 seats with no counterweight – all with the US supreme court weighing a Voting Rights Act case that, depending on the decision, could allow Republicans to nab another dozen seats. Californians will surrender their commission, and the best national inspiration for reform. The actual national impact may be negligible to zero.And over the long run, the partisan picture will grow cloudier still for Democrats. California’s shrinking population could cost the state four seats in Congress via reapportionment. That’s another reason why it’s so hard to imagine Democrats giving up power to draw the lines ever again. After the 2030 census, four incumbents will lose their districts. Will anadditionalfive Democrats want to lose theirs – the likely outcome if the commission returns? Might partisans want the power to choose which side, or which incumbents, lose their seats? Come 2029, the rumbling will begin: this power should stay with the legislature. You know, because democracy itself will depend upon it.If this mid-decade redistricting armageddon tells us anything, it’s that we desperately need a national standard to end gerrymandering everywhere. But if California unwinds the most successful example of reform for partisan purposes, well, it moves the nation farther away from any real solution.It moves California backwards as well, to a time when mapmakers chose winners and losers – something politicians tend to like just fine. We should expect them to zealously protect it at all costs.David Daleyis the author of Antidemocratic: Inside the Far Right’s 50-Year Plot to Control American Elections as well as Ratf**ked: Why Your Vote Doesn’t CountExplore more on these topicsDemocratsOpinionUS politicsUS CongressHouse of RepresentativescommentShareReuse this content"

Last week, Steve Bannon, the far-right provocateur and one-timeDonald Trumpadviser, said in an interview with the Economist that the president would seek an unconstitutional third term. “Trump is going to be president in 28, and people ought to just get accommodated with that,” Bannon said. (He seemed to be referring to Trump winning the presidential election in 2028 – Trump’s current term will last through 20 January 2029.) “At the appropriate time, we’ll lay out what the plan is.”Like clockwork, Trump commented on the idea soon after,telling reportersfollowing him on Air Force One as he flew from Kuala Lumpur to Tokyo: “I would love to do it.”Initially, he said: “I haven’t really thought about it. But I have the best poll numbers I’ve ever had.” (This is not true; Trump’s approval has sunk considerably, witha new pollreleased this week showing him at a net -19 point approval rating, the lowest of his second term.) Still, Trump said he would be legally able to run again in a scheme in which he was placed on the ticket as a vice-presidential nominee, only for the puppet placed in the presidential slot to resign once taking office, thereby granting him the presidency. But he suggested that he would prefer to run himself, casting aspersion on the vice-presidential campaign option. “I don’t think people would like that,” he said. “It would be too cute, it wouldn’t be right.” In fact, it would also be unconstitutional, violatingthe 12th amendment’s prohibitionon anyone ineligible for the presidency to be elected as vice-president.In a notable departure from his being loath to disagree with the president about anything at all, the House speaker, Mike Johnson, on Tuesday seemed to pour water on the idea of a third Trump term, noting, correctly, that such an outcome is barred by the constitution. “Well, there’s the 22nd amendment,” he noted. Johnson said that Trump was “trolling” his political enemies; analysis atCNNand theNew York Timessuggests that Trump is using the third-term comments in part to mute awareness of his own lame-duck status.Johnson is correct that the plain language of the constitution prevents Trump from getting what he says he wants in a third term. But we are in a moment when the plain language of the constitution is being subverted, ignored and read with shocking bad faith by the rightwing legal establishment, from law professors to justices of the supreme court, who have seemed eager to nullify parts of the constitution in order to expand Trump’s prerogatives and indulge his whims. How else but as an attack on the constitutional order are we supposed to understand, to cite just one example, the supreme court’s decision toallow Trump to proceedwith his dismantling of the Department of Education – a body created by Congress, which only Congress has the power to dissolve? The prohibition posed by the constitution against a third Trump term does not seem like an especially robust defense in an era when the constitution is effectively being rewritten to grant Trump ever more power, with ever fewer opportunities for accountability. The constitution, after all, is just a piece of paper. And of the nine jurists tasked with settling on its authoritative interpretation, six of them are in the tank for a man hostile to its principles.If obviating the plain and obvious language of the 22nd amendment seems like too embarrassing a move even for this degraded and servile supreme court, consider what the court is already looking to do to the 14th amendment. The plain reading of the amendment, which has been understood and implemented in exactly one way for the past 157 years, is that the constitution confers citizenship to all persons born within the United States – what is called birthright citizenship. But after the Trump administration issued an executive order purporting to nullify this constitutional provision, the supreme courtintervenedto allow the order to go into effect, and made an unprecedented move toprevent lower courtsfrom easily blocking it.The justices were provided cover, and a degree of plausible deniability, by right-leaning law professors, who had responded to the Maga movement’s calls to end birthright citizenship by assembling a legalliteraturethat claims – through strained, misstated, far-fetched and outright wrong readings of the historical and legal record – that there is a longstanding controversy about the meaning of the 14th amendment’s citizenship clause.There is not.But their papers have created a veneer of intellectual credibility and a pretext for the Trump administration to do what it wants to do anyway: ignore the constitution. (In abriefingfiled to the supreme court, asking it to sanction Trump’s attack on citizenship, the Trump administration alludes to “[a] growing body of modern scholarship”, and cites Trump-aligned scholars whose work claiming to limit birthright citizenship the administration’s own actions had provoked.) When the supreme court finally rules on the constitutionality of Trump’s order and the future of birthright citizenship is determined, what these law professors say may well matter more than what the constitution does.And this is why the notion that Trump “can’t” run for a third term, merely because such a thing is unconstitutional, may be a bit naive, or insufficiently alert to the degree to which the American constitutional order has already collapsed. What is and is not constitutional is determined, in effect, by Trump loyalists on the court; they already have an infrastructure of bad-faith enablers who will help them launder their efforts to empower him with flimsy pretenses of legal justifiability. And we already know, too, what happens when the law says that Trump must leave office, but he doesn’t want to. Events have long since made clear that the law is no check on Trump’s power. He’ll have to be stopped by the people instead: not with a lawsuit, but with a movement.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS constitution and civil libertiesTrump administrationUS supreme courtUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

My aging friend reminds me that the same industry too often steals dignity from the young horses who run for our entertainmentFri 31 Oct 2025 04.30 EDTLast modified on Fri 31 Oct 2025 09.11 EDTShareMy beloved friend Pancho is an off-track thoroughbred who has been with me for 24 years. In his youth, in the early 2000s, he soldiered through a vigorous mid-level career on the competitive tracks of Southern California. At nearly 28 now his life is approaching its natural end. Our life together riding trails has been the purest gift. But his slow decline forces me to face the unsettling possibility of euthanasia. It’s a decision that haunts me constantly, like a whispering djinn. Some days are good, some are not. Though I dread the day I may walk into the barn and he lets me know he needs my help to die I am consoled only by the dignity of his life. He’s privileged where many thoroughbreds of his day and thousands since were not. As it was back then, as it is now and will continue to be, for the young racehorse who dies on the track there is no dignity in the end.Horses helped shape the world as we know it. Now we run them to death | Elizabeth BanickiRead moreAs thoughts of Pancho’s creeping decline weighed on me, I took a job at a large equine hospital to fill gaps in my knowledge and learn how best to care for him as health problems arise. But after a while I admitted to myself that the more sincere reason I am there is to observe other horses die. It may sound dark or morbid, but it hardly compares with the deaths I’ve witnessed before: young racehorses with shattered legs or hearts that burst mid-stride, collapsing before an audience in the name of sport.Since my work began at the clinic, I have held horses’ heads while they were humanely euthanized. A horse’s eyes and body are their complete language. I’ve learned that when a horse is ready to die, whether due to old age or prolonged pain and illness, they accept death, welcome it even, much as people do. These deaths are generally tranquil, “peaceful death”. The horse’s soul is ready to leave.Sometimes though a horse is not ready to die. A young healthy horse may fight even as the overdose of bright pink barbiturates is pushed into their jugular. In the moments before their heart stops, they may stagger and set backwards. Their heads high and flight-ready, bodies braced stiff with fear, and eyes wide and wild before they drop to the ground dead. Some racetrack veterinarians administer a mild sedative prior to euthanasia, which works to confuse the mind and lessen the horse’s ability to physically respond to what’s happening to it. It is meant to relax the horse so that it accepts death with less fight. But this sedative is not designed to kill pain, and it takes time to have an effect, quite a bit more time in fact than euthanasia itself. For a horse who is exerted to the extreme from running and consumed by fear and pain, is more time spent standing on a broken leg ultimately more humane, especially considering the sedation makes standing precarious even for a horse on four good legs? When the death screen goes up around the doomed horse on the track, public inquiry stops. But the horse dies whether we see it or not. There is no humanity in taking an innocent horse’s life for a sport, so in the context of racing the term humane euthanasia doesn’t work.None of this is to say that euthanasia is not, in many circumstances, an appropriate way to end an animal’s suffering. But how a horse gets there, and for what purpose, matters. In racing, the horses are not old or sick, and they have no agency in what happens to them. Their lives – unlike Pancho’s, lived fully into age and rest – are only just beginning. They wouldn’t die if not for the misfortune of being bred and made to run toward it. In the world of racing, euthanasia is used loosely, as a tool for managing a business. Insurance payouts are built into the calculus of ownership. It remains a fact that no other equine sport accepted by the public as civilized kills young, healthy horsesat the obscene rate horse racing does. In a sense, the sport has hijacked the language of humane euthanasia to justify the unethical – an act of moral sleight of hand made necessary by an industry built on the exploitation of the young.My heart will be crushed the day I say goodbye to Pancho and if it is humane euthanasia we face, in that tremendous decision I will make on his behalf, I will find peace knowing that he knows I do it from a place of true love and compassion.And, believe me, they know.Elizabeth Banickiworked for two decadesas an exercise rider in the horse racing industry.Explore more on these topicsHorse racingHorsesBreeders' CupUS sportscommentShareReuse this content"

Whatever you’re doing right nowAndy BeckettIn California, daily life under Trump is marked by sporadic resistance and avoidance. Neither will defeat the autocratsFri 31 Oct 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 31 Oct 2025 05.56 EDTShareHow would you behave if your democracy was being dismantled? In most western countries, that used to be an academic question. Societies where this process had happened, such as Germany in the 1930s, seemed increasingly distant. The contrasting ways that people reacted to authoritarianism and autocracy, both politically and in their everyday lives, while darkly fascinating and important to study and remember, seemed of diminishing relevance to now.Not any more. Illiberal populism has spread across the world, either challenging for power or entrenching itself in office, from Argentina to Italy, France to Indonesia, Hungary to Britain. But probably the most significant example of a relatively free, pluralist society and political system turning into something very different remains the US, now nine months into Donald Trump’s second term.As it often does, the US is demonstrating what the future could be for much of the world. Trump’spurges of immigrants, centralisation of power, suppression of dissent, rewarding of loyal oligarchs and contempt for truth and the law are not unique. Even governments which present themselves as alternatives to populism, such as Keir Starmer’s,increasingly sharesome of its features, such as a performative severity towards asylum seekers. Yet with over three years left of Trump’s frenetic presidency, and possibly more – were he toovercome the constitutional and electoral obstaclesto a third term – life under him already provides the most unsettling picture of democracy under siege so far.Partly because populism is divisive – setting “the people” against their supposed enemies – and partly because Trump is so volatile, the domestic impact of his regime is very uneven. And so is how different groups and individuals respond to its actions. These complex, often disturbing patterns are particularly clear in California, one of the places he most dislikes, for its liberal values and multiculturalism, and where his regime has most aggressively intervened.In Los Angeles, where US marines, national guard troops and armed officers of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have beencontroversially deployedby the federal government on and off since June, some largely Latino neighbourhoods remain eerily quiet. In Boyle Heights last Wednesday morning, two of the usual hubs for shopping and socialising, Cesar Chavez Avenue and Mariachi Plaza, were almost deserted, bakeries and cafes empty, only a few of the square’s outdoor seats taken, despite a mellow autumn sun. Fear of sudden arrest, detention and deportation has kept many people indoors and away from public spaces for months.Yet in the neighbouring arts district of downtown LA, a gentrified grid of former warehouses and factories, the bakeries and cafes were busy as usual. Over pricey iced coffees and fat, artisanal sandwiches, fashionably dressed clusters of largely white people chatted about their latest cultural projects. The fact that Trump and his supporters would probably hate the whole scene, or that something approaching martial law had been imposed just up the road, did not appear to be affecting these ambitious millennials. In the US, as in other countries that are becoming or have become authoritarian, for those spared by the state, careers, social lives, leisure and consumerism carry on – and sometimes with a new intensity, as a form of escape.However, avoiding and engaging with politics are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Often, both impulses coexist in people, especially when faced with something as simultaneously provocative and exhausting as hard-right populism. Periods of passivity, of apparent acceptance of the status quo, alternate with an urge to act.View image in fullscreenProtesters at a No Kings march in Los Angeles on 19 October 2025.Photograph: Michael Nigro/Pacific Press/ShutterstockA fortnight ago, I went to aNo Kings protestin Beverly Hills, a Californian city much less associated with activism than deep wealth. I expected a small gathering of elite liberals; instead, there were a couple of thousand boisterous people, of all ages, marching back and forth for hours along the edge of a park, carrying witty anti-Trump placards and chanting, to the accompaniment of drummers and constant passing car horns. The chants were not that fluent, which suggested that the participants did not protest often, and so did their gleeful smiles, as if they were doing something unexpectedly enjoyable and naughty. The whole event was uplifting: politics coming alive for people, perhaps for the first time.But authoritarianism can provoke more jaded reactions as well. In San Francisco, traditionally a more political place, while there have been big No Kings protests, I also encountered a contempt towards Trump and his circle, for their blatant self-interest, cartoonish bullying and vast exaggerations, which risked becoming an angry apathy: a belief that the regime was a malign fact of life, like a government in a totally corrupt state or the Soviet bloc. This response, like refusing to rise to Trump’s attention-seeking, can be understood and justified as a form of conscious disengagement and as a coping mechanism. Yet while liberals and leftists brood, his regime relentlessly moves on.While I was in San Francisco, it was rumoured that he was about to send troops or federal agents to what he claimed was a failing city. Some people I spoke to there ridiculed the idea. They gestured towards the many beautiful streets, successful businesses, picturesque green spaces and extensive public transport – a quality of life which, while increasingly unaffordable for some, exceeds that of many Trump-supporting places.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Trump called off his San Francisco invasion, but the possibility of it remains, like a crude but effective TV cliffhanger. Creating a politics which can stand up to rightwing populism’s showmanship and drama in a sustained way is a project which has so far defeated Trump’s opponents, with the exception of isolated leftwingers such asZohran Mamdaniand Bernie Sanders.If Reform UK wins power, as seems increasingly possible, then British liberals and leftists will face the same challenge. Nigel Farage could launch endless eye-catching policies from Downing Street, such as the Trump-style deconstruction and politicisation of Whitehall, whichReform promisedthis week. These policies may fail or disappoint, as Trump’s often have, but make the political weather nevertheless. Unless populism’s opponents create an equally relentless and compelling movement, and draw in more of those whom populism victimises and scares into silence, then this age of autocrats will carry on.

This de-princing could leave the entire House of Windsor facing redundancyFri 31 Oct 2025 08.47 EDTLast modified on Fri 31 Oct 2025 14.22 EDTShareIncredible news for residents of the likes of Prince Andrew Drive and Prince Andrew Way, who in recent years have sought name changes from their local councils to remove the unfortunate association with You Know Who. Thanks to last night’s historicallydramatic action by the king, the dignity of those aforementioned small stretches of Britain has been restored. (If anyone happens to live in Andrew Mountbatten Windsor Close, my commiserations.) But has the dignity of the British monarchy – current custodians: the House of Windsor – been restored? No, I reckon. In fact, this has made it worse.By way of background, the royal family’s crises have not been external for some time. It is not beset by marauding forces, or rival claimants to its throne, or parliamentarian revolt. All its greatest crises in the past few decades have come from within. Those crises have been marital, financial,even clinical– and have just avoided being criminal. The royal family has proved its own worst enemy. The things that have happened have not happenedtoit, butbecauseof it. The call’s coming from inside the castle.I’ve covered this particular Andrew story for well over a decade, and it hopefully goes without saying that the ex-prince is an utterly grim, utterly dim disgrace. But for my money, this latest Windsor crisis is the most dangerous variety yet for the crown: philosophical. Far from securing the monarchy’s future, the de-princing of Mr Mountbatten Windsor has hastened its end, in the great scheme of things. Don’t ask me to put a number of years on “the great scheme of things” – all I can tell you is that it’s a real rush writing a column that will only be proved right or wrong long after I’m dead. Tony Blair must feel like this every time he says history will judge him kindly for the Iraq war.But look, here’s the take: when there isn’t a royal family any more, analysts will look back and see the unprecedented enforced commoner-ing of Andrew as a key moment. Notthekey moment – that was the abdication. Forgive me getting all Stranger Things on this story, but 1936 was the moment the Windsors opened the gate. Once they started suggesting that people could be fired from Earth’s most committed non-meritocracy – unroyalled, as it were – then they played around fatally with the idea of royalty itself. Now, you might well think that the idea of royalty itself is stupid, but it is what it is. They’re not just another random rich family. They’re supposed to be special and ethereal and not subject to personnel issues. There’s no way in the world they should want to be stepping out of their realm – which is, quite literally “the realm” – and into the plebeian waters of appraisals and feedback and mandatory discrimination training and whatnot. Though all that would, as always, make a fun three-minute comedy sketch.The most almighty number of shitbag relatives have been harboured by the British royal family down the centuries. Obviously it was easier when you could just poison your errant brother or whatever, but for those that couldn’t (most of them after the 17th century), you lived with it via exile and so on, because total deroyalling torpedoed the entire idea of what it was you were born into. TheBritish dukes who had their titles removedfor fighting for Germany in the first world war were distant foreign randos. Andrew remains eighth in line to the throne.So yes: the abdication was when the Windsors opened the gate. After that it was – and will be – whack-a-mole. Every crisis will draw significant numbers of people out who would ask why you couldn’t cut off whoever was displeasing them in that moment. And why not? You got rid of one: the precedent is set. My theory is that the late Queen Elizabeth realised this, and consequently knew that to avoid making matters worse, she would have to work as queen till literally her dying day. Don’t forget that for quite some time, people seriously suggested that the crown skip the then-unsatisfactory Charles and be passed straight to William. Don’t forget that later on, people kept suggesting that Elizabeth abdicate in favour of Charles, having put in decades of exemplary service and being deserving of retirement, as though monarchy really were this ludicrous “firm” they keep telling us it is.But it isn’t. It isn’t a firm, or a small-to-medium enterprise, or a place where you pick and choose which family member gets the big jobs. They’re not the flipping Murdochs. As far as the long-termist stewardship of the thing they are above all charged with protecting goes, I think that, philosophically speaking, you have to play the cards you’re laid. Now public opinion has managed to get the king to issue a P45 so close to home, it will be that much easier to call for the next personnel change. The king won’t have too many more years in the managing director role. But William, that supposedly iron-fisted current HR director, is a very indifferently gifted individual who will probably prove to be overpromoted in the role of king. I wonder who or what he’ll cancel, under his strange, self-styled guise as protector of the mental health of the nation. I guess we’ll find out.For what infinitely negligible amount it’s worth, I’m in favour of having a royal family, mainly because they’re insanely good copy, and arguably better than having Peter Mandelson or whoever as head of state. (I’m kidding: I understand third ways are available.) Given the sheer amount of merriment/discourse they generate, they add to the gaiety of the nation – certainly to the compulsive prurience. People love to love them or love to hate them. It seems to be a complete misery machine for those involved, and certainly not one that any of us ordinaries would in our right mind want our children to marry into (I will never get over the Middleton parents’ reported keenness for Kate to take a gap year so she could switch university application to St Andrews once it was confirmedPrince Williamwould be attending – and all this after the cautionary story of Princess Diana had come to its awful end).Speaking of tragic stories, the law has decided Andrew can’t be further investigated over the late Virginia Giuffre’s allegations, with theFBI dropping its probeinto him earlier this year. The king’s statement on the de-princing appeared to hint he doesn’t entirely believe his brother’s denials, so perhaps Charles’s actions are a sort of synthesised justice, designed in part to show that no one is above the law. And yet, the royal family is above many laws – and this will only hasten the goodbye to all that.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Positive Money, Tax Justice UK, the Fairness Foundation, Equality Trust and others arecampaigningfor a windfall tax on banks’ accelerating domestic profits. Inflation has yet again raised their takings torecord heightsfor no extra effort, the same inflation that also raises the cost of living.When oil and gas prices soared in 2022, the Tory government set a 35% energy profits levy. Why not on banks, an equally unavoidable utility, they demand? Naturally British banks fight back. “Our sector underpins investment, business growth and home ownership across the country,”says their lobby group, UK Finance. It will damage their competitiveness with foreign banks. Nonsense, say the campaigners, they would only tax UK retail profits. Banks’ investment in the real economy has been dropping, as they pay growing sums to their shareholders.The crescendo of pre-budget lobbying is louder than usual: sadly a pro-tax demonstration is reported only in the Morning Star andthe Banker, while lobbyists threatening dire consequences from any new tax get good coverage. As every imaginable tax rise is rumoured, the chancellor is bombarded with warnings, the rightwing media venting more than usually at any posited increase.Gambling is the public’s most popular target. The Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) says a 50% taxcould raise £3.2bn. But the industry kick-back has been loud, calling Gordon Brown’ssupportfor the tax rise, “economically reckless”. The betting and gambling council warns40,000 jobs would go, while Betfred is threatening to close all 1,287 of its outlets. Its lobbying hit a peak this week when its spokesperson told the Commons treasury committee there was “no social ill” at all in gambling.Everyone knows property taxes are chaotically unjust, but tiptoe towards rebalancing council tax, and defenders of very expensive homes warn of calamity. A suggested tax on mansions worth more than £2m was “shrinking the economy quite dramatically and breeding a stagnant swamp” in the housing market,said a Sotheby’s estate agent. A mansion tax will force thousands of cash-poor, asset-rich pensioners to sell up,protests Knight Frank, though downsizing would probably improve their lives. Ignore estate agents’ warnings of millionaire flight,well debunkedby the LSE’s Prof Sam Friedman and by HMRC itself.Equalising national insurance on earned and unearned income is popular, but has landlords and letting agents up in arms. The rental market will collapse, they say, killing little landlords. Reforming business rates would revive high streets by charging big supermarkets and megastores more, and abolishing rates for local independents to fill empty shops. Good idea. But the supermarkets’ riposte to the chancellor warned they wouldraise food prices. That’s frightening.View image in fullscreenCampaigners wearing masks of top bank CEOs urge the government to raise bank taxes, on Westminster Bridge, London, 28 October 2025.Photograph: Jess HurdDon’t touch pensions, says the mighty pensions industry opposing speculation that everyone should get the same pension tax relief. Why do basic rate taxpayers get 20% added to their pensions by the state, while 40% and 45% taxpayers get those higher sums? Cutting the equally unwarranted 25% tax-free lump sum is greeted with the same indignation, setting off a 61% increase in pension withdrawalslast year. Don’t touch savings either. The tax-free Isa is reportedly under threatof reduction, and so it should be. None but the very wealthy have £20,000 a year to stash away.The chancellor is besieged by warnings that the slightest tax tweak will result in raising less not more from the wealthy, with any tax rise a dread danger to growth. Lobbyists may sense weakness in a government that has backed down and U-turned before. But listening to the public is no guide either. Dismalpolling by Persuasion UKfor the IPPR this week shows there is no popular way to raise the kind of money she needs to repair crippled services.The only taxes people currently back are for the rich, high earners, social media companies – but not “ordinary people”, not pensioners, small businesses, farmers or petrol car drivers. They do want to tax gambling, an exit tax for the fleeing rich, homes worth more than £2m, investments and, of course, banks. YouGov findsstrong supportfor a wealth tax on the rich, and virtually none for Tony Blair’s strange call this week to cut the top tax rate. Taxing “others” will not be enough, yet there’s no support for raising the three big universal taxes. However, note that breaking election pledges matters less than delivering visible improvement in people’s lives.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Fairness is the more popular pro-tax message, making the wealthy pay more and closing loopholes. But the grim reality is that no pro-tax message beats an anti-tax message. That means the chancellor just has to do what she thinks right. Close her ears to the cacophony of expensive lobbyists, and close her ears to the public too. This government’s contradictory messaging has left it late to rouse public opinion for collective contribution. She can only trust her own judgment as she will be vilified and savaged whatever she does. With her party sitting at 17% in the polls, what’s to lose?

But human behaviour is far scarier than human appearanceFri 31 Oct 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 31 Oct 2025 14.26 EDTShareThere is something sadomasochistic about being a horror fan with a disability. For as long as I can remember, I have been drawn to the intoxicating cycle of dread-terror-release that a genuinely frightening horror film can bring – the simultaneous feeling of “I hate this and want it to end” and “This adrenaline rush is making me feel fully alive.” But I have also come to expect certain tropes that I know will make me feel a different kind of dread, which other people in the cinema may not necessarily be attuned to.Guillermo del Toro’s handsomeadaptation of Frankenstein, which received a 15-minute standing ovation in Venice this August, powerfully makes the case that we ought not to be afraid of difference. However, given that the story is widely regarded as anallegory for disability, it is disappointing that the film stars only able-bodied performers and that a creature repeatedly referred to as “deformed” is portrayed by Jacob Elordi. While the creature is shown to be gentle despite his “obscene” appearance, the audience is heavy-handedly invited to conclude that “the real monster” is his creator, Victor Frankenstein (in case you hadn’t understood the book). Unfortunately the film then drives home the point about Victor’s moral degradation by making him increasingly disabled – in a departure from the original novel, he is given a prosthetic leg, facial scarring and amputated fingers. Del Toro may have adapted the book with a great deal of panache and visual flair, but he has not understood its most basic message.The portrayal of disability in film generally, especially horror, isfamously problematic. While physical beauty is often conflated with a character’s moral goodness, villains have historically beenassociated withdisability or disfigurement:facial scarring,wheelchair use,limb difference. Because of their physical limitations, the logic goes, these characters are likely to become embittered, jealous and calculating, leading to their nefarious deeds. Suffering here does not ennoble but turns people into scheming supervillains who wish to inflict pain on those around them out of malevolence and spite. Neurodivergence and mental illness areroutinely equatedwith violence and deviance.Over the years, progress has been slow but incremental. Film-makers are more cautious about making antagonists explicitly disabled – the BFI hasrefused fundingfor films that feature facially scarred villains – but the prejudice presents itself in subtler ways. A number of recent horror films centre around someone who “doesn’t look quite right”, featuring some variation of exaggerated facial features and ungainly proportions. Minor spoilers ahead: Longlegs (Nicolas Cage in prosthetics), The Substance(Demi Moore in prosthetics), Heretic (scary lady in the basement in prosthetics), Weapons (old lady in prosthetics). In Robert Eggers’ Nosferatu, the vampire’s hands were “custom made” to be “gnarly and weathered. ‘Arthritic’ was a word we looked at,”according toOscar-nominated makeup effects designer David White. Self-mutilation resulting in disability is another common trope: see Norwegian body horrorThe Ugly Stepsister, the mother in Luca Guadagnino’s Bones and All, Brendan Gleeson’s character in The Banshees of Inisherin. In Ari Aster’s Eddington, disability is presented askarmic punishment.View image in fullscreenChristopher Lee in The Wicker Man (1973).Photograph: British Lion/Studiocanal/AllstarIn her excellent International Booker-longlisted novelHunchback, Saou Ichikawa references The History of the Body, edited by Corbin, Courtine and Vigarello: “The ‘criminalisation of the gaze’ that took hold around the dawn of the 20th century had led to the decline of the freak show, which was subsequently replaced in popularity by the Monsters of Hollywood. Now, with costumes serving as an ethical cushion, people can enjoy ogling deformity without guilt or reserve.”What is perhaps more painful, and insidious, is the portrayal of disability in films not specifically in the horror genre but which trade in a sense of discomfort: arthouse films by respected auteurs, with less emphasis on gore or jump scares than on an undercurrent of psychological unease. In these films, a disabled actor (or an actor in prosthetics) will often appear at a crucial moment as a visual signifier heightening the level of eeriness in a scene. This has happened in some of the best films ever made: the mute, paraplegic girl in Andrei Tarkovsky’s Stalker (referred to as a “mutant”), the “dwarf serial killer” in Nicolas Roeg’s Don’t Look Now, “the disabled one” in Aster’sMidsommar, the gratuitous five-second shot of a facially scarred amputee gleefully clapping along at a Nazi event in Jonathan Glazer’s The Zone of Interest (a modern masterpiece, and one of the most important films of this century). In Yorgos Lanthimos’s remarkable Poor Things, Willem Dafoe’s prosthetics-assisted “deformed … scary face” (as it is describedin the screenplay) and Emma Stone’s character’s intellectual disability are not a sign of moral depravity but are nevertheless presented as “creepy and uncanny”. The saddest thing is that these are some of my favourite films. I have no wish to publicly criticise them, but feeling excluded from them is particularly hurtful.View image in fullscreenBilly Barratt as Andy and Sora Wong as Piper in Bring Her Back (2025).Photograph: Ingvar Kenne/PAIt is exhausting never seeing yourself on screen unless you are used as shorthand for the viewer to feel uncomfortable, akin to the sound of a creaking door or spooky ambient music. There is no shortage of terrifying horror films that don’t resort to othering people who look different: classics such asThe Haunting, The Wicker Man and George Sluizer’sThe Vanishing, and recent releases such as Get Out, Saint Maud, Presence and Sinners. In the Philippou brothers’ horrifying, wonderfulBring Her Back, the character of Piper is portrayed by Sora Wong, who has limited vision, a casting decision that brings depth and richness to the role. Piper is funny and smart and a little bit mean and not defined by her disability, which is never used as a way to evoke eeriness – while she experiences ableism at the hand of other characters, the audience is on her side.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Perhaps this is not something film-makers are doing consciously; viewers may not even notice it is happening. But watching films as someone with a disability can be a singularly lonely experience. Disabled people are hugely underrepresented in film and TV, making upjust 2%of the workforce, compared with an average of more than 20% across all other industries; onlythree disabled actorshave won Oscars (compared with25 able-bodied actorswho won Oscars for “cripping up”), and onlyone directorwith a physical disability, Crip Camp’s James LeBrecht, has ever been nominated. This means we overwhelmingly see ourselves through others’ eyes, often perpetuating harmful and outdated stereotypes.The solution – in both film and publishing – is to get disabled writers, directors, actors and creatives to tell our own stories in order to bring a diverse, authentic and meaningful perspective to representation. “Nothing about us without us,” the saying goes. But for the moment, most of us are on the outside looking in, waiting to see whether we ourselves are the monster.Kathryn Bromwich is a freelance journalist and a former commissioning editor and writer on the Observer New ReviewDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

They’re sick of pretending to be fine with relationships that are notFri 31 Oct 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 31 Oct 2025 04.43 EDTShareLily Allen was always an enviably cool girl.When she first burst on to the music scene nearly two decades ago at 21, it was with a breezy, don’t-care London swagger. Her songs concealed big, painful feelings under flippant, deadpan lyrics and deceptively sweet melodies, which made them easier to swallow. Even this summer, when she talked on her thrillingly unfiltered podcastMiss Me?about having lost count of exactly how many abortions she’d had, she sang the words to the tune of Frank Sinatra’s My Way.In the noughties, she seemed fearless, gettingparalytic at awards ceremoniesand picking publicbeef with Madonna. However, it looked as if she might be settling into a quieter life when she married Sam Cooper and had their two daughters, but within four yearsthey’d split up. You might not immediately have guessed, when she wrote in her memoir abouta fling with Liam Gallagher, that since childhood she’d been dreaming of “two point four children, living in the country”,as she told this newspaper. But now we know what was really going on underneath.Or do we? Her new albumWest End Girltells the story of – well let’s just say,anopen marriage gone sour, rather than necessarilyheropen marriage, since like Beyoncé and Taylor Swift before her, Allen carefully blurs the question of exactly how much is about her real-life split from her second husband David Harbour last year and how much is just pure creative licence. Whoever this musical alter ego really is, she starts the title track singing dreamily about settling with her husband into a New York brownstone and finding schools for the kids, but ends it uncertainly trying to convince herself that doing whatever it takes to keep him happy will somehow work out for the best. After that, it’s downhill all the way, as she comes sadly to realise that he hasn’t even stuck to their agreement to “be discreet and don’t be blatant”, and that trying to match him at his own game as a 40-something mother of two isn’t nearly as fun as it looks.Though the guessing game of trying to match these lyrics to real life events is obviously driving a lot of downloads, I don’t think that’s why women of all ages have spent the past week listening to the album over and over on repeat, quoting scraps of it in their group chats, and arguing about whether putting “ethically non-mongamous” on your dating profile is just a fancy new pseudo-progressive name for behaving badly. Allen seems to have tapped into a deep vein of female anger about having to pretend to be fine with something you’re not, for fear that otherwise you’ll look uncool or uptight – and then he’ll leave you.It’s clearly resonating with plenty of women her age, sick of being strung along on dating apps by middle-aged Peter Pans who never seem ready to have the conversation about being exclusive. But there’s something here too for younger women, secretly wondering whether the shattering of stigma around casual hookups or infidelity or various shades of kinky sex – while undoubtedly liberating for some – has made it harder for others to admit that they just want something vanilla. It’s music for women tired of pretending to be fine with situationships in which they never know where they stand; tired of having to be a cool girl who never complains or makes demands, tired of worrying that it sounds too needy or basic to say you want more commitment or would like kids one day.“I tried to be your modern wife,” Allen sings plaintively on Relapse, “but the child in me protests.” But is it really so immature to want some stability, especially if (as Allen’s by all accounts was) your own childhood was fairly chaotic, and especially once you have (as Allen does) children yourself?For this isn’t what sexual liberation was meant to feel like. It wasn’t supposed to mean squashing your own needs anxiously down to fit some man’s fantasy – whether that involves becoming a downtrodden tradwife or one-third of a throuple – while gamely pretending you want it just as much as he does. Revolutions are liberating only when the freedoms gained are genuine freedoms, not something more closely resembling an obligation in disguise. On the album, Allen sings about her daughters looking to her for lessons about love. Well, it turns out, she’s written one: and it’s not to be shamed out of asking for what you want, even – perhaps especially – if it sounds slightly boring.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistskip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She opens up about politics, monsters – and whether her teen romance scenes would be acceptable todayEmine SanerFri 31 Oct 2025 09.00 EDTShareIn the new thriller The Beast in Me, a memoirist takes on a sinister property developer who may or may not have killed his first wife, and it’s not entirely clear which of the two is more dangerous. It has been billed by Netflix as “cat and mouse”, butClaire Danesprefers to think of it as the more evenly matched snake and mongoose.“I liked the idea of a writer being truly dangerous, and predatorial,” she says of her character, Aggie Wiggs – grieving the loss of her young son and living divorced and alone in a big house she can’t afford – who develops a fascination with her new neighbour. Nile Jarvis (I can get on board with everything in the gripping eight-part series except, perhaps, just about every character’s name) is certainly monstrous, may also be a murderer, but might just have found his equal, because “she’s a real fighter, and she doesn’t have that much to lose”.When they meet, explosively, Aggie is riding the tail end of the success of a bestselling memoir, and running out of money. Her marriage collapsed in the aftermath of their son’s death in an accident, and Aggie’s behaviour towards the young man she believes was responsible has landed her with a restraining order. “I really grew to enjoy her company,” says Danes. “She’s in a lot of pain that she’s not fully admitting to herself, but I admired her mind, her intellectual integrity and her chutzpah and, ultimately, her depth of feeling.”View image in fullscreen‘They’re soul mates, but sex isn’t at play’ … Claire Danes as Aggie Wiggs and Matthew Rhys as Nile Jarvis in The Beast in Me.Photograph: NetflixAggie is experiencing writer’s block on her new book, a worthy analysis of the friendship, across the political divide, of the US supreme court justices Ruth Bader Ginsberg and Antonin Scalia. “I think it’s a story that could offer hope,” Aggie says, uncertainly, over lunch with Nile (Matthew Rhys), her sinister new friend. “No one wants hope,” he snaps back. “People want gossip and carnage.” Sadly, he’s not wrong, but then what we want and what we need are rarely the same thing. Try befriending a sociopath who may end up manifesting your darkest desires and see how that plays out (it’s not a spoiler to say: not ideal).Their dynamic is all the more fun, and refreshing, because there’s no romantic subtext – Aggie is a lesbian, but Nile is a rich sociopath so, of course, he thinks she wants to have sex with him. “They’re really excited by each other, and wrestling for power with each other, but they’re also genuinely delighting in each other,” says Danes, when we speak over Zoom. “They’re kind of soulmates, but they’re adversaries, and sex isn’t at play. That was interesting. I’d never played that, and I haven’t really seen it before.”Was she nervous about playing a lesbian character and how that might be perceived at a time when we question whether apparently straight people – Danes is married to the actor Hugh Dancy, with whom she has three children – should be taking queer roles? “Oh, that’s interesting,” she says. “No, I wasn’t, to be honest, but maybe I should have been.” Thoughtful and intelligent as Danes is, I can’t work out if she’s being a little disingenuous. But it was intriguing not to have to be considered “sexy” to a male character, probably for the first time in her career. As a girl, she says, “I had to learn how to cultivate and assume a more feminine affect”. She remembers consciously training herself to walk in a more alluring way. “And suddenly in this role, I felt I could let some of that go. I felt like my 11-year-old self, before I had to present in a particular way, and that was really enjoyable, quite freeing.”View image in fullscreen‘I wasn’t nervous about playing a lesbian, but maybe I should have been’ … Danes as Aggie Wiggs in The Beast in Me.Photograph: NetflixThere were parallels with Carrie Mathison, the CIA agent Danes played over eight seasons of Homeland, the role she is still best known for. “She definitely was a dangerous person who didn’t have much to lose, and was deeply isolated and super-brilliant. Carrie probably did use her feminine wiles a little more.” She laughs and adds: “But she was still in a pantsuit.”Could she imagine Homeland now, in the current political climate where TV networks are nervy in Trump’s America and politics moves ever faster? “I hope so,” says Danes. “I don’t know if another show was so committed to reflecting the political moment as it was happening as Homeland was, and that was really exciting.” She remembers spending a week with intelligence experts, “what I started calling spy camp”, before the writers went off to write each new season. “We would get a forecast. It was a great privilege, and a little TMI sometimes. I miss it. There was something wonderful about being able to metabolise what was happening, politically, and reflect and comment on it in this fictional work. I don’t have that means of expression any more.”She doesn’t think a Homeland-style show would be impossible to create today, though. “This is a funny metaphor that’s coming to mind, but if you want to wear a ballgown, wear a fucking ballgown. I think it’s a little like that. If you decide to make a show like that, you’ll make a show like that. I don’t know that Homeland was made because the climate allowed for it. I think that show was made because Howard [Gordon] and Alex [Gansa] wanted to make it.” On her own feelings about the state of politics in the US, she says carefully, “It’s scary. It feels very volatile, and I’m really sad about how frightened we are of each other right now. I’m sad about that, so many of us are distrustful of each other.”It was Danes, who is a producer on The Beast in Me, who brought Homeland producer Gordon in to get it made, after it stalled for a couple of years (she was sent the script during the pandemic by Jodie Foster, who at one point was going to direct). “It’s really the first time I’ve produced a project from the beginning, and that was wonderful, I loved that,” she says, then adds with a laugh: “That’s the nice thing about being old. I’ve made friends along the way, and I can turn to them to make something with me.”View image in fullscreen‘It was a little awkward, but it was OK’ … Danes with Jared Leto in My So-Called Life in 1994.Photograph: Studiocanal/AllstarDanes is obviously not old – she’s 46 – but has been working for decades. She grew up in Manhattan, with artistic parents, and discovered a love of acting and performing as a child. The family moved to California when Danes got the lead role of Angela Chase in teen drama My So-Called Life. Danes was 14, and the boy she was supposed to have a crush on was played by Jared Leto, who was 21, an age gap that these days would be considered vastly inappropriate. Did it feel awkward at the time?“A little, but it was OK,” she says. Everything was awkward then. “I had barely kissed a boy and here I was making out with this Adonis, and I didn’t even know how to interpret the stage directions. Like it said I was supposed to kiss his face, and I did not know what that meant. I didn’t know that there was any other terrain that one could explore.” It was strange she says, “circling these themes in real time. Two months later, what I was exploring as Angela would suddenly become personally relevant to me.” Teenagehood, she points out, “is so Kafka-esque. It’s a really wild ride, and there I was, having a parallel one as a fictional self.”But it never felt exploitative or damaging, she says. The people who created the show, including writer Winnie Holzman, “were bona fide benevolent grownups, so it was a very solid, sane environment. That was luck. Not every environment is.” But would she say it’s a good thing that we probably wouldn’t cast a 21-year-old man opposite a 14-year-old love interest now? “I really don’t know. We might, would we not? I honestly don’t know what my moral stance on that is. Maybe because it just was my experience, and I felt safe.” But working with intimacy coordinators now as standard is great, she adds. “How did we not have that before? I’m very for it. But it is funny to be working with an intimacy coordinator for the first time as a 45-year-old.” She smiles. “Like, it’s a little late.”View image in fullscreenYoung love … Danes with Leonardo DiCaprio in Romeo + Juliet in 1996.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library/AlamyDanes seems to have survived decades in the industry, apparently relatively unscathed. “I think it was good that I took a little time out and went to college,” she says. Around the height of her movie fame, having co-starred with Leonardo DiCaprio in the 1996 film Romeo + Juliet (she was 17 during filming, he was 21), she spent two years at Yale studying psychology.“My parents were always very present when I was on set as a kid,” she says, “and made sure I was protected and my needs were met, and I had a good tutor, and sufficient rest, that kind of thing.” Others looked out for her. Jodie Foster directed her when she was a teenager in the 1995 family comedy drama Home for the Holidays. What has she learned from the great Foster? “She said a lot of things, but she always has urged me to advocate for myself. And also to relax.”Mostly, Danes just really loves the work – everything else that comes with being a successful actor – the attention and awards – is, she says, “kind of just noise” even if what she describes as “the undulations of success” are what leads to more work. “I hope that people are connecting with what I’m trying to make, and I also hope that I have another chance at making another thing.” She laughs. “Like, that’s it.”The Beast in Me is on Netflix from 13 November.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionClaire DanesDramafeaturesShareReuse this content"

I’ve seen it numerous times and even though I know what’s coming, the stabbing knife synched with Bernard Herrmann’s score always freaks me out.More recently, I went through a phase of watching Japanese and Korean horror films. I had to stop watching them because they weren’t good for my heart condition, but none of them affected me like the Psycho shower scene. Music set to visuals intensifies the audio experience and other senses. Surrendering to the film-maker’s interpretation of what the sound represents holds you in a heightened state of expectation of the unexpected, which reallyisscary.View image in fullscreen‘Shivers down my spine’ … Cosey Fanni Tutti.Photograph: Chris CarterStephen O’Malley, Sunn O)))Abruptum – Evil (1991)I bought this infamous seven-inch from my friend Odin in 1992 – he was one of the first people to have DIY living room black-metal distros in the States. We didn’t know what this was or which speed to play it, 33rpm or 45rpm. It’s really messed up, demented, improvised doom/black metal saturated with agony and torture. There were lots of rumours and stories about their now deceased leader Tony Särkkä, known as IT, some of which have since been validated by Dan Swanö, the engineer. Back then, we heard it was a recording of someone named IT being tortured and electrocuted during the vocal sessions.There are always criticisms when black metal is exposed to the wider world but I believe darkness is infinitely deeper in the light – and the mainstream is far more messed up today than that obscure dungeon of a scene was in the early 90s.View image in fullscreen‘Cathartic’ … Witch Fever, with Amy Walpole, right.Photograph: Frank FieberAmy Walpole, Witch FeverSloppy Jane – Jesus and Your Living Room Floor (2021)I was drawn to Sloppy Jane’s album Madison because it was recorded in a cave. Jesus and Your Living Room Floor is open to interpretation, but I think it’s a song about loneliness and wanting to be remembered after you die. Some of the lyrics describe dying in really grotesque ways, but then there’s more mundane imagery such as a plastic horse.Having been brought up in a charismatic Christian church – essentially, a cult – until I was 16, I can relate to the religious aspects. I find the song cathartic. It’s a ballad, essentially, but dark, gothic and sad and I love the strange, underground atmosphere. I listen to it all the time.View image in fullscreen‘Deeply disturbing’ … Sparky’s Magic Piano (1947).Photograph: Records/AlamyStephen Mallinder, Cabaret VoltaireHenry Blair – Sparky’s Magic Piano (1947)This was part of a series of mini musical plays featuring a little boy, Sparky, who was trying to master the piano. I heard it when I was about five, more than a decade after it came out. The BBC used to run Children’s Favourites on Saturday morning radio, playing music that grownups felt kids would like, often 40s and 50s novelty tunes, which I found deeply disturbing. Even now they trigger a PTSD response.Sparky’s Magic Piano fascinated me and terrified me. When Sparky’s mother was out of the room, the piano would start talking to him in a voice produced by a Sonovox, a primitive vocoder. I think that was the catalyst for my ongoing preoccupation with manipulating voices, but as a five-year-old I was convinced it was a small boy trapped inside a piano for eternity.TheOGM, Ho99o9Herbie Hancock – Paint Her Mouth, from the Death Wishsoundtrack (1974)My dad was a big fan of action films, so I saw Death Wish when I was a kid. We lived in an urban environment that was kinda like the New York depicted in the film, with gangs, muggings and home invasions, so I could relate to it. To me that was much scarier than Halloween or Nightmare on Elm Street.Later on in life I stumbled across the soundtrack, and if you hear it in isolation, it’s truly chilling. Herbie Hancock’s a genius but what I love about this is he gets so much out of so little – like the little snare drum sound or minimalist synthesiser, an echo or some strings. It just feels like darkness, or like someone’s following you, so you need to clutch your purse or have your keys out when you get to your door.Tatiana Shmayluk, JinjerAgatha Christie – Опиум для никого (1994)When I was young, scary cartoons or movies didn’t scare me much. Then, after my older brother introduced me to rock music, I listened to this one afternoon in winter when my parents had gone to work and really got the chills. It’s Russian darkwave. The title translates as Opium for No One. It’s more gothic and melancholy than horrifying, but the words are really dark. “I paint my lips black with shoe polish … the stars shine beautifully at me and hell looks attractive.” Then: “Kill me, kill yourself, you won’t change anything.”At nine years old I didn’t know what it was about and painted pictures in my head. I was born in Russia but grew up in Ukraine, and in those countries in the 90s the music got pretty depressing. Now, I live in California. All my friends have left Ukraine, and when I call my mom, sometimes I hear bombing.Taylor Momsen, the Pretty RecklessJohn Williams–Main Title, Theme From Jaws(1975)I was 10 or 11 when I first saw Jaws and the film would not be what it is without John Williams’s theme. For me, it’s the king of horror themes because of its simplicity. With just two notes and slightly varying the velocity, it creates incredible anxiety. You sense that something is coming, and the two notes replicate the primal simplicity of the shark’s mind.The difference between Jaws and zombie or monster films is that the threat – a shark attack – is real. I love to swim. For a long time I had a house in Maine and would swim in the ocean for hours. God forbid, if that music’s in your head and something touches your foot you start to freak out. You can’t not think: “Shark!”View image in fullscreen‘Convincingly scary’ … William Von Ghould of Creeper.Photograph: Harry SteelWilliam Von Ghould, CreeperNick Cave and the Bad Seeds – Stagger Lee (1996)I remember bringing the Murder Ballads album home in my 20s and my housemate telling me to turn this track off because it was scaring him. Stagger Lee is sort of an update on an American folk ballad, but it’s nothing like the original. It’s extremely graphic, but the scary thing is that the villain is human. Cave is inhabiting a murderous character, but is very convincing. It’s got that crazy, violent line: “I’ll crawl over 50 good pussies just to get one fat boy’s asshole” – it’s probably more shocking now than it was back then. Like a great horror film, the song takes your breath away. We play with a lot of dark, Halloween-type bands but nothing’s as convincingly scary as this.Cassy Brooking (AKA Cassyette)Ethel Cain – Perverts (2025)Ethel Cain [AKA Hayden Anhedönia] came up on my Spotify and slowly seeped into all my playlists. Her album Perverts is the most scary modern music I’ve heard, and quite a departure from her previous stuff. The whole album is drone music, with minimal layers, but she lets each sound linger, which puts you on the edge of your seat.At first I had mixed feelings about it because it’s so genuinely creepy, but her music is infused with guilt and sin and takes you on a journey. It makes me feel deeply, like some sort of exposure therapy. The track Pulldrone reminds me of American Horror Story, one of my favourite TV series, and it’s got the creepiest voice, like a prayer. I love the album, but it’s so terrifying I still can’t listen to it the whole way through.Jamie Stewart, Xiu XiuDiamanda Galás – Schrei x (1996)In my 20s, a friend introduced me to the album Diamanda Galás did with Led Zeppelin’s John Paul Jones [The Sporting Life, 1994]. On the cover he’s driving a cool classic car and she’s leaning across the hood with an insane look on her face, holding a knife. From that moment I wanted to listen to her. To me she’s one of the most intense musicians in history, but Schrei x is her most extraordinarily relentless and frightening work. It’s a genuinely wild, feral music, all a cappella and live.View image in fullscreen‘Music as a flight of harpoons’ … Diamanda Galás.Photograph: Logan WhiteI’m amazed this gut-wrenching use of the human voice happened in a space, with people witnessing it. For a long time when I listened to it I was in disbelief. The other day I listened to it in the gym. It’s a funny record to listen to on the StairMaster.Diamanda GalásIannis Xenakis – Mycenae-Alpha (1978)This is the first sound work Xenakis created for the Upic computerised composition tool he developed to turn hand drawings into electronic music. As a Greek resistance fighter, he had half his face blown apart by shrapnel and was imprisoned many times. His music is ferocious and difficult to perform but extremely innovative.The violence in Mycenae-Alpha attracted me instantly. I realised the composer was a master warrior who used music as a flight of harpoons. I had been working on my first vocal pieces and had already performed Wild Women with Steak-knives (the Homicidal Love Song for Solo Scream) [which appeared on Galás’s 1982 debut The Litanies of Satan], so this work was a confirmation that I was headed in the right direction. An experimental singer needs to have 400 screams at her disposal, so Mycenae-Alpha can be a compositional model.The Mycenaeans were a Greek warrior elite. Their strategy in warfare was unparalleled and their massive walls and architecture were so formidable as to imagine their creation by the hand of a Cyclops. Mycenae-Alpha is as terrifying as the drawings from the giant hand that composed it.Sade Sanchez, LA WitchKrzysztof Penderecki–The Devils of Loudun (1969)This is an opera by a Polish composer based on Aldous Huxley’s book of the same title, which was based on real events in the 17th century. A load of nuns underwent mass hysteria and were all convinced that they were being possessed by demons. There were public exorcisms and people burned alive.The story alone is scary enough and you can hear it in the music, such as the way the main nun goes insane. It’s very cleverly done, with organ, flutes, vocal, a choir and crazy effects such as strange laughter and human noises. It’s not easy to listen to – it’s sung in German, it’s unsettling and spooky – but it’s also really beautiful. You really feel you’re experiencing the women’s despair, highs and lows.View image in fullscreen‘Mass hysteria’ … LA Witch, with Sade Sanchez, right.Photograph: Marco HernandezSpencer Charnas, Ice Nine KillsJohn Carpenter – Halloween soundtrack (1978)In terms of musical impact on horror cinema, John Carpenter’s soundtrack to Halloween is up there with Jaws and Psycho. When they were making Halloween, the film didn’t have a score and the reaction was very bland. John said a20th Century Fox executive told him: “There’s nothing scary about this movie.” Then, when it came out, the same executive called him and said it was tremendous, and John explained that all he had done was add the score.If you listen to Bernard Herrmann’s score for Psycho or Harry Manfredini’s for Friday the 13th, they’re orchestral. The Halloween score is very stripped down, usually no more than a synthesiser, but it’s really unsettling. It conjures up the fear of the unknown, or unseen; an unsettling feeling that something’s wrong.View image in fullscreen‘Unsettling’ … Spencer Charnas of Ice Nine Kills.Photograph: Awaiting credit infoTakiaya Reed, Divide and DissolveShostakovich String Quartet No 8 in C minor (1960)My father played this in the house when I was a child and I was terrified. Much later, I read about Shostakovich’s experience of going to Dresden in 1960 – one of the most heavily bombed cities in the second world war – and feeling the weight of genocide and fascism. He wrote this in three days, like an outpouring. I realised I’d been terrified as a child because I’d picked up a sense of dread or fear from what he was writing about. It has dynamics and energy as well as the power to make people weep. I still find it very moving and uncomfortable, but it’s great to feel.View image in fullscreen‘Diabolical smile’ … Johannes Eckerström, centre, with Avatar.Photograph: Johan Carlén‘Not many people in metal look like me’: Divide and Dissolve, the doom band celebrating Indigenous sovereigntyRead moreJohannes Eckerström, AvatarSumio Shiratori – Moomin soundtrack(1990)As a child I was always drawn to scary things, such as Michael Jackson’s Thriller video with zombies or reruns of The Addams Family or The Munsters, and I loved the songs. Nothing freaked me out like Moomin, the Japanese anime TV series of the Finnish children’s book. It was basically horror for children, featuring a weird ghostly figure called Mårran (the Groke), who radiated cold and had a diabolical smile. However, the author had a great respect for children’s intellect and used her to represent themes of loneliness and loss.The song worked a bit like the theme from Jaws – as soon as you heard the double-bass notes, you knew trouble was coming. The synthesisers are very of their time, but to hear it as a child was to be paralysed by fear. Much later, you reach a point where darker things stop being unpleasant and start to feel exciting.Creeper’s album Sanguivore II: Mistress of Death, Witch Fever’s Fevereaten and Avatar’s Don’t Go in the Forest are all released today (31 October).

You’ve gotta get mad at The Man,” a wise man (Jack Black) once said (in School of Rock). And in 2015, four 15-year-olds in Canberra watching the Richard Linklater film at a sleepover decided they wanted to do just that, forming a rock band the morning after that has become one of Australia’s most exciting acts: Teen Jesus and the Jean Teasers – a joke name suggested by one of their uncles that stuck.The four teenagers had enough punk brio that they were soon being booked to play venues they weren’t old enough to enter unchaperoned. Adults around them would assume they were in their early 20s, when they were actually 16 or 17.“Our parents would tag along and we’d have lemonade on the rider. We’d have our little school backpacks, then go to a pub to play a show – when you look back now it was really strange. We thought we were really cool,” laughs guitarist Scarlett McKahey, now 24.“To be fair, itwaspretty cool,” adds singer Anna Ryan, 24.View image in fullscreenAt their first gig they played Nirvana covers; only a few years later, they opened for the Foo Fighters.Photograph: Bec Lorrimer/The GuardianThey got bigger and bigger, but they still felt impostor syndrome; when huge crowds lined up to see Teen Jesus play at Brisbane’s Bigsound in 2018, “I was like, what are they lining up for? Who is playing after us?” says Ryan.Their 2022 EP Pretty Good for a Girl Band was named for the backhanded praise they often heard; it included the hitGirl Sports, inspired by Stephenson who, after knocking her teeth out in a skating accident, was told by a male dentist that she should “stick to girl sports”. (The chorus kicks off with the chant: “Fuck off, fuck off!)“It was meant to be ironic, because it’s obviously deeply offensive,” says McKahey, of the EP’s title. “But people would come up after that and be like, ‘You guys ARE pretty good for a girl band!’”“People would be like, ‘Oh my god, you guys ARE my favourite girl band,’” adds Ryan.“It backfired a bit,” sighs bassist Jaida Stephenson.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningTheir debut, 2023’s I Love You, was more polished, with the wistful anthem Salt and the catchy belter Ahhhh! winning them best breakthrough artist at the Aria awards. That same year, they opened for the Foo Fighters on their Australian tour. “Our managers called us and said, ‘Guess who’s playing with the Foo Fighters?’” McKahey recalls. “And we said, who?”At their first gig (at a school fete), they’d played Nirvana covers; now they were playing with Dave Grohl.“I had to completely disconnect. I had to treat him as a regular person, because otherwise I’d throw up,” Ryan laughs.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Bec Lorrimer/The GuardianTeen Jesus later opened for Pearl Jam on their Australian tour, then joined their US arena tour. “We’d never been backstage at a stadium before Fooeys – so by the time we were touring with Pearl Jam we were like, OK, we’ve done this before,” says McKahey. “And by the time we went to America, we knew how to play those roomsandwe also knew the band – which is a fucked thing to say about Pearl Jam!”Somewhere along the way, a high school band had become one of Australia’s most exciting rock acts. “We didn’t do this because we want to become the biggest band in the world or we want to become famous. It’s just fun playing shows with our besties. And I think that energy really shows in our music,” says Stephenson.Their new album, Glory, sounds a lot grander than anything they’ve done before; ​as ​punchy and contagious as the best of I Love You​, but with ​a darker, synthy sound. There is Balcony, a taunting banger that will be loved by Wet Leg fans, and the lovely Unscarred, which has echoes of the Cranberries. Listening to it made me feel oddly hopeful, basking in its confident vulnerability; they are still sticking it to The Man.“I’m done being someone you ignore,” Ryan sings on Unscarred. “Don’t bother calling me back, don’t bother calling me back.”A four way gif of film images“I feel like the gap between being 20 and 25 is actually huge,” says McKahey. “I’ve lived a thousand lives this past four years. We’re actual professional musicians now. We’re legit. And we went into this album with so much intention and knew exactly what we wanted it to look like … it’s really good and we’re really happy.”Glory was produced by Catherine Marks, an Australian producer who has also worked with Boygenius and Wolf Alice. (“She won a freakingGrammy,” says McKahey.) They all lived together for five weeks at the studio; sleeping, eating, jamming, watching Married at First Sight, then repeat – with Marks even monitoring what music they put on during trips to the supermarket – to shape the album’s ultimate sound.“It changed so much because of her. She really made it exactly what we wanted,” says McKahey.View image in fullscreen‘When we were younger, we were in the mindset of everybody else knows best, but now we know what is best for us,’ says Ryan.Photograph: Bec Lorrimer/The GuardianHas the music industry, and the world, moved on from the days when they were only “pretty good for a girl band?” “Kind of,” says McKahey. “I also think there’s been such a rise of conservatives who think women shouldn’t be able to get abortions, or work. There’s a lot of non-male music that’s really big, which is great. But there’s also the Charlie Kirks of the world.”Generally, they have found that the music industry is not so bad; Ryan’s expectation that it might be “this terrifying place where people are going to try and wrong me everywhere I go”, they admit, was largely shaped by Alvin and the Chipmunks. But the four have learned to stand their ground: “When we were younger, we were in the mindset of everybody else knows best, but now we know what is best for us,” Ryan says.The transition from being four friends in a high school band to a professional band who happen to be childhood friends can be delicate. But none of them can imagine anything else.“We’ve been in the band for so long that I don’t even really know what it would be like without it,” says McKahey. “We all speak this language that nobody else can speak. We know each other super well. When we’re touring, if someone’s having a bad day we all can read it enough to leave them alone and not take it personally.“That’s a big thing musically too – not getting offended if your idea doesn’t work. When we were 18, we were all a bit grizzly – because we were 18. Now, it’s so easy.”Suddenly, a new voice pipes up: their drummer, Neve van Boxsel, who has been mute the entire time.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This year’s event will open the doors to 57 buildings and spaces, contrasting new builds with treasured heritage sites.The scale model exhibition showcases seven decades of work in the field of hi-tech architecture, sustainable design, and striking civic structures made of glass and steel.The architecture firm this year designed thewinning national memorial to Queen Elizabeth II, a translucent bridge to be built in London’s St James’s Park, inspired by the diamond fringe tiara the late monarch wore on her wedding day.View image in fullscreenA model of the Parkline Place tower above Gadigal station, part of the Foster + Partners Civic Vision exhibition.Photograph: Alicia TaylorIt was also part of the Metro consortium, which designed five new train stations in Sydney thatwon the 2025 NSW architecture medallion.The Civic Design exhibition is the first of its kind in Australia, drawn from a majorNorman Fosterretrospective staged at the Centre Pompidou in Paris in 2023. Norman Foster founded Foster + Partners in 1967.Housed in the firm’s Sydney studios, the Parkline Place tower, a new 39-storey tower rising above Gadigal station, the exhibition features an array of scale models ranging from the 1980s Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank – a handbuilt construction of timber and metal – to a tiny, meticulously detailed model of theproposed new Old Trafford stadium, complete with 50,000 minute human spectators.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThese models are far more than an architectural marketing gimmick; they are a critical tool in the design process.“The model is a tool for understanding how a building will look and feel,” says Katy Harris, Foster + Partners’ London-based head of communications, who walked the Guardian through the exhibition earlier this week.“Architects have to think in 3D … that’s why physically making models is incredibly important to understand whether you have designed correctly.“But a tangible, three-dimensional model can also be essential for clients who don’t have those sensibilities of understanding a two-deep drawing or a plan. They can’t understand it. Give them a model, they get it.”Those 50,000 handmade miniature Manchester United fans were created specifically to help the client understand the scale and atmosphere of the proposed building, she says.View image in fullscreen‘Making models is incredibly important to understand whether you have designed correctly,’ Katy Harris from Foster + Partners says.Photograph: Alicia TaylorThe collection tracks the evolution of modelling, revolutionised by the introduction of 3D printing. But that hasn’t supplanted the role ofskilled human model makers– the firm still employs about 60 model makers.Viewing the world in miniature takes people back to childhoods spent making kit models and building with Lego, Harris says. The art of model making is more than just a professional tool; it is a universal language that allows anyone to grasp the sheer scope and complexity of the architect’s vision.The Stansted Airport (1991) model displays in miniature a watershed moment in infrastructure design; by putting all mechanical services underneath the concourse – effectively turning standard airport design upside down – the roof was freed up, allowing natural light to stream in and aiding passenger orientation, a concept Harris says has since been “copied by pretty much every new airport design around the world”.The model of Trafalgar Square in the heart of London demonstrates the dramatic impact ofa simple urban intervention– replacing a traffic-choked roundabout with a vast stepped pedestrian plaza – can transform public amenity.View image in fullscreen‘Architects have to think in 3D …’ One Shelley building at King Street Wharf in Sydney.Photograph: Charter Hall/Museum of History NSWA closeup view of the 30 St Mary Axe model, known to most Londoners as theGherkin, reveals a complex ventilation system, where spiralling bands of atria enable a natural flow of air, making it an early example of an ecological high-rise. The model, almost a piece of sculpture in itself, gives the viewer a level of detail that would be impossible to see or fully comprehend when looking from a distance at the building itself on the London skyline.At a local level, there is a model for Deutsche Bank Place, which with its distinctive offset core has been making its mark on the Sydney skyline for the past 20 years, and one of the new Parkline Place, illustrating the concept of transport-oriented development seamlessly integrating commercial towers with major transit hubs like Gadigal station.View image in fullscreenDeutsche Bank Place on Phillip Street, Sydney, designed by the internationally acclaimed architect Norman Foster.Photograph: Unspecified/Foster + PartnersThe Foster + Partners exhibition itself is a key stop in a broader Sydney Open program that celebrates the city’s architectural identity.Visitors to Sydney Open can also explore Bundarra in Surry Hills, Australia’s first external diagrid structure at One Shelley Street at King Street Wharf, as well as the new aerodynamic commercial tower 1 Elizabeth, integrated with the Sydney Metro Martin Place station.View image in fullscreenBundarra building in Surry Hills designed by Smart Design Studio.Photograph: Romello Pereira/Museum of History NSWThe conversion of the old Darlinghurst police station into Qtopia Sydney, the world’s largest centre for queer history and culture, has also been opened for visitors, as have the Sydney Observatory, the Mortuary Station, and the archaeological Parbury Ruins – a 1820s dockworkers home unearthed during the construction of a residential apartment block in Millers Point in 2000.View image in fullscreenParbury Ruins in Millers Point, discovered in 2000 during the construction of a residential apartment block.Photograph: James Horan/Museums of History NSWTheSydney Openday, where the greatest number of buildings are open to the public, is on Sunday 2 November, but other selected events will be running throughout November and DecemberThe Foster + Partners | Civic Vision exhibition is open to Sydney Open ticketholders from Sunday 2 November to 21 December, at the Parkline Place tower, level 2 MezzanineExplore more on these topicsArchitectureSydneyNew South WalesnewsShareReuse this content"

Inspector Morse: House of Ghosts is in Sheffield this week and Hercule Poirot in Death on the Nile reaches Northampton next week, with both shows on the road well into spring. DSI Roy Grace andDI John Rebusinvestigated deaths live last year.The latest telly cop to be let out of the box is DCI Barnaby who, in Midsomer Murders, has occupied ITV prime time for 28 years, an age that residents of the Hampshire-adjacent village here often need a lot of luck to reach.Writer-director Guy Unsworth starts with the first of Caroline Graham’s source novels, The Killings at Badger’s Drift, which also began the TV franchise in 1997. A horticulturist is found dead in her kitchen, leading Barnaby to overturn the local GP’s verdict of old age after interviewing shifty village eccentrics. On TV, British showbiz stalwarts each inhabit one oddball but three of Unsworth’s main cast of seven actors entertainingly play trios of suspects/victims, enjoyably swapping costumes and genders.All of the screen cops recently brought to stage have at some point filled ITV’s mid-evening, which is significant to the rhythms of these theatre nights. The downtown American murder rate of rural English Midsomer was partly due to another slaying being a good way of bridging the commercial break. Unsworth sensibly uses the interval to the same end and gives great fun with a stage equivalent of TV’s easy cutting, actors sliding in on trucks and Julie Legrand at one point playing two characters almost simultaneously.View image in fullscreenHomicidal panto … John Dougall and Nathalie Barclay in The Killings at Badger’s Drift.Photograph: Manuel HarlanWhile Midsomer Murders is essentially harmless entertainment, there was a scandal and production reboot in 2011 whena producer suggestedthat the series offered viewers a haven from multiculturalism. Unsworth seems quietly to acknowledge this when DS Troy, played by the British-Filipino actor James Bradwell, doing plucky work in an underwritten part, suffers some othering from Badger’s Drift bigots.Daniel Casey, following John Nettles and Neil Dudgeon as TV’s Barnabys, gamely copes with being the straight man among wits and twits. Generally loving towards its source, the adaptation is occasionally lethal, as in an allusion to how Barnaby’s annual appraisal with the chief constable might go, given the body-count on his patch. Another daring touch is verbal; the words “Constable”, in the police sense, and “Picasso”, in its art meaning (paintings are central to the subplot), are delivered in ways that would have ITV up before the regulator.Going for jokes even more than the TV show – particularly in the transposition of English countryside with behaviours from Greek tragedy – Unsworth might be daringly exploring a new genre of homicidal panto. But, as crime stories and cross-dressed comic grotesques are British theatre’s core winter forms, this may be the way to a financial killing. If you don’t watch the TV series, only book a ticket over your dead body but, for fans of the programme, there will be huge pleasures on a tour of the UK and Ireland that, fittingly, continues almost until next midsummer.AtRichmond theatre, London,until 1 November,then touringExplore more on these topicsTheatreTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

She talks about the genre’s toxic fans, welcoming new boy Liam Hemsworth to the cast – and what sorcery really sounds likeFri 31 Oct 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 31 Oct 2025 10.19 EDTShareIt is a bittersweet day for Anya Chalotra. On the one hand, The Witcher, the fantasy epic in which she has played super-sorcerer Yennefer of Vengerberg since 2018, is about to return for a fourth series. All the hard work she and hundreds of others have done can finally be seen by millions of fans worldwide. The cast and crew wrap party is due to take place a few hours after we speak. It’s an exciting time for the actor. But on the other hand: “I wrapped The Witcher for good yesterday,” Chalotra says. “So forgive me if I can’t string a sentence together. It’s all very odd … I cried a lot.”Refreshingly for a big-budget fantasy show, The Witcher will bow out with its story complete, rather than at some dissatisfying midpoint due to an unceremonious cancellation. And though viewers will be seeing a final season of monsters, magic, mages, swords, skulduggery and swearing next year, the final two seasons were filmed back to back, meaning after the evening’s shindig, that’s that. The job that has taken over Chalotra’s life for so long, and the people who go with it (besides one high-profile absence, which we’ll touch on later), is finally over.The Witcher: Blood Origin review – this profanity-packed fantasy is a riotRead more“I was 23 when I started,” Chalotra, now 30, says. “It’s been a long time. I think the most emotional I got was when I was sat there yesterday watching everyone work. Just in my chair, drinking a cup of tea. You know these people … everyone worksso hardon the show. Eight months of a year for seven years. I’m going to miss everyone’s faces.”It has been a long journey, for the actor and the character. The Witcher began as a series of short stories and novels by Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski about monster hunter for hire Geralt of Rivia, which then became a hugely successful video game franchise before Netflix brought Sapkowski’s world to TV. Chalotra’s character begins the tale as a 14-year-old peasant girl, abused by her parents because of her physical deformities, who eventually becomes the ass-kicking mage, military leader and love of Geralt’s life we know today. When Chalotra was cast, she thought it important to do her research, playing the games and getting stuck into the books, of which she remains a fan: “When I was going back to the books this season, there’s someremarkablelines. Someincrediblequotes. It’s so grounded for a fantasy.” She carried that groundedness over to the way she played Yennefer, making burning thousands of soldiers to a smouldering crisp with apocalyptic flame spells or the quiet grief of learning she was unable to have children equally plausible. It’s a fine balance, not easy to strike.Chalotra was born in Wolverhampton, her father from India and her mother from the Midlands (the mention of which elicits a hoot of “Midlands! Yaaaaay!”). “I was a middle child,” she laughs, considering why she thinks she became an actor. “I don’t need to say any more!” But she pinpoints her mixed heritage as a huge element of her desire to perform: “I watched a lot of Bollywood as a kid. I loved musicals, film, watching very different experiences of people on stage, on screen. Because I only had my own experience, coming from quite a strict upbringing. So I was so curious about other people’s lives. Wanting to find out more about why someone is the way they are, their culture. I was very heavily influenced bymyculture. And I think I was just interested in how people were created.”My first season, there was a lot of fan negativity … I learned that it can be quite intenseA desire to use acting to find out what made her and the people around her tick led Chalotra to the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, and then to the Guildhall School of Music & Drama. “There was nothing else that came into my head that I wanted to do,” she says. “I didn’t think it was possible until about 17 years old when I got in and I realised that my family were going to support me. And going to London from Wolverhampton. That was a huge shift.”That commitment paid off quickly. Not long after graduating, she was nominated for a Stage Debut award in a Globe production of Much Ado About Nothing in 2017, and then in 2018 starred with Toni Collette in the BBC’s Wanderlust, and John Malkovich and Shirley Henderson in Agatha Christie adaptation The ABC Murders. “Shirley Henderson, Toni Collette, John Malkovich,” she lists. “That’s it – I’m happy. I was so curious, I almost didn’t want to do any work. They’redoingit in front of you. You’re so close. I just wanted to watch them.”View image in fullscreenUnder the spell … Anya Chalotra.Photograph: Rachell SmithIt was shortly afterwards that Chalotra was cast in The Witcher, and everything changed. It was her first taste of the intensity of geek culture, for better and for worse. The third Witcher game, considered one of the greatest of all time, has sold in excess of 60m copies worldwide; the books more than 15m by the time Chalotra took the role. Season one of the show in 2019 broke Netflix’s records as its most-watched debut series ever up to that point. That’s some enthusiastic fandom. “I was chucked into it,” Chalotra says. “A baptism of fire. Daunting, but so thrilling.” Sadly, as with many women of minority ethnic backgrounds cast in popular franchises, a small yet vocal corner of the internet protested her involvement on the grounds of her having the temerity not to match the exact image of the character each individual fan had in their heads. “I’m not on social media. I stopped,” says Chalotra. “I haven’t been on it for a long time. The first season, for me … there was a lot of negativity. A lot of positive as well, but obviously the negative … This was one of my first jobs. It hit me hard. I learned very quickly that it can all be quite intense.”Eight months filming a year for seven years was also intense, though the bulk of it took place at Longcross Studios in the UK. “We try to travel as much as we can,” she says, but handily, at least for budgetary reasons, the studio’s surroundings have “a lot of green”, and when a different type of green is called for, they do “a fair bit of filming in Wales”. This at least allowed Chalotra, who lives in London, to retain some semblance of normality when off the clock. “But even when you are filming here, you don’t get much downtime,” she says. “And so those moments, when you do come off set and get home, you want to keep to yourself anyway. I get home and eat something and have a shower, kind of like washing off Yennefer. Eight months is such a lot of a year to be in the headspace of a character. You go in the next day and you’re doing the same thing. I have had to learn so many tools to try to separate myself from this job. I have found that really tough, and continue to.”For these final two seasons, there was also the added complication of the show’s previous Geralt, Henry Cavill, departing after season three due to the time constraints of filming and different ideas about how his character should be portrayed than those of the showrunners. Into his gruff shoes steps Liam Hemsworth, who brings a new vulnerability to the baritone badass, which does the character no harm whatsoever. When Cavill left, did Chalotra think that could be the end of the show? Another fantasy epic left half-finished on the scrapheap of cancellation?View image in fullscreenLook sharp … Mecia Simson and Anya Chalotra in the new season of The Witcher.Photograph: Netflix“No, actually,” she says. “I think I always knew we’d all continue. With the love for the material, we knew that it was going to go again. I was excited to see where Yennefer went, that’s for sure.” The cast and crew were also eager to make Hemsworth feel welcome – Chalotra is adamant no hazing rituals or ribbing of the new boy occurred. “We didn’t want to be too intense,” she laughs. “We just wanted to make space for Liam. He understands people. He understands this world. He was able to come in so naturally. It was really easy.” (Hemsworth himself has rather sweetlydescribed the experienceas being like “changing school halfway through the year”.)For one day more, at least, Chalotra seems happy to still be very much in Witcher World. She describes the previous day of filming, and how when casting spells, even after seven years, she still makes “Whoosh!” and “Fzzzzzt!” noises when performing the hand gestures. “You’ve got to, right?! Someone’s always saying: ‘Anya, now can we do a take without the sound effects?’ Fine, I’ll try!”She is tight-lipped about her next projects, and says “the next stage of my life is about rewilding”, though she is set to star alongside Ralph Ineson and Euphoria’s Chloe Cherry in the dark thriller Two Neighbors, which played at this year’s Edinburgh film festival. She is also about to go straight into a “short period of filming”, though insists “it doesn’t mean that I won’t be grieving Yennefer. We’re all just so connected by these seven years. I think we’ll be trying to distil this experience for a long time. And what will always be a constant is how much we love and respect the people who were next to us doing it.”Nevertheless, it’s time to step off the juggernaut, and Chalotra is reflective. “This character’s in me and I’ve let her go. So it’s not sad at all really, it’s a new beginning.”But first, there’s the small matter of the wrap party. You can’t help but think she’s earned it.The first episode of season four of The Witcher is on Netflix from 30 October.Explore more on these topicsFantasy TVTelevisioninterviewsShareReuse this content"

But there are plenty of things he draws the line at …Imogen TildenFri 31 Oct 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 31 Oct 2025 04.21 EDTShareAkey plot point of The Choral revolves around Roger Allam singing badly. This is the man who originated the role ofJavert in Les Misérablesback in 1985, who was Olivier-nominated for his performance inCy Coleman’s musical City of Angelsand who once contemplated a career as an opera singer.Talk me through that, I say: the bad singing. We’re at his home in southwest London. He’s very busy, filming, but a small window of time was found to meet – did I mind coming to his house? No, of course I didn’t, and here I am on a blustery Monday morning, perched on a chair next to him, sat in the corner on the sofa in a comfortable but anonymous front room looking on to a leafy street.“Well, I’m slightly relieved,” he says with a laugh. “The part in Gerontius” – that his character attempts to sing – “is the tenor solo, which is endless and terribly difficult and very high. And I – as you hear – have a baritone voice, quite a low one as well. And I haven’t sung for about 15 years. And so I was rather glad that it had to be bad!”The Alan Bennett-scripted film, directed by Nicholas Hytner, is set in 1916 in a Yorkshire factory town on the cusp of huge societal change, hollowed out by grief as its young men die in foreign fields. The choral society is at the heart of this community, but even there it’s far from business as usual: Bach’s St Matthew Passion is verboten (German music). There’s a new chorus master. And so urgent is the need for new singers, they might have to look beyond the ranks of the respectable middle-classes. Allam plays the gentle local mill owner, who funds “the choral”, and so finds a way to assuage his own grief.It’s full of glorious period detail, wit and subtle wisdom, and Elgar’s oratorio The Dream of Gerontius plays a starring role. Allam’s only prior experience of the piece had not been positive. “Not long before we started filming there was a performance in London I went along to and I’m afraid to say I found it rather boring,” he admits. “But singing it was tremendously exciting.”View image in fullscreen‘I found the chorus passages terribly moving’ … Allam, far left, in The Choral.Photograph: Nicola Dove/SonyFor the most part, it’s the actors themselves whose voices we hear. “The chorus passages I found terribly moving: the effort of singing all together and trying to make it good. My father was a vicar, so I was in his choir, and one at school, and I toyed with the idea of doing classical singing at university. Music and singing have always been a part of my life.”One of the splashiest turns in the film is Simon Russell Beale’s cameo as an inordinately pompous Elgar who, on realising this amateur choral society has rearranged and reimagined his work, retracts his permission for the performance. Does Allam know if there is any truth in Bennett’s script? Can the composer really have been, quite frankly, such a git?“I don’t know!” he says. “I think maybe Elgar was a bit pissed off that he wasn’t as revered as he thought perhaps he should be. The first performance of Gerontius had gone really, really badly. I guess it’s understandable if he pushed back at that. But as to his ‘gitacity’ – I’m not qualified to say.”View image in fullscreen‘It made people feel like they were good people; morally good for being in sympathy with the characters’ … Allam, far right, in Les Misérables (1985).Photograph: Donald Cooper/AlamyWe move to a character whose gitacity is unambiguous: Javert, the villain of Les Misérables, now back in the public eyeas the musical celebrates its 40th birthday. Allam was asked to be involved in the celebrations, he says, but wasn’t free. Did he, then a young RSC actor in his early 30s, have a sense of the phenomenon that the show was going to be?“No! The reviews were very mixed although there were some people who really loved it from the get-go. When we opened at the Barbican, it felt too long. Transferring into the West End, some bits were taken out. And straight away it was full all the time.” To what does he attribute its huge success? “It is a kind of feelgood musical in the sense it made people feel like they were good people; morally good for being in sympathy with the characters. It works the same way big spectacular melodrama works: it stirs you.”Likewise Game of Thrones, in which Allam sported a magnificent beard with Viking-style plaits. “I’m hardly in it!” he protests. “I’d just been doingFalstaff at the Globe” – for which he won an Olivier award – “so I was completely broke. It was only a couple of episodes. But it inflated the bank balance enough to get through the year.”He hadn’t seen a second of the show until the pandemic, when he and his younger son resolved to sit through the whole thing. “And some of it’s absolutely brilliant! There’s one battle scene which is just marvellous, makes you realise what a terrifying species we can be. And some of it’s just shit!”View image in fullscreen‘Some of it’s shit!’ … Allam in Game of Thrones.Photograph: HBOAllam is, as you might expect, wonderfully unfiltered. A little like one of his best-known creations, The Thick of It’sPeter Mannion: a suave but beleaguered Tory MP, and the stuff of athousand memes. “They were such glorious scripts,” he smiles of the show, whose 20th anniversary falls this year. “It was the beginning of that time – which is still going on – when politics seems to have become just about making announcements. As long as you can make announcements and get a bit of attention …”What does he think Mannion would be doing now? “Oooh, some shady business somewhere. Feathering his own nest as much as possible. But I don’t think he’d be joining Reform.”That’s the show he’s recognised by young people for – though for those younger still, it’s the charming CBeebies animation Sarah and Duck, for which he provides friendly voiceover. “On the train into town I sometimes get parents coming up to me saying thank you, because it was the only thing that would get their child to sleep, or asking me if I’d mind saying ‘Happy Birthday, Chloe’ in my Sarah and Duck voice.”Does he mind? “No, of course not! It’s sweet. It’s not like I’m being pursued down the street by rabid mothers with pushchairs.”Another voice role that sees him held in huge affection is Radio 4’sCabin Pressure, written by the comic genius John Finnemore. “That was a joy to do,” he says. Does he have a favourite episode? He reflects. “I do love otters.” He means Ottery St Mary, in which, among other things, his character, Douglas,explains the origins of the name of the Devon town, and he, Benedict Cumberbatch’s Martin and Finnemore’s Arthur consider how many hypothetical otters could be fitted into a small plane.I’d feel uncomfortable going on television and just being me. I wouldn’t like that at allMany of the roles Allam has played lean into his appeal as a languid middle-class sex symbol, quick of wit but large of heart. It’s that come-to-bed voice, perhaps, which is the clincher: deep, rich and smooth. In 2010’sTamara Drewehe was an oleaginous crime novelist who romanced Gemma Arterton – and ended up trampled to death by cows, and in French farceBoeing-Boeinghe juggled three separate fiancées. Radio 4’s ongoing Conversations from a Long Marriage sees him as Joanna Lumley’s exasperated but loving husband as the two discuss friends’ divorces, descaling kettles and whether it’s reasonable to expect dancingandsex on the same night.Yet despite this distinctive persona, Allam is not at ease as simply himself, he says. “I’d feel uncomfortable going on television and just being me. I wouldn’t like that at all.” Bookers for Celebrity Traitors or Bake Off should try elsewhere; even panel shows are not his bag, he says, despite his manifest gift for comedy and brilliant delivery of one-liners. “No, I’d hate that. I’d be no good.”It’s telling, too, that he feels most kinship not with those roles one might assume most closely mirror the real-life man, but with DI Fred Thursday in the Inspector Morse prequelEndeavour. “Having played a lot of sneery middle-class bastards, I was immediately attracted to the character because this was more from my actual family background – working class. One grandfather was a labourer on a building site, the other was a stonemason,” he says.View image in fullscreen‘Absolutely someone of my parents’ generation’ … Allam with Shaun Evans in Endeavour.Photograph: KUDOS/Itv“Thursday is absolutely someone of my parents’ generation. My mother was born in 1912, my father in 1914, his brother Fred was born in 1916. Playing him was an opportunity to explore and remember the 1960s and the lives of people like my own family.”The Choral, too, taps into this interest in the past lives of everyday people who coalesce to make beauty amid hardship. “Singing in a choir is a way of bringing communities together. Art and music, drama – these are the things we do best. And we don’t kill each other in our millions over it.”He pauses. “It made me think maybe I should join a choir or have some lessons and see where my voice is … if it still exists in some form.”The Choral is in UK cinemas from 7 November, US cinemas from 25 December and Australian cinemas from 1 January 2026.Explore more on these topicsFilmRoger AllamTelevisionAlan BennettMusicalsFirst world warfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What willJonathan Rossbe wearing?Since the hit show started in 2022, it has been the hostClaudia Winklemanwhose kilts, oversized knitwear and dramatic sweeping coats have drawn attention. This time around Ross has had the cast and the nation gripped until the very last second of his banishment. Over the past three weeks, the broadcaster has appeared in everything from dapper tailoring to an 80s Top Gun-esque jumpsuit. There have been snazzy cravats, oversized aviator sunglasses and dramatic fuzzy stoles. At one point he even paid homage to Winkleman’s signature style by sauntering around the castle in a tweed cape and fingerless leather gloves.View image in fullscreenJonathan Ross styles it out in an air force inspired outfit on Celebrity Traitors.Photograph: Euan Cherry/BBC/Studio LambertThroughout his career, on-screen and off, the 64-year-old has been known for his eccentric personal style. Ever since he burst on to screens in 1986 as the host of the late night TV chatshow The Last Resort, a jazzy oversized suit has been his signature. So while no one expected Ross, who once wore a blue checked Jean Paul Gaultier tailored skirt suit to a Pulp Fiction premiere in 1994, to start dressing like a member of the Labour party, his decision to ramp up his outlandish style as a Traitor did come as a surprisebecause remaining inconspicuous is key. In previous seasons of the civilian version of the show contestants such as Paul Gortontried to go under the radarin unremarkable jeans and T-shirts and the ex-army engineer Harry Clark leant into a “softboi” persona in flannel shirts and a pearl necklace.The fart that could save TV! Why Celebrity Traitors is all about Alan Carr v Celia ImrieRead moreDr Dion Terrelonge, a fashion psychologist, thinks of Ross’s look as a costume. “In a game that is all about perception, Ross seemed to lean into his personal style even more so than he tends to do in his everyday life,” he said. Terrelonge believes Ross’s looks contributed to the Faithfuls’“big dog” theorywhere they were convinced it was either him or Stephen Fry leading the Traitors pack. “He went on a show where usually the simplest strategy used is to try to blend in,” Terrelonge says. “But by dressing in an attention-grabbing way, Ross purposefully chose to stand out. Sometimes when people dress in that way it is used to signal status. It says ‘I am a leader’ and ‘I am going to do things my way’. It was risky. It could have made him much more vulnerable just because he physically stood out.”View image in fullscreenJonathan Ross leant into his reputation for big, bold outfits on the show.Photograph: Euan Cherry/BBC/Studio LambertWhile the cast were assigned a stylist, Ross plotted his looks himself, choosing pieces from his vast personal wardrobe. In a post-show interview, he explained he had packed even more unconventional pieces – including a full goth look – that he never got a chance to wear.Of course, only the viewers at home knew that Ross was truly a Traitor. As a result, his wardrobe performed in the same way as his treacherous behaviour to the other cast members. That aforementioned jumpsuit and Ray-Ban aviators look alluded to Tom Cruise’s “Maverick” hero and created a sort of Faithful energy as Ross pushed a two-and-a-half-tonne Trojan horse up a hill with his fellow celebrities.While under the cover of darkness, Ross donned a velvet cloak to carry out his killings, by day his jovial tweed cape evoked the gentle detective Sherlock Holmes as he pretended to help the Faithfuls determine who was deceiving them. All that was missing was the deerstalker hat. His homey knitwear also helped to mislead players as he captured the aesthetic of cosy crime films such as The Thursday Murder Club. Would a ruthless killer really wear a fuzzy leopard print cardigan and caramel corduroy trousers to breakfast in the morning?Clare Baldingdidn’t seem to think so when she compared that particular look to the cast of the Flintstones. “Yabba, yabba don’t,” quipped Alan Carr in response.View image in fullscreenCould a Traitor wear leopard print and corduroy? Ross’s fellow contestants couldn’t be sure.Photograph: Euan Cherry/BBC/Studio LambertBut for every innocent guise there was a more undeniably faithless look. In a post-show interview, the comedian Lucy Beaumont, who was murdered by Ross face to face, said on reflection she could not believe her and her fellow faithfuls didn’t decipher Ross was a Traitor from his clothing alone.The stylist Peter Bevanpoints to checked tailoring as “Bond baddie coded” and compares the black furry stole Ross wore to Paloma Faith’s funeral to Cruella de Vil. “Even though his clothes are naturally quite eccentric, it felt like he hammed up the bad-guy persona intentionally,” Bevan says.View image in fullscreenCruella de Ross? Some feel the broadcaster’s love of costuming hastened his downfall.Photograph: Euan Cherry/BBC/Studio LambertHowever, even when Ross was aware he was coming to his demise, he remained defiant, choosing to wear an attention-grabbing Kermit green blazer to attend what would be his last round table.

She said: “A living wage and the ability to feed oneself and their family shouldn’t be up for debate.”Keith Rosson, whose latest novel Coffin Moon was released earlier this month, was the first to take action, saying: “A reader informed me that BL librarians were striking, and I looked into it, notifying the other participants. While I’m entirely confident that the British Library and their employees will reach a meaningful resolution, I have profound respect for librarians as a profession – I dedicated a recent novel to them – and won’t cross a picket line.”The strike began on Monday and runs until 9 November, with 300 members taking part. “Their key demand is for an inflation-proof pay rise with restoration, after a second consecutive year of a real-terms pay cut. In a recent survey of British Library [staff] members, we found that most struggle each month to make ends meet,” A PCS spokesperson said.“While the British Library initially proposed a pay award of 2%, with some receiving as little as 1.6%, they have since increased the offer to 2.4%, which is still way below inflation, citing rising costs across the board including energy bills and building materials. Workers at the British Library are fed up. It’s no wonder that the PCS ballot returned a result of 98% voting in favour of strike action on a turnout of 75%.”A British Library spokesperson said: “The British Library has been notified of planned strike action at our London site … We plan to keep all our buildings open during this time with our building opening hours unchanged. We will be operating a reduced service and there may be significant disruption and reading room closures at short notice. Full details about the impact of the strikes can befound on our website.”Explore more on these topicsBooksBritish LibraryLibrariesnewsShareReuse this content"

Its new venue remains in Wiltshire, at nearby Neston Park in Corsham.“It immediately felt to us like a warm and welcoming home into which we could sink our roots,” Gabriel said.“In a world in which many bad actors seem to be achieving power by fanning the flames of hatred, racism and division, a meeting place for all the world’s cultures and dreams, built on mutual respect, seems all the more precious,” he added.Womad is an acronym for World of Music, Arts and Dance, and it has one of the broadest musical remits in the British festival scene. Artists tend to span pop, dance, folk, jazz, hip-hop and beyond, and are drawn from a diverse range of global nations.Neston Park is a stately home owned by Sir James and Lady Venetia Fuller: James is one of the family board members for Fuller’s brewery, and Venetia is an entrepreneur. “This will be the first time we’ve opened the estate to any type of event and Womad’s message and what it stands for is something we’ve long admired,” they said in a joint statement.The festival began in 1982 in Shepton Mallet, moving to near Reading between 1990 and 2006, followed by Charlton Park.Explore more on these topicsWomadFestivalsMusic festivalsWiltshireShareReuse this content"

Butler and Chassagne married in 2003, and a year later the band released its epochal debut album, Funeral.In 2022,multiple women accused Butler of sexual misconduct. An investigation by Pitchfork found four people, aged between 18 and 23 at the time, who alleged sexual assault, unwanted sexual messages, requests for explicit videos and using his fame to pursue young fans.At the time Butler said that his extramarital encounters were consensual: “It is deeply revisionist, and frankly just wrong, for anyone to suggest otherwise.”He apologised “to anyone who I have hurt with my behaviour”, adding: “I am continuing to learn from my mistakes and working hard to become a better person, someone my son can be proud of ... I’m sorry I wasn’t more aware and tuned in to the effect I have on people – I fucked up, and while not an excuse, I will continue to look forward and heal what can be healed, and learn from past experiences.”Chassagne stood by Butler in 2022, saying in a statement: “I know what is in his heart, and I know he has never, and would never, touch a woman without her consent and I am certain he never did,” she said. “He has lost his way and he has found his way back. I love him and love the life we have created together.”Arcade Fire has released just one album after the allegations, this year’s Pink Elephant, which received lukewarm reviews and failed to break the US Billboard 200 – their previous five albums reached the US Top 10, with three of them scoring No 1s.Explore more on these topicsArcade FirePop and rocknewsShareReuse this content"

After the riotously gory Novocaine comes Companion, which is either a violent sci-fi or an extremely accurate representation of what life will be like 30 years from now. Quaid plays Josh, a “nice guy” who starts to have trouble when his sexbot jailbreaks itself. On one hand, Companion is a film about the consequences of coercive control; on the other, it’s a chilling warning about what will happen when the AI we use realises we aren’t very polite to it.Stuart HeritageCrawl (Alexandre Aja, 2019), 1.25am, Channel 4Viewers aren’t exactly wanting for horror movies this Halloween, but if you’re looking for something under the radar that delivers actual scares, Crawl is the movie for you. Ingeniously, Alexandre Aja’s film largely takes place in the crawlspace under a home. Upsettingly for those stuck in it, it is absolutely brimming with alligators. It’s a delicate balance, wringing maximum jeopardy out of the premise without becoming preposterous, but Crawl hits it confidently. Happily, a sequel is on the way … though how they up the ante from this is anyone’s guess.SHLive sportFA Cup football: Luton Town v Forest Green Rovers, 7pm, TNT Sports 1First-round tie of this year’s competition at Kenilworth Road.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV tonightThe Walking DeadAlan PartridgeSteve CooganGraham NortonScience fiction and fantasy filmsHorror filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

His 10th collection is informed by depression and the recovery from it: “if only some idea / could find its way / through enemy territory / then I’d at last begin / to look up at the sky”. His lyrics still meander down the page, but linguistic fireworks have been replaced by language that is straightforward, unadorned and more affecting for it. This also gives his reflections on the recent shifts in Northern Irish history and politics more bite. But it’s in its more private moments that the book really shines: “Heed my cadences then and live only for now. / Don’t ever bother about tomorrow. / Just pluck, today, life’s full-blooded roses”.View image in fullscreenForetokensby Sarah Howe (Chatto & Windus, £12.99)Ten years since winning the TS Eliot prize with her debut Loop of Jade, Howe’s second collection is a reaffirmation of the keen, probing intelligence and ability to layer telling detail that underpins her poetry. Taking on the biggest of subjects – genetics, time’s relativity, becoming a parent – as well as re-examining her mother’s occluded history in Hong Kong, there is now an anger in Howe’s tonal range, which brings a pleasing sharpness to her investigations: “child of a hoarder / I am not immune / to this mania this malaise / this inherited dream / of an archive / so complete nothing / could ever hurt again”. Foretokens is a quite brilliant return.Maryvilleby Joelle Taylor (Bloomsbury, £14.99)Taylor’s latest takes the four butch lesbian characters we met in the TS Eliot-winning C+NTO & Othered Poems, and expands into a sweeping, 50-year history of lesbian culture and LGBTQ+ rights. Maryville is framed as a television series because, as Taylor says, “I want you to see us”. The device works as both the poems and screen directions surrounding them are stuffed with urgent and memorable language: “inside / women have left their breasts at home / & brought someone else’s teeth / femmes wear their hair / like a borough wears a riot”. What lingers is the tenderness Taylor has for her protagonists; she knows that liberation never comes without a cost.Hekateby Nikita Gill (Simon & Schuster, £18.99)The first in a trilogy, Gill’s latest verse novel is a retelling of the life of Hekate, the Greek goddess of plants, witchcraft and more. We follow her from her youth, as she discovers why she’s ended up in the underworld, and what her godly powers might be. Making use of fast-flowing tercets and prose poems, it’s a propulsive read, though at times the needs of exposition contort the poetry into flatness. However, Gill is skilled enough to slow the action and allow moments of insight to surface. In Girlhood, Hekate pauses and ponders: “the shifting sands of time took my father from my features. Is that all ageing is? Leaving things you knew and once loved behind to become something brand new?”View image in fullscreenGoatsongby Phoebe Giannisi, translated by Brian Sneeden (Fitzcarraldo, £14.99)Also wrestling with the Greek gods and what their myths might mean for today is Phoebe Giannisi. Goatsong is a compilation of three recent books, all united by a style that, as perhaps befits a professor of architecture, is rigorously intellectual. Yet a focus on the physical grounds the poems: “I open my mouth to speak / but my teeth clench / you a seashell / a hidden word.” Giannisi’s work does not give up its charms easily, but is worth persisting with. Its oddity and opacity put me in mind of Auden’s The Orators. In its own way, Goatsong is saying something important: “I say take me / in your embrace / in your violence / and gently / let me go”.Rishi Dastidar’s latest publication is A Hobby of Mine (Broken Sleep Books).Explore more on these topicsBooksPoetry roundupPoetryreviewsShareReuse this content"

And if you were wondering what he’s up to now, in 2022 he returned to his native South Africa to lead first Jazzart Dance Theatre and now JoburgBallet. Founded in 2001, Joburg Ballet has an eclectic rep ranging across styles, subjects and continents. Case in point, this showcase begins with cheesy grins and pointe-shoe petit allegro and ends duetting with the severed head of John the Baptist.View image in fullscreenSouth African steps in pointe shoes … Tumelo Lekana in Prologue: Camagwini from Communication of Light by Joburg Ballet.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianThe cheesy smiles are for Concerto for Charlie, by South African choreographer Veronica Paeper. Made in 1979, it’s named after Revlon’s Charlie perfume (Revlon was the sponsor). The twee neo-classicism looks dated, but I think there’s an element of knowingness going on in the twinkly dancers, who perform well. It grows on you. Hurst’s own piece Resonance feels a little old fashioned too, with its smooth, easy-on-the-eye, jazzy ballet, nice frocks and saxophone soundtrack, but then it shifts into something more unsettling, tilting between between racial antagonism and the harmony of dancing together; an interesting conjunction of prettiness and ugliness in consideration of South Africa’s history.The mixed bill also features a decent contemporary piece set to Spanish guitar by choreographer Jorge Pérez Martínez (dancer Monike Cristina is a stand-out) and a very interesting vignette from dancer Tumelo Lakana, a ritual prayer to his ancestors that honours and transcends tradition as he dances South African steps in pointe shoes.The best piece is Salomé, byDada Masilo, who sadly died in 2024 aged 39.Salomé was one of Masilo’s final works, made for this company, and the urgent energy of the dancers feels like what we’ve been waiting for – it’s as if you can see a mad itch flying through the body of Revil Yon’s John the Baptist. This is a story of seduction and power, and especially being seduced by your own power. Latoya Mokoena’s sensuously commanding Salomé is absolutely believable, and the dramatic beats are spot-on – when they bring out that silver platter it’s like Chekhov’s gun exploding. The ending, when Salomé suddenly sobers up and sees reality, feels genuinely tragic. The real tragedy is that there won’t be any more work from Masilo, but it will be fascinating to see where Hurst leads this company in the future.At Linbury theatre, Royal Opera House, London, until 2 NovemberExplore more on these topicsBalletDancereviewsShareReuse this content"

Such is the case with Fire of God’s Love, a 1973 album by the Australian nun Sister Irene O’Connor.Simple and spectral, it is a marvel of analogue pop music – a collection of airy folk songs, played largely on drum machine, acoustic guitar and synth organ, which sometimes feels more spiritually aligned with cult singer-songwriters like Princess Demeny and Mary Margaret O’Hara than most other non-secular records. Set for reissue next month by Freedom to Spend – an arm of the cult electronic label Rvng dedicated to high-quality reissues of 70s and 80s amateur synth records – Fire of God’s Love is also a quintessential winter record, perfect for the cooler months ahead.O’Connor first started making music in the 50s while living in a convent in Singapore, and released music in the 60s under the pseudonym Myriam Frances, as to avoid ruffling any feathers in her community. In Singapore, O’Connor met another nun, Sister Marimil Lobregat, who had experience working in audio technology; back in Sydney, the pair would meet at the city’s Catholic Radio and Television Centre to work on music together, recording on a four-track tape recorder. The resulting songs are devoutly religious but skirt lines between devotional music and contemporary pop; some tracks, such as album opener Fire (Luke 12:49) contain elements of dub, while others, such as Teenager’s Chorus, feel of a piece with pastoral British folk music. The whole thing feels a little like a miracle: a sweet, compelling pop record from a hugely unlikely source.Shaad D’SouzaThis week’s best new tracksView image in fullscreenRosalía.Rosalía – BerghainGerman operatics, lyrics comparing diminishing yourself for love to transubstantiation, glass-shattering falsetto, “divine intervention” courtesy of Björk, and Yves Tumor reprising Mike Tyson’s “I’ll fuck you ’til you love me” – who else has the vision?LSLankum – Ghost TownThe only act capable of making the Specials’ 1981 hit even more haunting, Lankum swap dub for rumbling drone and the “ya ya ya!” for fathoms-deep chorals.

Six years and seven releases on (including a few collaborations with Levi), the sound of that scene continues to resonate in the experimental London guitarist’s music: the scuffed-up production; the dub influences; the disaffected, barely discernible murmurs and groans. Her new album balances those brilliant scuzzy elements with songwriting that stands on its own two feet.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Is This a QueueThough little is given away, Is This a Queue was supposedly written across several years and different locations. It checks out: the record is a cluster of heady, rough-around-the-edges tracks, assembling a motley crew of previous collaborators to document the people and places she has encountered along the way.Opening track 6-9 sets the tone: built around a rickety, chugging drum loop, the track is layered with off-kilter bells, sinister screeches and fragmentary voice recordings. Wandering instrumentals like this one make up the bulk of the album’s 31-minute run time: there are also swarming clouds of feedback (GOAT Rosetta), ritualistic drum workouts (Why We Have to Move, featuringpercussionist Valentina Magaletti) and scrappy guitar jams (Strut in Straddle).Woven among them is a handful of hook-laden tracks, more akin to songs than improvisations – and more memorable for it. The track 2 Numbers is wonderfully catchy, merging angular post-punk guitars with Manchester musician Leo Hermitt’s coarse singsong delivery, while On Smoke sounds like a break-up song warped through Alpha Maid’s Auto-Tune-entrenched drawl. To call these tracks lo-fi might suggest her music is delicate or twee, but really it’s anything but: the album is tough and steely, offhandedly chucking in a Giggs reference or industrial clang for every jangly riff.Also out this monthOKO DJis the kind of artist to play live industrial recordings, acid house and trap music all in one club set. While more suited to home listening, her debut album As Above, So Below (Stroom) is as expansive, adorning hazy guitar jams with swirling FX and syncopated percussion, while moody spoken-word-style vocals add an eerie, late-night allure. After a brief detour into pop-ish territory with last year’s album Sentiment,Claire Rousayreturns to her more esoteric roots on , an album of collage-like compositions recorded at dusk (Thrill Jockey). Instruments drone, glitch and flicker around found sounds and warped voice recordings. The latest inInvisible Inc’s 10-year anniversary series is Resonance, a various artists compilation honouring the psychedelic end of the Glasgow label’s output. Expect a constellation of tripped-out, lounge-y sounds, from space rock and dub to musique concrète.Explore more on these topicsExperimental musicExperimental album of the monthalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

A new band for fans of headstrong, tender Americana, Alabama twins Katie and Allison Crutchfield (of Waxahatchee and Swearin’ respectively) are in a new band together for the first time since scrappy, beloved PS Eliot retired in 2011. Backed by indie guitar starMJ Lendermanand storied alt-rock producer Brad Cook, Snocaps is a family record in more ways than one: the four have a tangled history of making music together, giving this one-off collection the lived-in feel of a band five albums deep.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for SnocapsWith no need for introductions, Snocaps starts with an exercise in trust. We’re in the car, Allison’s at the wheel, and she is daring the rest of the band to close their eyes: “I got a pedal on the floor or I’m slammin’ on the brakes,” she quips, setting the pace for an album about chasing integrity and conviction, told through airborne melodies and unpretentious, freewheeling guitar.The sisters play outlaws on Over Our Heads (“Don’t bother chasing us, boys!”), echoing their teenage rejection of male-dominated music scenes, while I Don’t Want To’s whispered assertions slowly grow in strength, with glowing acoustic guitar guarding their twinned harmonies like a blanket fort. Combining poetry and pragmatism for songs about flawed self-sufficiency, Wasteland and Cherry Hard Candy are instant Crutchfield classics – now with dusty, aching Lenderman solos. They have promised just a handful of live shows before screeching to a halt, but here’s hoping that a band with such obvious, exhilarating chemistry can’t resist driving a few more miles.Explore more on these topicsMusicIndiePop and rockAmericanaWaxahatcheeMJ Lendermanalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

The programme juxtaposes three works composed in the final decades of the 19th century, each reflecting in different ways on the notion of a hero, or what is meant by a hero’s journey.A Hero’s Song was Dvořák’s final tone poem, a 20-minute micro-symphony in which intrepid determination gives way to mourning, martial conflict and finally hope. It’s full of amiable melodies and, in Hrůša’s hands, it packs a dramatic punch. It’s followed by a compelling discovery: Glazunov’s symphonic elegy To the Memory of a Hero, composed when he was 20. Advancing with sombre tread, and boasting a pair of instantly memorable themes, it is handsomely shaped by conductor and orchestra.View image in fullscreenAlbum cover for Strauss, Dvořák and Glazunov.Photograph: Accentus Music/BR KlassikRichard Strauss’s ubiquitous Ein Heldenleben is no stranger on disc. Things get off to a slightly ponderous start, and the recording can feel congested when confronted with the full force of Strauss’s orchestration. Nevertheless, Hrůša’s flexible phrasing ensures the music’s theatricality wins through, especially in the supple central portrait of the composer’s wife and the hero’s poignant final retirement.Released on 7 NovemberExplore more on these topicsClassical musicalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

And what do people want? I’ve been asking myself these questions since closing our restaurantRovifor renovations this summer, taking the opportunity to rethink some of the things we do.It has become clear to me that the restaurant world I’ve known for decades is radically changing through a combination of factors: people’s working patterns, health obsessions, the falling out of love with alcohol and the falling in love with pastries and bread, but, predominantly, the affordability of it all.The numbers are genuinely frightening: in my restaurants, utility costs are up more than 50% since 2019; chocolate prices have doubled; olive oil is up 121%; even spring onions are up 55% – spring onions! Meanwhile, customers are feeling the squeeze just as hard:52% of UK consumershave cut non-essential spending, with 72% of those naming “eating out” as one of their cuts. With London renters now spending an average of41.6% of their income on rentalone, something has to give.My first panicky instinct was: we’re all fighting to survive in an industry that’s eating itself. But step outside and you’ll notice something unexpected. Everyone’s facing the same brutal economics, but the responses are all over the place. Some solutions are radical, some simple, some totally bonkers – and some are really working.Rotisserie chicken is suddenly everywhere:Norbert’sin East Dulwich;Cocotteexpanding beyond its Notting Hill site;Chick’n’Sourspivoting toward rotisserie; newcomers such asChicken Shop. It hits every pressure point: affordable protein, simple prep, fast turnover. Half a chicken and sides for £15 feels like good value when everything else has become expensive and fiddly.This city is often driven by immigrants who arrive with skills, recipes and a bloody-minded determination to make something workThe Yellow Bitternwent in the opposite direction. Instead of making things easier and more affordable, they made them harder and more expensive. Eighteen seats behind Kings Cross station, doorbell entry, a portrait of Lenin watching you eat a £50 lunch, closed for dinner, no cards, no website. When customers didn’t spend enough one day, the chef posted on Instagram asking them to “justify their presence”. Sounds mad, but everyone’s talking about it.The grocery shop-restaurant hybrid is another solution that’s spreading fast, particularly at the higher end. Places likeCorner Shop 180,Honey & SpiceandLeila’s Shopmake the profit margins more manageable by hedging their bets and offering a new kind of dining alongside the shopping experience. It seems obvious when you say it like that, but it’s surprisingly hard to actually do.View image in fullscreenYotam Ottolenghi tucking into the lamb tantuni at Mersin Tantuni London.Photograph: Chaya MayaReading Jonathan Nunn’s bookLondon Feeds Itselfmade me realise what I’m seeing in restaurants is part of something much larger. Nunn writes about how London feeds itself “in so many unusual ways – in its warehouses, mosques, community centres, and even in baths – spaces where monetary transaction is peripheral or even completely absent”. This city has always nourished itself creatively, often driven by waves of immigrants who arrive with skills, recipes and a bloody-minded determination to make something work.I go to Turkish restaurants for some of the best meals in the city. My test kitchen has become obsessed with tantuni (see recipe, below)– we’ll disappear for lunch and come back debating the lavash flatbread, the spice of the butter, whether there wasenoughyoghurt sauce. Right now,Neco Tantuniin Enfield andMersin Tantuniin Dalston are winning.The story of Mangal in Dalston shows how this evolution works. Ali Dirik moved from Istanbul in 1987 and openedMangal I, a real charcoal-cooking restaurant not seen here before. Then he openedMangal IIin 1994, which offers so much of what London wants: small plates, good wine, sharing everything. His son Ferhat runs it now, and has kept his father’s original Adana kebabs while adding dishes like grilled ox heart with sumac and wild garlic. It’s Turkish, but also completely London: that willingness to evolve while staying true to what you are.This pattern is repeating across London. In New Malden, Korean families have built something incredible – a whole strip of restaurants servingpajeonandbulgogito their community. Now, places such asCah Chiare packed with Londoners who’ve figured out that this is some of the best food in the city. In Elephant and Castle, Filipino families opened canteens in community centres before graduating to restaurants likeSarap Filipino Bistroin Soho (since closed but looking for a new home), bringing dishes such assisigandadoboto adventurous London palates.The restaurants thriving now aren’t the ones recreating old models with higher prices. They’re the ones who’ve figured out new models entirelySome of the most innovative responses combine food with community building.Migrateful, founded in 2017, trains refugees and migrants to become cookery teachers, running classes across London where participants learn to cook dishes from Syria, Afghanistan, Eritrea and beyond, while hearing the stories behind the recipes. It’s not so much a restaurant – though the food is extraordinary – as about creating opportunities and cultural exchange simultaneously. Since launching, it has supported more than 200 chefs and served more than 15,000 students.During Covid, we proved how adaptable our industry could be. We became grocers, takeaway specialists and community kitchens overnight. Even restaurants you would normally book weeks ahead – Gymkhana, Lyle’s, Hoppers – started offering meal kits. That same ingenuity has evolved – people building businesses from the ground up with adaptability built in, rather than having to retrofit it during a crisis.The restaurants thriving now aren’t the ones trying to recreate the old model with higher prices. They’re the ones who have figured out new models entirely: the chicken specialists, the doorbell restaurants, the grocery-restaurant hybrids, the community teachers, the cultural translators. They’re not waiting for things to get easier; they’re making excellence work within the constraints they have.I think I’ve been looking at this all wrong. The frantic booking apps, the eye-watering costs, the constant pressure to innovate … These aren’tjustsigns of an industry in crisis. They are signs of an industry that’s more alive and creative than it has ever been.The spring onions will cost what they cost. But people who care about feeding others well keep finding new ways to do it. That’s what resilience looks like.The question isn’t whether London’s restaurant scene will survive – it’s what brilliant, unexpected form it will take next.Pumpkin muhammara with peppers and date molasses (pictured above)This is based on the muhammara we serve at Rovi. The traditional Syrian version is made of roasted red peppers, walnuts and pomegranate molasses, but this one swaps half the peppers for pumpkin, which makes it creamier and less sharp. Look for delica pumpkin if you can find it, or any firm-fleshed, deeply orange squash such as onion squash or crown prince. We usepilpelchuma(a fermented pepper paste) for the topping, but rose harissa works just as well. You can roast the pumpkin and peppers the day before, which makes this ideal for parties when you need something mostly hands-off.Prep30 minCook50 minServes6-81 smalldelica pumpkin(900g), halved and deseeded6 red peppers(800g)60ml olive oil1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed2½ tbsp lemon juice80g walnuts, lightly toasted and roughly chopped2 tbsp date molasses, plus 1½ tsp extraFine sea salt and black pepper50g pilpelchuma, or rose harissa1 tsp cumin seeds, roughly crushed½ tspaleppo chilliTo serveSeeded crackers or pitta breadHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Place the pumpkin halves cut side down on a lined oven tray, arrange the red peppers alongside and drizzle both with a tablespoon of oil. Roast for 25-30 minutes, by which time the peppers’ skin should be blistered and blackened in places. Lift them off the tray, put them in a bowl and cover with a plate to steam. Continue to roast the pumpkin for another 20-25 minutes, until softened, then leave to cool completely.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Using a spoon, scoop out the flesh of the pumpkin halves, and discard the skin and any hard caramelised bits. You should end up with about 400g roast pumpkin flesh.To make the muhammara, put the pumpkin and 200g of the peppers in a food processor. Add the garlic, 2 tablespoons of lemon juice, 50g of the walnuts, 2 tablespoons of the date molasses, 1¼ teaspoons of salt and a good grind of pepper. Pour in 170ml water and blitz until completely smooth and silky.Chop the remaining pepper flesh into 1cm pieces and put these in a bowl with the remaining 3 tablespoons of oil, ½ tablespoon of lemon juice, the extra 1½ teaspoons of date molasses, the pilpelchuma (or harissa) and ¼ teaspoon of salt. Mix well.To assemble, spread the muhammara on a platter, followed by the chopped pepper mix and all its oil. Scatter over the remaining walnuts, cumin seeds and aleppo chilli, then serve with plenty of seeded crackers or pitta.Lamb and aubergine tantuni with garlic yoghurt and burnt butterView image in fullscreenThere’s a spot in east London calledMersin Tantunithat my team and I love – small, always busy, with a griddle visible from the street. Tantuni is Turkish street food from Mersin on the southern coast: finely chopped lamb or beef cooked on a griddle until crisp at the edges, mixed with tomatoes and peppers, then wrapped in the thinnest possible lavash bread and rolled like a cigar. It’s cut into fat rounds, doused in burnt butter and arrives at your table still sizzling. This version adds aubergine, which soaks up the lamb fat and spices, going soft and almost creamy. The burnt butter – with cumin and aleppo chilli – is what makes it feel authentic. Lavash is available in Middle Eastern supermarkets; you want the thinnest you can find, warmed briefly over the hot lamb so it softens and picks up the juices without going soggy.Prep30 minCook40 minServes2 as a main or 4 as a snackFor the lamb1 tbsp olive oil300g lamb shoulder, cut into 1cm pieces1 large or 2 small aubergine(300g), cut into 1cm piecesFine sea salt and black pepper1 small garlic clove, peeled and crushed¼ tsp smoked paprika1 tsp cumin seeds, lightly ground in a mortar1½ tbsp pine nutsFor the garlic yoghurt100g Greek yoghurt1 small garlic clove, peeled and crushed1 tsp lemon juiceFor the sumac onions1 red onion(125g), peeled and thinly sliced1 tbsp lemon juice¾ tsp sumac10g picked parsley10g picked mint, roughly tornFor the burnt butter40g unsalted butter¼ tsp cumin seeds, lightly crushed1 tspaleppo chilli⅛ tsp smoked paprikaTo serve2 lavash bread or 4 of the thinnest flatbreads you can getPut the oil in a large saute pan on a medium- high heat and, once hot, add the lamb, aubergine, ½ teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, for 15 minutes, until golden. Stir in the garlic, paprika and cumin, cook for another 30 seconds, then pour in 200ml water, stir well and cover with a lid. Turn down the heat to medium, and cook for another 20 minutes, until the water has evaporated and the lamb is tender. Stir in the pine nuts and cook for another 3 minutes.Meanwhile, put all the yoghurt ingredients in a bowl with a tablespoon of water and a good pinch of salt. Mix well and set aside at room temperature.For the sumac onions, put the onions, lemon juice, sumac and ⅛ teaspoon of salt in a bowl. Mix gently with a spoon and set aside to cure until bright pink. Add the parsley and mint just before serving.Put the butter in a small saucepan on a medium heat and cook for 3-4 minutes, until the milk solids have browned at the bottom of the pan and the butter smells nutty. Add the cumin, aleppo chilli and paprika, cook for 30 seconds more, then take off the heat.To assemble, briefly dunk the lavash over the hot lamb to soften and soak up some of the fat and juices. Divide the lamb between the two lavash, arrange half the sumac onions on top (sav the rest for serving) and roll like a cigar with the seam side down.Using a serrated knife, cut the tantuni into 4-5cm pieces and arrange these seam side down on a serving platter. Spoon over the yoghurt and pour over the hot butter. Serve with the remaining sumac onions on the side.Explore more on these topicsRestaurantsFoodLondonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And it’s only right to have them in a s’more, the American classic that’s also now part of the festivities over on this side of the pond. Digestive biscuits are typically the go-to, but I like to add extra flavour, depth and texture by using ginger oaty biscuits instead. These are quick to put together and don’t require any chilling. Ideally, the s’mores would be made over a real fire, but a blowtorch or hot grill will do the job, too.Ginger biscuit s’moresPrep5 minCook30 minMakes9100g unsalted butter25g honey130g plain flour120g caster sugar45g oats2 tsp ground ginger½ tsp bicarbonate of soda½ tsp salt9 squaresdark chocolate9 marshmallowsFlaky sea saltHeat the oven to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5 and line two oven trays with baking paper. Melt the butter and honey in a saucepan, then leave to cool a little.In a bowl, mix the flour, sugar, oats, ground ginger, bicarb and salt. Make a well in the middle, pour in the melted butter mix, and stir until it all comes together into a thick dough. Roll the dough into 18 balls weighing roughly 25g each, then flatten them a little and arrange on the lined trays (if you want them to be perfectly round, use a biscuit cutter slightly larger than the biscuits to shimmy them into shape).Bake for 15 minutes until well browned. Once they’re cool enough to handle, transfer to a rack to cool completely.To make the s’mores, put a square of chocolate on the base of half the biscuits and top with a marshmallow. Blowtorch the tops or place under a hot grill until the marshmallow is lightly browned and softened. Sprinkle a bit of sea salt on top, then sandwich with another biscuit.Explore more on these topicsFoodThe sweet spotMarshmallowsBiscuitsDessertBakingBonfire NightrecipesShareReuse this content"
