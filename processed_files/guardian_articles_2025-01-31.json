The chancellorsignalled her supportfor a third runway at Heathrow this week as part of the government’s latest push to stimulate the economy.One ally of the energy secretary, Ed Miliband, who is leading the government’s climate agenda, said the formerLabourleader would have a “punchy” response for any attempt to give consent to Rosebank. The ally said: “Ed will come to that fight armed with a lot of evidence about what Rosebank will do to our carbon emissions.”A spokesperson for Miliband declined to comment.A Labour backbencher said: “[A decision around Rosebank] will be a moment to speak out. There are a lot of us, on every wing of the party, who would go absolutely nuts if that happened.”Another Labour MP said: “Not many in the party are going to man the barricades over Heathrow, but Rosebank is a very different matter altogether. There would be massive resistance if they try and give consent for that.”The Rosebank developmentlost a significant court casethis week when a judge in Scotland ruled the decision by the previous government to give it the green light had been unlawful. The judge ruled that ministers should not have given it consent without knowing how much carbon dioxide would be generated by burning the oil the field will produce over its lifetime.Equinor, the Norwegian energy company that is leading the Rosebank project, is expected to carry out that more detailed assessment and come back with a renewed consent application later this year. An Equinor spokespersonsaid after the rulingit would continue to work with the government on securing consent, adding: “Rosebank is critical for the UK’s economic growth.”But while the decision is technically up to the independent North Sea Transition Authority, government officials say it is likely to be so sensitive that the prime minister himself will have to weigh in.Labour came into government last year promising not to issue any new licences for oil and gas fields in the North Sea. The Rosebank project, however, already has its licence and can continue developing the field until it gets environmental consent to start pumping oil out of the ground.A source close to Starmer said the prime minister had not ruled out giving the go-ahead for the field but would want to see the application first.Many, however, think it has been made more likely by the government’s renewed push for growth, after Reeves signalled her approval for another runway at Heathrow as well as further liberalisation of the planning regime.Asked last week about the clash between her economic agenda and the government’s environmental targets,Reeves said: “Growth is the number-one mission of this government, because growth underpins everything else, whether that is improving our schools and our hospitals, or indeed being able to get to net zero.”One oil and gas lobbyist said: “Three months ago I would have been less confident that the government would give consent. But Trump and Labour’s post-Christmas growth zeal makes it significantly more likely.” Equinor said the project would generate jobs for 4,000 people.Reeves’s apparent downgrading of the government’s climate mission is already causing unease in Labour circles. The backbencher Clive Lewis wrote in the Guardian on Friday: “A growing suspicion looms that our government lacks a coherent governing philosophy or ideological compass beyond the vague pursuit of ‘growth’. But if growth at any cost is the mantra, the costs will soon become painfully clear.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But some say they are looking out for any further sign of the government walking away from its green agenda.One Labour MP told the Guardian: “We are proud that we’re the most green government the country has ever had. That’s important, and not something you’d want to lose.”Another said: “Once Justin Trudeau is out [as Canadian prime minister], Keir will essentially be the world leader who is the most prominently committed to climate. I think we should not shy away from taking on that mantle.”Miliband is preparing to publish the results of a recent consultation with the energy industry and the public more generally about how the government should account for the emissions from oil and gas produced in the UK.Government officials say the outcome of that consultation will be vital in deciding whether or not they can give consent to a new oilfield while also remaining within Labour’s CO2reduction commitments.Campaigners argue that the project is unlikely to produce the growth promised by its backers.Tessa Khan, the executive director of Uplift, said: “Renewables are the key growth sector of the UK, both in terms of investment and jobs, and where our global advantage lies.“But that sector is now in competition with the oil and gas industry for workers, supply chains, port space and other resources, not to mention the disastrous signals doubling down on oil and gas sends to clean-energy investors.”Explore more on these topicsLabourOil (Environment)Oil (Business)Keir StarmerRachel ReevesHeathrow airportHeathrow third runwaynewsShareReuse this content"

Trump also threatened to follow up with a further wave of tariffs against the European Union.Goods exported from Canada andMexicoto the US will be hit with a 25% tariff, while products from China face a 10% levy, the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, told reporters on Friday.The administration did not give exact details of the tariffs, which Trump has repeatedly said would start 1 February. Trump later suggested in the Oval Office that oil fromCanada, which exports millions of barrels of crude per day to the US, would “probably” face a lower tariff of 10% and that he expected his administration would impose duties related to oil and gas around 18 February.While the president insisted that nothing could be done by Canada, Mexico and China right now to forestall tariffs, officials were said to be scrambling to find a way out. Several situations under consideration in a bid to strike an 11th-hour deal,accordingto the Wall Street Journal.Leavitt dismissed reports that the US would delay implementation of the tariffs by a month as “false”, claiming that “starting tomorrow, those tariffs will be in place”.Canada has pledged to retaliate with a “forceful but reasonable” response. Mexico has also drawn up plans, but declined to provide details. China has said it will “firmly defend” its interests.The US is also looking at tariffs on drugs, steel, aluminum, copper, computer chips and “things associated with chips”, Trump said. He also threatened the EU, which he claimed had treated the US “horribly”, with substantial action.The presidenthas claimed imposing duties on goods from overseas will raise hundreds of billions of dollars for the federal government, while forcing countries – even two of America’s closest allies – to bend to his demands.Why Trump tariffs will be ‘very bad for America and for the world’Read moreBut economists have repeatedly warned that higher tariffs, a key pillar of Trump’s economic strategy, risk raising prices for millions of Americans, challenging the president’s pledge to bring down prices “rapidly” amid a wave of frustration over thecost of living.Trump acknowledged on Friday that his tariffs could cause “temporary short-term disruption”, but expressed hope that Americans would understand why they had been imposed. “Tariffs don’t cause inflation,” he claimed. “They cause success.”Investors appear apprehensive, too. Stocks on Wall Street fell after the White House press briefing, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing down 0.75% in New York.After his election victory in November, the president homed in on Canada and Mexico, the US’s neighbors, andChina, demanding they do more to stop “illegal aliens” and drugs such as fentanyl from crossing into the US. Trump said he would impose tariffs immediately upon entering office, but hours after his inauguration said he would do so on 1 February instead.Mexico and Canada have insisted in recent days that they stand prepared for Trump to make good on his threat.“We have plan A, plan B and plan C for whatever the US government decides,” Claudia Sheinbaum, the Mexican president, said on Friday. The country has previously signaled that it would “have to” respond with duties of its own if hit with US tariffs.Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, warned of potentially “difficult times” if Trump proceeds with tariffs.On Trudeau’s warning that Canada would put forward a “forceful but reasonable” response to US duties, Leavitt shot back at the White House press briefing: “I think Justin Trudeau would be wise to talk to President Trump directly before pushing outlandish comments like that to the media.”Chrystia Freeland, Canada’s former trade negotiator and finance minister, who isvying to succeed Trudeau, proposed a 100% tariff on all Tesla vehicles and on US wine, beer and spirits. “We need to be very targeted, very surgical, very precise,” she told the Canadian Press – in this case, targeting the Tesla chief, Elon Musk, at the heart of Trump’s inner circle.Trump, who mooted a 20% universal tariff on all foreign imports from across the world while running for re-election, has made clear that other key markets, including the European Union, are also in his sights.In his inaugural address, the president laid out his plan to overhaul the US’s economic ties with the world. “Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens,” he declared, claiming this would lead to “massive amounts of money pouring into our treasury, coming from foreign sources”.Tariffs are not charged on the exporter, but the importer – in this case, firms based in the US – and are often passed on to consumers. This is why economists caution that increasing duties on importscould exacerbate inflation.Undeterred, Trump has launched a consultation into the creation of an “external revenue service” for the collection of tariffs.The conservative Tax Foundation has estimated that Trump imposed about $80bn worth of tariffs on about $380bn worth of products in 2018 and 2019, describing it as “one of the largest tax increases in decades”. The Biden administration kept most of the tariffs in place, and increased tariffs on an additional $18bn of Chinese goods, including semiconductors and electric vehicles.In a speech earlier this week, Trump claimed his officials would introduce tariffs on overseas semiconductors, drugs and steel “in the very near future”, singling out Taiwan and suggesting that such duties would incentivize manufacturers to make such goods in the US.Imposing tariffs, at least using the conventional playbook, takes time. A necessary investigation requires 270 days by statute. But Trump’s officials have reportedly been exploring other options, such as the declaration of an economic emergency, in an attempt to move more quickly.Biggest US trading allies brace for a ‘game of chicken’ with Trump’s tariffsRead moreUS importers, or their customs brokers, are required by Customs and Border Protection to file an entry summary for goods arriving into the US, with details about their shipment, such as what it is, how much it is worth and where it is from. Goods are assigned a specific code according to theHarmonized Tariff Schedule, which has the applicable tariff rates.Importers are responsible for paying the duties calculated on the value of the goods they have imported.Have a question about Trump tariffs?

I knew the journey would be exhausting, walking long distances on broken roads crowded with other displaced people, but I was eager to return to my beloved home.I followed the news minute by minute, waiting for the announcement that the crossing would open. Instead, we got news that it would not happen.I went to bed that day thinking about all the people who went to the checkpoint early Saturday night so they could be the first to return. Many had sold their tents to afford the journey back, or even burned their tents out of excitement they were finally leaving behind life in those camps.So they had no shelter that night, and slept in the freezing cold, waiting anxiously for the next morning, hoping their dreams would not be crushed again.View image in fullscreenA Palestinian woman holding a child as they return to northern Gaza.Photograph: Enas Tantesh/The GuardianWhen the announcement came on Monday that the road was open, I felt I could have flown away with joy. We got dressed, packed our bags, and drove as close to the checkpoint as we could get.As we approached on foot, we were drawn into a crowd so big it felt like an endless river of human beings. If you looked back or forward, you could see only the same torrent of people trudging north. We would walk for 11 hours, covering 15 kilometres.Everyone was very tired, and weighed down with the few possessions they had saved from the war, but the passion to return drove them forward. Our longing to see our homes, even if they were destroyed, was stronger than our exhaustion, and kept our tired legs moving.Clouds of dust stamped up by the passing crowds covered our faces, settling on every strand of hair, turning my eyelashes from black to grey. It felt almost comic, but around me there were so many heartbreaking scenes.View image in fullscreenMany of the people returning to northern Gaza have been displaced numerous times during the war.Photograph: Enas Tantesh/The GuardianMen with children on their shoulders struggled to carry or drag heavy belongings that were all they had saved from the war. Old people in wheelchairs jolted painfully for miles over the ruts of a destroyed road. Others who needed support but no longer had it collapsed in the middle of the road.I saw one man weeping over the body of his elderly father, who had insisted on trying to return despite poor health. The journey killed him. Elsewhere, children who had been separated from families in the crush cried for their parents, while a father searched frantically for his son.As we approachedGazaCity, Rashid Street was so full of people trying to return that the crowd seemed to have filled it and then come to a stop. So we turned off towards the beach where we used to go to relax, walking on the solid sand near the water with hundreds of other people.Map of journeyThe beach was clean and beautiful, so we took breaks every now and then. In the late afternoon, we ate cucumber, cheese bread and avocado that our mother had packed, looking at the sea. Our water had run out some time earlier.After finishing the meal, we continued our journey, finally reaching Gaza City, where big crowds of people had gathered to wait for their loved ones.The sun was setting, and its reflected light turned the sad, ruined buildings orange. It was strangely beautiful, converting Gaza into a piece of art that only the people who lived there could appreciate.We hoped to find a car to drive us the final stretch of the journey, but the few on the streets were already full, or the drivers were waiting for their own families.So we carried on walking through Gaza’s Rimal neighbourhood, which used to be a fancy enclave for the city’s rich. Now it was a ghost town, with an army of displaced people grey with dust tramping through its streets in exhausted silence.View image in fullscreen‘The scale of the destruction was overwhelming.’Photograph: Enas Tantesh/The GuardianWe kept looking for a car, but it was a hopeless search. The only one that stopped asked 30 times the usual fare, more than we could afford. So we kept walking.We reached our home town, Beit Lahia, in the farthest north, when night had already fallen. My feet and shoulders ached, and even in the darkness I saw glimpses of the destruction all around, but despite everything I was incredibly happy.We headed straight to my maternal grandfather’s house, which was still standing, although it was damaged and coated in dust and graffiti from Israeli soldiers. There were empty boxes of ammunition and bullets everywhere. We watch our steps when moving around, as unexploded bombs are a big worry for everyone here.When we woke the next day we went for a walk, and although I have been covering Israeli attacks for months, the scale of the destruction was overwhelming.View image in fullscreenMalak Tantesh and her father, Amjed, sit among the rubble of their home as Malak’s sister, Enas, takes a picture.Photograph: Enas Tantesh/The GuardianPeople were searching through the rubble of their homes, looking for clothes, photographs or other scraps of memories of their lives before the war, tools and utensils that may still be usable.I ran into friends and neighbours who I had not seen since the start of the war. All around there were families embracing, the hugs and kisses of longed-for reunions.We decided to visit our own home for the first time since the war started. I grew up in this area but it had been so devastated, buildings and streets and gardens bombed and demolished, that we could no longer find our way to the house. We were wandering lost and confused, when a neighbour appeared and guided us.The only things still standing were the trunks of a walnut tree, and some olive trees that used to be in our yard. Seeing them there, surrounded only by rubble, I felt like I had been stabbed in my heart.Our home was a three-storey building, and the levels had collapsed on top of each other like layers in a cake. I walked around and over the ruins to see if there was a way in, to recover anything from our life. It was dangerous but our memories deserve it.I couldn’t find even the smallest hole. Nothing had survived. My memories, my family’s memories and everything we owned have all been crushed and buried.Explore more on these topicsGazaPalestinian territoriesIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Like other spyware makers, Paragon sells use of its spyware, known as Graphite, to government agencies, who are supposed to use it to fight and prevent crime.Paragon’s spyware was allegedly delivered to targets who were placed on group chats without their permission, and sent malware through PDFs in the group chat. Paragon makes no-click spyware, which means users do not have to click on any link or attachment to be infected; it is simply delivered to the phone.It is not clear how long Cancellato may have been compromised. But the editor published a high-profile investigative story last year that exposed how members of Meloni’s far-right party’s youth wing had engaged in fascist chants, Nazi salutes and antisemitic rants.Fanpage’s undercover reporters – although not Cancellato personally – had infiltrated groups and chat forums used by members of the National Youth, a wing of Meloni’s Brothers of Italy party. The outletpublished clipsof National Youth members chanting “Duce” – a reference to Benito Mussolini – and “sieg Heil”, and boasting about their familial connections to historical figures linked to neo-fascist terrorism. The stories were published in May.Cancellato, 45, said he did not have reason to suspect in December that his mobile device had been compromised and has never been told by any authorities that he is under investigation. The news felt like a “violation”, he said.“We just began the technical analysis on the device in order to evaluate the actual extent of this attack, what was actually taken or spied on, and for how long. Obviously, it is also in our interest to know, if it’s possible to do so, who ordered this espionage activity,” Cancellato told the Guardian.Meloni’s party faced criticism in Italy and in Brussels following the publication of Fanpage’s reporting. A European Commission spokesperson at the time said: “The point of view of the European Commission and of President Ursula von der Leyen on the symbolism of fascism is very clear: we do not believe it is appropriate, we condemn it, we think it is morally wrong.”The president of the Jewish Community of Rome, Victor Fadlun, called for “appropriate actions [to] be taken” after the Fanpage reports. “It is imperative that society and institutions react strongly against all forms of hatred and discrimination,” he wrote on X.Giovanni Donzelli, a Brothers ofItalyMP and party organizer, said at the time there was “no place” for “racists, extremists, and antisemites” in his party.Paragon Solutions declined to comment.Have you received a notification from WhatsApp?

They started the 2025Six Nationsby beating Wales 43-0, a record score against them in a home game, and they did it at a canter. It’s hard to say which side of the score they’ll be more pleased with, the seven tries or the shutout. The only blemish for the French was a red card for Romain Ntamack, who was sent off for a high tackle on Dan Edwards when there were 10 minutes left to play. It did not make much difference this weekend but, who knows, maybe it will in the next one, when they play England at Twickenham.Wales have lost 13 in a row now. They looked awfully small out there waiting for the start, surrounded by flames, fireworks, and the blindingly bright blue, red and white lights, while their handful of travelling fans were drowned out by the tens of thousands of French. Their captain, Jac Morgan, gathered his men into a huddle and did his best to steel them for what was coming. Being ready for the blow, though, did not make it any easier to wear when it came. Within minutes, Morgan’s team were reeling backwards when Thomas Ramos kicked a 50-22, and Antoine Dupont barrelled his way over underneath the posts.‘I don’t think it was an entirely bad day at the office,’ claims Gatland after defeatRead moreDupont hauled three Welsh tacklers with him, and Tom Rogers managed to stop him grounding the ball. But it was only a temporary reprieve. Soon enough, France were back in the Welsh 22, this time when Paul Boudehent hacked the ball on after it was spilled in midfield. He fumbled the pick up, but Dupont scragged Ben Thomas as he attempted to clear the ball off the back of the ensuing scrum. Tomos Williams got the ball away at the second attempt, but the clearance only invited the French right back at them. This time, Jean-Baptiste Gros was stopped just short of the line.The ball came back to Dupont, who unlocked the defence with a wizardly little chip to Théo Attissogbé, unmarked on the right wing. That was the first, then, and the second came soon after, made, this time, by Ramos’s basketball pass to put Louis Bielle-Biarrey through a gap in the midfield.There was some good stuff from Wales in among all this. Their scrum held up, Thomas seemed to find time and space to play in the midfield, and almost picked out Rogers with a crossfield kick in the French 22. They looked an altogether better side than the abject one they turned out in Cardiff last autumn. But they were 14-0 down regardless, and had already lost Aaron Wainwright, replaced by Tommy Reffell, and then Owen Watkin, which meant they had to bring the uncapped Dan Edwards on at fly- half and move Thomas across to the centre to cover for him.View image in fullscreenFrance’s Louis Bielle-Biarrey scores their second try.Photograph: Manuel Blondeau/Inpho/ShutterstockWorse yet, they went a man down after Evan Lloyd was sent to the sin- bin for a high tackle on Bielle-Biarrey. Attissogbé picked off another while Lloyd was off, made again by Dupont, who stormed up the middle of the pitch after stepping out of a tackle like he was picking his feet over something left on the pavement by a careless dog walker. Bielle-Biarrey got a second too, by turning Rogers inside out from a standing start after the ball was flung out of a rolling maul. Forty minutes gone then, and the hosts had already scored their four and earned a bonus point.The second half, then, had the air of an open training exercise. France cruised through it while their bands played in the stands. They ran through a defensive set after Wales won a penalty for offside during a rare foray into the French 22. The opportunity came and went when the French crushed their replacement front row in a scrum. That done, Fabien Galthié made six simultaneous substitutions in the 50th minute, and the rejuvenated pack duly drove their way over from a line out for a fifth.

It was the first time they had failed to score a point in a Six Nations game, which stung. A scrap broke out when they thought they had mauled their way over after Ntamack’s dismissal. They’re a proud team, and getting better, but the truth is that in the years since they last won here, back in 2019, the French have pulled so far ahead that the gap between them is as good as impassable for this side, or any other the Welsh could muster.Explore more on these topicsSix Nations 2025France rugby union teamWales rugby union teamSix NationsRugby unionmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

There were 55,033 diagnoses of the disease in 2023, compared with 47,526 for breast cancer.Coren’s urologist urged him to have the biopsy taken after Coren requested a prostate specific antigen (PSA) test from his GP a couple of years ago, along with his annual cholesterol check, and discovered his PSA level was raised.The NHS offers PSA tests to men aged 50 and over who request them, while men who have a family history of prostate cancer can speak with their GP about having a test from the age of 45.Coren wrote: “I had only asked for the test because such good work has been done lately to raise awareness, by people like Stephen Fry and Bill Turnbull – and latterlypoor Chris Hoy– and now here I was with a score of four, where higher than 2.5 is considered abnormal and facing imminent death.”This assertion was refuted by his GP, who told him: “It’s not imminent death. All men get it, if they live long enough. It’s a slow cancer. Most men die with it, not of it. And a raised PSA doesn’t necessarily mean cancer anyway.”Coren, an award-winning food and drink writer, has appeared on BBC shows including The Supersizers, Our Food and the F-Word with Gordon Ramsay. He has been writing for the Times since 2002.He is the son of the English journalist and humourist Alan Coren and the elder brother of Victoria Coren Mitchell.Explore more on these topicsGiles CorenProstate cancernewsShareReuse this content"

Because of a history of deep-vein thrombosis, she could not have a tag attached to her ankle. No wrist tag that fitted her could be found.On Friday afternoon she was released from Eastwood Park prison on home detention curfew. It is understood that a 15cm wrist strap previously deemed unsuitable for her was considered usable.Delap’s brother, Mick Delap, said: “Gaie is of course delighted to be back at home. She is enormously grateful for the support she has received not just from family and friends, but from many generous and committed individuals and organisations.”Initially, Delap was informed she would be released on 17 March but last Friday she was told it had been delayed until 7 April.Her release on Friday follows representations by her lawyer Raj Chada, at Hodge Jones and Allen, supported by the Good Law Project. When they received no response, a letter before action was sent to the Ministry of Justice.Lawyers acting for the justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, said Delap’s release meant there was no longer any need to reply to the letter. Delap’s legal team will not need to bring a challenge against the Ministry of Justice about her recall to prison on 20 December 2024.A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said on Friday: “Ms Delap has now been fitted with a tag and has been placed on home detention curfew.”Jolyon Maugham of the Good Law Project welcomed Delap’s release. “Although we’re delighted Gaie has been released today this isn’t the end of the story,” he said. “We are now considering what action may be taken against the Ministry of Justice and Serco, who provide tags on behalf of the government, for a breach of equality law.“The Good Law Project’s position is that climate protesters are being disproportionately policed. The public interest would be much better served if the police went after real criminals.”Mick Delap called the news a victory for common sense. “This is not compassion – it’s the law finally being applied as it should be. And her release today shows that if challenged peacefully by enough people, and if backed by proper reporting, those tasked with applying the law can be persuaded to do their job,” he said.“Gaie is keen that we shouldn’t forget the large numbers of prisoners, especially women, serving equally unjust terms of recall whose suffering Gaie’s case has highlighted.”Her case was one of 16 in the court of appeal this week. On Wednesday, 16 convicted climate activists called for judges to reduce their prison sentences in a rare mass appeal. They claim the terms were excessive and breach international human rights laws.The court of appeal reviewed the jail sentences related to four separate cases involving Just Stop Oil activists between July and September 2024.Explore more on these topicsPrisons and probationJust Stop OilUK criminal justiceProtestBristolEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

British officials say it was signed with the support of the US government but allies of Trump have since criticised it, warning that Mauritius’ alliance with China posed a risk to US national security.Downing Street said on Friday: “The prime minister spoke to the prime minister of Mauritius, Navin Ramgoolam, this afternoon. The leaders began by reflecting on their first months in office and discussed the strong relationship between the UK and Mauritius, which they looked forward to expanding.”A spokesperson added: “The prime minister underlined the need for a deal to secure the military base on Diego Garcia that ensures strong protections, including from malign influence, and that will allow the base to continue to operate. Both leaders reiterated their commitment to a deal, and they looked forward to speaking again soon.”Starmer agreed the deal to hand over the islands last year with Ramgoolam’s predecessor Pravind Jugnauth and with the backing of the Biden administration. This followed a legal opinion from the International Court of Justice in 2019 that the UK should end its control of the territory.However, changes of government in the US and Mauritius have since put the deal at risk.Ramgoolam hasordered a reviewof the terms, arguing they do not represent value for the Mauritian people. Having promised to pay £90m a year for ongoing control of Diego Garcia, British ministers are now offering to front-load those payments.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Eleven of the cities showed “significant increasing trends in rat numbers”, said the paperpublished in the journalScience Advances, and these trends were likely to continue.Over the past decade, rats increased by 390% in Washington DC, 300% in San Francisco, 186% in Toronto and 162% in New York according to researchers, who analysed public sightings and infestation reports.Some big cities, such as London and Paris, were not included because they did not provide the necessary data – but researchers said the findings would apply to many similar cities around the world. “There’d be no reason to expect it to be different in other places,” said lead researcher Jonathan Richardson, from the University of Richmond in Virginia.In Toronto, one of the worst-affected locations, a “perfect rat storm” has taken hold, with residents of Canada’s biggest city staring down a surging population.“When you walk the streets of Toronto, under your feet, deep in the sewage system, is a place teeming with rats,” said Alice Sinia, lead entomologist for Orkin, the country’s largest pest control company. “Increasingly we’re flushing them out into open spaces – either through construction or floods – and they have to go somewhere.”Toronto city’s helpline fielded1,600 rat-related calls in 2023, up from 940 in 2019 and Orkin has also experienced a surge in calls.“But the reality is, we don’t know how big the population is because no one has ever really studied it formally,” said Sinia.View image in fullscreenResearcher Jonathan Richardson surveys a rat infestation with students in the US city of Richmond, Virginia.Photograph: Courtesy of Jamie BettsTwo Toronto city councillors, Alejandra Bravo and Amber Morley,last year calledfor a formal management plan as a way to blunt the crisis.“It’s a really critical quality-of-life problem when people have all of a sudden been confronted with rats coming into their home or into their business or their place of work,” Bravo told theCanadian press, adding that it had morphed into a “kind of perfect rat storm”.Other cities with increasing rat populations included Oakland, Buffalo, Chicago, Boston, Kansas City and Cincinnati. The research focused on US cities, as well as Amsterdam, Toronto and Tokyo, as all of them gathered similar data on rat sightings. The research did not quantify the overall rat population, just relative increases in reports over time.Rising temperatures correlated with rising rat numbers, researchers wrote in the paper. As small mammals, rats struggle during winter, but in higher temperatures they can breed for more of the year and forage for longer.In Toronto, cold winters had long acted as “mother nature’s pest control”, said Sinia, killing off swaths of the population. But mild temperatures had helped rodents of all kinds in the city to keep breeding.The fact that rat numbers increased fastest in cities that were warming fastest was “the gloomiest outcome of the study”, said Richardson. Last year was thehottest on record, with average temperatures 1.6C above preindustrial levels.Rats causebillions of dollarsin damage by infiltrating buildings each year, and can transmitat least 60diseases to humans, as well as affecting the ecology of other species living in cities. In regions where they are an invasive species, they do huge damage to biodiversity. Research suggests people who encounter rats frequentlyhave poorer mental health. Globally, humanity’s “war on rats” costs anestimated $500meach year, according to the study.View image in fullscreenRats in New York, one of the cities with the greatest increase in infestations.Photograph: Anadolu/Anadolu Agency/Getty ImagesTokyo, Louisville and New Orleans bucked the trend with declining rat numbers. In Tokyo, Richardson speculated that cultural norms and expectations of cleanliness meant people were quick to report rodent sightings. In New Orleans there has been educational outreach on how to prevent infestations. “There are important lessons probably to be gleaned from those cities,” said Richardson.They lived through the ice age. Can the mighty musk ox survive the heat?Read moreResearchers say the best pest management strategies involve making the urban environment less rat-friendly – for example by putting rubbish in containers, and not in bags on the street – rather than removing rodents that are already there.Despite thousands of studies on lab rats, little was known about wild urban rats, said Richardson. “We need to know the battle that we’re fighting. Pretty much every city announces that they have a war on rats.”Sometimes there can be up to 100 rats in a single colony, which usually occupies less than one block. “I do not like rats,” he said, “but there is something fascinating about an organism that has been able to spread over the world and live in such proximity to us so successfully.”Explore more on these topicsUrban wildlifeThe age of extinctionAnimalsClimate crisisGlobal healthCanadaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

She lies back on a bed strewn with underwear and heart-shaped petals while a voiceover announces: “Over the past decade there has been a trend of using AI to create videos of celebrities like Scarlett Johansson and Margot Robbie in highly explicit and degrading scenarios.”Lawyers specialising in the field of sexually explicit AI-generated imagery have suggested that this might mean that Channel 4 is in violation of the act, as it specificallyforbids nonconsensually sharing computer-generated imagerywhichappears to show someone in underwear.“It could, I think, breach the Sexual Offences Act if this were a deepfaked image of someone taken without their consent,” says Clare McGlynn, a professor of law, who specialises in the legal regulation of pornography, sexual violence and online abuse. “Because it is an image that falls within that act.”The decision to include AI-generated intimate imagery of Johansson in particular has been hailed as particularly poor taste given how vocal she has been in opposing the sharing of deepfaked imagery of women.She has previously called it “demeaning” and talked of her frustration that “nothing can stop someone from cutting and pasting my image or anyone else’s on to a different body and making it look as eerily realistic as desired”.View image in fullscreenVicky Pattison hosted the Channel 4 documentary My Deepfake Sex Tape.Photograph: Rob Parfitt/Channel 4“Scarlett Johansson was one of the very first celebrities to ever be subject to deepfake sexual abuse,” says McGlynn.“She has had to live with this since 2017/18, so if it’s a deepfake without her consent, then I think showing it isn’t the best editorial decision, because you risk reproducing the harm and humiliation she has long experienced.”Some legal experts have pointed out that while Channel 4 may have broken the law with the image of Johansson, they would most likely be able to offer the defence that they had a “reasonable excuse” for doing so, given that it came as part of a documentary that they have previously claimed was raising awareness of deepfake pornography.“That would be left up to the courts to decide,” says Alice Trotter, an associate lawyer at Kingsley Napley, who has written about the regulation of sexually explicit deepfakes.“There are also exemptions … one of which is if the person who shared the image reasonably believed it had previously been publicly shared, and the individual in the picture had consented to the previous sharing, or it was reasonably believed that they had.”The decision to include Johansson has been seen in poor taste given her vocal opposition to deepfake imagery of womenThis is the latest problem faced by Channel 4’s documentary, after campaign groups representing survivors of deepfake abusecriticised its decision to release an AI-generated pornographic video of host Vicky Pattison, specifically warning that it could increase traffic to the sites they were fighting against.“Using that image shows a real lack of understanding about the issue and the real life harm that it causes,” said one campaigner, who requested to remain anonymous, having also had pornographic AI-generated images that depicted them shared online.“I understand that Channel 4 might argue that this was done to raise awareness, but there are ways to raise awareness without replicating the harm that we’re fighting against. It’s not just about nudity, and that is laid out in the Sexual Offences Act. It’s about the violation of someone’s identity and autonomy, and their consent. It all comes back to consent.”Scarlett Johansson takes legal action against use of image for AIRead moreLawyers have also raised concerns that using a potentially illegal image undermines efforts to change the law around creating deepfake imagery. McGlynn appeared in the Channel 4 documentary (without full knowledge of how it would be created) to urge the need for robust legislation that means forcing tech giants to act.“I think the thrust of the programme – trying to shine a light on this issue – was really positive,” she says. “My biggest regret with how Channel 4 have gone about it is that this [the ethics/legality of using deepfake imagery of a celebrity] is the nature of the conversation we are having, rather than the documentary having sparked a bigger discussion.“It’s really regrettable. We should be focusing on issues such as how the tech giants are involved – about what Google and Instagram are doing.”A Channel 4 spokesperson said: “Celebrities worldwide have been impacted by the rise in deepfake pornography. Channel 4 took steps to ensure we only identified celebrities who have been widely reported as being victims, and we blurred any sexually explicit content. As with all our programmes, we have ensured that we have adhered to all relevant laws and regulations.”Scarlett Johansson was contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionScarlett JohanssonMargot RobbieDocumentaryChannel 4Factual TVnewsShareReuse this content"

The Guardian has spoken to three women regarding their experiences of paying privately for gynaecological treatment.Rachel Bevan, a 33-year-old flood risk management worker from Aberystwyth, began experiencing severe period pains at the age of 16. “I was told I was just someone who has very heavy periods,” says Bevan. She was put on the pill, but when her periods returned after the birth of her son in 2022 the symptoms became worse.She saw several GPs, with some suggesting her issue was “muscular” or that it was “probably a urinary tract infection”, before being referred to see a consultant who prescribed her an oestrogen patch. “He seemed reluctant to believe it might be endometriosis, but after six months of still being in agony, I was finally put on the waiting list for a diagnostic laparoscopy.”When Bevan was told theNHSwaiting list was at least a year, and a further four to five years to remove any potential endometriosis, she was “heartbroken” and decided to go private.View image in fullscreenRachel Bevan was diagnosed with deep endometriosis and feels lucky she was able to use her family’s emergency savings for private treatment.Photograph: Rachel Bevan/Guardian CommunityWithin a month she saw a consultant and after an MRI scan she was diagnosed with adenomyosis and deep endometriosis, which is “tethering the back of my womb to my large and small intestine”. She is now looking forward to having a laparoscopy in the next month or so. “It’s a massive relief,” says Bevan.With the cost of the private treatment reaching about £10,000, Bevan feels lucky she has been able to use the family’s emergency savings, as well as receiving some financial help from her husband’s parents. “I’m still finding it hard to process, but I can’t wait to finally live my life fully.”In 2021 Abi, a 62-year-old communication tutor, realised she had a lump in her lower abdomen that was causing extreme discomfort and affecting her ability to go to the toilet. “I was quickly referred to a gynaecologist and was told I had several fibroids, one of which was the size of a melon,” says Abi, who lives in north Norfolk.View image in fullscreenAbi was a strong supporter of the NHS and struggled with the idea of going private.Photograph: Abi/Guardian CommunityShe was told it would be an 18-month wait on the NHS for a hysterectomy but the fibroids were stopping her from doing day-to-day activities such as lifting objects and exercising. “I am a strong supporter of the NHS and struggled with the idea of going private,” she says.“However, after discussions with my wife we decided that I couldn’t wait that long and by coming off the waiting list it would allow someone else to take my place, so we decided to pay using our savings.”Due to the size of the largest fibroid, she had a full hysterectomy costing nearly £12,000. The surgery was successful, but during a follow-up consultation she was told that doctors had discovered pre-cancerous cells which, had they not been removed, would have probably developed into cancer.“I was absolutely shocked and felt a mixture of relief and horror at what might have happened if I had to wait. I also felt guilty that I escaped cancer only because I was able to pay for treatment.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At that point I had also been noticing that my periods were lasting for 12 or 13 days.”This prompted Phillips to visit a GP, who told her they could refer her to a specialist on the NHS but the waiting list would be 18 months. With the pain affecting her quality of life, Phillips felt she had no choice but to see a private gynaecologist. “At that point I was quite desperate, my quality of life was really quite dipping,” Phillips says.Phillips was diagnosed with endometriosis by an internal ultrasound, with the private surgeon recommending she remove an ovarian cyst by laparoscopy. The total cost of the treatment was £10,000, but for Phillips it was worth it as it has greatly reduced the amount of pain she would usually have experienced. “For me, the surgery was worth that cost,” Phillips says. “I was in a position to have some savings, but I did have to borrow money from family as I am self-employed, so that was a consideration for me.“The cost was worth it because at the time, nothing else I was doing was helping ease that pain, and the surgeon seemed really adamant that this would make a big difference to me.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's healthHysterectomyEndometriosisWomenNHSPrivate healthcareHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here we look at the key findings from the module, the fourth of 10, in the inquiry chaired by Lady Hallett.The value of vaccinesFor all that went wrong in the pandemic, Britain’s vaccination programme, the largest in the country’s history, was a clear highlight. Historically, vaccines have taken many years to develop. In the pandemic, the first vaccines were designed, trialled and approved within 12 months.The UK became the first country to authorise a Covid jab and on 8 December 2020, 90-year-old Maggie Keenan became the first person to receive the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine outside clinical trials. The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine was approved weeks later.In an opening statement to the inquiry, Hugo Keith KC said that in its aim to protect at a population level, “the vaccine programme succeeded”. In the first nine months, the shots prevented more than 23m infections and 123,000 deaths in the UK, where more than 90% of people age 12 and over have received at least one dose. “It is beyond argument that vaccinated people were far less likely to get Covid-19 with symptoms,” Keith said. “They were even more unlikely to get serious Covid, to be admitted into hospital, or to die from it.”View image in fullscreenJonathan Van-Tam.Photograph: Covid InquiryThe creation of the vaccine taskforce, headed by the venture capitalist and Whitehall outsider Dame Kate Bingham, was a pivotal moment. Backed by £5.2bn from the Treasury, the VTF secured access to seven vaccines in development. Each was considered to have only a 5% to 10% chance of being safe and effective. “It was a form of spread-betting by any other name,” Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, the former deputy chief medical officer for England, told the inquiry.Key to securing the contracts was the provision of case-by-case indemnities to the pharmaceutical companies, meaning that rather than a complete bar on them being sued, the government would pay damages and legal costs in certain circumstances.There were problems, though. Ministers cancelled a contract with the French vaccine manufacturer Valneva weeks before its phase 3 trials reported. Bingham criticised the decision, saying it sent “the worst possible message to any future UK industrial investor or life sciences partner”.Therapeutics and antiviralsView image in fullscreenChris Whitty arrives to give evidence to the inquiry.Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty ImagesThe Recovery trial, one of the most successful clinical trials in history, proved critical in the pandemic. Led by Oxford University, it showed that a readily available steroid, dexamethasone, was a lifesaver. By March 2021, the inquiry heard, dexamethasone had saved about 22,000 UK lives and 1 million lives globally.The search for other therapies was not as effective. Hundreds of potential drugs were proposed early on, prompting a flurry of early-stage trials that researchers struggled to recruit for. “Many of them were ultimately inconsequential,” Keith told the inquiry.Developing antivirals was a particular challenge. Whereas vaccines and antibody therapies were well researched before the pandemic, antivirals were an area of “scientific weakness”, ProfChris Whitty, England’s chief medical officer, told the inquiry. Only two new antivirals were approved by the end of 2021.Ministers were heavily criticised for failing to buy Evusheld, an antibody cocktail from AstraZeneca. The prophylactic was intended to provide temporary protection, for six months at a time, for half a million immunocompromised people. Ministers decided against an advanced purchase, citing a lack of data. By the time it was approved in March 2022, the Omicron variant of the virus had swept in, raising doubts that Evusheld would still be effective.Bingham accused ministers of deprioritising clinically vulnerable people, accusing them of “following a very clear two-tiered strategy … in favour of those who were able to receive vaccines”. She called the decision “manifestly wrong, both ethically and morally”.Lara Wong, who spoke for Clinically Vulnerable Families, said: “This is a group of people who, through no fault of their own, and through the lack of the government’s action to find or procure this treatment, left them essentially locked up without any route out, and these people still live today with these same issues.”Problems with vaccine uptakeThe vaccine rollout did not go well for everyone. The independent Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) prioritised frontline health and social care workers, clinically vulnerable people, and the rest of the population by age. But some clinically vulnerable people didn’t know they were eligible, many unpaid carers had to wait for their shots, and guidance on how to get vaccinated wasn’t always available in the right languages or in accessible forms for disabled people. The information didn’t reach many Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities, an estimated half a million people.In line with standard practice, pregnant women were excluded from the vaccine trials, and the lack of data meant the JCVI could not initially recommend the shots for pregnant women. Pregnant and breastfeeding women were told to discuss the vaccine with their doctors, but doctors were similarly in the dark. When data from other countries showed the vaccines were safe for pregnant women, ministers changed the advice, but this caused confusion.Whitty told the inquiry: “The judgment was a perfectly reasonable one, but the way that it was phrased and the way that it was communicated, I think, made it much harder when subsequently we were confident that this was a safe thing to do.”View image in fullscreenKemi Badenoch gives evidence at the Covid 19 inquiry.Photograph: ReutersVaccination rates were far lower for minority ethnic groups than for white people. Prof Heidi Larson, an expert on vaccine hesitancy, highlighted a “legacy of mistrust” among ethnic minorities, driven by past and ongoing discrimination. Misinformation was rife, too. Beyond the internet and social media, false claims spread easily on family WhatsApp groups, the Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch told the inquiry.Vaccine risks and injuriesThe inquiry heard that the UK operated “a robust and sophisticated system” for ensuring safety standards for vaccines and drugs. But as the charity Vaccine Injured and Bereaved UK told the inquiry: “Vaccine injury and death are also part of the pandemic story.”Rare but serious side-effects became apparent during the vaccine rollout. The AstraZeneca vaccine was linked to rare blood clots and low blood platelets, while the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines raised the risk of inflammation of the heart muscle or the lining around the heart.The government’s vaccine damage payment scheme offers a one-off sum of £120,000 for people who have serious adverse reactions to vaccines and are left at least 60% disabled. But Kate Scott, from Vaccine Injured and Bereaved UK, called the scheme “inadequate and inefficient”.“It offers too little, too late, to too few,” she said. Some people who have applied for damages are still waiting, more than three years later.Preparedness for the futureA huge weakness in pandemic preparedness was the UK’s lack of vaccine manufacturing capacity. The government hadfunded the Vaccine Manufacturing Innovation Centrefrom 2018 but “there were not even stakes in the ground when the pandemic hit,” said Prof John Bell, who blamed the delay on “dithering”. The site was sold in 2022 and has since been mothballed.A new vaccine plant operated by Moderna will open in Oxfordshire in the summer, but the inquiry heard that broader investment was needed on a variety of vaccines, antivirals and other therapies. “One of the things we have to recognise in this pandemic was we were very fortunate that we got a vaccine quickly that worked,” Eddie Gray, the former chair of the antivirals taskforce told the inquiry. “We cannot guarantee that that will happen next time.”Explore more on these topicsCovid inquiryVaccines and immunisationHealthChris WhittyHealth policynewsShareReuse this content"

It was 2016 and also her first Christmas without her husband, Monty, who had died suddenly a month earlier.“I didn’t even want to be alive,” says Brodie from her home in Lismore, northern New South Wales. “I definitely didn’t want to go to the shops or buy presents or do anything. But Jo had come to stay with us [Brodie and her two teenage boys] to help out, and on Christmas Eve I told her my gift to her was that we could go dumpster diving, which I’d never done before – and we did, that night.View image in fullscreenNemeth hangs out washing at the multigenerational home she shares with her friend, her daughter and others in Lismore in northern NSW.Photograph: Natalie Grono/The Guardian“It was a revelation. The things we found, just thrown out by local businesses. We brought home perfectly good food for a Christmas feast and all these beautiful flowers we put around the house and they felt like a gift from Monty, a gift I would never have received if not for Jo. That was my introduction to Jo’s moneyless life.”A year earlier, in 2015, Nemeth had quit her community development job, given the last of her money to her 18-year-old daughter Amy and closed her bank account.“I was 46, I had a good job and a partner I loved, but I was deeply unhappy,” Nemeth says.View image in fullscreenNemeth volunteers at Lismore community garden.Photograph: Natalie Grono/The Guardian“I’d been feeling this growing despair about the economic system we live in and the harm I was doing to other people and to the planet, even when I tried to buy ethically, while I lived in this world of privilege.”Her “lightbulb moment” came when her parents, retired farmers used to frugal living, gave her a book about people with alternative lifestyles. “When I read about this guy choosing to live without money, I thought, ‘Oh my God, I have to do that!’”Soon after, Nemeth came across The Moneyless Man: A Year of Freeconomic Living byMark Boyle, who lived without money for three years in the UK. Following his example, the first thing Nemeth did was write a list of her needs.“It turned out to be a short list because I already had things like pots and pans and a toothbrush, and I discovered I really didn’t need much to be comfortable. Then I just started ticking things off, figuring out how I could meet my needs without having any negative impacts.”View image in fullscreenInstead of paying rent, Nemeth cooks, cleans and manages the vegetable garden.Photograph: Natalie Grono/The GuardianNemeth, now 56 and single, doesn’t own her own home or any property. Nor does she receive welfare payments or have any savings, a generous benefactor or a secret stash of emergency cash.At first, food was her biggest concern and the easiest need to satisfy. “I didn’t actually do much dumpster diving, I didn’t need to,” she says, because she was growing food herself and friends would give her waste food. “People often have things they’re never going to use in the back of their cupboards.”And whenever her birthday or Christmas rolled around, she would ask her parents for, say, a 5kg bag of rice or a packet of powdered milk.View image in fullscreenA community library and vegetable box that Nemeth contributes to.Photograph: Natalie Grono/The GuardianShe soon started tapping into the “gift economy” more deeply, giving without expecting anything in return, receiving without any sense of obligation.I wanted a tiny house – and a big life. Could I have it all in 25 square metres?Read more“That second part took a while to get used to,” she says. “It’s very different to bartering or trading, which involves thinking in a monetary, transactional way: I’ll give you this if you give me that. In the early days people would say, ‘Come and do this for me and I’ll give you such and such in return.’ And I’d say, ‘No, I’ll just come and do the work and you don’t have to give me anything’.”It’s paid off in unexpected ways. Nemeth is acutely aware she is in thefastest-growingdemographic atrisk of homelessnessin Australia. Yet, paradoxically, she has never worried about where she’s going to live.“I actually feel more secure than I did when I was earning money,” she says, “because all through human history, true security has always come from living in community and I have time now to build that ‘social currency’. To help people out, care for sick friends or their children, help in their gardens. That’s one of the big benefits of living without money.”View image in fullscreenNemeth makes items such as washing powder to save the household money and reduce its environmental footprint.Photograph: Natalie Grono/The GuardianFor the first three years, Nemeth lived on a friend’s farm, where she built a small shack from discarded building materials before doing some housesitting and living off-grid for a year in a “little blue wagon” in another friend’s back yard. Then, in 2018, she moved into Brodie’s house full-time; it’s now a multigenerational home that includes Brodie’s new partner and one of her sons, Nemeth’s daughter Amy, Amy’s husband and their three small children.Instead of paying rent, Nemeth cooks, cleans, manages the veggie garden and makes items such as soap, washing powder and fermented foods to save the household money and reduce its environmental footprint. And she couldn’t be happier.“I love being at home and I love the challenge of meeting our needs without money – it’s like a game.”View image in fullscreen‘I love being at home and I love the challenge of meeting our needs without money – it’s like a game.’Photograph: Natalie Grono/The Guardian“If you worked out the dollar value of everything Mum does in this house, she’s probably contributing way more than we do in rent,” says Amy. “But living with her now, I can see that her life is about so much more than not using money. I really notice the impact of things we do and buy.“Like, you can buy something at Kmart that’s cheaper than buying it from an op-shop, and I get that people just want to spend less money, but where’s that money going?”Brodie agrees about Nemeth’s positive impact on the household. “We live a lot more simply than most people, but it feels very abundant at the same time. We don’t have chocolate very often now, for instance, but when we do get some – as we did recently when a local shop closed down and gave away all its stock – it feels like such a privilege, which it is really.”View image in fullscreenBuy Nothing groups on Facebook are a place Nemeth regularly sources items.Photograph: Natalie Grono/The GuardianNemeth is quick to say she’s not “anti-money”, so when she realised she was going to need dental work this year, she found a way to pay for it that aligns with her values. “I’d been planning to teach people how to make tofu or apple scrap vinegar, share my skills, then a friend suggested I set up a GoFundMe campaign to create a dental fund and offer how-to lessons as rewards, so that’s what I’m going to do.”She’s not anti-technology, either. Nemeth has a phone (a gift from a friend) but no phone plan or sim card; she makes calls and sends messages and emails through the household’s wifi network. She also uses Facebook – mostly to browse Buy Nothing groups and to promote Lismore community garden, where she volunteers.

There’s no electricity or running water.“But I want to feel more connected to reality, to the birds and the stars and the sun and the rain. I feel really disconnected living in a big house.

Alex [James, Blur bassist] was hanging out with her at the time and he’d invited me down to the studio. I think we were all in a high party mode at the time. I sat down and had quite a good banter with her straight away.We were quite lairy with each other. I said: “I can sit down and write a song, a perfect song.” And she said: “All right, well go on then.” And I sat down and I wrote the song which became Green Fields in one go. I don’t remember a lot more about that evening, but that’s how I met her.We’d always hang out with each other when I was in Paris. She’d hang out with all the Nick Cave people. I didn’t see her so much when she got back to London and the last few years I didn’t really see her at all.She had always been highly regarded in my family house. My mum had been obsessed with her album Broken English. I can clearly remember her dancing around the living room singing Why D’Ya Do It?And as a person she was just lovely, beautiful, wonderful. I’m just going through thepictures of her you’ve got in the Guardianand the people she worked with – that’s quite a roll call. I bet you everyone says they absolutely loved her.As for her qualities as a singer – well, she was authentic. She wasn’t the greatest of singers, but then again, that’s not what made her so special. It was the life lived through that voice, that journey from being this seemingly sweet, innocent beauty into this incredible sort of matriarch of indie.Was she motherly to me? No. We always had a laugh. She had an endless source of incredible, somewhat salacious stories about people who had all become much more circumscribed in their behaviour. She was always a bit cynical about how people were transformed into pillars of the establishment. But she was always true to her creed.Blur made a song with her, called Kissin Time. I only vaguely remember it. I mean, look, we were just another of her backing bands.Rufus Wainright: ‘I partied for a week with Marianne … and my mother’There was never anyone like her, and there never will be. There was a strange dichotomy between this will-o-the-wisp flowery beauty and this hard, gnarly rock’n’roll figure. She had these two strains, which were very strong, and yet kind of complete opposites.She was a big fan of my mother [Kate McGarrigle], of the McGarrigle sisters, and occasionally she would come to their shows. I met her backstage when I was a little kid, occasionally. But it was really through [esteemed music producer] Hal Willner that I got to know her: he would do these tribute shows, to Harry Smith or Leonard Cohen, and she would show up. I always loved her album Broken English, with [the lyrics from The Ballad of Lucy Jordan] “She realised she’d never ride/Through Paris in a sports car …”. But when she did a Kurt Weill tribute with Hal, and sang the Ballad of the Soldier’s Wife, that’s when she really clicked.And then itreallygelled when I started hanging out with Carrie Fisher, because Marianne and Carrie were very, very close. I had several wild evenings seated between them, kind of along for the ride. They were completely classic, original legends, who seemed to live in a universe all their own, and it was very decadent, incredibly funny and totally rock’n’roll. One of the craziest times was when I had a week of partying with Marianne and my mother, which I’m not going to get into too many details of – it was quite intense. I think I went to rehab two weeks later. But we’d talk about music, funny jokes, sex, the craziness of life.Marianne was someone who struggled with addiction for many years, and she never quite won that battle. It was always haunting her. So I think, even if she was sober, there was a little bit of the devil in her, always, and on one hand you were very attracted to that, and very inspired, but you also had to be careful.But the main thing about her, putting the drugs aside, is that she was a great fan of music. She was really affected by a wonderful song or brilliant performance. She clocked pretty early on that I was on a fairly good [career] track, and she really was excited for me. And it was when she came to me and said: “Rufus, you’ve really made it”, that I knew that I had. I knew there wasn’t a modicum of bullshit in her assessments in general.That’s what I most cherish about the relationship with her: when she was clear-eyed, and engaged artistically, she was such a rich judge of depth and meaning, and the true brilliance of what music can be. There was nothing cheap about her whatsoever.Explore more on these topicsDamon AlbarnMarianne FaithfullPop and rockRufus WainwrightfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.And if you’re here because you’re not entirely happy with the coffee in your cup now – or wish you could replicate the £4-a-cup magic brewed by your local barista – then you’ve definitely come to the right place.Let me be clear: brewing good coffee doesn’t require magic or outlandishly expensive equipment. OK, fine – expensive equipment can help, in the right hands. But it’s by no means a necessity. With a little knowledge, anyone can make a life-changingly (or at least a morning-changingly) good cup of coffee at home.Here’s a quick cheat sheet of coffee-brewing essentials and a few tips to help you begin your journey. We’ll start with good-quality coffee beans and a decent grinder, move on to a competent and affordable brewer (or coffee machine if you can afford it) and round off the recommendations with a few pretty but non-essential fripperies.Essential coffee kit for barista-style brewsGood coffeeView image in fullscreenRed Brick£13 for 350g at Square MileThis espresso blend from the wonderful Square Mile – a roastery co-founded by James Hoffmann, author of How to Make the BestCoffeeat Home – is always on point. The precise blend varies from crop to crop, but it consistently makes a delicious espresso or espresso-based drink in my experience.View image in fullscreenEthiopia Werka Wuri£10 for 250g at Clifton Coffee RoastersYou’ll find a huge range of seasonal specialities flitting in and out of roasters, but you can’t go wrong with a good house roast such as the Werka Wuri from Bristol’s highly capable Clifton Coffee Roasters. This is a great showcase for the more delicate, floral, tea-like flavours synonymous with lightly roasted Ethiopian coffees, and it makes excellent filter, pour-over and potentially even cafetière brews. It’s well worth trying at least once.View image in fullscreenColombia Tumbaga Decaf£9 for 250g at Craft House CoffeeCraft House Coffee’s blend of reliably high-quality roasts, intriguing variety and sensible prices has kept me loyal for many years. Among my recent favourites is this Colombian single-origin decaf. It’s bright, subtly fruity, milk-chocolatey joy, perfectly scratching my afternoon itch without the caffeine buzz.A good grinderThe next stage in the process is the grind, the importance of which cannot be overstated. It’s usually better to pair a great grinder with a more affordable coffee maker than the other way around.If you can’t afford to spend big bucks on a grinder, then the key advice is to buy a burr rather than a blade grinder. Blades simply smash and crack the coffee into pieces, and are terrible at getting a consistent grind, making for a terribly uneven brew. Burr grinders have two spinning, serrated metal surfaces that crush the coffee to a more even consistency, so as long as the burrs are nice and sharp, they’re a better bet for a balanced cup of coffee.You can pick up a basic electric burr grinder for about £50, but bear in mind that not all will be a step up on a blade grinder – many cheap models use dull “false” burrs, which are little better than a blade. If you want to really up your coffee game, though, then pushing your budget to £100 or above will upgrade the evenness of the grind and, consequently, the quality of coffee that ends up in your cup. If you buy wisely, you’ll end up with a grinder that you can repair and maintain for many years.View image in fullscreenKingrinder K6£92.99 at eBay£99 at AmazonThis hand grinder is a great starting point for smaller single servings of everything from pour-over to espresso, with good-quality 48mm burrs and 60 clicks of adjustment for grind size. You can grind up to 35g of coffee at a time, and while the large handle still gives you a bit of an arm workout, it doesn’t take too long. It’s brilliant for camping or on-the-go grinding, too.View image in fullscreenWilfa Svart£99 at Wilfa£89 at Horsham Coffee RoasterIt doesn’t grind fine enough for espresso, but the Svart is a regular sub-£100 recommendation for coarser filter, pour-over and cafetière grinds. The design is smart, the burrs are replaceable, and the timer setting delivers a preset amount of coffee with the press of a button.View image in fullscreenEncore ESP£159.95 at Baratza£146.73 at AmazonThe Baratza Encore ESP is a great mains grinder for beginners. The ESP model increases adjustability above the standard Encore, which is crucial for dialling in a perfect espresso grind It’s also perfectly capable of coarser grinds for brilliant pour-over and immersion brews. Spare parts are plentiful, too, so repairability is top drawer.A manual brewerOnce you’ve ticked off the first two steps on the journey to coffee nirvana, you’ll need something to, you know, make coffee with. While I recently tested some ofmy favourite coffee machinesfor the Filter, there’s a lot to be said for manual brewers. They’re way cheaper than a half-decent machine and they make better than half-decent coffee with the tiniest bit of effort. Often, they can even be slung in a bag and taken on holiday to guarantee good coffee.There’s a winsome simplicity to a cafetière – if you can live with the occasional sludgy bits at the bottom, that is – but if you prefer a lighter, less intense cup, you should explore the results from other manual brewers such as a V60, AeroPress or Clever Dripper. And especially so when you only want to brew one or two cups at a time.View image in fullscreenBodum Kenyacafetière£26 at CafePod£12.95 at AmazonYou can’t go wrong with a basic Bodum cafetière. Themetal-framed Caffettiera model (£16.49) is prettier, but the plastic-framed Kenya model offers more protection to the glass carafe, making it a tad more accident-proof. Add some coarsely ground beans, pour in freshly boiled water and you have a recipe for delicious coffee with minimal faff.View image in fullscreenAeroPress£35 at Argos£35 at AmazonThe AeroPress is a small, plastic manual brewer that makes a stunning cup of coffee. The results can be mind-blowingly good, but be warned: the quest for the perfect cup may leave you disappearing down a Reddit-fuelled technique rabbit hole from which you may never escape. And if you really fancy your brewing talents? Well, you can always consider enteringthe 2025 World AeroPress Championship. Let us know how you get on.View image in fullscreenHario V60 coffee dripper set (size 02)£11.99 at HR Higgins£12 at HarioHario’s V60 coffee drippers have become synonymous with pour-over coffee. You can spend big money on itsceramic versionsorimmersion drippersif you like, but the simple, cheap, plastic V60 is a great place to start. Getting the very best results can require a little (or a lot of) honing of technique – aficionados will recommend a specialist pour-over kettle, as recommended further down the page – but the simplicity is winsome. Don’t forget to pick a colour that matches your kitchen decor.View image in fullscreenClever coffee dripper£20.99 at Clumsy Goat£35 at AmazonThis immersion brewer looks like a standard V60 but it’s far more forgiving for beginners. Simply stand it on your kitchen surface, add a paper filter, coffee and boiling water, then allow the coffee to brew for a couple of minutes. Pop it on top of a cup and the valve releases perfectly brewed coffee. It’s great for slinging in a travel bag or rucksack, too, if you’re so inclined.A beautiful cup (or jug)These are hardly essential, but if you’re brewing beautiful coffee, there’s something even more satisfying about drinking it from an equally beautiful cup. A good coffee cup is about more than just aesthetics, though; the best cups can also keep your coffee hot for longer.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

Take your pick from handle-free beakers, espresso cups and larger mugs – each adds a tiny spoonful of tactile, aesthetic joy to a fresh, attentively brewed coffee.View image in fullscreenPavina double wall glassset£32.95 for four at Bodum£32.95 at AmazonTruth be told, I bought these cups because they look pretty, but they’re impressively multi-functional. They may not look it, but they’re actually more effective than traditional cups or mugs at keeping coffee warm (or iced coffee cold). The secret is the hollow construction, which creates a thick, insulating layer of air between the two glass walls. Reassuringly, a little rubber-bunged vent on the underside ensures that pressure doesn’t crack the glass, and they’re dishwasher-, microwave-, freezer- and even oven-safe up to 180C.View image in fullscreenCarter MovemugFrom £29.99 at Coffee HitFrom £30 at AmazonWhat else could a coffee lover need more than this perfectly proportioned and achingly stylish travel mug? The Fellow Carter Move comes in three sizes – 8oz (236ml), 12oz (341ml) and 16oz (455ml) – and uses layers of ceramic, stainless steel and BPA-free plastics to keep your drink hot on your travels. It also comes with a little splash guard to prevent you from slopping frothy cappuccino all over your work clothes. Helpfully, you can brew straight into it with a Hario V60 dripper or Clever Dripper or similar, which cuts down on washing up.How to choose the right type of coffee machine for youRead moreThermal jugView image in fullscreenHario heat-resistant server, 750ml£58 at Hario£39.95 at Redber Coffee RoasteryI wouldn’t be without a thermal jug. This one from Hario has an ample 750ml capacity and a tough aluminium exterior so you can carry it without worrying about smashed glass. Pop a V60 on top and you can brew directly into the jug, which is a nice touch. Coffee then stays hot for a claimed 90 minutes – but I’ve had drinkably warm black coffee several hours later, even outdoors during camping trips.Gadgets galoreAmong the simultaneous joys and dangers of coffee is how easy it is to slide towards full-blown obsession over every minutiae. Could it be tastier if only I were using an [insert coffee gadget here]? In some cases, yes, of course, itcould. But that depends on how much time you have to master said item, and whether your palate can actually taste the difference. These upgrades are by no means necessary for the beginner – they’re just nice to have.Precise scalesView image in fullscreenMinipress coffee scale£31 at MiiCoffee£33.99 at AmazonIf any of these gadgets are an essential purchase, then it’s a set of scales. If you can measure out a consistent amount of coffee every time, then all else being equal, you should get a consistently lovely brew. These cute scales from MiiCoffee measure up to 2kg with 0.1g precision and have a built-in timer to help keep track of your brews, which is super helpful. You can buy a cheap set at a third of the price on Amazon, but it’s something of a lottery – I’ve had to bin a couple as they stopped giving accurate readings.Milk frotherView image in fullscreenNespresso Aeroccino 4£89 at Nespresso£119 at AmazonI’ve had an Aeroccino in my kitchen for years now, and it gets regular use for everything from topping up filter coffee to babyccinos for the kids. It can simultaneously heat and froth the milk – with a choice of two froth levels – but you can also opt for plain hot milk or even cold frothed milk if you prefer. It produces a thicker, more meringue-like froth than the silken microfoam you’d get from a carefully wielded steam wand on an espresso machine – or a decent assisted espresso machine for that matter – but for froth without the faff, it’s a winner in our household.Coffee kettleView image in fullscreenFellow Stagg EKG pour-over electric kettleFrom £139 at Borough Kitchen£165 at AmazonIf you’re considering buying a kettle designed solely for achieving a perfect, laminar flow of boiling water for coffee, then yes – you’ve fallen head-first into the coffee-brewing rabbit hole. It works, though. The Fellow Stagg EKG has the gooseneck design typical of the breed, providing a concentrated, precise stream for penetrating and agitating a bed of coffee grounds (or tea leaves) powerfully enough to create an even, balanced brew. With a 0.9l capacity and precise control over temperature (from 57C to 100C), this kettle ticks all the boxes.Flat push tamperView image in fullscreenRhino flat coffee tamper£29.95 at Redber Coffee Roasters£49.99 at Coffee HitThis may be a revelation for espresso enthusiasts. If you’ve already got a decent machine but struggle to wield a standard tamper due to limited strength or dexterity, then a flat push tamper is a great call. This cute one from Rhinowares is expensive for what it is, but if your espresso machine has a 58mm portafilter, then its adjustable tamping depth and simple, palm-friendly design may make your brewing life just that bit simpler and more consistent.Don’t bother with …View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesFlavoured coffee beansWe’ve all been there, walking around the local market or similar and finding a stall selling alluringly flavoured coffee beans. Beware: it’s rubbish coffee with additives. Coffee doesn’t need added flavouring. Great coffee well brewed will naturally burst forth with a vivid spectrum of flavour; cast your cup wide enough and you’ll discover varieties that taste of chocolate, honey, vanilla, blueberry, booze-soaked fruits and beyond. There’s a whole world of coffee out there – go explore.Expensive coffee scalesThink twice before splashing triple figures on pricey coffee scales. Indeed, add the word coffee to any product type and you’ll notice a dramatic price mark up. I wouldn’t endorse buying the cheapest scales you can find with 0.1g precision – I’ve had to bin a couple over the past decade or so – but if you can afford something a little nicer, such asthe £31 MiiCoffee Minipress I recommended above, then it’ll do the job. Don’t feel the need to spend megabucks.Barista cosplay accessoriesYou don’t need a premium rubber tamping mat or fancy-looking espresso knock box to make great espresso. Ask yourself, do you really want to spend £50 on a 1:10 scale replica of a plastic kitchen bin and a small piece of rubber? That money could pay for a far more meaningful upgrade, such as a new grinder. Or you could just treat yourself to some really great coffee instead.Sasha Muller is a freelance tech and consumer journalist, avid coffee drinker and craft beer enthusiast with more than two decades of experience in testing products and avoiding deadlines.

Elizabeth Bennet as a YouTuber! As the BBC marks the author’s 250th anniversary with four-parter Miss Austen, we pick her finest television outingsMichael HoganFri 31 Jan 2025 10.52 ESTLast modified on Fri 31 Jan 2025 10.56 ESTShareIt is a truth universally acknowledged that every article aboutJane Austenmust begin with “It is a truth universally acknowledged”. Now we’ve got it out of the way, we can proceed.To mark the 250th anniversary of her birth, new Sunday night BBC drama Miss Austen stars Keeley Hawes as the novelist’s sister, Cassandra, and tackles the long-standing literary mystery of why Cassie burned her famous sibling’s letters after she died. But how does it stack up within the canon of small-screen Austens? We’ve cast our net wide to include riffs and reboots as well as straight-up bonnet-and-breeches adaptations. Here are our all-time top 20, ranked from Plain Janes to Superbrains …20.Mansfield Park(1983)Mansfield Park is one of Austen’s least adapted novels and this stodgy BBC Two six-parter – the first-ever screen version, remarkably – demonstrated why. An earnest Fanny Price shared a screen with her terribly-coiffed cousin (and, ick, love interest) Edmund, joined distractingly by Gorden Kaye. At which point viewers said: “Sacre bleu, isn’t that René From ’Allo ’Allo?”19.Clueless(1996-99)Hello? As if. OK, so we’re stretching the definition of Austen dramas a tad but this TV take on the Californian high school comedy was based on the film which was, in turn, inspired by Emma. Sadly, the series lacked either Alicia Silverstone or Paul Rudd. If it were the film it would rank way higher. But it totally isn’t. Whatever.18.The Real Jane Austen(2002)This serviceable docudrama starred former Brookside and Emmerdale actor Gillian Kearney as the author but it was narrator Anna Chancellor – a distant relative of Austen, fact fans – who stole the show. Erring more towards docu than drama, it was a little dry.17.Northanger Abbey(1987)Made for the BBC’s Screen Two strand, this feature-length adaptation of Austen’s Gothic pastiche was atmospheric enough, if lacking in chemistry between its leads. Without Austen’s arch narrator, it struggled for nuance and ye olde lolz.16.Sense & Sensibility(1981)A year after their second-best pop at P&P (see No 12), the BBC made this version of S&S with some of the same cast and crew. The visuals have dated, the humour clunks and it’s all a bit boringly beige.15.Sanditon(2019-2023)View image in fullscreenTheo James and Rose Williams as Sidney and Charlotte in Sanditon.Photograph: Simon Ridgway/Red Planet Pictures/ITVAdapted from Austen’s unfinished novel, this frothy saga set in the titular seaside resort never found its feet. Nor indeed its channel. After one series, it switched from ITV to BritBox. But later still aired on ITV, confusingly. Top-hatted hunk Theo James also bailed after the first series, so they had to retrospectively kill him off. Not ideal.14.Miss Austen Regrets(1987)Based on Austen’s surviving letters, this bittersweet quasi-biopic starred Olivia Williams as the author. Approaching her 40th birthday (she died at 41), Jane reflects wistfully on her life and loves, while helping her favourite niece Fanny (Imogen Poots) vet potential husbands. The new Miss Austen (minus the regrets) is way better.13.Sense and Sensibility(2008)View image in fullscreenA rare sunny day in Sense and Sensibility (2008).Photograph: BBC/PAProlific adaptor Andrew Davies’s stated aim with this sexed-up BBC three-parter was to make viewers forget Ang Lee’s 1995 film. Hattie Morahan and Charity Wakefield played the Dashwood sisters, with David Morrissey and Dominic Cooper as their love interests. The weather was so soggy during filming that Davies added a gratuitous shot of wet-shirted Dan Stevens chopping logs in the rain. A knowing nod to “that” Pride & Predge lake scene.12.Pride & Prejudice(1980)It would later be blown out of the Pemberley lake water by the peerless 1995 version, but this five-parter adapted by novelist Fay Weldon is unjustly forgotten. Faithful to the novel and slyly funny, it looks a little fusty by today’s standards but otherwise stands up well.11.Emma(1996)Overshadowed by the Gwyneth Paltrow version, which was released the same year, this ITV film pulled in 12 million viewers. Samantha Morton was great as Harriet Smith but Mark Strong’s receding hairline drew attention to the age gap between Mr Knightley and Kate Beckinsale’s girlish Emma. Everyone’s relentless rudeness to the servants may have been period appropriate but it was still annoying.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Blake Ritson made for a winningly gawky Edmund, while Hayley Atwell stole scenes as Fanny Price’s two-faced frenemy Mary.9.The Lizzie Bennet Diaries(2012-2013)The first ever web series to win an Emmy neatly reworked Pride & Prejudice in 100 snappy episodes, originally released on YouTube twice per week. A media student starts a vlog for her thesis, a wealthy dimwit called Bing Lee moves into a nearby mansion, his try-hard hipster mate Darcy visits and we’re off. Supporting characters get their own episodes. Characters’ tweets pop up on screen. Addictive and innovative.8.Persuasion(2007)One of Austen’s more subtle stories was adapted with fitting nuance for ITV. Sally Hawkins was superb as Anne Elliot, with diary entries in voiceover taking us inside her head. Rupert Penry-Jones smouldered as Captain Wentworth, while Julia Davis and Tobias Menzies lent sterling support. Understated, perhaps, but it looks like a work of unparalleled genius compared to the 2022Dakota Johnson aberration.7.Northanger Abbey(2007)View image in fullscreenTwilight with corsets … Carey Mulligan and Felicity Jones in Northanger Abbey.Photograph: Album/AlamyThis ITV iteration is underseen and underrated. Felicity Jones sparkled as the Goth-fixated heroine with a rampant imagination. A young Carey Mulligan caught the eye as her two-faced friend, while JJ Feild made for a dashing romantic hero. With its steamy dream sequences, it was like Twilight with corsets and carriages.6.Miss Austen(2025)Why did Cassandra Austen commit “an act of literary vandalism” by burning her sister’s letters? Cleverly adapted fromGill Hornby’s bestselling novel, this gorgeous new series persuasively suggests Cassandra has been misunderstood by history, and paints a poignant picture of sisterly love. The fantasticPatsy Ferranis heartbreaking in flashback as young Jane. In case you need further invitation, it also boasts an amusingly idiotic vicar and some adorable pygmy goats.5.Emma(2009)View image in fullscreenSwooningly soppy … Romola Garai and Jonny Lee Miller in Emma, 2009.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamySmug busybody Emma Woodhouse can be irritating in the wrong hands but Romola Garai’s terrific portrayal in this BBC series made viewers root for her. Jonny Lee Miller charmed as Mr Knightley, the great Michael Gambon twinkled as Emma’s father, and Miranda Hart provided comic relief as the wittering Miss Bates. Sensitively rendered and gently ironic with a swooningly soppy ending.4.Death Comesto Pemberley(2013)View image in fullscreenKiller cast … James Norton in Death Comes to Pemberley.Photograph: Album/AlamyAusten meets Agatha Christie anyone? This gripping three-part murder mystery, based on PD James’s novel, was a cosy-crime continuation of Pride & Prejudice. Handsome production values and a smart script made it a respectful mashup. A killer cast was led by Anna Maxwell Martin, Matthew Rhys and Jenna Coleman. It aired at Christmas and made for near perfect festive viewing. Pass the Quality Street, darling mother.3.Lostin Austen(2008)View image in fullscreenLost in Austen.Photograph: ITVThis playful fantasy followed Amanda (Jemima Rooper), a modern-day Austen fan who stumbled into the world of Pride & Prejudice through a portal in her bathroom. She joined the Bennet family and tried not to ruin everything, while Lizzie (Gemma Arterton) was stuck in 21st-century London. A riotously fun romcom ensued. Hugh Bonneville and Alex Kingston were a hoot as Mr and Mrs Bennet.2.Persuasion(1995)This feature-length BBC Two drama had the misfortune to drop in the same year as Andrew Davies’s Pride & Prejudice and Emma Thompson’s Sense & Sensibility, meaning it is often overlooked. Directed byRoger Michell, it deserves way better. Amanda Root captured the essence of Anne Elliot and Ciarán Hinds was downright magnificent as Captain Wentworth. A tender tale of lost love and second chances with an exquisite ending. It rightly won five Baftas. Aye aye, Captain.1.Pride & Prejudice(1995)“Ooh, Mr Darcy,” indeed. A nation came over aflutter and had to fan itself whenColin Firthemerged wet-shirted from a lake like a Penguin Classics edition of Daniel Craig. Yet this peerless series was far more than its signature scene. Screenwriter Andrew Davies deftly combined Austen’s social satire with unabashed romance. An audience of 10 million were rapt as sparks flew between Jennifer Ehle’s spirited Elizabeth Bennet and Firth’s aloof Fitzwilliam Darcy. The all-conquering series kickstarted the Austen-aissance, flinging open the ballroom doors to everything from Bridget Jones to Bridgerton.

The majority of this year’s first-time narrative films have been cursed with an overabundance of eitherin-your-face styleorprecariously stacked ideas(or, even worse,both) and a frantic need to show how much one can do, often showcasing how little can be done well.But Russell, a TV writer whose credits include Beef and The Bear, is the rare freshman who knows exactly the right balance, often choosing less when others choose too much, his film a relatively simple yet extremely confident introduction. It’s a contemporary pop-culture riff on an obsessive psycho-thriller, the kind we were flooded with in the 90s in which an outlier enters the life of someone who has something they want, recalling Single White Female and The Talented Mr Ripley as well as something more recent and comedic like Ingrid Goes West. Russell takes this formula and extracts most, if not all, of the heightened genre elements to give us something a little more grounded, dialogue more rooted in reality and a canny realisation that murder isn’t always needed to create menace.The lurker is Matthew (Théodore Pellerin), a twentysomething retail worker who insinuates himself into the inner circle of rising music star Oliver (Saltburn survivor Archie Madekwe) by pretending not to be a fawning superfan. Matthew, living with his grandmother and seemingly lacking a social life of his own, has to work hard to make his way deeper inside, cleaning dishes and putting up with insults from Oliver’s entourage of laddish yes men, a believably off-putting and juvenile world new to some of us. Many would tap out but Matthew persists, and his refusal to fall at the many hurdles laid out nabs him a job as unofficial documentarian. Much of Russell’s film then swerves among forms of video, as Matthew films more and more of Oliver’s life, but he avoids stylistic overkill and, for a film that revolves around people of this age, keeps plot-reliant on-screen texts and social media posts to a bare minimum.Unlike, say, Ingrid in Ingrid Goes West or Tom in The Talented Mr Ripley, there’s nothing likable or tragic about Matthew (a tender scene of him dancing with his grandmother is quickly followed by him hilariously scolding her for talking while he’s on the phone). He’s a parasite, perfectly played by an uncomfortably on-point Pellerin, lacking the social ease and innate coolness that he sees around him, always lingering longer than he should, the kind of person who makes you want to leave a room as soon as they enter. His welcome is inevitably outstayed but Lurker isn’t just content with the well-trodden downfall of someone who is embraced and then rejected. It’s smarter than that, examining what a person would actually need to do to impress and then control someone so vulnerable yet so fickle, the learned portioning of tough love in a world where people are afraid to give it. What if Matthew is what Oliver needs? What would that say about the realities of being famous?Opus review – John Malkovich plays an evil pop star in a silly horror dudRead moreRussell is happy with light interrogation – his film is no grand social statement – and he’s focused more on his characters over what they represent. It’s also a pleasure and relief to see a film about pop culture ignore the obvious cascade of easy point-and-acknowledge referencing that plagues so many others and create its own credible world instead with music, crafted by Kenny Beats, that you never once doubt. As things go from bad to worse, it’s a captivatingly nasty descent as Matthew’s mask starts to slip, offering up the sort of clammy suspense that one hopes for from this territory without falling into the equally expected overwrought absurdity. The young cast are all superb, with Madekwe cleverly embodying that brand of alluring aloofness that so many celebrities have, never letting you know where you stand, keeping you on a knife’s edge instead. There’s also a great turn from Havana Rose Liu, doing a lot with a little, as a semi-assistant who pities then fears Matthew’s presence.Lurker is a film of easy targets but Russell avoids obvious jabs. While there’s a cynicism that clearly comes from someone who has done his time in both Los Angeles and the industry, it’s ultimately about something more human, and more unsettling, than just Hollywood. There are, after all, lurkers everywhere.Lurker is screening at theSundance film festivaland is seeking distributionExplore more on these topicsSundance 2025First look reviewSundance film festivalThrillersFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

On a five-a-side pitch at the top of one of the city’s many inclines, a group of determined girls are being put through their paces by a coach from Albion in the Community. They’re running hard, working through passing exercises, keeping warm. And at the side of the pitch is the Premier League’s chief executive, Richard Masters, standing under an umbrella looking happy.Masters describes the community and social programmes his competition supports as “the other half of the Premier League”. His trip to Brighton commemorates the beginning of a process that will anoint 100 “community captains”, celebrating the work of individuals in clubs up and down the football pyramid. He says: “I’ve always said if other stuff might be getting you down and you need an injection of enthusiasm, just go to a community programme and you’ll feel better about what you’re involved in.”Since taking the top job at the world’s biggest domestic football league in 2019, Masters will have likely needed the odd injection. Called “The Master of Corruption” by one Everton banner aggrieved at the club’s profitability and sustainability punishments, he is also regularly labelled as a puppet, either of the so-called big six, or maybe the red cartel, or the collection of clubs that feature on the mobile hoarding regularly parked outside Premier League shareholder meetings reading “Richard’s Masters”. He is the face of opposition tothe football regulatorand the man who puts noses out of joint when he doesn’t congratulate Erling Haaland on getting a new contract. He gets it in the neck most days.How Bournemouth became the Premier League’s latest model clubRead morePerhaps not unsurprisingly, therefore, he feels the Premier League’s work in the community does not receive the credit it deserves. “I think that Premier League football is part of British culture,” Masters says. “It doesn’t define it, but it’s part of it. There are more than 6,000 people employed by community foundations across the country, the Primary Stars [educational] programme is active in 19,000 schools. So yes, I do think we’re culturally relevant.”He also stands by the social values the league looks to articulate across the season. No Room for Racism, Rainbow Laces, the mental health campaign Inside Matters – all share a thread of inclusion, and the league’s support for equality and diversity comes at a time when such values are under direct attack from politicians. “The message that football is for everyone is non- negotiable,” says Masters, who rejects any claims of politicising sport. “I would just ask the question: ‘To what extent is making clear statements about discrimination, about racism, political?’ I don’t believe it is political. We are an apolitical, politically neutral organisation with multi-faith. Everybody is welcome. So to me these are not political statements.”This season the Rainbow Laces campaign was the subject of pushback from some players,including Manchester United’s Noussair Mazraouiand theIpswich captain Sam Morsy, who objected on religious grounds. Masters says the protest had “made us think about [the campaign] again” but not to change position. “It’s a very simple message of inclusion,” he says. “Everyone should feel like they are welcome at Premier League matches. It’s not enforced on players, it never has been, and to some extent it’s a shame that it’s been mildly politicised during that period. So whether it’s that message or another message we’ll continue to make sure that the LGBTQ+ community know that they’re welcome at Premier League football matches and Premier League grounds, whether that’s on the pitch, in the stands or in the employment chains.”View image in fullscreenA Kicks session at Brighton’s Manor Gym – Richard Masters says such community and social programmes are ‘the other half of the Premier League’.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianMasters says the modern Premier League is “four things together”. Not only “a fantastic football competition, it’s also an amazing story of soft power around the world, of inward investment and community social impact [which] make it unique. I can’t think of anyone else or anything else that does it in quite the same way. Of course we’re immensely proud of that and we’d like to keep all four of those things spinning at the same time in a positive direction.”The task of spinning plates usually ends with at least one smashing to the floor, and Masters does acknowledge some tensions between his four pillars. Such as the increase in ticket pricing which has caused outrage and organisation among match-going fans. Masters cites stats that show average ticket prices across the league are £39, and the £30 away ticket rule. However, with season tickets going up and concessions under threat he acknowledges clubs have work to do. “So our clubs, in my view, fully understand their fanbase,” he says. “We are 99% sold out at matches, that is a great thing and our clubs know the value of that. I think they will get it right in the end and ensure that football remains affordable to a broad cross-section of people.”As for the regulator, Masters remains unwaveringly sceptical, suspicious of mission creep and the throttling of the jeopardy he says is the key ingredient behind the Premier League’s success. “The essential theory is that in the interest of trying to do good in football, the regulator may come in and affect that ability to invest, that ability to inspire and the ability to deliver jeopardy,” he says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Whilst we have got the same name scratched on the trophy, it’s incredibly competitive still to win the Premier League. We’re not blind to long-term trends, and we do understand that we have a responsibility to the rest of the pyramid.”Masters has clearly grown into his role, more confident and relaxed than the man who had to hold the tiller as football was thrown around by the crises of Covid. Read between the lines of some of his remarks and there also appears to be more flexibility than previously. There are bigger challenges to come, Manchester City’s 130 charges foremost among them, a topic Masters says he doesn’t want to discuss. It’s an unrelenting job but one that has its benefits, and sometimes they can be found as the rain bounces off the astroturf.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueFootball politicsSport politicsFootball ticket pricesinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Will we feel the difference?Mabel Banfield-NwachiFri 31 Jan 2025 13.01 ESTLast modified on Fri 31 Jan 2025 13.16 ESTShareTax on alcohol sold in the UK is changing from Saturday, with an increase to match inflation, a cut to duty on draught pints and a shake-up in how wine is levied. So what is changing, which drinks will be cheaper and which might cost more?What is alcohol duty?Alcoholic drinks are taxed according to their strength, or alcohol by volume (ABV), expressed as the percentage of pure alcohol in a product and shown on the label.Under the system that came into force in August 2023, alcohol duty is levied on drinks that are more than 1.2% ABV, with a higher rate paid for every extra 0.1% in strength in order to promote better public health by discouraging the sale of cheap, high-strength drinks.The tax is typically paid by producers or when drinks are imported, with the cost then passed on to the consumer.What is changing this weekend?From 1 Februarya 1.7% reductionin the duty on draught drinks sold in licensed venues with an ABV below 8.5% comes into force – equivalent to 1p less on a pint of an average strength beer.The government hopes the move announced by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, in her autumn budget will support thestruggling hospitality industry, as such products account for more than 60% of drinks sold in pubs.Meanwhile, duty on non-draught alcohol will rise 3.6% in line with inflation as measured by the retail prices index (RPI).There is also an end to the temporary 18-month “easement” period in place for wine, under which all varieties between 11.5% and 14.5% ABV paid a flat £2.67 tax rate – increasing the number of tax bands for wine in this range from one to 30.Wines below 11.5% or above 14.5% were already taxed according to strength. Now all will be taxed according to ABV, with the amount of duty paid a bottle rising by 2p for every 0.1% increase.What prices are going up?Prices on about 43% of wines will increase as a result of the easement period ending, according to analysis by the Wine and Spirits Trade Association. The tax on a bottle of wine with an ABV of 14.5% will increase by 54p. Red wines will be most affected by the changes given their higher alcohol content, with the industry expectingprices on 75% of them to go upbecause of the shake-up.The increases in wine duty may not sound like a huge jump, but will cost the consumer millions in the next year, according to Sarah Coles, head of personal finance at Hargreaves Lansdown.“If you take a 250ml glass of wine at 13%, you’ll pay 8p more – 4p of this is the RPI rise in duty and 4p is due to the rule change.“Eight pence might not feel like it’s going to break the bank, but the changes are expected to cost us an extra £10m in the coming tax year.”The inflation-linked duty increases mean an 11% ABV 250ml glass of wine will cost 3p more. They will also push up the price of spirits, with a bottle of gin going up by 32p and a shot of 40% whisky up by 1p. While there is a cut for draught pints, that exception does not apply to bottled beer and cider. A 500ml container of 5% ABV cider will be 1p higher.What prices will fall?The Treasuryestimatesits change to tax on draught drinks will cut the hospitality industry’s overall duty bill by £85m. For regular pub-goers, the draught duty change may result in only a modest saving on pints. However, it is likely punters won’t notice any difference as publicans may not necessarily pass on the savings.What has been the reaction to the changes?Some organisations lauded the move as a positive step by incentivising people to consume lower-strength alcohol while supporting pubs. Wine sellers have warned their customers that prices could rise and their choices may be diminished.Michael Kill, the chief executive of the Night Times Industry Association, said the measures were “meaningless for businesses already buckling under the strain of rising costs and taxation”, and do not go far enough to support the UK hospitality sector.Explore more on these topicsHospitality industryTax and spendingAlcoholPubsTaxHealthAlcoholismexplainersShareReuse this content"

I can hardly imagine your distressMarina HydeIf China has done to Sam Altman what his OpenAI has been accused of doing to creatives, it would take a heart of stone not to laughFri 31 Jan 2025 09.44 ESTLast modified on Fri 31 Jan 2025 12.18 ESTShareIonce saw an episode ofAmerica’s Dumbest Criminalswhere a man called the cops to report his car stolen, only for it to turn out he’d stolen it from someone else in the first place. I couldn’t help thinking of him this week while watching OpenAI’s Sam Altman wet his pants about the fact that a Chinese hedge fund might have made unauthorised use of his own chatbot models, including ChatGPT, to train its new little side project. This is the cheaper, more open, extremely share-price-slashing DeepSeek.As news of DeepSeekplayed havocwith the tech stock market, OpenAI pressed its hanky to its nose andreleased a statement: “We are aware of and reviewing indications that DeepSeek may have inappropriately distilled our models, and will share information as we know more,” this ran. “We take aggressive, proactive countermeasures to protect our technology.” Oooooooooh! I want to say “welcome to America’s Dumbest Tech Barons”, except I can’t, because I think we all know that no law enforcement is coming to get Sam for the stuffhe’salleged to have madeunauthorised use offirst. That was the good type of alleged theft, whatever the claims of all thelawsuitsbelatedly trying to claw something back for the alleged copyright victims of his firm’s own inappropriate methods.So, to put it another way … wait, Sam – you’re not telling us that the Chinese hedge fund crawled all over your IP without asking and took it for themselves? Oh my God, IMAGINE?! You must feel used and abused. Financially violated. Like all your years of creativity were just grist to some other bastard’s mill. Like a host organism. Like a schmuck. Like Earth’s most screamingly preposterous hypocrite.Anyway, are you particularly familiar with Sam Altman? I think he’s becoming almost my worst one. Elon Musk remains the edgelord overlord to beat, of course, but honestly, it’s getting extremely difficult to avoid appreciating just how much of a super-irritant the OpenAI boss has become. Physically, he resembles the kind of actor who shows up to an audition thinking he’s a perfect leading man, but who gets cast as the puppy-eyed loner who just happens to take a trophy from each one of his victims. Which, in a funny kind of way, I guess he is. Sam’s got every living creative down there in hisbasement well. “It feeds my machine its script, or it gets the hose … ” I think I have to say here that he and OpenAI deny all this. The unauthorised scraping of human creativity, I mean – I’m not sure if anyone’s asked him about the basement well, so do consider that one unsolved.But where were we? Ah yes: the Altman journey. “To anyone familiar with the history of Germany in the 1930s,” declared Samback in 2016, “it’s chilling to watch Trump in action.” Well, now. Purely going on Sam’s own rather crass analogy, he now seems to have turned into one of those German industrialists who gladly popped into the chancellery for a slice of cake. And, indeed, for a slice ofthecake.But as I say, that’s Sam’s analogy – anyone who’s ever skimmed over his recommended books list knows he’s very much rooted in the business history section of the airport bookshop, and consequently shouldn’t be relied upon to produce a single comparison that isn’t with either the Third Reich or ancient Rome. If you want to feature on his recommended books list next year, just get the freebie version of ChatGPT to fart you out something called Rome: the First Reich. He will find it “fascinating”, “unexpected”, and “really thought-provoking”.Needless to say, Samwas thereat the inauguration of the current American caesar. As far as I could see, he didn’t make the cut of those tech titans placed in front of Trump’s supposed actual cabinet. I did, however, note that he was filmed having some bulging-eyed chat withJake and Logan Paul– YouTubers, podcasters, energy drink dealers, and “boxers”. I suppose one of the comic pleasures of these times is watching the nerds making common cause with the guys who would 100% have given them a wedgie in school, purely because they are now all rich. Money’s one weird side-effect is to unite some of the worst wedgers and wedgees.Alas, like the rest of theSilicon Valleyhorror-moguls, Sam is now a fact of all our lives, and – along with the Trump administration he is thoroughly cosied up to – is telling everyone how to think about DeepSeek. This is really a key dynamic of the next few years: being told we should be very worried about what the authoritarian Chinese are doing by Silicon Valley authoritarians we should also be extremely worried about. For us little people, the choice seems to be between being data-jacked and screwed over by the undemocratic Chinese, or being data-jacked and screwed over by the post-democratic tech bros. Once again, it’s the old syphilis or Ebola menu choice.The only thing worse than being this impotent and option-free is having to listen to the Silicon Valley gazillionaires whining about it all, and demanding more public money to defend themselves. But why wouldn’t they? Their whining always works. Every time they say we should get rid of all government subsidies while keeping their own, or threaten to abandon building projects if required to pay normal taxes like everyone else, they get what they want. Already Trump’s AI tsar is gibbering obligingly that it’s“possible”that theft of OpenAI’s IP has occurred.As the entrepreneur and investor Scott Galloway has pointed out on numerous occasions, big tech are thebiggest welfare queensthat ever stalked the Earth. They’ve all drawn vast benefits from public money, chased countless tax breaks and demanded even more. Far from being some heroic form of risk-taking done without a single handout, theirs is the capitalism of the school bake sale – someone else buys all the ingredients and does most of the cooking, and the kids then claim they have turned a profit for the good of humanity.Meanwhile, it’s left to sidelined Cassandras to flash the warning lights. This week, Yoshua Bengio, the Canadian computer scientist and a so-called godfather of AI, warned of theshock arrivalof DeepSeek that: “It’s going to mean a closer race, which usually is not a good thing from the point of view ofAI safety.” You’ll note that barely a day goes by without someone described as a “godfather of AI” coming out to caution against its increasingly malign potential and capabilities. AI seems to have more godparents than even Sleeping Beauty. And, regrettably, more than one significant prick.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDeepSeekOpinionArtificial intelligence (AI)Stock marketsSam AltmanSilicon ValleyChinacommentShareReuse this content"

This will only escalate unless western governments actFri 31 Jan 2025 10.26 ESTLast modified on Fri 31 Jan 2025 13.22 ESTShareAs if this world needs more bloodshed, here comes another major war knocking on the door of the crumbling international order. This week’sferocious assault and captureof the largest city in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) by rebels backed by troops from its tiny neighbour, Rwanda,marks an escalationwith far reaching consequences beyond Africa. It also exposes the complacency of western governments, who many Congolese accuse of paving the way for this crisis.The rebellion,known as the M23, has been snowballing since 2021. In recent months, M23 seized swathes of territory as it encircled Goma, a city nestled below a group of volcanoes facing the Rwandan border. This week, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, called for Rwanda to stop supporting M23 and toremove its troopsfrom Congolese territory, adding that the conflict had inflicted a “devastating toll” on civilians, millions of whom need aid. In DRC’s capital, Kinshasa,angry protesterslit fires and attacked the Rwandan, French and US embassies.The M23 rebellion is the latest in a line of several Congolese insurgencies backed by Rwanda’s president,Paul Kagame, over nearly three decades. A darling of many western countries, Kagame rose to power in the wake of the 1994 genocide, against whose perpetrators he fought as a rebel commander. He has long argued his interventions in DRC are driven by his mission to safeguard his ethnic Tutsi group, which has at times been the butt of pogroms and political persecution in eastern Congo and from which M23 draws its leadership.Yet the series of wars involving Rwanda and the Congolese state since Kagame took power have been about much more than this. Rwanda-backed rebels, who controlled much of eastern DRC in the late 1990s, extracted massive amounts of mineral wealth. After anational peace deal in 2002that integrated Congolese Tutsi officers and politicians into military and political institutions under the watch of the world’s biggest UN peacekeeping mission, some of them again rebelled in 2004 and 2008 as they pushed for more military privileges and access to power and local resources. Formed in 2012 as the latest iteration of those rebellions, the M23briefly took Gomabefore they were defeated the following year.Throughout the cycle of wars, western officials defended Rwandain closed diplomatic circles, routinely playing down evidence of Rwandan backing for these rebellions. Kagame had charmed donors with his government’s efficient implementation of aid projects. His western friends held up Rwanda as a feelgood story of post-genocidal reconstruction. Only when theevidence unearthedby UN security council investigators of Rwandan involvement in DRC became overwhelming in 2012, did the UK, EU and US finallytemporarily haltsome aid to the country. Todayas much as a thirdof Rwanda’s budget is still donor supported.When DRC’s president, Felix Tshisekedi, took power in 2019, he tried to reset the dial, inviting the Rwandan army into eastern DRC to attack and degrade Rwandan Hutu rebels, whose leadership included commanders who participated in the 1994 genocide. But by this time, M23 soldiers had begun to re-establish a camp near one of the volcanoes and were looking for outside support again. The rebellion escalated in 2021 after a series of stalled talks between M23 representatives and the Congolese government concerning the possible reintegration of some M23 membersinto state institutions.Rwanda had by then become an even more prized ally for the west. The UK’s Conservative government had hitched its immigration policy to a plan to deport migrants to Rwanda. In mid-2021, thousands of Rwandan troops began deploying into northern Mozambique, where a jihadist rebellion now backed by Islamic State has taken root around an area where a massive gas deposit is being developed by the French energy giant TotalEnergies. The European Union has provided financial assistance for Rwanda’s operations there. Brussels has also inked a minerals supply agreement with Rwanda, inviting criticismfrom rights groupswho say this legitimises war booty from Congo. Western officials, including the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, havedemanded that Kagame withdrawfrom DRC. But it is unclear whether they will force the hand of Rwanda’s president, who now also courts countries such as Turkey and Qatar as alternative friends.The Congolese government has meanwhile fallen back on a motley crew of military allies. They include regional troops from SouthAfricaand Tanzania, and a range of ethnic militia, including the Rwandan Hutu rebels that Tshisekedi had previously allowed the Rwandan army to target. Hundreds of eastern European mercenaries backing DRC’s army have surrendered. Some western diplomats now fear Congolese military commanders will seek Russian government assistance to fight against a rebellion that can be compared to the Russian-backed insurgency in Donbas.Western officials need to now use all their remaining leverage to demand the M23 withdraw and force political negotiations that can settle the political and material underpinnings of the repeated cycle of rebellions. If not, the war in DRC could yet draw in a number of regional actors, as it did in the 1990s. It could also open space for coup-mongering and Russian interference in the giant central African nation. That playbook has already unfolded in theSahel regionof west Africa. It must be avoided at all costs in DRC. The international order, already close to unravelling, will depend on it.Dino Mahtani is an independent researcher and writerExplore more on these topicsDemocratic Republic of the CongoOpinionAfricaRwandaUnited NationsPaul KagamecommentShareReuse this content"

Before she had even got throughher highly anticipated “growth speech” on 29 January, criticism flooded social media and the airwaves. Her approach is too scattered, some said, and too reliant on measures whose impact will be felt only over the long term. Some programmes run counter to the government’s environmental commitments, others said, and they are not evenly distributed across the UK. It is all too expensive. The Ryanair chief executive, Michael O’Leary, even went so far as todeclare publiclythat Reeves “hasn’t a clue”.Don’t get me wrong: the speech was not perfect. But perfection is not possible under the UK’s current economic and financial conditions, and to pursue an elusive optimum would be to make the perfect the enemy of the good. Moreover, Reeves’s speech did succeed in five areas.First, it reinforced the message that the government will go “further and faster” to boost growth – its “number one mission”. Second, it laid out several specific efforts – including planning reforms, reducing overregulation and improving the use of pension fund surpluses to increase domestic investment – to ease constraints on existing growth engines.Labour’s plan for ‘growth’ won’t take off, but it will leave ordinary people behind | Aditya ChakraborttyRead moreReeves also focused on the need to promote new drivers of growth, such as by creating a European “Silicon Valley” in the corridor linking Oxford and Cambridge, thereby scaling up these research hubs and the startups that draw on their breakthroughs. She wants to improve the UK’s trade relations to expand its available markets and attract more foreign direct investment. And, finally, she recognised that trade-offs are inevitable when pursuing a far-reaching reform agenda.Such a multipronged approach is what the UK needs to break out of decades of insufficient investment, lagging productivity, disappointing growth and shrinking growth potential. Reeves’s growth agenda is about enabling the private sector to invest, create jobs and expand. It is also about avoiding the 1%-of-GDP cut in public investment that was on the table last year.Of course, success will depend on whether the chancellor’s words are urgently translated into action. The various elements of her plan must be executed simultaneously and in an accountable fashion. That will require a well-coordinated, whole-of-government approach to “hardwire growth into all decisions in the cabinet”, as Keir Starmerput itbefore her speech.True, even if the government can meet all these requirements, its strategy may still lack some important elements. But many of Reeves’s critics fail to acknowledge the scale of the challenge and how she is stepping up to it. The UK has underinvested for decades and now faces serious growth and budget constraints.According to a widely citedstudypublished by the Institute for Public Policy Research last year, “the UK has had the lowest level of investment in the G7 for 24 of the last 30 years. The last time the UK was ‘average’ in the G7 for total investment was in 1990.” The result of this chronic neglect is a staggering cumulative shortfall of £1.9tn. Just imagine how different things would look if the UK’s level of investment had been merely average.Given such poor investment performance, any government would need time and luck (especially with respect to external economic factors) to turn things around. The lack of budgetary space leaves the government with no single measure, no magic bullet, to deploy. Even the best growth-oriented policy package would have to comprise a wide variety of measures. Implementation was always going to take time, even if it did not require a broad range of public-private partnerships.Ultimately, the Starmer government’s growth mission will fail if it does not secure the buy-in of companies and households alike. The currently low level of business and consumer confidence is a major headwind to stronger growth, better budget outcomes, and higher inflows of foreign direct investment. It is why the government pivoted from its gloomy talk about the economy to statements about economic performance “turning around”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That is also why it is unhelpful to reduce the multifaceted growth strategy to the third runway at Heathrow airport, the item that is attracting the most attention.In March 2008, I co-authored a paper, “Growth Strategies and Dynamics: Insights from Country Experiences”, with the Nobel laureate economistMichael Spence. One of our findings was that successful growth strategies hardly ever specified every step in the policy journey. Indeed, it is almost impossible to do so. Instead, policymakers defined their destination, embarked with only an initial set of measures, focused on implementation, and remained open to course corrections as more information came in. What they did not do was fail to get off the starting block because the strategy was imperfect, incomplete, or would take too long to bear fruit. They gave growth a chance. The UK needs to do the same.Mohamed El-Erian is the president of Queens’ College at the University of Cambridge and a professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania©Project SyndicateExplore more on these topicsEconomicsRachel ReevesEconomic policycommentShareReuse this content"

But his plans to improve school lunches and crack down on additives are laudableFri 31 Jan 2025 12.50 ESTLast modified on Fri 31 Jan 2025 13.44 ESTShareThe United States and Britain: two countries divided by a common language and by very different approaches to health, whether it’s how healthcare is accessed, what kind of food products are sold in supermarkets, what is advertised on TV or even what is in the water that we drink from our taps. Having lived in both countries for an extensive period, the UK, in my opinion, takes a more sensible approach to implementing pro-health and wellbeing policies, closely linked to EU regulations. But the US could soon be following suit, under a range of proposals from a surprising source:Donald Trump’s nominee for health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr. As I laid outlast month, many of his ideas are potentially dangerous for public health – frombizarre conspiracy theoriesto anti-vaccineviews and campaigning – and completely divorced from data and reality. But a couple of them could turn out to be beneficial.For example, the US still allowscertain additivesbanned by the UK and EUto be added to ultra-processed foods such as cereals, sweets and biscuits, despite the fact that they have been linked tohyperactivity in children. Kennedy has suggested this week that he will ban some of these in food products. Depending on what exactly he does, thisisn’t a radical suggestion: it may just put the US in line with what is done in other countries. It’s the same with his suggestions to regulate theadvertising of pharmaceutical productsand improve the nutritional quality of school meals.But what about his pronouncements about thedangers of fluoridein drinking water? In 1945, fluoride was introduced into US drinking water because of concerns about dental health and the rise of cavities in children. Fluoride is a naturally occurring mineral and is proven to reduce tooth decay. And the evidence does show that fluoridated water has important dental health benefits.Kennedy has vowed to remove fluoride from drinking water, claiming it is toxic. Yes,at high levels and when ingested (rather than just applied to teeth like toothpaste),fluoride can be toxic to the brainand can adversely affect the cognitive development of children – a recentJama Pediatricsmeta-analysis (which summarises other studies) showed that high levels of fluoride exposure were linked to lower IQ scores in children. Yetthe point at which fluoride affects neural development is far higher than the level found in average US tap water. It is also above the level that the World Health Organization recommends as the maximum allowable concentration in drinking water. In addition, the Jama Pediatrics article was published with two expert commentaries noting that the meta-analysis findings were limited – of the 74 studies included, 45 were conducted in China – and 52 studies were highlighted as having a high risk of bias.As with most things in science, fluoride isn’t absolutely good or bad. It was a tool brought in to help reduce dental problems – which it did effectively – and it’s worth constantly re-examining that policy to evaluate whether it fits with the latest evidence and state of the world.Does the US still need fluoride in the water? That depends on who you ask: we now have better ways of preventing tooth decay, such as seeing a dentist regularly, brushing with fluoride toothpaste, flossing and limiting sugary foods and drinks that get stuck in teeth and encourage bacterial growth. However, dentists are increasingly out of reach for struggling families and children in deprived areas. Some countries are still movingtowardsadding fluoride: England and Walesintroduced a billin 2021 to allow the health secretary tobring in water fluoridation–supportedby all four nations’ chief medical officers. It’s estimated that aboutone in 10 peoplein England have fluoridated drinking water, with plans to expand it further.Ending water fluoridation in the US would not be a major concern for me as a public health scientist – as long as dentists are made accessible. That said, Kennedy makingunfounded claimsthat fluoride causes thyroid disease and cancer doesn’t help inform the real public debate over fluoridation.I’m more focused on whether he maintains the childhood vaccination schedule (for example against measles, whooping cough and mumps) and whether he is able to bring the US in line with the UK and the EU in terms of what is permitted to be added to foods that we buy from our shops. This might mean saying adios to the artificial food dyes used in cereals such asFroot Loops and Lucky Charms, but if it means parents being able to buy food products checked for safety for their children and healthier school lunches, that’s a huge step forward, no matter who initiates it.Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of EdinburghDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

We’re ready to work with Westminster to forge closer bonds with EuropeJohn Swinney is the first minister of ScotlandFri 31 Jan 2025 07.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 31 Jan 2025 11.57 ESTShareThe pantomime season may be over, but when it comes to the government’s much-repeated claim to be pursuing economic growth above all else, the cry of “It’s behind you” is sounding ever louder. This classic panto joke works when everyone in the audience can see something clearly but the character on stage pretends not to. So it is with Boris Johnson’sBrexitdeal and Rachel Reeves’s attempts to kickstart the economy. Reeves and Keir Starmer are ignoring what is blindingly obvious to everyone else: Brexit is a significant drag on Britain’s growth prospects. They know it’s true but refuse to acknowledge it and, more importantly, to do anything about it.There is, however, nothing comical about this situation. The hard Brexit negotiated by Johnson took the UK out of the EU, the single market and the customs union and brought an end to freedom of movement. As a result, people are paying the price throughhigher food bills, lower growth and therefore lower tax revenue that could and should be spent on the NHS.Today marks the fifth anniversary of the UK formally leaving this great project – in which countries come together on the basis of agreed values – to share and enhance sovereignty for the common good. For Starmer, however, it seems Nigel Farage is more of an influence on his decision-making than the interests ofScotland, where European freedom of movement in particular enriched our country in so many ways, culturally and economically.To be clear, I don’t see freedom of movement as merely a trade-off to secure business access to the huge single market. They are complementary benefits, helping business, communities and our world-class universities. Enabling people to live, love, work and study across the European Union is one of the EU’s great achievements. And, of course, Brexit was driven through despite the fact thatScotland, as well asNorthern Ireland, voted decisively to remain in the EU. This itself calls into question the idea of the UK as a voluntary union of equal partners.The EU is not perfect, but its founding values – human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights – are precious fundamentals in our society that I want to protect and nurture. Those values are, however, being challenged internally and externally. So, as the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, made clear in herspeech in Davoslast week, that is all the more reason for countries that believe in cooperation to continue to work together in a shared endeavour to champion those values.For many people, although those values will be keenly felt, it is the economic cost that matters most. This week the Scottish government presented yetmore evidenceof the continuing damage to trade and GDP as a result of hard Brexit. It simply isn’t possible to claim that growth is the number one priority while engaging in a Westminster conspiracy of silence over Brexit. Labour appears to be casting around in an ever greater panic for ideas to boost growth, while ignoring all the evidence of the damage caused by the Brexit deal it inherited but refuses to seek to change in any meaningful way.I believe it is time to fight back against that hard Brexit Westminster consensus. In the short term, the government needs to clarify urgently what it actually wants from its much-vaunted “reset” of European relations. The Scottish government is clear on our priorities: for example, we need an ambitiousveterinary agreementto help our food and drink industry; we need closer cooperation on energy to help boost investment and tackle the climate emergency; and we badly need a youth mobility scheme to open up greater educational opportunities for our young people again.A bolder and necessary step would be to join the single market and the customs union and refuel our trade withEurope. The Scottish government would be a willing partner with the UK government and the EU in pursuit of those goals, which would have a real impact on people’s lives. I urge the government therefore to think again about its self-defeating red lines and to seek a genuinely closer relationship with our fellow Europeans.For Scotland, the real prize, of course, is to become a member state in our own right for the first time. It is striking that EU countries very similar to Scotland enjoy higher productivity and greater equality than the UK. For Ireland, it has been said persuasively that it was the policy flexibility that came with independence, alongside EU membership, that enabled economic take-off.For the rest of the UK, it seems inevitable that the journey back to being an EU member state will start at some point. Surely it is better to start that journey now than to continue to put up with such ongoing, needless economic damage.John Swinney is the first minister of ScotlandExplore more on these topicsBrexitOpinionEuropean UnionEuropeScotlandLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

It was also a warning shot to wavering Labour MPs. The message was blunt: get on board with the government’s economic strategy or step aside. Growth, we were told, is the non-negotiable mission.This was not a sudden shift but a reaffirmation ofher stance at Davos, where she made clear that “the answer can’t always be no”. That answer, now firmly codified, prioritises GDP growth above all else.Heathrow airport expansionis in; net zero,bats and newts are out. The promise? A revitalised economy, busy high streets and more bobbies on the beat – a Labour-friendly vision of progress designed to bolster morale and stuff leaflets with “good news” ahead of the next election.This strategy is fraught with risk. Some may call it bold; others, a sign of desperation. A growing suspicion looms that our government lacks a coherent governing philosophy or ideological compass beyond the vague pursuit of “growth”. But if growth at any cost is the mantra, the costs will soon become painfully clear. Why pledge to be clean and green, only to undermine that commitment with a Heathrow expansion promise six months later? Burning the furniture to stay warm doesn’t signal confidence – it reeks of panic.Labour’s plan for ‘growth’ won’t take off, but it will leave ordinary people behind | Aditya ChakraborttyRead moreRegardless of the motivation, Labour has crossed the Rubicon. Approving Heathrow expansion is an irreversible break with our pre-election pledges. In 2021, Reeves stood in front of the Labour party conference and declared that she would be the “first-ever green chancellor”. Now, Labour isaccused of obstructingtheclimate and nature billand abandoning its ambitious decarbonisation plans. The rapid turnaround is striking.There is also an international dimension. Has Donald Trump’s resurgence made it easier for Labour to jettison some of its social and environmental commitments? Some may argue that when mass deportations and the dismantling of the state are politically feasible in one of our closest allies, progressives here should be grateful for a Labour government – even one shifting ever rightwards. But the Heathrow expansion and the realignment it signals do not insulate the UK from the political forces that enabled Trump, it accelerates them. Remember our pledge torebuild trust in politics? Climate U-turns like this do the exact opposite. Indeed, they fuel the very climate scepticism the right peddles. After all, if we genuinely think the climate crisis is an existential threat, why undermine combatting it?As much as it pains me to say, Heathrow is just the most visible indicator of Labour’s shift. The changes are stacking up.BlackRock’s influence is growing. Austerity and deregulation are back in fashion. Zero tolerance for benefit fraud is in; stricter taxation onnon-doms is out. Post-2008 banking regulations areset to be dismantled, while the long-touted climate and nature bill is quietly sidelined.This raises the fundamental question: whose growth are we talking about? We know that the economic benefits of Heathrow expansion, AI development and financial and planning deregulation will not be evenly distributed. The winners will be the same old symbols of financial capitalism’s excesses – property developers pushing high-rise luxury flats while social housing crumbles; financial institutions such as BlackRock dictating investment priorities that benefit the wealthiest; and corporations such as Amazon,notorious for union-bustingand exploitative labour practices, reaping profits from deregulation.The losers? The very working-class communities thatLabourhas to champion, who will probably see little of the wealth generated while facing increased job insecurity from AI disruption, unaffordable housing due to continued speculative investment and environmental degradation from unbridled development.The economic orthodoxy the chancellor is embracing has been tried before. Joe Biden’s Democrats achieved GDP growth but still struggled against Trump’s populism. Why? Because growth, when concentrated in the hands of the few, does not translate into security or prosperity for the many. Starmer understood this implicitly when he stated back in 2022 thattrickle-down economics “is a piss take”.Reeves once championed the foundation economy – lifelong learning, public services, local industries and wealth redistribution. Whatever happened to that vision? Instead of pinning hopes on trickle-down promises from Heathrow and hedge funds, Labour should be levelling up wealth, not just GDP statistics.That means “growth” that serves people, not just profit. Of course, investing in AI, the life sciences and renewable energy is critical, but so too is sustainable farming,rewildingand well-paid jobs in adult social care – an urgent necessity for an ageing society, yet perpetually sidelined.The choices Labour is making will define not just its electoral prospects but the political landscape of the UK for years to come. This is not just about Heathrow, banking regulations or benefit fraud crackdowns. It is about whether my party can offer a vision of growth that actually works for the people who need it most – or whether it will leave that space open for its populist opponents to fill.Clive Lewis is the Labour MP for Norwich SouthExplore more on these topicsEconomic policyOpinionEconomic growth (GDP)Heathrow third runwayRachel ReevesKeir StarmerLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

The Astute-class attack vessel is still being built, but on Sunday night, the Royal Navy announced that what was to become HMS Agincourt would, instead, be given the more Franco-friendly name of HMS Achilles. Up popsGrant Shapps, the former Conservative defence secretary, to dust off his opportunism and accuse the navy of bending to Labourite “woke nonsense”. It’s just like riding a bike!The naming of ships in this country is famously fraught after the saga of Boaty McBoatface, one of those jokes that was supposed to advertise the country’s jaunty irreverence and ended up being flogged into tiresome half wittedness. But back to the submarine formerly known as Agincourt. The government insists the vessel hasn’t been renamed because it might make the French feel bad, but rather to pay tribute to a previous ship of the same name that received “battle honours” during the second world war.View image in fullscreenThe jumpiness over naming the Astute-class submarine brought back memories of Boaty McBoatface.Photograph: CPOA (photo) Thomas McDonald/British Ministry of Defence/EPAThis would be more credible if Achilles had been the first idea out of the gate and not the substitution for a name that honoured the defeat of the French by Henry V at Agincourt in 1415. Times Radio, meanwhile, managed to whistle up an angry formerRoyal Navycommander, Chris Parry, who had the courtesy to deliver exactly what they were looking for and call the renaming a “craven and contemptible surrender to ideology being pushed by the government”. We must be grateful no one put in a call to the British Legion. (The Daily Express probably did. I can’t bring myself to look.)TuesdayIt was Kennedy vs Kennedy in the US Senate this week at the confirmation hearing for the presumptive health secretary and anti-vaxxer,Robert F Kennedy Jr. The son of RFK came up against perhaps the only person in the US with greater surname capital than his own – Caroline Kennedy, the daughter of JFK, which makes her assuredly an outranking FK – who released a video in which she read out a statement enumerating all the ways in which her first cousin was a terrible person who was unfit for office.Caroline Kennedy wasn’t messing around. Like a playful assassin, she opened gently, referring to RFK Jnr as “Bobby” and contextualising him fondly as one of “a close generation of 28 cousins who have been through a lot together”. That tone soon evaporated. Bobby, said Caroline, was “dangerous and wilfully misinformed” on vaccines, lacking in any relevant medical or government experience, and wholly unsuited to the job of health secretary. And this was just the warm-up.Reminding us that the Kennedys didn’t accumulate their wealth and influence via charm alone, Caroline then flatly informed the Senate panel and the American public that her cousin was a “predator”, who, “no surprise”, keeps birds of prey and – who saw this detail coming? – once “put baby chickens and mice in a blender to feed his hawks”. We look forward to the Republican-run Senate confirming RFK Jr to take his rightful place alongside Kristi Noem, the freshly confirmed homeland security secretary, who admitted in her recent memoir to having shot her dog.WednesdayTo the theatre, to see the acclaimed adaptation of Annie Ernaux’s book of auto-fiction, The Years. The five women in the cast are fantastic, the staging is perfect, and – bonus drama – the “graphic scenes” of abortion that have been knocking out audience members intermittently since the play opened, caused someone in the audience to faint. The show stopped for 10 minutes.As the action resumed, I found myself wondering if it was a man or a woman who’d keeled over. The scene was graphic to the extent that fake blood poured down the character’s legs and the dialogue painted an even grimmer and more upsetting picture. Still – and sorry to be gross – the experience of having your bathroom turning into a scene from Straw Dogs is pretty familiar to most women I know, especially if they’re approaching menopause. I assume it was a man who passed out.Anyway, on with the play, in which there were cigarettes and existentialism and of course, blood, very much in line with the French idea of womanhood as hard work and less aligned perhaps with the British fondness for defensive flippancy. As we left the theatre, an older British lady in front of us laughed and remarked to her companion: “I think we’ll need some ice-cream after that.” Well said, madam.View image in fullscreenJennifer Aniston’s menopause-focused workout gives a historically ignored demographic its moment of rigorous commercial exploitation.Photograph: Jae C Hong/Invision/APThursdayMenopausal ladies are big business at the moment. After Davina McCall’s and Jen Gunter’s bestselling menopause books, comes Dare I Say It, a menopause memoir by movie star Naomi Watts, and a new “viral” menopause workout byJennifer Aniston.Aniston’s partnership with a fitness brand called Pvolve – no, I don’t get it, either – offers a rigorous programme of low-impact exercise designed for middle-aged women. Fine, lovely, it’s nice to see a historically ignored demographic get our moment of rigorous commercial exploitation. The upside to the Pvolve programme is that you don’t have to leave your house to do it. The downside is that it involves buying a load of Pvolve-branded gear – an exercise ball, a “heavy ankle board”, “glider discs” – to gather dust in your house when, two weeks into the programme, you understand you are not turning into Jennifer Aniston and give up.FridayAn impact of the pandemic on very young children is that, according to a survey of 1,000 teachers released this week, many of those who started reception last year spoke with vaguely American accents from too much screen time and were “unable to climb a staircase”. Intellectually, I understand the concerns this might raise, but from experience it all looks normal to me. When my own tiny three-year-olds started the equivalent of reception, they spoke with American accents, struggled with stairs because we didn’t have any, and one of them was still in pull-ups. Somewhere in the intervening seven years we figured it out.Explore more on these topicsRobert F Kennedy JrDigested weekTrump administrationJennifer AnistonChildrenSchoolsMenopauseRoyal NavycommentShareReuse this content"

When the meeting was set last year, few expected US aggression toward a European nation to be on the agenda. But initial incredulity at Donald Trump’s bellicose claims on Greenland, a Danish territory, has been followed by shockedexpressionsof solidarity with Denmark’s prime minister, Mette Frederiksen. A bullying 45-minutephone callbetween Mr Trump and Ms Frederiksen was described as “horrendous”.So it begins. AsEuropereacquaints itself with Mr Trump’s aggressive “America First” brand of diplomacy, further such provocations can be guaranteed. Fighting talk emanating from the White House will sometimes be a prelude to eventual compromise. But there can be no doubt that the challenges raised by the president’s second coming are substantial and wide-ranging.Threatenedtariffs, levied in response to EU tradesurpluses, would hit economies already suffering from anaemic levels of growth and an ongoing cost of living crisis. Mr Trump’s big tech acolytes are determined toundermineBrussels’ attempts to properly regulate social media, and protect their own overweening power to influence debate. On Ukraine, the EU will need to fight to be inside the room to ensure that an unjust peace deal is not imposed by Washington on Kyiv. And the impact of EUenvironmental regulationson American businesses is set to become another Trumpian cause célèbre.As Emmanuel Macron and Olaf Scholzarguedat a joint press conference the day after the inauguration, unity of purpose will be critical if European interests and values are to be adequately defended. Sadly, the circumstances for achieving that are unpropitious. The French president and German chancellor both preside over countries mired in domestic politicalcriseslikely to stretch into the summer and beyond.Further complicating matters, the rise of populist nationalist parties across the continent threatens Maga-style disruption within the EU,cheered onby Elon Musk. In Berlin, the traditional cordon sanitaire excluding the far right from mainstream politics was ominouslybreachedthis week as Friedrich Merz, Germany’s likely next chancellor, relied on Alternative für Deutschland votes to pass an opposition motion despite previously pledging not to – drawing criticism fromAngela Merkel, his most successful predecessor as Christian Democratic Union leader.But a brighter scenario would be one in which four more years of Mr Trump catalyse a pragmatic reset that is overdue. As Mr Macron hasadvocated, the EU has the chance to respond to a transformed global context by leveraging its own strengths as a market of 450 million people, and deepening strategic autonomy in areas such as defence, tech and AI, and the green transition.That will take economic ambition. Acting on theDraghi reporton European competitiveness, Brussels should belatedly abandon the doctrinaire fiscal conservatism that has prioritised debt reduction over investment and growth. If the EU is to stand up to Mr Trump, and fulfil its obligations and pledges to Ukraine, it needs to liberate the collective resources to do so. After four decades of championing free trade, Europe has been slow to adapt to a new era of geopolitical rivalry. Mr Trump’s re-election suggests his brutal, transactional style isn’t an anomaly but is becoming the new normal. To deal with a new kind of United States, a new kind of Europe will be required.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

As Silicon Valley bosses were expressing concerns about “the distillation” of their models with the launch of theChinese DeepSeek chatbotearlier this week, the House of Lords was debating legislation to protect against unfettered data crawling by AI.Sir Elton John has joinedSir Paul McCartneyin calling for new rules to prevent tech companies from riding “roughshod over the traditional copyright laws that protect artists’ livelihoods”. Apetitionagainst the unlicensed use of creative works for training generative AI now has more than 40,000 signatories including Julianne Moore, Kazuo Ishiguro, Kate Bush and Sir Simon Rattle. It is a battle that has united artists of every kind.They are outraged at UK governmentplansto weaken copyright laws, and are urging greater transparency, control and financial remuneration to counter the challenge of AI.The UK has a “gold standard” copyright regime and the oldest in the world. TheStatute of Anne, passed in 1710, gave authors the right to control their work. Now the government is seeking to turn this law on its head byproposing exemptions, where the onus would be on the rights holder to opt out of their content being taken free of charge, and for them to trace how it is being used.Kate Mosse, the bestselling author and co-founder of the Women’s prize for fiction, likens the AI model to a thief stealing all the Mars bars from a shop on the grounds that no one told them they weren’t allowed to do to so. The peer, film‑maker and digital rights campaigner Beeban Kidron has said we should not “redefine the notion of theft”.Her amendmentto the government’s data bill, stating that data is licensed by default, was accepted by the House of Lords onTuesday.In the UK, adapting a novel for TV or film needs permission and payment unless it is public domain. Covering a song? No permission needed, but royalties apply – unless the lyrics or melody is changed, which requires consent. Even reproducing lyrics requires both permission and a fee, unless fair dealing applies.ChatGPT“knows” this and it cannot reproduce song words “due to copyright restrictions”. As Philip Pullman notes: “The principle is simple ... if we want to enjoy the work that someone does, we should pay for it”.Labour must not be dazzled by the shininess of the tech industry and the promise of endless growth. To favour these businesses at the expense of the creative sector,the second most lucrative in the UK, generating more than £126bnannually, would impoverish more than our economy.Both industries are at an impasse: tech insisting that enforcing copyright laws on AI is unfeasible and regressive, creatives that opting out is unworkable and unjust. It is up to government to foster a fair agreement in which both flourish. This is a pivotal moment for our cultural future. The artistic community has spoken. Now ministers must listen, take their concerns seriously and respond. We must protect our creators at all costs.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I have defended Labour up to now among family and friends who feel let down by the failure of Rachel Reeves to tax the super-wealthy in a fairer way to help fund vital services that were so eroded by the Tories.The Heathrow expansion is so clearly out of step with what we should be doing, and such a betrayal of Labour’s election campaign to be a conserver of the environment, that I feel the party will be significantly damaged by it.Flying is one of the most egregious forms of pollution, and we should be increasing tax on flights and discouraging it as a mode of transport, especially private jets, which simply should not be an option.Sadiq Khan has made difficult decisions to reduce London’s pollution and faced much criticism in the process. That is what moral leadership should do, but all that will be wiped out by this craven decision.Cass WitcombeLondonHaving worked on both the third runway at Heathrow and HS2, I understand all too well the obstacles thatRachel Reeveswill face in trying to translate the intent of her speech into reality. Three things are necessary: clarity about the purpose and outcome of each project, not just for itself but for the country as a whole; a comprehensive, whole-of-government plan to articulate, realise and evolve those benefits over time; and a willingness to persist in doing so through all the inevitable ups and downs of delivery.At Heathrow in the past and on HS2, collectively we failed those tests, but my experience on the other “project” I worked on – theNorthern Irelandpeace process – shows that government is capable of the necessary focus, drive and sheer bloody-mindedness. But that is only possible with clear, decisive, almost obsessional leadership from the top, day in, day out. That’s the real test to come.Tom KellyAghadowey, ColeraineWhat part of the economy is the chancellor trying to grow, and for whom (Reeves plans to create ‘Silicon Valley’ between Oxford and Cambridge, 28 January)? When it comes to growth, “it’s the little things, stupid”.Instead of remote, long-term and hugely expensive projects that may well prove economically ineffective, but are certainly environmentally destructive, people need to see and experience changes that make a positive difference to their everyday lives.More (paid) workers cleaning up rubbish from the streets. Funding local libraries and museums. Reopening community and youth centres. Restoring park keepers. Revitalising the proud tradition of adult education for all. More police on the beat. It’s all job creation and paid jobs bring in tax revenue. What’s not to like? With ministers sneering about bats and newts, much of the time it seems that the only guardians of the public good are those who end up being demonised by this government as barriers to “progress”.Karin Hessenberg and Robin ParrishSheffieldIn 1948, despite postwar austerity, a Labour government successfully passed theNational Assistance Actand created theNational Health Service. David Kynaston, in his monumental chronicle of this epoch,Austerity Britain 1945-51,quotes froma Clement Attlee broadcast of the time: “All our social services have to be paid for, in one way or another”, so that only “higher output can give us more of the things we all need”. Rachel Reeves has inherited this powerful argument from the Attlee days, and nothing could be further from the accusation voiced against her by a Greenpeace spokesman in your article, that she is simply “chasing growth for growth’s sake”.Dr Nick McAdooLondonRachel Reeves needs to redefine “growth”. We are not the US, with swathes of land to host servers. Tourists visit Oxford and Cambridge for their historic cities and beautiful surrounding landscapes, not to see small nuclear reactors generating power for AI. People come to East Anglia for its vast beaches and birdlife, ancient trees and farmland, not to see a high-rise substation the size of Wembley or two nuclear reactors surrounded by concrete.What we have as islanders is resilience, inventiveness and creativity – and these qualities we should harness to be at the forefront of green technology and work with nature to slow down climate change, not against it. We have wind, we have wave, we have floods, we have sea. Now all we need is the political will. Think again, chancellor.Vanessa RaisonLondonI read with interest the report of infrastructure projects including Heathrow expansion to be enacted by Labour in order to drive “growth” (Legal challenges to infrastructure plans to be blocked in Starmer growth push, 23 January). I also happened to notice that all of these projects appear to be in the south-east of England. Can I just remind Rachel Reeves that other parts of the nation exist and are in desperate need of investment?My own area was promised a new hospital to replace the crumbling University Hospital of North Tees at the end of the New Labour reign – and we are still waiting. A new road crossing of the River Tees near Middlesbrough was also mooted, never mind the now-shelved plans to upgrade the A1 (to Edinburgh) to a dual carriageway.Andrew LonsdaleStockton-on-Tees, County DurhamIn the 29 January edition that includes your front-page headline “Reeves pledges to create ‘Europe’s Silicon Valley’ in push for growth”, on page 19 is another: “Only Scotland is set to curb child poverty in UK, charity report finds”.

Unrwa services in health, education, welfare, food aid, microfinance and social services are critical for Palestinian refugees and these services have been mandated by the UN general assembly.For Israel to unilaterally ban Unrwa operations in the occupiedPalestinian territoriesin a period of unparalleled deprivation and social need, following 15 months of total siege and constant bombardment in Gaza and relentless military and settler aggression in the West Bank, is immoral, illegal and inhumane.Israel’stargeting of UN staff and installationsshould be more than adequate grounds for it to be unseated from the UN. It has also repeatedly defied UN resolutions as well as the July 2024ruling of the international court of justicethat declared Israel’s occupation of the Gaza strip and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, unlawful.The protection of UN staff and Unrwa services in the occupied territories, and the integrity of the rules-based order, demands concerted multilateral action that ensures Israeli compliance with international law.Stephen McCloskeyDirector, Centre for Global EducationDonald Trump’s threat to “clear out that whole thing” is, as your editorial states, “damaging”; it dehumanises Palestinians and buoys Israel’s extreme right, but this repugnant bigot is only taking advantage of a mess created by other politicians. What leader other thanBenjamin Netanyahuwould be given a blank cheque by western leaders, to act with impunity and carry out what many consider to be genocide against Palestinians, using weapons supplied by the west?The west had given Netanyahu the green light by doing nothing about Israel’s aggression in the West Bank – despite warnings from the UN’s human rights commissioner,Volker Türk, who in June 2023 called on it to comply with international law after it had launcheddeadly airstrikes with helicopter gunshipson Jenin refugee camp.If Trump could insist on a ceasefire, why couldn’t Joe Biden threaten an end to arms supplies and economic sanctions last May. And, furthermore, why couldn’tKeir Starmerand his fellow and equally spineless western leaders put pressure on the president to do so?Instead, we had a prime minister “hoping” for peace in the Middle East, while sending arms to Israel. By all means criticise Trump, but the blame for this awful situation lies elsewhere, and much of it close to home.Bernie EvansLiverpoolHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Their approach at the 2023 World Cup was certainly different but, as we saw in the autumn, England can produce something from nothing. My worry is that they can be too reliant on those moments. Marcus Smith is a magician, capable of some spellbinding stuff, but there are only so many rabbits he can pull out of a hat.Put simply, England have some room for improvement in terms of precision from their launch plays. To win in Dublin for the first timesince 2019they need to show better shape and patterns, which in turn give Marcus more opportunities to do his stuff. In the autumn most of what Marcus showcased wasn’t as a result of shape or patterns, it was instinct – darting down the blindside, leading counterattacks or picking off an interceptagainst New Zealand.Twin peaks: meet the greatest pre-Curry pairings in sporting historyRead moreEngland found an impressive rhythm scoring points as last year went on but defensively they were exposed too often. If they can tighten up defensively and not show so much reliance on individual brilliance they’ll be in the game in Dublin.I find the debate and the conversation about Marcus fascinating. It’s almost as if, because he can be so instinctive, there is a perception that he cannot play in structure, or that he is in some way responsible for England’s inability to do so. It’s as if we look at the inadequacies of England’s attack and automatically pin it on the No 10. But for me it was obvious: he was England’s best player of the autumn, bar none.When we talk about patterns and shape, it’s really important that we understand precisely what we’re talking about. The point of shape and patterns is to create options for whoever the ball player is and, more often than not, that’s going to be Marcus. If he has really good shape and he has different options, you’re left with the best ball player on the pitch to select the right option. I don’t think we’ve had a robust pattern for long enough to give Marcus enough options. If we can drill the shape of England’s attack more, it gives him more choices and he’s pretty good at selecting the right one.If we flip it on its head, we know Marcus is a talent and his vision is incredible, so why haven’t we seen it enough for England to win these tight matches? Is it his ability to spot things or is it the structure around him? I believe it is the latter because he has shown a number of times that, where he has good options, he’s very good at taking them. I believe the team needs to a) provide good quality ball and b) when they’ve got it provide enough quality options, whether that’s with their shape, running lines, depth, speed or urgency to get into the required position for Marcus to be able to pull the trigger.Is it because he’s not driving the shape enough? Would another 10 drive shape a bit more or have the England team been given enough time to practise their structures? It’s very rare that you get a 10 who consistently makes bad decisions and selects the wrong options, so if it’s not a case of Marcus making bad calls, we need to look at the choices he’s been given. I don’t remember a game where we thought: ‘Oh Marcus, what a terrible option.’ We can debate things in terms of his decisions to kick, pass or run but in terms of when he’s got the ball in his hand to attack with, he is the best England have.View image in fullscreenHenry Slade has an important role to play in this year’s Six Nations.Photograph: Mike Hewitt/Getty ImagesWhat we do want to see is Marcus still having that licence – if he sees it and feels it, go for it. But having that supplemented by creating opportunities through quick ball, pattern, shape and options. England need to connect those dots and provide opportunities for whoever is in good space. That’s where England must improve and it’s going to take a big match from Henry Slade because there is not an abundance of ball players in England’s backline. He has a big role to play defensively but he also needs to assist Marcus in attack and get the best out of Ollie Lawrence alongside him. I think back to Slade’s performance in Dublin in 2019 and England could do with another one of those.In my mind, how great would it be if 70% of England’s points were manufactured in shape and then 30% were those magic moments? You can’t go into games, as we were in the autumn, relying on brilliance from individuals to get you points. It’s not something you should rely upon.I look at the team Steve Borthwick has picked and I believe it’s on the defensive side. Tom and Ben Curryhave been chosento disrupt Ireland’s rhythm, stop their flow and prevent them from going through phase after phase. We’ve seen how effective that can be.If the Currys, and players such as Ben Earl and Luke Cowan-Dickie, are really strong at the breakdown, however, it can provide England with quick turnover ball and they can take advantage on transition. They have been really quite sharp in that regard in recent matches. Alex Mitchell’s return at scrum-half is a big plus in that area too because he is England’s swiftest No 9 in terms of his delivery. I’m excited by the back three as well. I’m really pleased for Cadan Murley and it will help him settle having Marcus on the pitch too and we know what Freddie Steward and Tommy Freeman are all about. Individually England have the players in form to perform. The question remains whether they can be greater than the sum of their parts.Explore more on these topicsSix Nations 2025England rugby union teamIreland rugby union teamSix NationsRugby unioncommentShareReuse this content"

Great news, on the other hand, for new 63-year-old wide forward Jorge Vital, now weighing up a number of offers from Serie A and Saudi Pro League clubs, and whom Manchester United are hopeful of shifting from the wage bill before the end of the transfer window.For this cash-strapped theatre of ghosts, trying to build its new cast of dreams on the bones of the old, perhaps every pound helps. Corporate box guests at Old Trafford no longer get a free match programme each and are instead invited to download the dictated thoughts of Amorim via a QR code. Free cereal bars for matchday stewards were cut at the beginning of the season. The annual £100 staff Christmas bonus was replaced by a £40 M&S voucher. Concessionary tickets for children and the senior citizens were temporarily withdrawn.This is Austerity United, after all, and we’re all theoretically in this together. Losses of £313m in the past three years have put the club on the brink of breaching profit and sustainability rules (PSR). According to the most recent accounts, they still owe £410m in outstanding transfer fees to other clubs. “If we do not act now,” the club wrote in a letter to fans last week, “we are in danger of … significantly impacting our ability to compete on the pitch.”Rashford has heart set on Barcelona but deal rests on exits from La Liga clubRead moreDoubtless it will not have escaped your attention that United’s ability to compete on the pitch has been significantly impacted for a while now, and for reasons only tangentially connected to finance. Or that many of the same people now mandating mass redundancies and ticket price rises also approved the£21.4m costof sacking Erik ten Hag and replacing him with Amorim. Or the total package of around £100m in fees and wages for the struggling Matthijs de Ligt. Or the cost ofhiring Dan Ashworth for five months. Still: got to get those cereal bars off the ledger.In the meantime, the fourth-richest club in the world is somehow sitting 12th in its own domestic league. What does it take to get this side back to, say, top-three level? Maybe seven new players – a goalkeeper, two wing-backs, a centre-half, another passing midfielder, a striker and another winger/No 10 to play behind the striker. Let’s also say you get lucky and a teenager like Ayden Heaven or Chido Obi-Martin makes the leap to the first team. So maybe you need six new signings who are available, would choose United over other clubs, and offer an immediate upgrade on what you already have.Even if you can find them, in the new age of parsimony you no longer have nine-figure sums lying around the place. So you also need to get rid of players you want to sell. Victor Lindelöf, Tyrell Malacia, Harry Maguire, Christian Eriksen, Casemiro and Antony could all be lost without too much heartache. But of course these are distressed assets unlikely to command much value in a crowded market. At which point you need to pull the other lever: getting rid of players you don’t want to sell.It is now eight months since Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo stalked the Wembley turf in golden sunshine, the two academy teenagers who hadjust won United the FA Cup. Now the club have made it clear they are prepared to listen to offers for both. Garnacho could even leave for Chelsea before the transfer deadline on Monday night, for a fee of between £50m and £60m. Mainoo – so impressive in a more advanced roleagainst FCSB on Thursday– looks to be staying, but will now know he too is expendable.View image in fullscreenRuben Amorim’s Manchester United side have lost six of their last 10 league games but won five of their last six in all competitions.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAPainted on the stairs at Carrington are the words “Youth, Courage, Success”. It is a reminder of the club’s heritage, the proud record ofmore than 4,000 consecutive gamesin which a United academy player has featured in the match-day squad. In the current climate, however, the slogan takes on a slightly different meaning. Revenue generated from selling academy products counts as “pure profit” under PSR. And for clubs with the courage to cut loose their best young players, youth can provide an entirely different route to success.The model United are seeking to emulate here is Chelsea, who for most of the past couple of decades have made little secret of the fact they regard their academy as a revenue farm, a place where talent is nurtured, fattened and sold on. In the past few years, as the new ownership consortium has skirted around breaking PSR, Cobham graduates like Conor Gallagher, Mason Mount, Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Callum Hudson-Odoi, Ian Maatsen, Lewis Hall and Billy Gilmour have all been profitably moved on. Three seasons ago under Thomas Tuchel, Chelsea gave 25% of their league minutes to academy graduates. This season, it’s just 12%, most of those to Levi Colwill.At the time Chelsea’s strategy generated a certain tension within the fanbase. For many local supporters with emotional ties to the region as well as the club the sale of academy products was almost a kind of betrayal: a severing of the link between the club and its roots. For most international fans, largely untethered by geography or history, this mattered less. What mattered more was the splendour of the current product, and if selling academy gems allowed them to invest more heavily in their replacements, then this was simply the nature of doing business.These days, with Chelsea challenging for the top three, you’d struggle to find many fans pining for the old pin-ups. Few Chelsea supporters would now swap out Moises Caicedo for Gallagher, or Cole Palmer for Mount. Perhaps this is the kind of collective amnesia United’s hierarchy are also banking on: that an increasingly globalised fanbase will prefer the endorphin rush of new signings over the pull of heritage. That like the stalwart Scott McTominay, sold to Napoli last summer, the respective services of Garnacho, Rashford, even Mainoo, will be mourned lightly, briefly and then not at all.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This week, a video emerged of United fans at Craven Cottage haranguing him over ticket prices. “We’re northerners, come on, mate,” one fan beseeches him. “Oh, come on,” Ratcliffe mutters as he winds his car window up, almost disgusted by the audacity of the attempt at kinship. Northerner, United fan, slash-and-burn capitalist … but not necessarily in that order!Perhaps it should not surprise anyone that a man so attached to north-west England that he lives in Monaco, so invested in the wider resonance of football that he has ordered big cuts to the club’s charitable foundation, should also regard the lineage and inheritance of the academy in such bleak, transactional terms. Manchester is just a word on a shirt, a handy gimmick, something to sell the tourists. And there are no people here, just product: cells on a spreadsheet that can be cut and copied at will.View image in fullscreenJim Ratcliffe (centre) has recently been harangued by fans over Manchester United’s ticket prices.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAA few months ago a photograph started doing the rounds online.

He’s in his football kit, waiting for a lift to training at the United academy. We’re encouraged to think it’s Rashford.Certainly it would make a lovely story. But, of course, we don’t know for sure. The face is blurred out, the outline hazy. Taken out of context, it’s just a pile of red pixels.

The former Bournemouth and Portsmouth midfielder was also responsible for players such as Justin Kluivert to the Vitality Stadium. He wasappointed Liverpool’s sporting directorby Michael Edwards, a friend from their time together at Fratton Park.How Bournemouth became the Premier League’s latest model clubRead moreLiverpool’s visit to Bournemouth on Saturday could be a significant moment in the title race and Slot, who rested nine senior players from Wednesday’s Champions Leaguetrip to PSV Eindhoven, says Hughes’s astute recruitment is largely responsible for the challenge his team faces. The Liverpool head coach, who was himself appointed by Hughes, said: “It’s one of the toughest games. They’ve shown already bybeating Arsenalthere andbeating Citythere. Theylost to Chelseabut missed a penalty, and have conceded only seven goals at home.“The second half [of Liverpool’s3-0 victory over Bournemouthin September] we played against them showed me they are a serious team. If you are 3-0 down and can keep competing and working that hard in the second half that tells you a lot about the mentality of the team. Combined with the quality they have – and Richard left that club in a very, very good place, not only with the quality of the players they have but because he hired a very good manager – then it’s no surprise to me that they are able to compete with every single team in the league.”Slot said he has tapped into Hughes’s knowledge of his former club in preparation for Liverpool’s visit but added: “He tells us what we are already seeing. It’s not that important if he tells me things I don’t know like whether a player is married and has children, that will not influence the game tomorrow. But he definitely sees the things we are seeing because of their playing style and the manager is the same. What I see he confirms is true.“They have a lot of quality, created by Richard. He hired a fantastic manager. Justin [Kluivert] is one of the many examples where Richard deserves a lot of credit. You need quality and that is what Richard brought there.”Slot, meanwhile, insisted it is no surprise that Saudi Arabia’s sports minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki al-Faisal,wants Mohamed Salah in the Saudi Pro League. “I would be surprised if there was anyone around the world saying: ‘We don’t want Mo Salah,’” the Dutchman said. “Everyone wants him – including us. We want him to extend [his contract], of course. That is clear but I am not surprised that Saudi wants him. I would not be surprised if other countries wanted him as well.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Haaland scored the first goal but City needed a late John Stones strike to rescue a point against a team they have not defeated in their past four meetings. Arsenal have finished as runners-up to City in the past two seasons and Ødegaard is expecting an extra edge to proceedings.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead more“It is normal when you play these big games that there is a big rivalry,” he said. “You are competing and you want to be the best. So that’s how it should be and there should be a little bit of heat sometimes. But then I think a lot of the players know each other from the national team – England, Brazil, me with Erling – so on the pitch and off the pitch it is a bit different. When we are on the pitch, then it’s a good battle.”Ødegaard, asked whether he had been surprised by Haaland’s outburst towards Arteta, said: “In football, games like this, the emotions are so high and the adrenaline is there and everything. So that’s something that can happen on the pitch and then when you walk off the pitch, then you are done with it. It is not something I think too much about. We are good friends. Him and a few of the other boys from the national team, we have a little group chat, so we stay in touch there and we speak every now and then. To be fair, not about football, just about random things. We haven’t spoken about the game, but he is a good friend.”Arsenal’s hopes of signing the Norway Under-21 midfielder Sverre Nypan in this window appear to be over after he decided to stay at Rosenborg until the summer. The 18-year-old has been compared to Ødegaard and also held talks with City’s sister club Girona and Aston Villa this week but has opted to defer a decision on his future.Arsenalare believed to be in talks with his representatives over a potential summer move.Creative responsibility will continue to fall on Ødegaard, who admitted his return of only one Premier League goal this season “hasn’t been good enough”. David Raya is a doubt to face City owing to a muscular injury that meant the goalkeeper sat out thevictory over Gironathat secured qualification for the last 16 of the Champions League.Arsenal are set to head for a warm-weather training camp in Dubai after the second leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final against Newcastle on Wednesday, and Ødegaard is hoping they can replicate their brilliant form of the second half of last season, when they dropped only five points from their last 18 matches.View image in fullscreenNeto played in goal for Arsenal against Girona because of David Raya’s injury and the Brazilian could face Manchester City.Photograph: David Price/Arsenal FC/Getty Images“We’re in a good position and we have to remember that,” he said. “But I feel like we have another gear to hit and it was the same last year. We really hit top form towards the end of the season. Hopefully we can do that again.”Ødegaard added: “When you’ve been so close, you get even more hungry, you get even more determination to do it, especially last year when we were there on the last day and really could feel it was that close. I feel the whole squad is ready now to push for it.“I have been dreaming about this since I was a young kid. To win one of the big trophies and especially the Premier League was always something special growing up so this would be the biggest dream. It’s what we work for every day and I think it’s important to stay in the moment and not look too far ahead. Just focus on the day by day and keep going and in the end hopefully we will be rewarded.”Explore more on these topicsArsenalManchester CitynewsShareReuse this content"

Annabel Sutherland has for some time appeared to be a next-generation Ellyse Perry, similar not only in stature but in output and style. The resemblance comes most notably when batting in Tests, with the concentration and appetite to put away short-form games and take up the tempo of the longest format, hour after hour of focus in the middle.Perry was unavailable through injury on the second day of the Women’s Ashes Test at the MCG, and Sutherland made sure that she wasn’t missed. Batting into the third session for 163, she was the biggest factor in pushing Australia to 422 for five,a lead of 252 by stumps. This made three centuries in her past four Tests, after 137 not out at Trent Bridge and 210 against South Africa at the Waca. Unflustered, for a long while Sutherland looked on track to become the first women’s player to make two double centuries. In the more expansive history of men’s Tests, doubles in consecutive innings is something only six players have achieved.Sutherland century turns screw on wretched England in women’s AshesRead moreShe didn’t get there, bowled off the inside edge by seamer Ryana MacDonald-Gay, looking to force the rate, finally fatigued after a long day of work. The mixture of focused defence with consistent attack is her calling card, lacing 21 boundaries plus a six during her stay, so crisp when cutting or pulling the short ball, assured when driving the full. Her last 116 runs were faultless, but the fault for her still being there to make them was entirely the opposition’s.How to describe England’s fielding? Let’s say that while walking through the Betty Cuthbert Bar in the third session, witnessing a small, tired girl abruptly coat both her parents and the floor with a sluice of vomit formed from chips and lemonade, that was only the second-most noxious display at the MCG that day.Sophie Ecclestone was dropped four times off her bowling, and responded with two of her own. It started with Phoebe Litchfield lofting down the ground, where Sophia Dunkley ran in circles underneath it, frolicking into the air and flinging out one arm in an airborne school-dance-recital move, her vaguely gesturing hand less an attempted catch than an alibi.Sutherland then cut Ecclestone to backward point, where Danni Wyatt-Hodge lost it hitting the ground. There were two tougher chances for the wicketkeeper Amy Jones, an edge into her knee that she might have had some hope of reaching had her gloves not already come up too high, and a missed stumping from MacDonald-Gay down the leg side as Sutherland overbalanced and had to swap feet.View image in fullscreenLauren Filer is unable to bring in a catch on day two at the MCG, one of many missed opportunities by England.Photograph: James Ross/EPAThree lives for Sutherland before reaching 50, and after Ecclestone went solo to trap Alyssa Healy for 34, there were three to come for Beth Mooney in four overs. MacDonald-Gay at short cover off Ecclestone, missing a drive; Ecclestone returning the favour with a simple one at slip, then off MacDonald-Gay’s bowling again; Maia Bouchier at gully with the simplest of the lot, a catching-practice steer that somehow still surprised the fielder so much that she was jumping and falling backwards while forcing hard hands at the ball.By then England looked done, shrugging at each miss and trudging on. Tired and cranky, Ecclestone added a seventh drop at slip when Ash Gardner played a forcing shot on 12, MacDonald-Gay again the bowler. Late in the evening, Lauren Filer gave Gardner another, leaping well but spilling the return chance. When Filer finally held Gardner close to stumps, the simplest lob still seeing her fall over at square leg and clasp the catch to her clavicle, it drew less a cheer than a groan of relief.Then the misfields – after a while, who could even keep counting? There is a period for the spectator at which even the spirit grows spongy and bruised. Half a dozen went through hands for boundaries, maybe another 15 escaped for smaller quantities of runs. A litany of errors that went far past the comedy stage, to the point that Tammy Beaumont got an unironic cheer of support when she tumbled and stopped a ball cleanly.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The same can’t be said for the basics in the field, the skills that these professional cricketers are paid £100,000 a year to hone. England played without any apparent plan beyond sticking on Ecclestone at one end all day, the spinner bowling 17 overs through the first session and 39 by stumps, with more to come.It was the display of a team that is mentally halfway to Dubai on the flight home, or for some of them to India for the Women’s Premier League, where another lucrative contract demands they remember how to play. Perhaps they are tired from the tour treadmill; there will be all sorts of theories once this is done as to how things got this bad.Not so for Australia, another happy three sessions with Litchfield batting well for 45, Gardner 44, and Mooney to return for day three on 98 not out. As far as a competitive spectacle though, that was best illustrated by another kid on a day out. A crowd nearing 12,000 combined with day one’s attendance to form the biggest turnout ever for a women’s Test, but their loudest cheer of the last session was when the big screen zoomed in to a small boy holding an ice-cream cone. Rapt with the attention but beaming even more widely at his treat, he hung on to it cleanly, both hands on the prize.Explore more on these topicsWomen's AshesAustralia women's cricket teamEngland women's cricket teamAustralia sportCricketWomen's cricketanalysisShareReuse this content"

Dube was conked on the helmet during his knock, prompting a concussion replacement, with Harshit Rana coming in for hisTwenty20international debut during the England innings. With Rana a far more significant bowling threat, this was hardly a like-for-like change, as the playing conditions demand.India beat England by 15 runs to win fourth men’s T20 international and series – liveRead moreRana’s role would be impactful, too. While Harry Brook led England’s reply with a 26-ball 51, the hulking quick took three wickets, including that of Jamie Overton in the penultimate over when the match remained up for grabs, 25 required off 12 balls. An inside-edge would see the England all-rounder bowled, a 15-run victory secured minutes later.“It’s not a like-for-like replacement, we don’t agree with that,” said Buttler. “Either Shivam Dube has put on about 25mph with the ball or Harshit has really improved his batting. It’s part of the game. I still think we should have gone on to win the match. But we disagree with the decision. We’ll ask Javagal [Srinath, the match referee] some questions just to get some clarity around it.”It had begun so well for England. Replacing the rested Mark Wood, Mahmood’s impact was immediate with the second over of the match, his first of the tour. Sanju Samson pulled away Mahmood’s first delivery to deep backward square; Tilak Varma charged the next but ended up getting a thick edge to Jofra Archer at third. Suryakumar Yadav patted away the next few, a hat-trick denied, but chipped to short mid-on to close the over.Abhishek Sharma and Rinku Singh counterattacked before the No 1-ranked T20 international bowler in the world intervened. Adil Rashid tempted Sharma into a slog towards deep midwicket for 29 before Dube was dropped by Buttler, though it was a difficult chance at slip. Playing his first international since last August, Dube took advantage. He welcomed Rashid’s spin, collecting 25 off 11 deliveries from the leggie on the way to his half-century.Pandya brought the greatest danger, coming in at 79 for five, dominating the 87-run vibe-changing stand with Dube. The former has power but also the touches of an old-school technician, visible through his drives and a Test hundred on the resume. He took sixes off Mahmood, Archer and Overton, setting India up for the highest first-innings total of the series. It was some recovery.Ben Duckett was the dominant force in England’s powerplay, Arshdeep Singh tucked away for three consecutive on-side boundaries before various sweeps took care of spin. Fifty came up inside five overs before the tumble. Duckett miscued off Ravi Bishnoi for a 19-ball 39 with the final act of the powerplay before Phil Salt was bowled by Axar Patel. Buttler found short third to provide Bishnoi greater joy, England having lost three wickets for five runs and nine balls, the onus on an out-of-nick Brook to sort the mess.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The initial fee is about £65m and represents a significant profit for Villa, who signed him from Chicago Fire for £18m. Durán has scored 12 goals in 29 games for Villa this season, including a memorable winneragainst Bayern Munichin the Champions League.Men’s transfer window January 2025: all deals from Europe’s top five leaguesRead moreDurán’s move was confirmed after Villa’s manager, Unai Emery, said Ollie Watkins was happy to stay after Arsenal had a bid for the striker rejected. Watkins reacted to scoring in Wednesday’s Champions League winagainst Celticby tapping the badge in celebration.“Yes, he is happy to stay,” Emery said. “You can ask him, but we asked him how he is feeling every day, every year he has been here with Aston Villa, with us and without us. We talked with him and he is very focused on the message we have. The commitment of Ollie Watkins with us is a huge commitment, he appreciates a lot how Aston Villa was always supporting him, helping him and when we joined him here two years ago, how we worked with him, always trying to get the best of him. Now we need him, like he needed Aston Villa.”The fee for Durán is the second biggest Villa have received behind the £100m Manchester City paid for Jack Grealish.Al-Nassrhave also made an improved offer of £75m for Kaoru Mitoma but had that rejected by Brighton and are set to give up on their hopes of signing the Japan winger.An initial £54.4m offer was rejected on Thursday by Brighton for the 27-year-old, who signed a new contract worth about £80,000 a week in October 2023 and will have two years on his deal at the end of the season. He is believed to be not interested in moving to Saudi Arabia at this stage of his career.Neymar has completed his return to Santos after leaving another Saudi Arabian club,Al-Hilal.

City have been contacted by the Guardian for a response.Transfer window verdict: how every WSL club fared in January | Tom GarryRead moreIt was the second time in just over 24 hours that Kelly had aired her disappointment at City, having posted a longer statement on social media on Wednesday night, accusing the club of dictating who she could and could not join.On Thursday, the 27-year-old wrote: “So disappointed to find out tonight that people at the club are briefing journalists against me if I am to sign at a club before the window shuts. They’ve called reporters to assassinate my character and tried to plant negative stories about me in the football media.”She added that any such allegations against her were false, before concluding: “To those responsible, I am disappointed in this. As I said in my previous statement, I just want to find happiness again.”City’s head coach, Gareth Taylor, was asked about the comments before Sunday’s home WSL game against Arsenal, for which Kelly will be ineligible. “I’d rather not go into specifics,” he said. “What I would say is, it’s been really disappointing [for it] to come to this, and the ending it transpired to.“I’ve always tried to represent the club in the right way, really dignified in the good moments, the difficult moments, and I certainly work for a club that has real integrity. It’s really disappointing. It’s been a challenging couple of days, for many people, not just for myself, but obviously a lot of people here at the club as well.“And we never like to hear that a player has not had a good experience of being at the club. And I’m sure that’s not the case for the whole period she’s been at the club. Maybe this more recent period, of not playing, but we certainly try to support every single player that we work with. But we’re in a selection-based business, where difficult decisions have to be made for the betterment of the team, and sometimes people and players can fall on the sharp end of that. [But] Arsenal is a rival and they made the best offer, so we’ve certainly not stood in the way of a player being able to go and make the move they want to make.”At one stage in his press conference, Taylor asked for no further questions about Kelly’s exit. The Guardian understands that City accepted bids for Kelly from Arsenal and Brighton but that a bid from Manchester United was rejected because City did not feel it was sufficient and were unwilling to help strengthen their local rivals. According to Sky Sports, Kelly turned down the chance to join Brighton earlier in the window.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We run this tight ship as a real business – we have to do that. Arsenal made the best offer so it was a simple one for us.”Kelly had been seeking a move after being frozen out, making only one start in the WSL this season amid reports linking her with a transfer. She said in her statement on Wednesday that she accepted she had no future at City beyond the end of her contract in June.Kelly broke her silence in an apparent last-resort plea to be permitted to leave. “The situation has dragged on far too long, it’s disappointing and not right,” she posted. “Ultimately I just want to be happy again.”Explore more on these topicsManchester City WomenWomen's Super LeagueArsenal WomenWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

Although southern Madagascar experienced gusty winds owing to the storm, Elvis’s primary impacts on land were the result of the persistent rainfall. As of 9am on Thursday, Elvis contained maximum sustained winds of 40 knots and was tracking south-south-east, with no further effects on land expected before the storm undergoes extratropical transition by Sunday.The European windstorm season continued apace, with three named storms affecting western Europe. WhileStorm Éowyn was bringingstrong winds and heavy rain and snow to Ireland and Britain last weekend,Storm Herminiawas named by the Spanish national weather service. This was swiftly followed by Storm Ivo, named on Monday by the Portuguese national weather service. A strong jet stream across the North Atlantic was responsible for the rapid intensification of these systems.In Spain, Herminia brought gusts of 96mph to the Picos de Europa national park. Strong southwesterly winds also brought an unseasonably warm air mass to Spain, leading to January temperature records being broken. Valencia recorded a maximum temperature of 27.1C, beating the previous January record of 26.5C.Finistère in north-westernFrancehad gusts of 75mph on Sunday, and these strong winds continued into the new week, with much of the west coast of the country put on orange alert for winds on Tuesday.The rain from Herminia caused major problems, with parts of Brittany put on red alert for rain and flooding on Monday. In Rennes, the regional capital, about 400 people were evacuated after the worst flash flooding in 40 years. Eight other departments were put on orange alert, mostly for rain and flooding, with the French Alps put on orange alert for avalanches.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Researchers have foundthat thermogalvanic hydrogel, for example, could be used to keep a mobile phone battery cool while turning the waste heat into electricity.In theory reversing this process enables the generation of cooling power, but previous studies have shown this effect to have limited potential. By optimising the chemicals used in the process, researchers found that they were able to improve the hydrogalvanic cell’s cooling power by 70%.Electricity used to power refrigerators combined with gas leakages from fridges and freezers into the atmosphere make them a significant source of greenhouse emissions. Fifty per cent of UK food refrigeration emissions are from electrical power, with 37% of UK food refrigeration electrical emissions from domestic refrigerators, according to a study published by theInternational Journal of Refrigeration.Future research conducted by this team will include optimising the system’s design and investigating other potential commercial use.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We are also attempting to develop diverse refrigerator prototypes towards potential application scenarios and are seeking to collaborate with companies to promote commercialisation of thermogalvanic technologies.”Explore more on these topicsTechnologyClimate crisisShareReuse this content"

There is particular worry about those who have already started contributing to Reform, as it can be almost impossible to bring back donors who switch to another party.Others senior Conservatives are alarmed that Badenoch does not appear to have put in enough effort to wooing donors, with one attender at a function saying she turned up late, was not explicit enough about asking for money and then left early.There is even concern among some of Badenoch’s high profile supporters.Sir Rocco Forte, the luxury hotel owner who gave £20,000 to Badenoch’s leadership campaign last year and donated £100,000 to the Tory party during its successful 2019 general election campaign, said: “It’s not yet clear what the Conservative party is doing and for me and many other people there is a big question mark.“I’m a very big supporter of Kemi Badenoch. I think she understands a radical revolution is needed. A lot of what Reform is saying is pointing in the right direction and I admire Farage, who have momentum at the moment and have no baggage.“The problem for Kemi Badenoch is that every time she says anything, others ask ‘Well, why didn’t you do something about it when you’re in power?’ I think she’s got to disassociate herself quite significantly from what happened in the last 14 years when there was a strategy of the middle ground and all that.”He said he thought Farage could reach parts of the country the Tories could not, “particularly the north”, adding: “It could well be that come the next election you could have the vote on the right split. Some form of accommodation may have to come about. People talk about a merger but I think an accommodation is more likely.”In an uncomfortable moment for Badenoch, Farage plans to park Reform’s tanks on the Tory leader’s own lawn on Friday night by holding a rally in her constituency of North West Essex.Badenoch is defending a relatively slim majority of 2,610 in what was once a Tory stronghold, but where a bigger Reform showing at the next election could hand the seat to Labour by splitting the right-wing vote.The Conservative leader has retained Graham Edwards as treasurer of the party, a role the property tycoon has held since he was appointed by Rishi Sunak in 2022. Edwards, who donated £12,000 to Badenoch’s leadership campaign, runs Telereal Trillium, one of the UK’s largest property firms. He has contributed £3.5m to the party since 2018, including a £2m donation last year.However, some donors feel that the party has not adequately found a replacement for Ben Elliot, the Old Etonian who supercharged donations under Boris Johnson by targeting the world’s ultra-wealthy, raising more than £70m in two-and-a-half years after being appointed co-chair and fundraiser before the 2019 general election.“Ben Elliot did quite a good job,” said Forte. “Treasurers have to be prepared to upset people by asking them. I’ve known treasurers who’ve been afraid to ask me for money. You’ve got to ask me for money if you want me to give it.”A Conservative party spokesperson said: “The Conservatives are under new leadership and are working to renew and rebuild the trust of the British people. Fundraising is an important part of the democratic process and the Conservative party holds regular events around the country.”Explore more on these topicsConservativesKemi BadenochReform UKNigel FarageParty fundingnewsShareReuse this content"

How can she possibly implement a growth strategy if penny pinching once again wins the day?” he said.A spokesperson for AstraZeneca said: “Following discussions with the current government, we are no longer pursuing our planned investment at Speke.“Several factors have influenced this decision including the timing and reduction of the final offer compared to the previous government’s proposal.”The AstraZeneca chief executive, Pascal Soriot – the highest-paid boss in the FTSE 100, with apay package of £18.7m– had previously suggested the investment was “absolutely ready to go”.The pharmaceutical company stressed that the existing facility at Speke, which employs 450 people, would continue to manufacture its nasal flu vaccine.However, the expansion of the facility has been under threat since the Labour government decided to review taxpayer funding for investment projects, seeking to get better value for money, given what Reeves has claimed was a £22bn “black hole” in the public finances.A government spokesperson said “a change in the makeup of the investment originally proposed by AstraZeneca” was behind the decision to offer a reduced government grant.The spokesperson added: “All government grant funding has to demonstrate value for the taxpayer and unfortunately, despite extensive work from government officials, it has not been possible to achieve a solution.”The company said the level of investment it was planning to make had not decreased.In her growth speech in Oxfordshire on Wednesday, the chancellor said that as part of the government’s industrial strategy, it had already “provided funding to unlock investment in sectors like aerospace, automotives and life sciences”.It is understood she recently increased the amount of support available to AstraZeneca from an initial gambit of around £40m.But the offer remained significantly below what Hunt had put on the table, which sources suggest amounted to up to £90m, including a direct grant as well as support from the UK Health Security Agency.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The focus on unblocking planning constraints and the delivery of major infrastructure investments that will enhance transport capacity and drive innovation are the right ones.“But it is clear that companies continue to be challenged by the breadth and scale of cost increases announced at the budget, and this risks undermining both the investment needed to drive growth and the sustainability of the public finances.”Explore more on these topicsAstraZenecaPharmaceuticals industryBiotechnology industryMerseysideRachel ReevesnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a quick, cheap alternative,” he says. “And fly-tipping is one thing, but look at the gutters as well, they never get cleaned. It’s everywhere.”One of the worst-affected areas is around Camelot Way, an area where primary and secondary schools sit alongside industrial units and car garages. A burnt-out caravan full of fly-tipped rubbish has been encircled by barriers, while bin bags, car detritus and mud clog the pavements – the problem has been reported to the council for years, residents say, andthe piles likened to Mount Everest.“It massively concerns me because my child, she’s four years old and she has to walk up Camelot Way to get to school,” says Mohammed Shafqat. “With the rubbish, with the flooding that we get because the drains are blocked, it’s a massive hazard.“My wife now takes a much wider route home because my daughter could easily catch her head or eye on a dumped vehicle that’s got no front end on it. It’s just ridiculous. It is a stain on our community and it looks really, really bad.”View image in fullscreenMohammed Shafqat among the fly-tipping and discarded cars on Camelot Way.Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The GuardianThe area is actually in better shape than usual, thanks to a joint police and city council action the day before to remove a large part of the rubbish. “Short-term solutions are great, but the long-term solution is there has to be enforcement around here. Or it will just got back to the way it was,” says Shafqat.A couple of streets over, barriers have been erected around a pile of dumped tarmac, which Moynihan says he has been reporting for over a year. “I’m going to come down with some candles for its birthday if the council haven’t moved it,” he says.He walks over to a huge pile of fly-tipping that he says has sat for months blocking the emergency access point to the train line that runs between Birmingham and Leamington Spa, the security cameras overhead not having acted as a deterrent.“For the council, it’s not costing them anything for the rubbish to sit here. And prosecuting is expensive for them,” he says.As part of budget cuts announced in 2024, Birmingham city council plans to remove its team responsible for street quality audits and neighbourhood waste contamination, and has increased the fee for bulky waste removal from £35 to £45. It has also introduced a fee for rat control treatments, nicknamed the rat tax.In a city that also struggles with high levels of deprivation – it is home to the two constituencies with the highest child poverty rate in the UK, at 55% – many can’t afford to pay that fee, and rubbish is starting to stack up.Over in Allens Cross, in the south-west of the city, Leanne Gregory has started litter-picking with her five-year-old son, Jude, after becoming fed up with the state of the streets around her home.“Bin collections are being missed a lot, so you’ve got bin bags overspilling out of bins, rubbish getting blown around, rats at the bins, cats at the bins. And this has been a problem for months and months,” she says. “People don’t have cars so they can’t take stuff to the tip, and then we get people fly-tipping here on top of that.”View image in fullscreenLeanne Gregory out litter-picking with her five-year-old son, Jude.Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The GuardianShe is particularly alarmed at the prospect of fortnightly bin collections, and says she thinks the most deprived parts of the city will be worst affected. A previous council report suggested they would use “intelligence” to identify places which may have to revert to weekly collections.“This is the sort of community that is not going to cope,” she says. “This is a poor, marginalised council estate, historically. You’ve got a rise in HMOs [houses in multiple occupation], and often families of five or six people living in a three-bedroom house; the bins are already overflowing.“I’ve been highlighting that this is not the sort of area you want to be moving to bi-weekly bin collections because it’s going to be an absolute tip. And we’ve got rats as big as your feet already.”But she says she has hope that the community will rally together to create change. A local litter-picking hub is due to open in the coming months, which will allow people to rent equipment for free.“When people see me and my son out collecting litter, they respond, they smile – they don’t want to live with rubbish all over the street, with fly-tipping. They don’t want that,” she says. “We might be poor, but we have respect, you know what I mean? We have self-respect.”Majid Mahmood, Birmingham city council’s cabinet member for environment and transport, said: “There is no excuse for people fly-tipping, and when we can identify the culprits, we do not hesitate to take enforcement action or prosecute offenders. So far this financial year, the courts have handed out a range of penalties with fines averaging £3,500, as well as various court orders, including seizure and destruction of vehicles.“Our crews clear around 600 fly-tipping reports each week; this is in addition to the work our neighbourhood crews undertake to clean up across the city. There are many legitimate ways to get rid of waste, including using one of our five household waste recycling centres or, if people don’t have a car, then they can use our bulky waste collection service. This is in addition to the mobile household waste recycling service which operates in parts of the city, and around 1,500 responsible residents use this service, collecting around 30 tonnes of waste each week.“I know some residents are concerned about moving to a fortnightly collection, but this will not be introduced until we have food waste collections, something all councils will be required to do by March 2026. Introducing food waste collections will mean people have less general waste, as this represents around 30% of what is thrown away. Other additional bins for recycling will also provide residents with more capacity.”Explore more on these topicsBirminghamLocal governmentWastefeaturesShareReuse this content"

He had been diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease.Tributes were paid at the memorial service by the peers Paul Boateng and Simon Woolley, as well as the former head of the equal rights watchdog Sir Trevor Phillips, the TV presenter Sherrie Eugene-Hart, and in a written statement from the former boxer Frank Bruno, to an audience that included the actor David Harewood.The service was also attended by civic leaders including the former Bristol mayor Marvin Rees, the leader of Bristol city council, Tony Dyer, and His Majesty’s representative, the lord lieutenant Peaches Golding.Music chosen to reflect Stephenson’s broad tastes was played, including classical choral music and Labi Siffre’s (Something Inside) So Strong.Addressing the congregation, Boateng said: “None of us would be here if Paul hadn’t refused to give up his seat when they told him to, if he hadn’t faced the humiliation of arrest, the fingerprinting, the day in court; none of us would be here.”Stephenson was made an OBE for his services to equal opportunities in 2009 and was awarded honorary doctorates at three UK universities.Paul Stephenson: the hero who refused to leave a pub – and helped desegregate BritainRead moreHe was the first black person to be granted the freedom of the city of Bristol, and received a Pride of Britain lifetime achievement award in 2017.Bruno’s tribute said: “I am sure today you will hear many stories about Paul. I am only disappointed that, while alive, his life was not honoured more nationally – not just in the south-west but across the entire UK – with far more substantial recognition.”He added: “I feel that when God created Paul, the mould was destroyed. We will never see the likes of Paul Stephenson again. May we all live happier, easier lives thanks to his actions.”Stephenson was born in Rochford, Essex, in 1937. At three years old he was evacuated to a care home in Great Dunmow in the Essex countryside with seven white children, where he stayed for seven years.In 1953 he joined the RAF as a cadet, serving until 1960. He went to college to study youth work before moving to Bristol in 1962 to be a youth and community development worker and a supply teacher.In 2012 he released his autobiography,Memoirs of a Black Englishman.The dean of Bristol, the Very Rev Dr Mandy Ford, said: “It is a great privilege and honour for us to be hosting this service to give thanks for the legacy of Paul Stephenson. Paul was a true giant who leaves a lasting legacy in the city of Bristol and beyond.”Explore more on these topicsRaceBlack British cultureBristolProtestnewsShareReuse this content"

This threshold could be exceeded at over 70% of sites by 2080.”In 2016, the results of a UK national fish vote were covered by the BBC’s Springwatch. Of nearly 7,000 respondents to a survey, 21% voted for brown trout as their favourite fish.There is an increase in reports of egg mortality, smaller size in hatching and increased levels of defects when the water temperature is above 12C.The modelling of the impact of a rise in water temperature suggests that “the initial sites affected appear few and mostly in the south of England” but that the affected catchments will include “greater numbers of more northerly sites as the decades progress” with “a significant number of sites reaching 12C and 13C across this period, particularly after 2040”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the two categories appear to have been discarded.The existing inspection report format uses four to six sub-grades, including quality of education, and leadership and management, with a cumulative headline grade.The current scale of four grades, ranging from inadequate to outstanding, will be replaced by five steps, with “exemplary” as the new top grade, down to “causing concern” at the bottom, according to the FT.Ofsted did not comment on the reports.An earlier presentation by Ofsted stated: “We want report cards to provide more nuance by inspecting each of the proposed evaluation areas against the proposed evaluation scale so that leaders and parents can understand the areas of strength and areas of development in the provision.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

People went in for their frying pans and came out with a Jeffrey Archer thriller. That’s brilliant. If it disappears, we lose that.”The company confirmed it is “exploring potential strategic options” including a “possible sale”. Its high street business is profitable, with £452m of revenue last year and £32m of profit.“As a child, I used to get WH Smith gift vouchers for Christmas to spend on books, so to hear the chain is selling its high street stores produces a very particular nostalgic twang,” said Victoria Selman, author of novels including Truly Darkly Deeply.“I don’t think the importance of the book sections in WH Smith and shops like it can be overstated,” said Sarah Underwood, whose most recent book is Gentlest of Wild Things. “They are critical in getting books into the hands of teenagers, especially those who are more reluctant readers and won’t generally visit bookshops, or those who can’t access books at the relatively higher price points there.”In many towns across the UK, WH Smith is the only accessible bookshop. It’s a huge blow for readersJess PopplewellIn many towns across the UK, “WH Smith is the only accessible bookshop, so I think it’s a huge blow for readers who might now find themselves in a book desert”, said Jess Popplewell, author of The Dark Within Us. She hopes that independent bookshops will emerge as replacements.The chain is “such a valuable part of our high street”, said Rosie Talbot, whose latest book is Phantom Hearts. WH Smith was established in 1792 on London’s Little Grosvenor Street – now Broadbent Street – by Henry Walton Smith and his wife Anna. Its high street stores now employ about 5,000 staff.Multiple authors told the Guardian that a sale would negatively impact writers. It would be “one more nail in the coffin for British writers”, said Rubin. “Britain’s never really going to compete with Germany in building cars or China in electronics, but we can stake a place on the world stage with our literature.” He called for more government support, including tax breaks, for authors, the publishing industry and bookshops.Selman said that being selected for the Richard and Judy book club, run in partnership with WH Smith, provided her “with a brilliant opportunity to reach new readers who might not otherwise have come across my novels”. The potential sale would “likely mean the end of the book club and therefore the closing off of yet more opportunities for writers to stand out from the crowd in an increasingly crowded and competitive marketplace”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

The company’s “ability to reach a broad demographic of readers remains important”, added Bloomsbury.A sale “would be incredibly damaging for the publishing industry and authors”, said David Headley, managing director of publisher Goldsboro Books. It would leave a gap in the promotion of commercial fiction and books by emerging writers, particularly as it raises questions about the future of the Richard and Judy book club.“As the channels though which people buy books become fewer, the world narrows,” added Chris Vick, whose books include Shadow Creatures. “There is less choice, less visibility and – in the end – fewer readers.”Explore more on these topicsBooksWH SmithBooksellersnewsShareReuse this content"

And as we compete globally with countries like South Korea, China, India, we need a work ethic. We need everybody to be making a contribution … we need to lift our game and to up our game,” he said.Figures published this month showed 9.3 million people were economically inactive between September and November last year, down slightly on the year before, but still 670,000 more than before the pandemic.A quarter of those are economically inactive because they are students and another 30% have a long-term illness.Previous Conservative politicians who have suggested British people need to work harder include Norman Tebbit, a cabinet minister under Margaret Thatcher, who suggested in the 1980s that unemployed people could follow the example of his father, who got on his bike to look for a job.The former prime minister Liz Truss once co-wrote a book, Britannia Unchained, with five other Tory MPs, that described British people as “among the worst idlers in the world” and claimed: “Too many people in Britain prefer a lie-in to hard work.”Responding to Philp’s comments, a Labour spokesperson said: “After the Conservatives’ economic failure left working people worse off, it takes some real brass neck for the Tory top team to tell the public that it’s really all their fault. It’s the same old Tories. They haven’t changed and they’ve learned nothing.”The Liberal Democrat deputy leader, Daisy Cooper, said Philp’s own work ethic as chief secretary to the Treasury under Truss had “crashed the economy in just 39 days”. She added: “The British public will no doubt take his advice with a bucketload of salt.”Badenoch, asked about Philp’s claim that Britons needed a better work ethic, told broadcasters: “I think everybody should be working hard, including myself.”Philp also waded into the debate over the Conservative party’s approach to immigration while in government, saying “mistakes were made”.Priti Patel, the shadow foreign secretary, had on Thursday declined to apologise for high levels of immigration during her time as home secretary in Boris Johnson’s government. Appearing on the Sun’s Never Mind the Ballots programme, she said it was “totally distortionary” to suggest the previous government had “thrown open our borders” to the rest of the world.But a spokesperson for Badenoch appeared to distance the Tory leader from Patel’s comments, saying the Conservative party under her leadership “will tell the truth about the mistakes we made”. They added: “While the last Conservative government may have tried to control numbers, we did not deliver.”Philp told Sky News that he and Badenoch had been “completely honest” about errors made by their predecessors, and immigration numbers were “far too high”.Explore more on these topicsChris PhilpKemi BadenochPriti PatelUnemploymentConservativesImmigration and asylumnewsShareReuse this content"

In it, Hampshire assured Yang: “You sit at the very top of a tree that many, many people would like to be on.”The prince’s aide wrote that Yang had been fortunate to attend a celebration of Andrew’s 60th birthday at Windsor the month before, which had been scaled down at the Queen’s request after he struggled to answer questions from the BBC’s Emily Maitlis over his friendship with Epstein.“I also hope you fully understand what your invitation to his birthday party meant; this was not an engagement or an exclusive dinner. This was strictly his and his family’s personal life that very, very few people have the privilege to ever be part of,” Hampshire wrote.“Moreover, remember that you were originally invited to their house and therefore on the much smaller original guest list. Despite press reports to the contrary, I know for a fact that there were very few people who were not able to make it.”In the 2019 interview with the BBC, Andrew had said he cut off contact with Epstein in December 2010, but emails disclosed in a separate legal action have now revealed they were still exchanging messages in late February 2011.Epstein suggested the Duke might see the banker Jes Staley, and after a back and forth, Andrew wrote: “Keep in close touch and we’ll play some more soon.”Yang, a Chinese-born entrepreneur who had lived in the UK, was excluded from the UK by the then home secretary, Suella Braverman, in March 2023 on the advice of MI5, and the court concluded that she “was entitled to conclude that the applicant represented a risk to the national security of the United Kingdom”.He maintains the allegations against him are “entirely unfounded”. On Friday, he said he was seeking permission to appeal against the court’s decision in a statement.A witness statement from Yang provided to the immigration court said that he had first met Hampshire after he sat next to Andrew during a VIP dinner hosted by Buckingham Palace in October 2019, and was advised by the prince to contact him. “The duke wrote Dominic’s number down on a piece of paper,” Yang said.Download original documentHampshire’s letter describes how rapidly their relationship developed after meeting at the Corinthia hotel in London on 23 October. “Immediately, I learned of a whole new level of obsessive confidentiality and a slightly different way of communicating,” reads a sentence partly quoted in the court’s judgment.“We have dealt with the aftermath of a hugely ill-advised and unsuccessful television interview; we have wisely navigated our way around former private secretaries and we have found a way to carefully remove those people who we don’t completely trust,” Hampshire wrote, using language that has been partly quoted by the court.Hampshire, a former Scots guard and long-time friend and fixer for the duke, heaped praise on Yang’s punctuality: “You bring a completely new level to timekeeping – I aim to be at every meeting at least 15 minutes before it starts and without exception, you are already there!”The purpose of the letter, Hampshire wrote, was “a personal note from me to you” and he apologised for its length, which he said was “very British”. It nevertheless emphasised the closeness of their relationship: “After this short amount of time, I feel an unusual bond of friendship, trust, support and loyalty.”Seven months later, another letter from Hampshire said that Yang was authorised to act on behalf of an investment scheme called the Eurasian fund in China. It said he had the authority to act on behalf of Andrew “in engagements with potential partners and investors in China” but also asked that “this relationship remains confidential”.Explore more on these topicsPrince AndrewMonarchynewsShareReuse this content"

The force indicated it was Henrietta’s body that was found but stressed it had not yet been formally identified.The force said divers and other specialist officers had been redeployed to carry out further searches of the river and the riverbanks for Eliza Huszti between Queen Elizabeth Bridge and Victoria Bridge.Police Scotland had deployed divers, cadaver dogs and helicopters in the search for the women, who were part of triplets, soon after they were reported missing near the river on 7 January, but had called off those searches after nothing came to light.Supt David Howieson said they were very keen to find both women but that the search was challenging because the river, which feeds into Aberdeen harbour, was tidal.“Our thoughts are with the Huszti family today. We are keeping them fully updated following this recovery and the further search activity which is ongoing,” he said.“Our priority remains finding both of the sisters and the search has focused on the River Dee and will do so in the coming days.“Nothing from our extensive inquiries so far suggests either sister left the immediate area after they were last seen on Tuesday, 7 January. There is also nothing to suggest any suspicious circumstances or criminality.”The sisters moved to Aberdeen about 10 years ago and were said by their older brother, Jozsef, who lives in Budapest, to have been saving money to buy a flat in the city. He told the BBC their other triplet sister, Edit, had spoken to the women by video call on New Year’s Eve, and had found them happy and cheerful.‘Doesn’t make sense’: Aberdeen baffled by disappearance of Hungarian sistersRead moreIt was unclear whether any of the family had been to Aberdeen since the women went missing.The sisters rented a flat in a well-maintained block north of the Bon Accord shopping centre, where one of the women reportedly worked.The police said they had first been alerted to their disappearance by their landlady, who received a text message from Henrietta’s mobile phone at 2.12am on 7 January that indicated the sisters would not be returning to the flat. The phone was then cut off and has not been active since.CCTV footage recovered by the police showed that the sisters had previously visited the path along the river that they are believed to have taken that morning, at 2.50pm the previous day.CCTV from nearly 12 hours later, at 2.12am on 7 January, showed them walking from Market Street, past the container ships in Aberdeen harbour and across Victoria Bridge, which crosses the Dee where the river enters the harbour.The police believe they then turned right along the path, which skirts a series of industrial units and garages, westwards towards Aberdeen boat club, where they vanished. The area has since been repeatedly searched by specialist teams including marine divers and police dogs.Explore more on these topicsAberdeenScotlandHungarynewsShareReuse this content"

It is the first time in more than a century that a secretary’s first official visit abroad will be to Central America.“This is a truly historic visit that Secretary Rubio will be paying to the region,” said Mauricio Claver-Carone, United States special envoy for Latin America. “I can’t stress enough the historic nature of this visit and how it harkens back to President Trump’s overall message during his inauguration of the golden age of theAmericas.”Tension and defiance in Panama after Trump threatens to ‘take back’ canalRead moreTammy Bruce, the state department spokeswoman, added: “This is where we live. This is who we are. This is about not just wanting to have new partnerships – but that’s always good – but the nature of what it means to have an extended relationship with the people closest to you.”The visit will come just 10 days into a Trump administration that has already caused significant concern in the region, by declaring in his inaugural address that the US was “taking back” thePanamacanal and then proceeding to threaten Colombia with 25% tariffs for refusing to take US deportees sent to the country aboard military transport planes.“I think the president’s been pretty clear he wants to administer the canal again,” Rubio, who is scheduled to meet with Panamanian president José Raúl Mulino and tour the canal this weekend, said during a television interview.“Obviously, the Panamanians are not big fans of that idea. But that does not in any way replace the core reality that the Panama canal, we cannot allow any foreign power – particularly China – to hold that kind of potential control over it that they do. That just can’t continue.”Panama has launched an audit of several ports along the canal that are owned by a company based in China in a potential bid to appease Trump. But Panama’s comptroller has told the Guardian that the audits are motivated by politics and that they are not designed to deliver a peace offering to the United States.“I cannot negotiate and much less open a process of negotiation on the canal,” Mulino told reporters on Thursday. “That is sealed. The canal belongs to Panama.”Rubio also is expected to discuss curbing migration to the United States via Panama with Mulino. Panama’s government said that 300,000 migrants crossed the Darien Gap into Panama in 2024. That is 42% fewer than the previous year, Reuters reported.Rubio will then travel toEl Salvador, where he will meet with the hardline president Nayib Bukele, who has used a self-described “iron fist” to crack down on violence in the country.“Just decades ago – it was just a decade ago San Salvador was the murder capital of the world, and today it’s one of the safest cities in the world,” said Claver-Carone. “And those extraordinary measures, which are frankly the envy of a lot of countries throughout the western hemisphere, has really made him one of the most consequential leaders not only on security but a great ally on migration.”Throughout the visit, Rubio is expected to focus on combating growing Chinese influence in the region. China has become South America’s largest trading partner and is seeking to grow its “belt and road initiative” in Central America as well.“Everyone thought that China was literally going to become the most influential force throughout the Americas,” said Claver-Carone. “This is a re-pivot of the golden age of America, of the Americas, to leave, unequivocally, without a doubt, that the 21st century, akin to the 20th century, will be an American century.”Explore more on these topicsUS foreign policyMarco RubioPanamaAmericasCosta RicaGuatemalaDominican RepublicnewsShareReuse this content"

Opponents included members of Merz’s own CDU/CSU alliance who rebelled, as well as members of the pro-business Free Democratic party (FDP) who had voted for the original motion but wanted the law to return to internal committees for further debate.The “influx limitation law”, the name and detail of which has been criticised, was considered of such historic importance that the plenary hall was unusually full and some MPs were reportedly persuaded to leave their sickbeds to be present.Merz, who will lead the Christian Democratic Union into the 23 February elections, said his bill was necessary for German domestic security and denied he was working with the AfD, or had any intention of doing so.“There are many who are concerned about democracy, but there are also many who are concerned about security and order in this country and expect decisions to be made,” he said.The debate adjourned before it had even begun in order for behind-the-scenes negotiations that aimed to enable the law’s passage with the backing of mainstream parties and not the far right.Attempts by the Social Democrats (SPD), their coalition partner the Greens, as well as their former coalition partner the FDP, to stop the law’s passage by referring it back to committees earlier in the day were unsuccessful.When MPs returned to the plenary hall it was for an often rowdy, tension-filled and emotional debate.Much was made of the opposition to the proceedings, including the decision by a 99-year-old Holocaust survivor,Albrecht Weinberg, to return to the German state his order of merit over the Wednesday vote, as well as the resignation from the CDU of Michel Friedman, a prominent German-French publicist and former deputy chair of the Central Council of Jews in Germany.Merz said the law was necessary in response to a string of high-profile murders carried out by men with an immigrant background. The chancellor, Olaf Scholz, had said existing laws were sufficient to stop such attacks, if properly implemented.Between 66% and 67% of Germans are in favour of permanent controls on Germany’s borders, according to recent polls, including 56% of supporters of the Social Democrats.View image in fullscreenThe chancellor, Olaf Scholz, takes part in the vote.

But Weimar also failed because the authoritarian mindset never completely disappeared.”He had urged Merz to reverse his decision and “re-establish the firewall” against cooperating with the AfD. He suggested that if Merz failed to do so he would have to live with a damaged political reputation.“Your fall from grace will always accompany you,” Mützenich said, to jeers from the CDU benches. “But we can still close the gateway to hell together.”In an extraordinary broadside against his erstwhile CDU rival Angela Merkel, who on Thursdaycriticised Merzfor his apparent U-turn over earlier refusals to work with the AfD, Merz said his own party had a “significant share of responsibility” for the fact that the AfD had sat in the Bundestag since 2017.The remarks were a reference to Merkel’s open door policy, during which almost 1 million people entered Germany in 2015, but Merz went on to say it was the fault of the three-way coalition under Scholz that the party had since been able to become “twice as strong”.The foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock of the Greens, had urged Merz to change his mind and drop the bill. “It’s not about yourself, it’s about Germany,” she said. “There are times when you have to correct your policy by 180 degrees. That is precisely the question now. Do the right thing.”The first opinion poll on Friday since the Wednesday vote showed the AfD’s position unchanged in advance of the election. It is now second in the polls with 22%. Merz’s CDU/CSU was down one percentage point to 29%, while the SPD of Olaf Scholz gained 1.5 percentage points, bringing it to 17%, its best showing since the end of December. The Greens gained half a percentage point.Protests have taken place across Germany over the perceived shift to the right of the German parliament. At the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin on Thursday evening, a line of young people held up a long string of illuminated letters spelling out the slogan “Hope and Resistance”. On a poster bearing the CDU’s name, the wordbrandmauer(firewall) had been crossed out and replaced with the wordbrandstifter(arsonist).Explore more on these topicsGermanyAlternative für Deutschland (AfD)MigrationThe far rightEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

My view is that Trump is animated by his revenge and retribution agenda.”Career officials at the Department of Justice have been summarily fired – despite having civil service job protection – after being told they cannot be trusted to implement the returning president’s agenda.Among those purged are lawyers who were assigned to the investigation of Trump by the special prosecutor, Jack Smith, over his attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election and his removal of a trove of classified documents from the White House.Also targeted have been about 30 government watchdogs, known as inspectors general and responsible for rooting out corruption and wrongdoing. They were dismissed en masse last Friday night without the legally required 30-day notice being given to Congress.One possible motivation animating Trump’s grievance against the group is that it was an inspector general who initially informed Congress that Trump was improperly pressuring Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden during his last presidency, leading to his first impeachment.About 60 senior officials for the United States Agency for International Development (USAid) were put on leave after being accused of trying to circumvent the new administration’s order to freeze all aid operations worldwide.Other senior staff have found themselves switched from their areas of expertise to much less amenable roles after failing to demonstrate an acceptable standard of loyalty to Trump.Long-serving officials in the criminal and civil rights division of the justice department have been reassigned to newly created units intended to help enforce the administration’s immigration crackdown in so-called sanctuary cities.“People are being moved reassigned, fired or otherwise [put] under pressure, if they are not able to say that they are mission-aligned, which is the phrase being used by the transition team to mean you will carry out the orders of the president regardless of whether they’re lawful or not,” said Bergman.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But this one is mind-boggling,” he said. “Any rational, reasonably tightly wrapped, intelligent person would come to the conclusion that there is no other reason [than retribution].”One presumed future target could be Smith, whom Trump repeatedly assailed as “deranged” and suggested should be deported from the US.But Hirschhorn said Smith, who wound up his investigation after Trump’s election victory and resigned as special prosecutor before he took office, was protected by “prosecutorial immunity”.“Unless they can show that he absolutely acted in bad faith, which is not the situation here, any threat against him is like a fart in a category 5 hurricane,” said Hirschhorn. “It will go whimpering away.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationSecret ServiceDonald TrumpCIAUSAidCoronavirusAnthony FaucifeaturesShareReuse this content"

It will be available without charge – albeit with usage limits – to people who use the free version of OpenAI’s chatbot.DeepSeek rattled tech investors in the US with the release of R1, a so-called reasoning model that underpinned the company’s eponymous chatbot. News that it had topped Apple’s free app store and claims it had been developed at a fraction of the costwiped $1tn offthe tech-heavy Nasdaq index on Monday.OpenAI’s chief executive,Sam Altman, reacted to DeepSeek’s challenge by pledging to “deliver much better models” and accelerate product releases. He had first announced plans to release o3-mini – a less powerful version of the full o3 model that has yet to be released publicly – on 23 January, days after DeepSeek unveiled R1.“Today’s launch marks the first time we’re bringing reasoning capabilities to our free users, an important step towards broadening accessibility to advanced AI in service of our mission,” said OpenAI.R1, the underlying technology for DeepSeek’s chatbot, not only rivalled its OpenAI equivalent in performance but was also developed with fewer resources, according toDeepSeek. This has made investors ask whether US tech firms will continue their dominance of the AI market and generate a return on the multibillion-dollar sums they have invested in AI infrastructure and products.OpenAI said the o3-mini model matched its predecessor, o1, in maths, coding, and science but at a significantly lower cost and with faster responses. Users on ChatGPT’s Pro package, which costs $200 a month, will get unlimited access to o3-mini, while users on the cheaper Plus tariff will have higher usage limits than free users.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

[the die is cast]” on social media alongside a picture of him shaking hands with Belgium’s King Philippe.The royal palace confirmed an accord for a right-leaning coalition, which still has to be formally signed off by members of the participating parties.Split between French- and Dutch-speaking communities, and with a highly complex political system, Belgium has an unenviable record of painfully protracted coalition discussions – reaching 541 days back in 2010-2011.This time around, five groups have been seeking to forge a coalition since June elections thatfailed to produce a clear majority– with talks led by 54-year-old De Wever after his party claimed the most seats.The right and centre-right came out on top in June’s elections, leading analysts to predict coalition talks could take less time than usual.But negotiations hit a wall during the summer over the issue of plugging the country’s budget deficit – 4.4% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2023.De Wever, mayor of Antwerp since 2013, has pushed for cuts in social benefits and reforms to the country’s pension system that have already sparked opposition from labour unions.The flamboyant politician had threatened to throw in the towel on the hunt for a coalition if no deal was reached Friday – and the agreement was struck with just hours to go.Negotiators needed one final marathon 60-hour session to iron out differences over their 800-page programme.The new government brings together three parties from Dutch-speaking Flanders: De Wever’s conservative N-VA, the centrist Christian-Democrats and the leftist Vooruit (Onward).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This situation feels hopeless,” said Judith Saima, a 28-year-old merchant in Goma, where heavy fighting that cut the city off from the outside world and left bodies piling up in the streets only subsided two days ago.Access to food is a significant concern, after trade and agricultural supply routes were severed. “If this continues, we will all die, either from stray bullets or starvation,” said 26-year-old Ngise Ngeleka, a 26-year-old student living in the ULPG neighbourhood. Ngeleka said her neighbour had been hit by a bullet at the beginning of the week and that his body was still lying uncollected in the street.Adeline Tuma, who lives in the city with her four children, said: “We have nothing left to eat. My children cry from hunger. I make porridge without sugar. My shop has been looted. I curse this war. A new, grim chapter of our lives begins.”View image in fullscreenWorkers transport goods in vehicles at a bustling intersection in Goma.Photograph: Michel Lunanga/AFP/Getty ImagesThe UN said on Friday that at least 700 people had been killed and 2,800 injured in Goma since Sunday, according to an assessment conducted by the World Health Organization and the Congolese government.Travel by boat, which many people use to carry supplies, has effectively been banned since M23 occupied Minova, a port town along Lake Kivu, last month. Another route across a small border crossing linking Goma to Gisenyi inRwandahas also been blocked.Residents lost access to water and electricity on Sunday. On Thursday and Friday, power and mobile data services returned in some districts and the border with Rwanda, a lifeline for the city, was reopened, as M23 tried to show it could restore order and govern. The water supply is expected to return in the coming days. In the meantime, some residents have resorted to filling jerrycans from Lake Kivu.DRC mapM23 is the latest in a string of ethnic Tutsi-led insurgent groups that have operated in mineral-rich eastern DRC since a 2003 deal was meant to end wars that had killed 6 million people, mostly from hunger and disease. The group is backed by Rwanda, which says its primary interest is to eradicate fighters linked to the 1994 genocide. The Congolese government and several UN reports say in fact that Rwanda uses the group as a means to extract and then export valuable minerals for use in products such as mobiles phones.On Friday, the UN voiced alarm at rampant violence in eastern Congo, a day after expressing “deep concern” that the rebels were advancing south from Goma to Bukavu – capital of the neighbouring South Kivu province. The UN rights office said it had documented cases of summary executions and widespread rapes in recent days. “Conflict-related sexual violence has been an appalling feature of armed conflict in eastern DRC for decades,” a spokesperson said.For many in Goma, M23’s occupation brings back grim memories of the last time the group seized the city, in 2012. At the time it stayed for just 10 days, leaving when Rwanda’s international donors threatened to cut aid. This occupation already feels different.Children executed and women raped in front of their families as M23 militia unleashes fresh terror on DRCRead moreElisabeth Sikuli said: “In 2012, they entered in broad daylight. We heard a few bombs, but the clashes didn’t last long. This time, the situation is far worse. We spent three days hiding under our beds, without food.”Hospitals have been overwhelmed by people injured in the fighting, and relief efforts have been paralysed. Internally displaced people have gone without aid for days, prompting humanitarian organisations to issue urgent pleas for a cessation to the hostilities. Uniforms abandoned by exhausted Congolese troops have been picked up and worn by street children, some of whom have looted abandoned shops.“Although there are signs of reprieve in Goma after days of intense fighting, the need for shelter, food, water, medical supplies, and protection in the city remains overwhelming,” said Rose Tchwenko, Mercy Corps country director for DRC. “We are now in a race against time to save lives.”On Wednesday, M23declared its intention to remain in the cityand a day later Corneille Nangaa, head of Congo River Alliance, the political coalition backing the M23, asked residents “to go back to normal activities”. He also pledged to get children back in school within 48 hours and open a humanitarian corridor so people displaced by fighting could return home.At stake is a potential return to the situation that arose in the 1990s and 2000s, when Rwanda and Uganda and their proxy forces occupied and ran DRC’s eastern borderlands, managing trade, communications and transport.Not all people in Goma oppose the arrival of the Tutsi-led group. A senior UN official told Reuters this week: “A lot of people are sick and tired of the chaos. If they can trade, security improves, their daily lives improve, then M23 could be popular.”Olakire Senga said he thought the Congolese government had failed to protect its citizens. The doctor said: “I think we need to assess the maturity of those arriving and join them. Personally, I went out to welcome them.”Explore more on these topicsDemocratic Republic of the CongoRwandaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Hernandez also injured Wilson’s husband, Ryan Wilson, with whom she had two sons.Emily Hernandez at the Capitol on 6 January 2021.Photograph: FBIThe Wilsons were out celebrating their 15th wedding anniversary when Hernandez struck their car while driving westbound in the eastbound lanes of Interstate 44, as the St Louis television stationKDSK reported.Victoria Wilson, 32, died of her ensuing injuries. Court documents note that Ryan Wilson endured a disabling injury to his right foot. And investigators later determined Hernandez had a blood-alcohol content of .125, over Missouri’s legal limit of .08 for most motorists.On 5 November, the day Trump defeated Kamala Harris to clinch a second presidency, Hernandez pleaded guilty to driving while intoxicated leading to a person’s death and a separate charge of DWI resulting in serious injury. Her attorneys then filed documents contending that Hernandez deserved no more than about four months in prison, saying she acknowledged her actions were deadly and shameful.“Emily’s emotional make-up will forever contain feelings of remorse, grief and shame,” Hernandez’s attorneys wrote in the filings ahead of her sentencing.The January 6 attack on Congress was a desperate attempt to keep Trump in office after his first presidency ended in defeat to Joe Biden in the 2020 election. Hernandez pleaded guilty in federal court in January 2022 to a misdemeanor charge of entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds on the day of the Capitol insurrection.Pardoned January 6 rioter faces unresolved charges of soliciting a minorRead moreAs he successfully campaigned for a return to the White House four years later, Trump promised to pardon those who participated in the attack on Congress, during which the mob of the president’s supporters beat police officers and trashed the Capitol building. Their attack was linked to several deaths, including suicides of traumatized officers.Trump has been subjected to bipartisancriticismfor the sweeping clemency he afforded the Capitol attackers, including those who inflicted violence on police at the building.“It sends a message to others out there: if you use violence to keep Donald Trump in power, or use violence in the service of Donald Trump, he will have your back,” Adam Schiff, a California Democratic senator,saidon NBC’s Meet the Press on 26 January. “Because he did have their back ultimately.”Hernandez joined a number of pardoned Capitol attackers who have since made headlines overother brusheswith the law.Among those in that group is a man left grappling with unresolvedchargesin Texas of having solicited a minor. And yet another pardoned January 6 attacker was recentlyshot to deathby police during a traffic stop in Indiana.Explore more on these topicsUS Capitol attackUS crimeUS politicsMissouriDonald TrumpTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

All three were charged with criminal abortion by means of abortion-inducing drugs, a felony.The case appears to be the first instance of criminal charges against a doctor accused of sending abortion pills to another state – at least since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022 and opened the door for states to ban abortion.Texas sues New York doctor accused of mailing abortion pills across state linesRead moreCarpenter was alsosued by the Texas attorney generalin December under similar allegations of sending pills to that state. That case did not involve criminal charges.Carpenter did not immediately return a message, but the Abortion Coalition of Telemedicine, an organization she co-founded, issued a statement condemning theLouisianacase as “the latest in a series of threats that jeopardizes women’s access to reproductive healthcare throughout this country.“Make no mistake, since Roe v Wade was overturned, we’ve witnessed a disturbing pattern of interference with women’s rights,” the statement continued. “It’s no secret the United States has a history of violence and harassment against abortion providers, and this state-sponsored effort to prosecute a doctor providing safe and effective care should alarm everyone.”The indictment comes just months after Louisiana became the first state with a law to reclassify both mifepristone and misoprostol – pills commonly used in medical abortions – as “controlled dangerous substances”. The drugs are still allowed, but medical personnel have to go through extra steps to access them.Under the legislation, if someone knowingly possesses mifepristone or misoprostol without a valid prescription for any purpose, they could be fined up to $5,000 and sent to jail for one to five years. The law carves out protections for pregnant women who obtain the drug without a prescription to take on their own.“I have said it before and I will say it again: we will hold individuals accountable for breaking the law,” the Louisiana attorney general, Liz Murrill, a Republican, said in a statement on Friday.Since the fall of Roe v Wade, Louisiana has had a near-total abortion ban, without any exceptions for rape or incest. Under the law, physicians convicted of performing an illegal abortion, including one with pills, face up to 15 years in prison, $200,000 in fines and the loss of their medical license.In aninterview with Talk Louisiana, the district attorney Tony Clayton, a prosecutor on the case, said the minor’s mother gave her the pill. “The minor child was home alone, felt that she had to take the pill because of what her mother told her,” Clayton said.Friday’s indictment could be the first direct test of the ability of New York’s “shield law” to defend doctors from criminal prosecution. In the years after Roe fell,New Yorkbecame one of a handful of blue states that passed such shield laws,which are intended to protect prescribers who use telehealth to provide abortion pills to patients in states where abortion is banned.“This cowardly attempt out of Louisiana to weaponize the law against out-of-state providers is unjust and un-American,” Letitia James, the New York attorney general, who would enforce the shield law that could protect Carpenter from out-of-state prosecution, said in a statement. “We will not allow bad actors to undermine our providers’ ability to deliver critical care.”In the Talk Louisiana interview, Clayton acknowledged the New York shield law but said he thought he would “get over” it.“If that doctor were to travel to a state that has reciprocity with Louisiana, then that presents an issue for the doctor,” Clayton said. “I will seek a warrant and use whatever laws we have in place to effectively have a warrant.”Pills have become the most common means of abortion in the US, accounting for nearly two-thirds of them by 2023. They are also at the center of political and legal action over abortion. In January,one judge let three statescontinue to challenge federal government approvals for how one of the drugs usually involved can be prescribed.Explore more on these topicsUS newsLouisianaNew YorkAbortionReproductive rightsWomen's healthUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

The items were part of an exhibit, featuring more than 600 artefacts on loan, that had sought to offer visitors a glimpse of the glory of the Dacia civilisation, an ancient agrarian society that once thrived in what is today Romania.The helmet, in particular, had long been celebrated across Romania as a symbol of the country’s rich history, its image gracing school history textbooks, postage stamps and even a gold coin issued by the country’s national bank.“The helmet is one of the most popular and well-known ancient gold objects in Romania,” said Andrea Teunissen-Oprea, the honorary consul for Romania in the Netherlands. “Some people here are saying that it’s as if the Dutch would wake up and discover that [Rembrandt’s] The Night Watch was missing.”Dramatically studded and adorned with intricate designs that depict a lamb being sacrificed and mythical creatures such as a griffin, the helmet was believed to have been used during ceremonies. “It is unique in the world,” said Teunissen-Oprea. “Because there are no written documents from this period, the archaeological discoveries are incredibly important for Romania.”News of the heist had set off an “uproar” across Romania, she said, as mourning over the potential loss of the objects gave way to fury among the art world, politicians and media.“Even in our most pessimistic dreams, we would not have believed this to be possible,” said the director of Romania’s National History Museum, Ernest Oberländer-Târnoveanu, earlier this week.

He alleged that it was not sufficiently guarded – a claim the Drents Museum rebuffed – as he sprang into action, announcing that Romania would send a team of experts including forensic police officers to help with the investigation, while the loan of the objects would be investigated domestically.“This is a very serious situation,” he wrote on social media, “but this robbery, which must be resolved swiftly, must not become fuel for the spread of all kinds of conspiracy theories by those who aim to make easy political capital.”The comment appeared to be a reference to Romania’s far-right AUR movement. Emboldenedafter its strong showingin the presidential and parliamentary elections in late 2024, the party had seized on the theft to call for government resignations. The robbery was “a direct attack on our national history and identity”, it said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Dozens of detectives and specialist officers combed through the scores of tips that had poured into a dedicated hotline. On Wednesday, after a days-long manhunt, police saidthey had arrestedthree people.“The suspects are held under strict conditions and are being questioned about their role in the heist,” said Dutch police, who also released a photograph of another suspect and noted that they had not ruled out further arrests.The Drents Museum described the arrests as offering a glimmer of hope. “We are awaiting further developments with bated breath,” it said in a statement. “The recovery without damage would be, for all, a fantastic next step. Not only for us, but also for the Romanian population.”Police said the focus was now on recovering the stolen artefacts. It was in some ways a race against time, as the global headlines over the heist meant the objects were likely now too well-known to be sold as they were, sparking fears the thieves would destroy the priceless objects in an attempt to sell what might amount to only about 1kg of gold.It would be a relatively small payoff for such a daring feat, said Teunissen-Oprea. “There’s really a question of why they did it. Why only those four things? Because there were 600 other things there.”She was among the many frantically hoping that the pieces would be found intact. “We are praying that the pieces are found and not melted down,” she said. “It would be a huge loss not only for Romania, but for the entire cultural heritage ofEurope.”Explore more on these topicsNetherlandsRomaniaMuseumsEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Bertha von Suttner (€200), the Austrian pacifist and first woman to win the Nobel peace prize, is apparently worth 10 times the Polish-French scientist Marie Curie, an option for the €20.In the “rivers and birds” table option, a seascape of a northern gannet flying over big ocean waves is envisioned for the €200 note, with the European court of auditors on the back, while the European parliament is placed on the smallest €5 note, with a mountain spring and “wallcreeper next to a mountain landscape” on the other side.View image in fullscreenCould a northern gannet grace the €200 note?Photograph: Stuart Greenhalgh/AlamySince2016, the ECB has no longer issued a €500 note due to “concerns that this banknote could facilitate illicit activities”.Rob Wainwright, the then director of Europol, told the Dutch public broadcaster NOS at the time that the notes were far too handy for crime. “What we are seeing at Europol is that criminals and terrorists are using the €500 note … as their denomination of choice,” he said. “One million euros in €500 notes … can be moved in one small briefcase. Very convenient for these criminals and terrorists.”The leading European figures selected by the ECB could prove controversial, according to Reuters, as only six of the eurozone’s 20 countries are represented. Initial reactionson social mediahave also been critical, with calls for more focus on price stability instead of new notes. “Don’t fall for the ‘we love Europe’,” said one commentator on X. “Buy gold, silver and commodities.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When the euro banknotes were created bythe Austrian designer Robert Kalina, his “ages and styles of Europe” notes featured seven abstract, fictional bridges representing different design eras, rather than choosing one country’s designs or historical figures over the others. However, all these carefully neutral bridges now belong to the Netherlands, since the Dutch designer Robin Stamrecreated themin his home town of Spijkenissein 2011.The ECB still needed to organise a contest for EU designers, a jury, public consultation on the shortlist and the governing council decision, before a two-year process to get the notes into circulation, a spokesperson said. The cost of the redesign is understood to be between 5 cents and 8 cents per banknote.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionEuroCurrenciesGraphic designLudwig van BeethovenEuropean Central BankMaria CallasnewsShareReuse this content"

As darkness fell on Friday, workers had started constructing a 30-metre long a ramp that they hope will allow them to reach the man, whose cab is covered in soil and other debris.As residents of Yashio, a town in Saitama prefecture, questioned the slow pace of the rescue operation, the local fire chief, Tetsuji Sato, described the scene at the traffic intersection where thesinkholeopened up as “extremely dangerous”.“We are planning to construct a slope from a safer spot so that we will be able to send down heavy equipment,” Sato said, adding that groundwater was continuing the leak inside the hole, which is still expanding. The Kyodo news agency reported the sinkhole was 15 metres deep and 40 metres wide.Residents living within a 200-metre radius of the site were ordered to evacuate, and 1.2 million people in nearby towns and cities have been asked to cut back on baths and laundry to prevent leaking sewage water from making the operation even more hazardous.“It’s difficult not to use the toilet, but we are asking people to do their best to use less water,” a prefectural official said.Authorities in Yashio believe the sinkhole was formed as a result of corroded sewage pipes, which allowed water to seep into the surrounding soil and loosen it. Some sewage water in the area has been collected and disinfected before being released into a nearby river to reduce the runoff into the hole.The rescue operation, in its fourth day, has been complicated by further erosion of the sinkhole walls, making it impossible for workers to remain below ground for long periods.Concern is growing for the health of the trapped truck driver, who spoke to rescue workers shortly after his vehicle fell into the hole on Tuesday morning, but has not been heard from since around noon the same day. The 72-hour period considered crucial to the survival of people who become trapped without food or water has passed.Workers had hoped to complete the slope by the end of Friday, but an official said it could take several days to complete.Once the ramp is complete, heavy equipment will be used to clear the rubble and rescue workers will venture into the sinkhole to search for the man, Kyodo said.Some people living nearby questioned why it was taking so long to locate the truck driver. “It feels rather abnormal that the search is taking this long,” Takuya Koroku, a 51-year-old factory worker, told Agence France-Presse. “I wonder if he could have been saved much sooner. I’m scared to go near it.”Explore more on these topicsSinkholesJapanAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Sam Wollaston travels to Costa Rica to see what it’s like – but things do not go to planSam WollastonFri 31 Jan 2025 08.00 ESTShareIam slithering across the forest floor, stealthily, silently, like a pit viper perhaps? But that would make me the predator and I think I’m the prey here. Actually – to be honest – slithering and stealthily are wishful thinking; it’s more like trying to creep, a little stooped, in an attempt to be less visible toBear Grylls, who is hunting me. Although – further honesty alert! – he’s not really hunting me. We’ll come to that.I’m trying to remember what Grylls said in his brief about how to avoid detection. A lot of things beginning with S: sound obviously, though it’s hard to be quiet here because the forest floor is covered in dry leaves and twigs. Smell is another; wish I’d gone easier on the Lynx Jungle Fresh – hopefully Bear is upwind. Shadow, silhouette and shine are also no-nos, some of which Grylls himself helped with by rubbing dirt on my face.Time for some explanation. Grylls has a new TV show, Celebrity Bear Hunt, on Netflix. Twelve celebs – including a Spice Girl, a Saturday, a Strictly judge, an Inbetweener and a former tennis player – are holed up in a beach house on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica. After instruction from Grylls, they are given tasks – build a shelter, jump off a moving boat, that kind of thing. If they fail, they get released into the Bear Pit, an area of terrifying and dangerous jungle, where they must evade capture as Grylls hunts them down. It’s the Scouts meets The Hunger Games, with Holly “Right, deep breath” Willoughby presenting.Netflix has invited a few journalists and influencers (I like to think I straddle the genres) to Costa Rica during filming, to try a task, have a chat with the main man, and – crucially – experience a Bear Hunt. Yes, I have come to Costa Rica to be hunted, in the jungle, by Bear Grylls. IfMel B, Una Healy, Shirley Ballas, Joe Thomas andBoris Beckercan, then I can too.View image in fullscreen‘I always want to be building people to learn skills’, says GryllsPhotograph: Netflix/PAI know, a long way to go for a stunt, and there are questions about whether it warrants the flight. But here’s my lame attempt at justification: I spent some time in Costa Rica in my 20s, teaching English, and here was an opportunity to return for the first time. I remember a few days in Santa Rosa national park on the Pacific coast, watching turtles lay eggs on the beach, sharks cruising in the river mouth, crocodiles fishing in the shallows. I actually quite fancy my chances against an Old Etonian TV presenter … Oh, but on arrival, we are told that Grylls won’t be hunting us after all, due to the heavy filming schedule, and “some safety concerns”, though it’s apparently safe enough for Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen. (Flamboyantroom-changerLLB is also a contestant. Completing the lineup: Steph McGovern, Leomie Anderson, Kola Bokinni, Danny Cipriani,Big ZuuandLottie Moss). We are promised a chat with Grylls, and taken to see the camp where the celebrities are living – while they’re off doing a task, so we don’t meet any.The camp is lovely, like a rustic yoga retreat. But I’m wondering why I had to have a rigorous medical – and every travel vaccination under the sun – to tour a beach house then sit in an air-conditioned portacabin.To be fair, the show does sound fun. I’m looking forward to Mel B’s encounter with a crocodile (who was more scared?) and Becker opening up about being banged up. It’s a big operation. Millions of Netflix dollars, a crew of 300. We visit some mudflats for a task – dismantle a shelter, then build it again. Mucky, not too tricky, I’m prepared, I don’t give up, I survive. C’mon, take me to that Pit …No, first a briefing from the health and safety team. Things to watch out for: snakes, spiders, scorpions, ticks, death apple trees … bloody hell, it is beginning to sound ominous. We put on helmets and harnesses, and a veteran named Scottie in full combat gear leads us into the Bear Pit.View image in fullscreenGrylls with Holly Willoughby and the celebrity contestants.Photograph: Tom Dymond/NetflixWe walk for a few yards and pause by a map. Suddenly I feel a tap on my shoulder … Oh, hello! Bear Grylls has snuck up, wearing black and carrying a coiled rope. He tells us about the stuff beginning with S that will give us away – sound, smell etc – before rubbing dirt on our faces. “To break up your shape, take the shine off you, as well as protect you from ants and mosquitoes.”Not that it matters, now that he’s not actually going to be hunting us. He does have time for a quick stroll through the Bear Pit, talking as we walk, hitting us with the Bear Grylls shtick. “I always want to be building people to learn skills …. Men and women want to be alert in life, be on the front foot … You’ve got thousands of years of primal stuff driving through you, these are natural skills for you.”When I ask if we’ve gone soft, the so-called snowflake generation, he talks about mettle. “It’s a muscle. If we try nothing, never step out of our comfort zone, your mettle muscle gets weak.” There is a snowflake state of mind, but it’s not generational or encapsulated by young people. “As chief scout [he led the young person’s groupuntil July 2024] I see young people I’m incredibly impressed by – resilient, motivated, positive, determined to change the world, combat climate change, start businesses. They’re not just going to coast. But if you don’t get any training in resilience you get weak.”Do we need survival skills – building shelters or crawling through the forest – in the modern world, though? They are transferable, he says. “It’s a reflection of how to be tough in everyday life.” We come to a trap that has been set in the path, covered with leaves, which Grylls demonstrates using a young influencer. Stand there, and … whoosh! Suddenly there’s an influencer hanging in the air in a net, like a trawler’s haul. Not so influential up there, are you?There’s a lesson here, says Grylls: don’t get track happy. “The easy path never leads anywhere good.” He also has a thing about people living in green, amber and red. “Green is walking along looking at your phone, not concentrating, someone could be walking past naked and you wouldn’t notice. It’s how most people live – but we didn’t become the dominant species by living in green. Then you have amber, when you’re more alert, aware and looking around you. And red which is high intensity, like a soldier going through the door of a building. You can’t live in red for long, like 30 seconds. This place is about trying to live alert, when to push, when to hold back.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Bear Pit doesn’t seem that wild or terrifying; we’ve walked along a path for a few minutes from the road, it’s scrubby rather than thick forest. I think he senses our disappointment – that we’ve been put on the easy path and it’s not going anywhere good. “Do you want to have a little experience of stalking?”Yes please Bear. We need to hurry, he’s not got much time, he’ll go over there by that tree on the path, we’ll try to sneak up on him without being seen. “Use the cover, be smart, I’m going to see who gets the closest to me, without me spotting you,” he says. “Like Grandmother’s Footsteps …”Seriously?! I’ve had every health check available, been vaccinated to the eyeballs, and come all the way to Costa bloody Rica to play Grandmother’s Footsteps!That’s when I meet a man called Diego behind a tree – who agrees to swap headwear, giving me his green cap, which has bits of foliage sticking out of it. A bike mechanic from San Jose, he’s been hired to make sure Mel B et al are OK. Quite a few of the trees have people behind them. Oh, and here’s a fence. You know what, this Bear Pit is less scary than the London park at the bottom of my road, and considerably smaller. One of the health and safety team tells me it’s 500 or 600 metres long, and 300 metres wide at its widest, and it’s someone’s private land. “Not jungle by any means,” admits Scottie.I know, it shouldn’t be a massive surprise: reality TV isn’t quite as it seems. And I’m sure it will look the part on the telly. But I am shocked at just how unwild the Bear Pit is. It’s a little strip of privately owned dry woodland, just off the road to the beach. There’s a house just over there – I can hear the dog.Even wearing Diego’s leafy headgear, my lame stoop and underfoot crunching mean I don’t get very close and I’m soon spotted. “Behind the tree,” Grylls calls, from the path. The influencer who a short time ago was hanging in the air in a net wins, proving perhaps that gen Z has plenty of mettle (or is good at Grandmother’s Footsteps). A couple of all-terrain vehicles arrive (there’s also a track into the Bear Pit) to take us the short way back to the production base, air-conditioned cabins and a fridge full of cold drinks.Some of the celebrities are due on site for an actual Bear Hunt. We’re herded politely but smartly on to a bus and whisked away to avoid any unscheduled encounters.The following day, the flight out of Guanacaste Airport takes us up the Pacific coast and over Santa Rosa national park. It’s a vast carpet of green where the trees don’t have health and safety people hiding behind them; where the squawking, chatter and howling comes not from crew radios and celebrities on the hunt for fame, but from macaws and monkeys. Where the crackle of breaking twigs is not Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen crashing through the undergrowth but a herd of peccaries on the prowl.Celebrity Bear Hunt is on Netflix on Wednesday 5 February.Explore more on these topicsBear GryllsReality TVfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That’s not us, says the communityVictoria Clayton in Los AngelesFri 31 Jan 2025 11.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 31 Jan 2025 11.04 ESTShareView image in fullscreenIllustration: Allie Sullberg/The GuardianWhen music mogul and rapperSean “Diddy” Combswas arrested in September on federal charges including sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy, a narrative started to build: Diddy parties apparently extended far beyond his celebrated white parties, in which guests at the star-studded events donned white clothing and munched white food supposedly to represent simplicity and break down barriers.Accounts soon emerged of other legendary Combs parties. Referred to as “freak offs”, these events allegedly involved group sex, kink, BDSM, public masturbation and plenty of baby oil – more than 1,000 bottles of the slippery stuff was found when officers raided Combs’s Los Angeles mansion.Combs has entered a plea of not guilty and is jailed in New York awaiting a trial set for May. Combs’s handlers, meanwhile, got to work defending him to the public. They have maintained that the mogul did nothing wrong and was merely engaged in an unconventional adult “lifestyle”.But practitioners of unconventional adult lifestyles – often referred to as “sex-positive” – take issue.This is how we do it: ‘We don’t share the intimate details of the sex we have with other people’Read more“People in our community don’t want to be equated with people who are under investigation for things that include sexual misconduct and coercion,” explains Sophia Iannicelli, executive director of thePan Eros foundation, a Seattle non-profit that aims to celebrate consent and sexuality through education and the arts. Iannicelli says people like Combs can sully the reputation of the sex-positive community and become “a really big driver for people not wanting to be more open about doing things that are considered unconventional from a sexual or a relationship point of view”.Her organization hosts the annualSeattle Erotic Art festivalas well as educational events. They also manage Gallery Erato, a space for other groups to host events and parties, including group sex parties and masturbation events called “jackoffs”. Some of these activities may mirror those that allegedly took place at Combs’ freak offs, but there’s a significant difference, Iannicelli says: “In the sex-positive community, first and foremost, consent is everything.”The Consent Academyis an educational arm of Pan Eros that works to educate about the nuances of consent. Its website defines consent as “a shared feeling, created together through a process of constant, collaborative discovery. It’s a feeling that comes from voluntary agreement (made without coercion) between those with decision-making capacity, knowledge, understanding, and autonomy.”Co-director Asha Lerae points out that there are stringent guidelines, saying: “For example, sex between children and adults is never consensual.” (Several suits allege that Combs or associates engaged in sexual acts with minors.)A major power differential is also problematic. If you are someone’s teacher, employer, supervisor or mentor, or you are a music mogul holding a career over someone’s head, Lerae notes, mutual consent becomes nearly impossible.The point, says co-director Ariana Coveney, is that if you want to have a kinky or non-conventional sex party, it needs to be with willing people on equal footing.While there is something called “chem sex” in which people intentionally take certain drugs to heighten a sexual experience, the sex-positive community is mostly wary of drugs and excessive alcohol consumption.“Intoxication takes away consent,” warns Hercules Liotard, a Vermont sex educator and pleasure coach.Rest assured, though, that you don’t have to be a mogul to take part in a non-conformative sex party. A large variety of sex events – kink, BDSM, leather, swinger parties and more – are happening “all the time, everywhere”, says Liotard, an advisory board member ofSex Positive World, an organization that started in Portland, Oregon, in 2009 and now includes more than 5,000 members and 10 chapters in cities across the US and Europe.Sex Positive World and local chapters host non-traditional-sex events. There are also many private members-only sex clubs throughout the US. “People may have a sense that sex events are only happening in very liberal areas, but it’s really not true,” says Liotard. Florida, New Hampshire, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas and Utah – to name just a few states – have very active swinger and kink communities. “It’s really all over if you look,” Liotard says. Liotard even noticed a large conservative contingency supporting Trump onFet Life, which he describes as the “kinky Facebook”.Proponents say open-mindedness about sex and sex events should be embraced by everyone regardless of political persuasion. “A lot of the people have been raised in a very sex-negative environment with very sex-negative messages,” says Emily Prior, editor of theJournal of Positive Sexuality. “And so anything that we’ve been taught about sex is usually all the bad things … ‘Here are all the horrible things that could happen if you have sex outside of the heteronormative marriage.’” But when done ethically and legally, there may be health benefits to expanding one’s sexuality: studies show that positive sexual experiences improve mental health, reduce stress and anxiety, and enhance physical health.Dr Jessica M Yih, assistant professor of urology and director of women’s sexual health and male infertility at the University of California, Irvine, agrees. “I always encourage people to explore different things,” says Yih, who points out that it’s liberating to be open to various and changing sensual and sexual experiences throughout one’s lifespan. “We don’t have to just do penis and vagina our entire lives.” For some people, being sex positive may also include embracing celibacy or asexuality if that’s what they’re called to do.Unfortunately for the curious folks, though, cases such as Combs’s can induce fear and certainly don’t help the sex-positive movement.Coveney from the Consent Academy has some good advice: “If you want to put on a sex party, come to us. There are far better and safer ways to do it than the freak off.”"

It’s a line that feels very on brand. Hurry Up Tomorrow’s release has been promoted with billboards declaring “THE END IS NEAR”, social media posts in which Tesfaye has inferred the album is the final “beautiful chapter” in his story and interviews during which he’s suggested that a 2022 incident in which he lost his voice on stage was some kind of cosmic message: “You can end it now … when is the right time to leave if not at your peak?”View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Hurry Up Tomorrow.Photograph: XO Music/RepublicIt is perhaps worth noting that the same was true of his last album more-or-less:2022’s Dawn FMwas rich with end-times imagery, mentions of the afterlife and arrived accompanied by interviews in which Tesfaye announced his desire to “remove the Weeknd from the world”. A cynic might suggest that implying he’s about to retire – or at least retire the Weeknd persona that he has inhabited for the last 13 years – now seems part of his release strategy. In fairness, it feels a lot more explicit this time around. One theory is that Tesfaye is more interested in pursuing a career in film, something viewers ofThe Idol, the abysmal drama series he co-wrote and starred in in 2023, might consider less of a career move than a terrible threat.Still, it’s not a theory Hurry Up Tomorrow does much to dispel. It lasts as long as a movie – nearly 90 minutes – and it’s rich in samples from soundtracks: Giorgio Moroder’s score for Scarface, David Lynch’s Eraserhead. It also comes accompanied by a full-length feature film, once more co-written by and starring Tesfaye (Oh, good). In addition, while there are umpteen covers featuring different artwork, the version that has been punted out to streaming services looks remarkably like a movie poster. A close up of Tesfaye’s face, sweaty and grimacing, it’s both striking and mysterious: he could be on stage, in agony or in the throes of passion. Equally, he could just be suffering the after-effects of last night’s chicken phall.Or he could have been reading Hurry Up Tomorrow’s lyrics, which are enough to bring anyone out in a sweaty grimace. There are moments when they slip into standard Weeknd mode, alternately predatory and injured – “She’s addicted to the rush … she trust me with her life” etc – but they are primarily concerned with telling you how awful it is being rich and famous. That’s a tough sell at the best of times, although, in recent years, the charts have played host to a number of pop albums that have painted a very convincing picture of 21st-century celebrity’s downside, Billie Eilish’sHappier Than Everand Olivia Rodrigo’sGutsamong them.The Weeknd: Timeless – videoBut a striking depiction of a panic attack on Baptized in Fear aside, Hurry Up Tomorrow really doesn’t boast their lyrical depth or nuance. You’re left feeling that Tesfaye deserves some kind of kudos just for singing a line as bad as “in this penthouse prison, I’m alone” with a straight face; likewise the song in which he admonishes a lover for complaining with a petulant little stamp of “you know it’s my opening night!” or Reflections Laughing’s wail: “I’m trapped inside a gilded cage.” Indeed, it is occasionally so on the nose you wonder if it might not be treating the subject with a certain degree of knowing camp, as when Enjoy the Show features a voicemail message inquiring about the star’s welfare, accompanied by a soundtrack of drinks being slurped, pills rattling, lungfuls of smoke being inhaled and suspicious sniffing.Darkness, drama and Daft Punk: the Weeknd’s best songs – ranked!Read moreArch or sincere, it becomes fairly exhausting over the course of an hour and half. It would be more exhausting still if the music on Hurry Up Tomorrow wasn’t as great as it is. Tesfaye has described the album’s sound as “Frankenstein”, and you sometimes see what he means. São Paulo jumps from Brazilian funk to a punishing house pulse midway through, Given Up on Me stitches together a lot of jarring fragments into an entirely gripping whole: a slowed-down, Auto-Tuned sample of Nina Simone’s Wild Is the Wind; a sped up sliver of 70s soul; beatless, chopped-up piano chords. But even at its most straightforward, it’s marked out by brilliantly turned melodies and fantastic production touches: the George Harrison-esque guitar that runs throughout Reflections Laughing; the rubbery bassline of I Can’t Wait to Get There, the stew of sickly sounding electronics and lush 70s soul-inspired backing vocals on Big Sleep. It’s a peculiar sensation: an album that floors you at the same time as it’s driving you up the wall.It goes all out for a blockbuster ending, courtesy of two big ballads. Without a Warning has a certain end-credits quality, but it concludes with the sound of an audience screaming and cheering, as if demanding an encore. They duly get one with the blockbusting title track, which has a sparkling melody, a vaguely Purple Rain-ish grandeur and really does sound like a leave-taking: “I’m ready for the end … I have no more fights left to win.” Off he goes, perhaps permanently, leaving behind an album that frequently presses great songs into the service of rotten lyrics. Suggesting that the Weeknd has run out of stuff to say but not impressive ways of saying itmanages to make you think his apparently imminent departure is a shame – and probably just as well.Explore more on these topicsThe WeekndPop and rockR&Balbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

Plus: is Thunderbolts* Marvel’s answer to The Suicide Squad and will Tron: Ares be as good as it looks?Ben ChildFri 31 Jan 2025 12.29 ESTLast modified on Fri 31 Jan 2025 12.31 ESTShareThere are moments in life when you expect to be confronted by greatness: hearing a live orchestra swell into the opening notes of John Williams’ Star Wars theme; standing at the edge of the Scottish Highlands; watching a dog somehow open a fridge and retrieve a beer for its owner. And then there are moments when greatness sneaks up on you in the form of an 82-year-old Hollywood legend, materialising like a grumpy mirage, one metre from your face, during what you thought was a routine Disney presentation of new movies and TV shows.Harrison Ford is not a man one simply stumbles upon. He is a force of nature, a living relic of an era when leading men didn’t have to spend six months on a chicken-and-rice diet before taking their shirts off. And yet, here he is, looking suitably nonplussed with the entire concept of being on a stage, fielding questions alongside his Captain America: Brave New World co-stars in an impromptu Q&A with all the enthusiasm of a guy who somehow finds himself trapped in the world’s most boring hostage video.Harrison Ford’s MCU debut can wait. I prefer his whisky adsRead moreAnd perhaps this is the true magic of Disney, that an actor such as Ford can be persuaded to star as Thaddeus “Thunderbolt” Ross (now the new president of the USA) in aMarvelmovie about a guy with metal wings whose job is to save us all from a sinister genius whose head is rapidly outgrowing his ambitions (Tim Blake Nelson’s The Leader) and a gang of snake-themed terrorists who, despite their name, are disappointingly not actually snakes. It’s a classic Marvel dilemma: can Sam Wilson protect democracy, avert global catastrophe, and stop Harrison Ford from walking off set midway through a fight scene because he’s had enough of this nonsense?During his appearance at Disney’s 2025 slate presentation, Ford was typically gracious about the work done by the late William Hurt, who starred as Ross in previous Marvel and 20th Century Fox films but passed away in 2022. “I’m beginning to understand that this is a big family and I’m a small part of it,” he said with that habit of gruff understatement Ford-watchers have come to know and love. “The attraction of Marvel films for me is watching wonderful actors have fun and play. So when the opportunity came along I was grateful. It’s a new genre and audience for me, and it was fun.”The assembled audience is also treated to an exclusive clip of the new film, out 14 February, in which we already know Ford will end up transforming into the Red Hulk. It’s an action-packed set piece in which Wilson (Anthony Mackie) infiltrates an enemy base, and showcases the new winged Captain America suit, which we’re told was given to Sam by those helpful Wakandans. . Marvel has always been a franchise built on increasingly wobbly physics, but even the most generous audience might struggle to believe that a bloke with no serum and no billionaire gadgets could stand toe-to-toe with a bad guy whose brain is so large it requires its own postcode.View image in fullscreenEnough of this nonsense … Ford as Red Hulk/President Thaddeus Ross.Photograph: Marvel StudiosElsewhere on the slate of new movies, we were treated to an intriguing look at the upcoming Thunderbolts*, which increasingly looks like it will be Marvel’s answer to The Suicide Squad, but with fewer talking sharks and more ex-Avengers. The return of David Harbour’s Red Guardian and Florence Pugh’s Yelena Belova, and plenty of heavily accented eastern European badinage, might well be worth the price of admission alone. Wyatt Russell’s John Walker/US Agent looks as if he’s been through the mill since we last saw him in the Disney+ show The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, and there’s still no confirmation of why the Thunderbolts* have an asterisk next to their name. Will this one be Marvel’s new Guardians of the Galaxy? Or just another Eternals – a film that technically exists, gets released, but is then spoken about as often as Thor: The Dark World? We’ll find out in May when the movie hits cinemas.Also on the slate is Tron: Ares, starring Jared Leto as the titular AI, who arrives in the real world from the digital domain with an undisclosed but dangerous mission. Footage shown didn’t go that far beyond what we’ve seen in trailers, but it all looks visually splendid, with light cycles flying here there and everywhere through human cities. There’s no way of knowing, of course whether all this incredibly expensive-looking digital sorcery will end up getting lost in a logic vortex by the time the titles roll this October.Jeff Bridgesis back again, and let’s hope there’s a better part written for him this time than the two versions of Kevin Flynn that turned up fairly pointlessly in 2010’s Tron: Legacy.That’s the thing about living legends – it’s only worth wheeling them out for a late-stage encore if you can give them something meatier than looking vaguely mystical or, in Harrison Ford’s case, brilliantly playing the US president with all the enthusiasm of a man who just found out his Light Cycle got impounded.Explore more on these topicsFilmWeek in geekSuperhero moviesHarrison FordMarvelWalt Disney CompanyDisney+Jared LetofeaturesShareReuse this content"

A writer slightly more famous than the author of the book you’re buying might have called it “whip-smart”, “illuminating” or “a tour de force”, for example – presumably so that fans of the more famous writer will take a punt on the less famous one.But soon we may not see so many of these author blurbs – Sean Manning, publisher of Simon & Schuster’s flagship imprint in the US, has writtenan essay for Publishers Weeklyexplaining that as of this year he will “no longer require authors to obtain blurbs for their books”.“While there has never been a formal mandatory policy in the eight years I’ve been with the Simon & Schuster imprint, it has been tacitly expected that authors – with the help of their agents and editors – do everything in their power to obtain blurbs to use on their book cover and in promotional material. I have always found this so weird,” Manning wrote in his essay.“The argument has always been that this is what makes the book business so special: the collegiality of authors and their willingness to support one another. I disagree. I believe the insistence on blurbs has become incredibly damaging to what should be our industry’s ultimate goal: producing books of the highest possible quality.”Authors feeling obliged to write blurbs for their friends can create “an incestuous and unmeritocratic literary ecosystem that often rewards connections over talent”, he added.“Thank God,” was the reaction of British writer Jo Hamya. “Honestly, it’s just an insular and repetitive format.”Irish novelist Naoise Dolan also welcomed the move. “Pragmatically speaking, I do give blurbs and am very grateful to receive them because as an individual author, you want to be supportive (and supported) within the industry as it currently stands. But I would be delighted if they were done away with,” she said. “There are famous authors who give blurbs to complete strangers; I’ll never forget Hilary Mantel doing so for my first book. But by and large, blurbs reflect who’s friends with whom. It’s natural, and not at all a bad thing, for writers to find companionship with people whose work they admire. But I think we would all breathe easier in these intellectual friendships if our publishers didn’t constantly make us pester one another for glorified marketing copy.”Yet twice Booker prize-nominated author William Boyd thinks Simon & Schuster might be “shooting itself in the foot”.“I once asked an editor of mine what was the benefit of blurbs and he said that blurbs weren’t so much aimed at the casual browser but at the bookseller. Booksellers are inclined to order more books if the book in question has been well-blurbed, apparently,” he said. “Any little help one can give to a fellow author is worthwhile, I reckon.”Manning did state that “if a writer reads a book because they want to (not because they feel beholden) and comes away so moved by it that they can’t resist offering an endorsement, we will be all too happy to put it to use”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Taking place simultaneously at both the state-of-the-art arena (which opened in August) and the longtime city staple the Kia Forum, the roster, which included everyone fromJoni Mitchellto Peso Pluma, wasannouncedin the wake of thedevastating firesthat struck the area earlier this month and broadcast around the world to raise funds and awareness, the atmosphere before showtime was neither celebratory nor subdued, striking a delicate balance to coalesce over a common love forLos Angelesand its ongoing strife.A red carpet where flashbulbs are usually popping was mostly quiet as a mouse, with photographers invariably checking their lenses; perhaps the stars in attendance knew it would be inept to have a fashion moment on such an occasion. Even inside the arena, the usual pre-concert buzz of boisterous mingling and drink sipping was missing.2025 Grammys will celebrate music but also raise money for LA fire reliefRead moreKicking off at the Forum,Green Dayopened the show; an apt choice to slowly rev up the proceedings considering the rockers exude that California pedigree (they’re from the Bay Area, after all) before welcoming Los Angeles nativeBillie Eilishfor a rendition of the band’s 2019 song Last Night on Earth. Eilish would provide a bookend, helping start the proceedings here and then helping close them nearly six hours later with a set of her own alongside brother Finneas. And no, she didn’t sing the Barbie song.View image in fullscreenBilly Crystal.Photograph: John Shearer/Getty Images for FireAidTo welcome the crowd, perennial master of ceremoniesBilly Crystaltook the stage. Poignantly missing was his usual black tie associated with his starry hosting gigs: tonight he flaunted a hoodie and knit cap, which Crystal said were all he wore after he was evacuated and hishome was destroyed.After announcing a $1m donation fromU2(seemingly one of the only acts in music not on the roster), Crystal delivered an emotional speech comparing the death of his father as a young boy to this recent tragedy, and the healing power of laughter. Naturally he cracked, “This young girl came up to me, and said she understood my pain because she had lost TikTok for a day,” Crystal said, before adding: “With your help around the country and here in the room, we’ll laugh again, we’re gonna listen to music again, and we will be OK.”View image in fullscreenDr Dre and Anderson .Paak.Photograph: Scott Dudelson/Getty Images for FireAidVolleying back and forth between the arenas, the roster was like hitting shuffle on a music nerd’s eclectic playlist.Alanis Morissette, Earth, Wind & Fire andPinkwere all on hand busting out a mix of their biggest hits and covers, with the latter singer noting she’ll have her feet down on the ground on this occasion, a wry nod to her normal high-flying wire routine. Sometimes the juxtaposition was fierce: Graham Nash delivered a rendition of his 1968 Hollies-era ballad Teach Your Children, while Anderson .Paak brought outDr Dreand Sheila E for a mini hip-hop concert that naturally included Dre’s 1995 collaboration with 2Pac, California Love.In fact, almost every California anthem one could think of was on full display at FireAid, perhaps save for Randy Newman’s I Love LA. Inside the Intuit Dome,Katy Perrysang her pop confection California Gurls, as well as Roar and Rise, the latter flanked (at least momentarily) by the Pasadena Chorale. (Notably Perry skipped any songs from her most recentill-received album 143). Meanwhile Jelly Roll, assisted by SoCal native Travis Barker on the drums, fashioned a rollicking spin on the 70s Bob Seger classic Hollywood Nights while theRed Hot Chili Peppersclosed out the Kia Forum portion of the show with the longest set of the night and a spate of their own odes to the City of Angels with pitch-perfect renditions including Californication and Dani California. And proving the night wasn’t too somber, Flea performed in nothing but underwear.View image in fullscreenGwen Stefani.Photograph: Scott Dudelson/Getty Images for FireAidFellow 90s rock iconsNo Doubt, perhaps reliving theirrecent Coachella reunion, also took to the stage, though they curiously focused on a gender-split singalong to Just a Girl.Guitar geeks had to be happy, with appearances byJohn Mayer, Joan Jett, Slash and the surviving members ofNirvana. The latter band, who only get together for charity shows and one-offs, flaunted an array of frontwomen including Kim Gordon, St Vincent and drummer Dave Grohl’s daughter Violet; however, their set stumbled a bit thanks to sound mix issues. Baby boomers and gen Z were also well represented with the likes of John Fogerty (79) andRod Stewart(80) energetically commanding the stage, whileOlivia Rodrigo(21) and Gracie Abrams (25) all flaunted their biggest hits; the crowds spreading the love equally among the generations.Los Angeles musicians lost homes, studios and instruments: ‘A part of you is gone’Read moreDespite the once-in-a-lifetime nature of the concert, as the night went on and midnight approached, the audience was getting listless. The father next to me, with two young girls, was nodding off. It was a school night after all, but it was clear promoters savedLady Gaga, one of the night’s major draws, for last. Sting, who performed as the audience inside the Intuit Dome started to chat among themselves, couldn’t fully capture their attention. By 12.30Stevie Wondersang Love’s in Need of Love Today, which he previously performed at a bevy of charity events including the America: A Tribute to Heroes concert in the days following 9/11, before Flea and Sting joined him for Higher Ground.View image in fullscreenLady Gaga.Photograph: Amy Sussman/Getty Images for FireAidFinally, Gaga appeared with dyed eyebrows and a black wig. Sitting at a piano, she performed a pair of A Star Is Born tracks: the earworm Always Remember Us This Way and Shallow, before surprising the audience with a new one. Written with fiance Michael Polansky, she said she crafted it “just for tonight”, albeit it sounded more Broadway than the Gaga-pop she’s known for.By the end of the night, it was lost how much money was raised; gone are the Jerry Lewis telethon days when a ticker showed the numbers climbing higher and higher. Perhaps the number was so big it could have discouraged additional donations. Regardless of the figure, FireAid proved the power of music and how a just cause can bring together polar opposites. If anything, here’s hoping it’s a harbinger for the future.Explore more on these topicsMusicCalifornia wildfiresBillie EilishBilly CrystalLady GagaGreen DayGwen StefanifeaturesShareReuse this content"

It also means you don’t need a bike-specific bag – just throw in whatever you’re carrying that day. Fit your crate atop the rear pannier rack, or do it the Dutch way and buy a front rack (for compatible flat handlebar bikes). If in doubt, ask your local bike shop about your options – some bikes and components are incompatible.Almost universal rackView image in fullscreenJack the bike rack£79.99 at WholeGrain CyclesFrom £76 at Sigma SportsFor something a bit different, or if your bike doesn’t have the necessary bolts for a front rack, this is an innovative bit of hardware that attaches easily to (almost) any bike. Your stuff can then be strapped on as needed.The bestpanniersPannier bags just need a rack fitted to the rear (or sometimes front) of the frame. Avoid loose fittings that encourage passing thieves, and vicious speed bumps that could lift the bag off–a friend has one such bag and it regularly jumps off, including into my path as we’re riding along. Some rack clips can feel fiddly at first, and any fittings need to withstand heavy bags and repeated removal and refitting.A great all-rounderView image in fullscreenBack-Roller bike bag£150 at Ortlieb£130 at TredzOrtlieb’s all-time classicBack-Roller is a firm and longstanding favourite.

The idea is these streamlined bags make off-road and longer adventures easier. They’re fiddlier to get on and off, but if you’re in the country, or on trips where the bike stays by your side, that shouldn’t be a problem.

Should I go it alone?I don’t think it’s fair your partner uses his past relationship to dictate the present with you. You need to have an open and honest conversation to understand each other’s feelingsEvery week Annalisa Barbieri addresses a relationship problem sent in by a readerAnnalisa BarbieriFri 31 Jan 2025 09.30 ESTLast modified on Fri 31 Jan 2025 12.59 ESTShareMy partner has a child from a previous relationship who was two when we met a few years ago.For the first half of our relationship we discussed having future children together. Then one day he told me he no longer wanted more kids and that his child is his sole focus. The future was gone in one second.We have an amazing relationship, so this is our only issue. His previous relationship has scarred him deeply.I love him. I love his child. I love our life. But I’ve always wanted to be a mother. I’m 37 now and I’m surrounded by friends who have families. I have had my eggs checked, to buy me more time and settle my mind.I don’t want to end our relationship for the sake of a fictional child I may never have, and perhaps live a lonely life. But I also wonder if I should go it alone. However, this would be incredibly hard, and I’m not financially secure to support a child by myself.Whatever path you choose, you need to have a really clear conversation with your partner. He really needs to know how you feel and that your feelings matter as much as his. It’s not an amazing relationship if your needs aren’t acknowledged. If you don’t say anything and continue as you are, I worry that the compromise you’re making may plant a very tenacious seed of resentment. To lessen the consequences of any decision you make you need to be really heard, because as you say, there are no guarantees whatever you do.I went to UKCP-registered psychotherapist Nicola McCarry who wondered first if you had anyone to talk to about this? “It’s no surprise that you feel devastated that your dream is suddenly taken off the table by the person you love. You’re trying to weigh up the joy of your current life against the pain of not having a future that includes children of your own, and that’s an impossible equation to balance,” she says.You’re not his ex – you deserve a partner who is willing to explore your shared dreamsMcCarry felt you’d had to “slot into” your partner’s life. “It sounds like there could be a power imbalance in your relationship that may have gone unnoticed, or at least unaddressed, until now. It sounds like you have cherished his child and embraced his existing life, but there hasn’t been enough space for your own needs and dreams. Are you the only one compromising here?”This is a really important question. It’s a good exercise to think ahead to five, 10 years’ time and wonder how you’ll feel if nothing has changed and then what changes you could practically make to give you what you want.I don’t think it’s fair your partner uses his past relationship to dictate how things might go now. “It’s important to remember that his fears shouldn’t dictate the entire future of your relationship,” says McCarry. “You’re not his ex, and the story can play out differently. You deserve a partner who is willing to explore your shared dreams, and have some sensitivity to how this change in plan might hurt you deeply and care about this.”You need to talk. “It’s time to have an honest and open conversation with your partner,” says McCarry. “Not one where you try to convince each other of your positions, but one where you’re both listening in order to understand the feelings and beliefs behind them. If this conversation feels too daunting, it might be helpful to bring in a couples therapist to mediate..”Finally, whatever you decide, both McCarry and I felt you were very probably “much more important to his little child than you give yourself credit for”. I wouldn’t doubt that.Every week, Annalisa Barbieri addresses a personal problem sent in by a reader. If you would like advice from Annalisa, please send your problem toask.annalisa@theguardian.com.

This sleek, moderately fancy celebration of all things from Athens to the coast of Crete is currently working hard to channel a sun-kissed sojourn on the Aegean, in winter, in London. Yet step inside, away from the concrete and drizzle outside, and the place is airy, opulent and verging on the semi-Californian. This is movie-set Greece hewn in tones of dappled, early evening Athenian sunshine, all bronze, peach, tan and gold, and enhanced with tasteful lighting, velvety soft furnishings and comfortable leather banquettes. Before I walked in, I was just a woman in thermals with a flaky nose, but then – bang! – I’m suddenly Christina Onassis sipping a mulberrymournorakiin a rustic yet dashingly chic taverna.All this and a kitchen headed byAngelos Togias, ex ofthe Connaught, and with a clear vision to honour the many wonderful things about modern Greek cooking and ingredients. We begin with a “tasting” of five olive oils in tiny bowls with house flatbread, each of them passionately explained by our server as if they were the finest wines from the cellar. Doesn’t the 245 Organic 0.8% have subtle wafts of citrus and fresh grass? How about the fuller, fruitier aroma of the Mitira Lesvos? As a non-drinker nowadays, I found the ceremony of the experience rather delightful – why do we reserve such nerdiness mainly for wine?View image in fullscreenKrokodilos’ taramas cream is ‘miles away from the usual pink, whiffy mush’.But perhaps you’re already saying no, thank you, having been burnt by other renditions of allegedly traditional Greek food in Great Britain. Yes, there are some fine examples out there – my belovedHand Cafe in Stratford, east London, for one, where sweetbougatsa, good coffee and the likes of fragrant, freshly made courgette and fetastriftiare to be found – but who among us has not, at some point, stared sadly at a bowl of roughly chopped red onion, unripe tomato and unlovable, catering-pack feta and muttered: “This is not how the Greek salad was when we were on holiday.”Here at Krokodilos, however, there’s a sense that Togias and his team are aching to change all that. From the dozen or so starter options, some are instantly recognisable. Yes, there’s tarama and whipped fava, through which to scoop some lovely fermented potato flatbread, but there is also much more unusual and unexpected stuff, such as sharp, citrussy stone bass dressed in blood orange and fennel. Even a humble-sounding “beetroot salad” turns out to be a rather complex plate of beets, fermented apple, peanuts, raisins andgalomizithracheese.View image in fullscreen‘Generous and heady’: Krokodilos’ prawn saganaki.That apparently predictable taramasalata, by the way, is miles away from the pink, whiffy mush to which we have somehow grown tolerant as a nation. Krokodilos’ “taramas cream” is the richest, most decadent bowl of pale, barley-coloured, salty, cured roe (bottarga from Messolonghi, no less) with a judicious scattering of dill and topped with a runny egg yolk. “Ilikethis place,” I said while devouring this pungent concoction. “It’s well handy.” There are tiny, romantic tables, as well as larger areas for groups, should you need them, plus it’s in a part of London where good, reasonably priced places to eat at and/or entertain are all too rare.The mains menu is equally enthralling. A properly good rabbitstifado, monkfish fricassée, grilled octopus with avièrgeemulsion and lambdolmadakia… So I was at fault for ordering the prawnsaganaki–not because it wasn’t delicious, but because I was wearing white, and foolishly imagined that I’d be able to eat this generous and heady tomato, feta and prawn stew and emerge unsplattered. I began with aplomb, dipping the remains of my wild mushroom-topped flatbread into the sauce, but things got messy very soon thereafter.View image in fullscreen‘The star of the show’: Krokodilos’ greek yoghurt with quince and cardamom oil.The front of house, thankfully, feigned ignorance and swept me into the dessert selection, from which the Greek yoghurt with quince and cardamom oil might seem the healthy option, but it is served as if it’s the star of the show, in a supremely elegant glass and with a recommendation to pair it with an eight-year-old Gaia vin santo. We also cleared akaridopitachocolate and walnut cake withkaimakiice-cream.Krokodilos is flying way under the radar right now, possibly due to its location, the time of year and the fact that its owners have opened so many places at roughly the same time. But what we have here is averyamenable place to spend a couple of hours, imagining you’re feeling the sun on your face when in reality you won’t see it for another six months. Bring a bib, order the saganaki and think of summer. Better days are ahead.KrokodilosLancer Square, 28A Kensington Church Street, London W8, 020-8191 2783.

Anya says waiters deserve a decent bonus. You decide who should foot the billFind out how to get a disagreement settled or become a jurorGeorgina LawtonFri 31 Jan 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 31 Jan 2025 08.18 ESTShareThe prosecution: KaterinaI find it offensive when Anya tops up my tip in a restaurant – if I’m paying she should follow my leadWhenever we go out to a restaurant, my daughter Anya and I will have an argument about tipping. If I take her out for a meal, I’ll pay and leave a tip that I believe to be fair – usually 5% of the bill – unless the waiter has been exceptionally good. In that case, I might tip 10 or 15%. Anya says I should be paying more, but I do what I believe is right.Recently we visited Bali, and ate out at a restaurant that added a 10% service charge to the bill. But Anya wanted us to tip more, and when I refused she topped up the payment with her own money. If I’m taking us out, I think she should go with what I want to do – that’s the polite thing to do.I don’t have a problem with service charges being added to a restaurant bill. I just think that waiters generally receive good salaries across Europe, so tipping is not a necessity. I’m from Moscow and there’s a different standard there: tips are seen as a bonus; they top up your usual salary if you’ve worked extra hard. It’s down to how the client feels, and how the waiter performs.We have separate values, and that’s fine, but why can’t she adopt my values when we are out for dinner together?It shouldn’t be on the customer to support the waiting staff’s salary, unless they do something really impressive. In my opinion, to receive a tip you need to do more than just serve the food and take away the plates. There shouldn’t be an expectation that you will receive the tip, otherwise you won’t go above and beyond in your role.This issue first came up when I divorced Anya’s father eight years ago, and became more conscious of how I spend my own money. In restaurants, I get annoyed with Anya when she doesn’t follow my lead. We have different values, and that’s fine, but why can’t she adopt my values when we are out for dinner together?I like eating out with Anya and I don’t mind paying for her, but I don’t want to discuss this with her every time. If she leaves a big tip on top of what I’ve already paid, I try not to tell her off but it’s hard, because I feel like it is a bit disrespectful.You be the judge - send us your domestic disputesRead moreThe defence: AnyaMum needs to realise it’s not about her. Giving more money helps me live up to my valuesI really enjoy dining out with my mum, and I am grateful for all the lovely meals. But I also believe I should be able to do what I want with my money.I don’t think I need to follow her rules. I never tell my mum that she needs to leave a tip if she’s taken me out for dinner. Most of the time, I’ll use my own money because I believe her tip is inadequate. I don’t put any pressure on her to tip more than she wants to. She can spend her money how she sees fit. But I am 30, and if I want to tip a waiter, I will.I think she gets annoyed with me because she sees it as me being disrespectful. I know it might look a bit insulting, but I just don’t think that her 5% is enough. I’ll add more to make it up to 15 or 20%. That’s not ludicrous – it’s the industry standard.I’ve worked in bars and restaurants for many years, so I know the value of tips. People in service jobs rely on themWhen were in Bali, I tipped more because everything was already really cheap, so I wasn’t going to miss the extra £5 or £10 I tipped. Me tipping extra doesn’t undermine how I feel about my mum. If she wants to invite me for a meal I will gratefully accept, but that does not give her a right to tell me how to spend or not spend my money.I’ve worked in bars and restaurants for many years, so I know the value of tips to waiting staff. People in the hospitality industry rely on them – they make such a difference to your pay packet and motivate you to work harder. A lot of workers do long hours, have little in the way of career progression and sometimes live in precarious conditions. There should be more protection for workers in general, and salaries should be higher for waiters. I’d love it if workers didn’t have to rely on tips, but until that happens I believe that if you can’t afford to tip, you shouldn’t go out for a meal.I want to help my mum to see that me adding an extra little tip on top of her bill isn’t about her. It just makes me feel good and helps me live up to my values.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

It isn’t fair, but that’s the way it is. So if Anya wants to top up the tips, then Katerina should let her. Perhaps they could compromise – if Katerina pays for dinner, Anya puts in the tip?Iain, 48I get Anya’s credo, but when it’s time to actually pay the waiter I imagine it gets a bit messy and is terribly embarrassing for her mum, having to watch her daughter top up her tip. For that alone, Anya is guilty.Jackson, 41If Anya is happy for her mum to pay for dinner she should go along with her wishes when it comes to the tip, to avoid embarrassment. If they were splitting the bill, I’d side more with Anya.Rachel, 32Sorry Katerina, but in the UK a 5% tip is pretty measly. Why not let Anya pay the full tip as a thank you – that way embarrassment is avoided and she gets to pay what she feels is right.Sara, 53I don’t know where Katerina got the idea that waiting staff are well paid! Anya is right that many rely on tips. If topping up her mum’s tip makes Anya feel good, Mum should let her do it. Perhaps if Anya explained that her intention isn’t to be disrespectful, Katerina might back down a bit.Felicity, 26Now you be the judgeIn our online poll, tell us: should Anya follow her mum’s lead on tipping?The poll closes on Thursday 6 February at 10am GMTLast week’s resultWe asked whether Maeve is right toask her housemateRichard to pay a bigger share of their household bills, as he works from home more.75%of you said no – Richard isinnocent25%of you said yes – Richard isguiltyExplore more on these topicsFamilyYou be the judgefeaturesShareReuse this content"

A ­horseback riding accident resulted in severe injuries, the death of my beloved horse Spooks and the devastating news I’d never ride again. I was set on proving the doctors wrong. Just a few months later, with my mother’s support, I rode sidesaddle to win my first jumping competition. The thrill was incredible.From then on, I dedicated my life to adventure, remembering my mother’s lesson: never say, “I can’t”. At 22, I read about an opening to be a motorcycle stunt rider – I’d learned to ride a few years earlier. Still, it was 1976 and I knew they were unlikely to hire a woman.At the time, I was working as a dispatch rider, zipping through London, making high-speed deliveries. My boss had hesitated to hire me, and even asked his wife’s permission first. I thought about that as I signed my stunt rider application, leaving off an honorific, hoping to disguise the fact that I was a woman. But they never got back to me.I was devastated. Maybe the position had already been filled; maybe they’d discovered I was a woman. My mother suggested I train in something that could lead to a stable career. I agreed, so long as it didn’t come at the expense of adventure. My friend Steve then proposed an idea that at first seemed absurd: learning to fly aeroplanes. “Flying is for men,” I scoffed, but the suggestion stuck.I got my solo pilot’s licence and headed for the US. I ended up flying an aerobatic plane, and taught myself stunts including loop-the-loops and rollsYears ago, trial flights – brief introductory sessions with an instructor –cost just £5 for 15 minutes in the air. Steve and I both signed up, and by the time we landed, I was hooked. I got my solo licence and headed for the US. There, I ended up flying an aerobatic plane, and taught myself stunts including loop-the-loops and rolls.When recession hit in the early 1980s, I headed to Botswana, where I found work flying chartered planes. It wasn’t easy. Initially, they were sceptical about a woman working in the role, but I ended up outperforming my male colleagues.When my contract ended, I moved to South Africa to work as a pilot for a luxury travel company. Despite being popular with passengers, I faced resistance from male colleagues and was fired. Later, I learned that my “unusual hobbies for a woman” – including motorcycling – and lack of a boyfriend had fuelled ignorant speculations about my sexuality.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I worked as a commercial pilot for 10 years, then as a flying instructor, starting my own company, Tiger Airways, with my partner Chris. For 17 years, we specialised in instruction and aerobatics, until Chris passed in 2017.Now, I live a quieter life. I’ve settled in a village in Lincolnshire with my dog Tiger, my chickens, Wize and Candy, and hawk, Solar. Much of my time is spent volunteering in care homes, where Tiger brings comfort to the residents.Last October, after nearly 50 years and countless adventures, I received a letter from a post office in Staines. It was my stunt rider application, with a note scribbled at the top. The post office apologised for the delay and explained it had been found stuck behind a drawer in the office – the company never received it.It felt strange to get it back after all those years. I remembered the excitement I’d felt when I heard about the listing back in 1976, my days of anxiously waiting for a reply, and the disappointment when it never came. I also looked back on all the adventures I went on after that letdown.Who knows what would have happened had I taken the job? Perhaps the letter did not reach its destination because I was meant to go down a different, more fulfilling path. In any case, my story was covered in the papers, and old friends got in touch.They were amazed to hear all the other adventures I’ve had.I don’t always understand why things happen, but I do believe they happen for a reason, even if that reason isn’t clear right away – and my lost job application proves that.As told to Sophia BroussetDo you have an experience to share?

Food styling assistant: Áine Pretty-McGrath.The sweet spotScandinavian food and drinkRichard Hart’s recipe for Scandinavian cardamom bunsAn adventure in Scandinavian baking, from starter to finishRichard HartFri 31 Jan 2025 10.00 ESTShareIn Scandinavia, people are crazy about cardamom buns. They’re usually much drier than I’d like, and after much testing I’ve found that the secret to making a much moister bun is underproofing the dough. Normally, baking something that’s underproofed is nothing but disappointing, but in this instance it’s the way to go. A slightly underproofed centre lets the dough hold on to that sticky, gooey texture you want in a cardamom (or cinnamon) bun.Cardamom bunsPrep10 minProve3 hrChillOvernightCook1 hr 50 minMakes12125g rye flour125g warm water (28C/84F)For the starter60ghot water(40C/104F)60gwholewheat flour24g 12-hour wheat or rye starter– see methodFor the dough204gplain flour204gbread flour55gsugar41gmilk powder143gwarm water(30C/86F)65geggs122gfreshly fed starter(see above)8gsalt4ginstant dry yeast102gbutter51gneutral oilFor the cardamom sugar252gsugar16gground cardamom3gsaltFor the cardamom schmear200gsoftened butter100gcardamom sugar(above)For the cardamom syrup71gcardamom sugar(above)29gwaterTo finish60g softened butter, for greasingA pinch of ground cardamom, to garnishIn a clean jar or plastic container, combine 50g of the rye flour and 50g of the water and mix well by hand to form a dough. It will be quite sticky. Use a dough scraper to scrape any excess from your fingers and back into the mixture. Take its temperature: if it’s below 25C, set the container in a larger container of warm water to bring it up a few degrees. The water should completely surround the starter container to insulate it. Put a lid on the container. As long as you’re keeping the starter warm enough, you can leave it alone for 24 hours.Check on your starter: To be honest, it probably won’t look all that different. It may have separated a bit, with some liquid at the top, and if that’s the case, just mix the liquid back in. Put your clean fingers into the mixture and stir it around a bit, to add some oxygen. Take its temperature and warm the container in warm water as necessary. Cover the container and let it sit again for 24 hours.By now, you should be seeing some noticeable bubbling and expansion in the mixture. Add 25g of the flour and 25g of the water and mix it in by hand. Scrape the excess off your fingers and add it to the mixture.The next day, check for bubbling and expansion, which should be evident by day four. Discard half the mixture and mix in the remaining 50g flour and 50g water. If there is no evidence of fermentation in your mixture, and if you see red or orange streaks of mould or other visible growths, chuck it out, buy some fresh flour, and start over.By day five, you should have a nicely fermented starter, with real, clear signs of active life. You are now ready to use this starter to make bread. From here, you will maintain a daily feeding schedule by discarding about 90% of it and refreshing it with flour and water, equal parts by weight. For a rye starter, you can do this once a day. For wheat, I recommend feeding it twice a dayIn a medium bowl, use your hands to mix the water, flour, and 12-hour starter for a minute or so, then take the mix’s temperature: it should be 30-35C (86-95F). If it isn’t, put the bowl into a larger bowl of warm or cold water, depending on which direction you need it to go. Scrape the excess mixture off your fingers back into the bowl, then rinse your hands in the bowl of warm water. Now, use a plastic scraper to push the starter mix together, getting everything off the insides of the bowl and into one cohesive body, then cover the bowl with a tea towel and leave the freshly fed starter in a warm, draught-free place. Set a timer for 45 minutes.Once the starter is ready, in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, combine both the flours with the sugar, milk powder, water, eggs and starter, and mix on medium speed to combine. The mixture will look wet at this point. Let it rest for 30 minutes.Add the salt and yeast, and mix the dough thoroughly on medium for about 10 minutes, until completely smooth and very strong.Add half the butter and mix again until fully incorporated. Add the remaining butter and mix again until that, too, is incorporated. Add the half the oil, allow it to be completely absorbed, then add the rest. Ideally, the dough shouldn’t be too warm (not higher than 82F/ 28C).Transfer the dough to an oiled container that’s large enough to hold double its size and leave to ferment at room temperature for 45 minutes to an hour, until bubbly and slightly increased in volume. Cover with a tea towel and refrigerate overnight, or for up to 12 hours.Make the cardamom sugar: In a bowl, combine the sugar, cardamom and salt, and mix well, cover and set aside.The next day, make the cardamom schmear. In a small bowl, combine the butter and 100g cardamom sugar, and mix until the sugar is well incorporated. Keep this mixture at room temperature so that it will spread easily across the dough.Use a pastry brush to brush the insides of a 12-hole muffin tin with the softened butter. Turn the chilled dough out on to a work surface and roll out into a 55cm × 25cm rectangle that’s about 5mm thick. Using a palette knife, small spatula or butter knife, spread the schmear in an even layer over the dough, working quickly so the dough doesn’t warm up, then sprinkle evenly with 100g of the cardamom sugar.With one short side of the dough facing you, fold it in half by bringing the top edge down to meet the bottom edge. Roll it out again, this time to a 40cm × 25cm rectangle about 2cm-thick and horizontally oriented.Use a pizza cutter or sharp knife to cut the dough into 12 long strips. Hold each end of one strip in your hands, twist in opposite directions, then roll on to itself into a snail shape. Tuck the loose ends underneath to keep the strip from unraveling while baking, then put each one in the prepared muffin tin. Proof in a warm place for an hour, until they have expanded to one and a half times their original size. If you poke your finger into the dough, it should leave an impression but still spring back slightly. The dough is underproofed at this point, which will result in a moister bun.Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, combine the remaining 71g cardamom sugar and the water. Bring to a boil, then take off the heat and leave to cool to room temperature.Heat the oven to 185C(365F)/gas 4½. Bake the buns for 10-12 minutes, until deep golden brown and the internal temperature is at least 98C(208F). While they’re still warm, invert the buns on to a rack, brush with cardamom syrup and garnish with ground cardamom. Serve warm.This is an edited extract from Bread, by Richard Hart, published by Hardie Grant at £28.

They called him “the pastor”,“the messenger” and “the healer”.For 17 years, Brendan Stevens led his small congregation known as the Saints, a religious sect thrust into the international spotlight this week after one of its flock, an eight-year-old diabetic named Elizabeth Struhs, died after members denied her life-saving insulin. Fourteen members of the Saints, including Elizabeth’s parents, her brother and Stevens,were this week convicted of her 2022 manslaughterin a Queensland court.Based in Toowoomba, west of Brisbane, Stevens taught a conservative version of Christianity, based on a literal interpretation of the Bible. He believes “God heals”, and medicine shouldn’t be used under any circumstances. Every moment should be devoted to the worship of God; even sport or time dedicated to schoolwork is wrong, he declared.Stevens is a charismatic and extraordinarily magnetic person.In court, the father of one of the Saints referred to them as “a cult”.‘She’s at peace and so am I’: why members of Australian religious sect the Saints deliberately denied Elizabeth Struhs lifesaving insulinRead moreIn January 2022, Stevens and the Saints convinced Jason Struhs to take action that would lead to the death of Elizabeth. It took her four days to die, as the Saints prayed to God, sang, and waited for a miracle.“It’s not extreme. It’s just words of God. God heals. And there’s no reason why I should put – or anyone else should put – their trust in the medical system, which has failed, any more than we should put it in God,” Stevens told police after Elizabeth’s death.The Saints repeatedly told the court they believed – and still believe – she will rise from the dead.‘We are your true family’During the nine-week trial, the court heard from family members who did everything to try to drag their adult children away from the group.All of them still appear to be committed members of the faith. Many cross-examined their own siblings or parents.The court heard adults baptised into Stevens’ church would change almost overnight.One father testified it took less than three weeks for his son to radically change – the length of a Pfizer vaccine schedule. One day he was a trained civil engineer – the next he no longer used even glasses.When the time came for the second shot he said: “I’m not getting any vaccine. It will damn your immortal soul.”But even after the mammoth trial, Stevens remains a mystery.He is 63, married to Loretta Stevens, 67, wears a huge grey-white beard, and served for a time as a police officer as a younger man. He has seven children.Stevens was apparently unemployed at the time he was arrested, earning an income paid in tithings.He met the Struhs family in 2004 while serving in “something of a leadership position” at a Brisbane Revival Centres International church, the court heard, but fell out with them about four years later. Since then the Struhs and Stevens families held church meetings several times a week at one of their homes.They speak in tongues. They don’t celebrate holidays like Christmas, Easter or birthdays. They believe in traditional gender roles and that being gay is wrong. Medicine was called “witchcraft”.According to police interviews with Elizabeth’s mother, Kerrie, the group “are closer than any blood relations” because they are “all united by the Holy Spirit”.Coronial inquest will be held into death of Elizabeth Struhs, who died after religious group withheld medicationRead moreRather than attend school to learn, they did so to “spread the word of God”, according to estranged former member and Elizabeth’s sister, Jayde Struhs. Any school assessment would be addressed from a “religious standpoint”, she said.Danielle Martin testified about the way her daughter, Keita Martin, 24, became a member.A schoolmate of the Stevens’, she often visited their home for drum lessons. Over the course of a year the visits became longer and longer. In January 2018, she was baptised. Her mother forbade her from going back to the Stevens’ home in August 2018, but she moved out at 17.The Stevens’ had sent Keita Martin a Christmas card. Her mother testified that it read “we are your true family. We love you more than your family does”.Lachlan Schoenfisch was a civil engineer before he was baptised into the Saints in August 2021.His father, Cameron, testified to court that his son changed in a matter of weeks. In September of October he made a final attempt to reason with his son.5:49Fourteen members of religious sect found guilty of killing eight-year-old Elizabeth Struhs - video“I said ‘this is going to end badly’. And I said, ‘when it does, when you get to the end of the road, you don’t know where to go, just remember that we love you desperately, no matter what. You’ve got a special place in your mother’s heart …’” he said.“He effectively told us that we weren’t really his family any more. We were just people. And he’d gone off to join the true family.“When they drove away that afternoon, Lachlan’s mother held me and sobbed and said ‘we’ve lost him’.”Lachlan was convicted of manslaughter on 29 January 2025.Paying the priceOne of the first things Kerrie Struhs did after giving birth to her third child was tell Brendan Stevens.“Sorry it’s late but thought you’d like to know. Elizabeth Rose was born at 10:50,” she texted that night, 31 January 2013.Brendan was also there at the end, as Kerrie, Jason and others prayed over the dying child.The court found Kerrie had been part of a “campaign” to change her husband’s mind about medicine.Jason, who had resisted becoming a Saints member for 17 years,finally changed his mindwhen his wife was jailed in 2021 after Elizabeth became deathly ill in 2019.“I have no doubt Mr Struhs joined the Church out of fear he would lose his family if he did not,” Justice Martin Burns, of theQueenslandsupreme court, found.Fortwo and a half yearsJason had been the one to help Elizabeth her with insulin. But armed with new beliefs, in January 2022, he stopped providing her with the drug.Such was the power of the atmosphere around Stevens’ church.In the “cloistered atmosphere” Stevens and his followers had created, Jason became “so consumed by the particular belief in the healing power of God,” he believed she would either be saved by a miracle or raised from the dead, Justice Burns wrote in his judgment.One of the police who questioned Brendan Stevens in the days after Elizabeth’s death put to him: “I mean, you’re a 60-year-old man who’s lived a full life and has several adult children. This was an eight-year-old girl who’s had to pay a price”.“She didn’t pay the price, a dead person doesn’t pay the price! They know nothing!” he said.“How do you know she was in agony? You have no idea!”Brendan Stevens had no regrets.Explore more on these topicsQueenslandReligionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He volunteered to defend Kyiv as enemy tanks appeared and joined Ukraine’s armed forces. In the spring of 2023 he was fightingin the village of Tonenke, near theeastern city of Avdiivka. “When I arrived I was super-motivated. If necessary I would give my life,” he recalled.Gradually, however, he became disillusioned. The battle was furious. “The Russians would smash our positions to the ground,” he said. Senior Ukrainian commanders gave unrealistic orders. Then, while he was defending a ruined building, a panel fell on his shoulder. After receiving injections to reduce the pain, he was told to return to the front. “I realised I’m nobody. Just a number,” he said.View image in fullscreenOnce a trained sniper, Viktor is one of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers who have abandoned their units.Photograph: Anastasia Vlasova/The GuardianIn May that same year, Viktor left his position to seek further medical treatment. He did not come back. His commander marked him down as awol. Viktor is one of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers who have abandoned their units. The exact figure is a military secret, but officials concede the number is large. They say it is understandable, when tired troops have served for months without a proper break.The issue of desertion has made headlines in Ukraine. Last week the government launchedan investigationinto the 155th Mechanised Brigade. Fifty-six soldiers disappeared while training in France. Hundreds of others are said to be missing. The unit’s commander, Dmytro Riumshyn,was arrested. He faces 10 years in jail for failing to carry out his official duties and to report unauthorised absences.After three years of war, Ukraine is desperately short of soldiers, especially infantry. This has made it easier for Russia’s army toadvance in the east. There are structural issues too. New brigades have been built from scratch. They performed poorly. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, recently ordered a change in policy, with inexperienced recruits integrated into existing battalions.View image in fullscreenViktor recalls being given a 10-day break, only to be recalled a day later when Avdiivka fell under attack.Photograph: Anastasia Vlasova/The GuardianSome who desert keep a low profile. Others live and work openly. Viktor said he went back to his brigade in August 2023 but was told he was not wanted. Once a trained sniper, he now runs a garage in westernUkraine, where he repairs military vehicles for free. Had he killed Russians? “Many,” he replied. “Everybody is tired. The mood has changed. People used to hug soldiers in the streets. Now they worry about being conscripted.”Viktor added there was a severe lack of frontline manpower. In February 2023 he was given a 10-day break – only to be recalled a day after he got home, as Avdiivka came under attack. Two people from his company had been killed, he said. The others were wounded. “One guy lost an arm. Another a leg. Some had bullet wounds. Nobody is completely OK. Even so, we managed to achieve some tasks,” he said.Another deserter, Oleksii*, said he took part in Ukrainian offensives in the southern Mykolaiv and Kherson regions. He described one battle as chaotic, with bullets flying, mortars landing in a forest clearing, and insufficient artillery support. During the winter of 2022 he had a row with a new commander, applied unsuccessfully for a transfer, and got hurt. “I reached boiling point. So I decided to go where nobody can find me,” he said.View image in fullscreenOlha Reshetylova, Ukraine’s first military ombudsperson, says many service members end up with fragile mental health.Photograph: Jelle Krings/The GuardianEver since, Oleksii has been in hiding. “We will see what happens. Maybe I get caught and sent to the frontline,” he said. He added he would take up arms again if the Russians came into his town, or if the Ukrainian army became a genuinely reformed Nato style force, with better generals. Asked if he was happy, he answered: “I’m alive. The longer the war goes on the more people like me there will be.”Olha Reshetylova, Ukraine’s commissioner for protecting service members’ rights, said she understood why some people went awol. “Let’s be honest. The problem is big. It’s natural in a situation where you’ve had three years of major war. People are exhausted. They want to see their families. Their children are growing up without them. Relationships get broken. Wives and husbands can’t wait for ever. They feel alone.”She said many service members ended up with fragile mental health. A small conflict with a senior officer could “trigger” them to flee their unit, she said. There were injuries too. “It’s a complex and complicated problem. We can’t solve this with criminal punishment. If it comes to a choice between being killed and going to prison, of course at that moment you will go with the second option.”Reshetylova is a well-known human rights activist. She took up her newly created post in Januaryat the request of Zelenskyy. Her role is to balance the needs of the state with fairness to individuals. “We have this post-Soviet heritage where a soldier is slave to his commander. But Ukraine’s army is transforming. We are trying to change it, to make it more modern and human-orientated,” she said, in an interview in Kyiv.Ukraine’s parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, has been debating how to bring in more recruits. Deserters face between 12 and 15 years in jail. Last summer, deputies abolished criminal penalties for those who voluntarily return to their old battalions, with full benefits restored. A bill has also been passed that allows service members to transfer to different units – getting round lingering conflicts between lower and higher ranks.Reshetylova said transfers were unpopular with commanders, who blocked them because they were short of troops. The government is working on a solution, she said, allowing applications to be made via the ministry of defence’s Army+ app. Meanwhile,changes are being draftedto attract 18- to 25-year-olds, who are currently exempt from mobilisation. They include training guarantees and measures to ensure dialogue between soldiers and commanders.View image in fullscreenAndrii Hrebeniuk, the commander of an infantry battalion of the 110th mechanised brigade, fighting in the town of Velyka Novosilka.Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The GuardianAndrii Hrebeniuk, the sergeant major of an infantry battalion,fighting in the Donetsk oblast town of Velyka Novosilka, said soldiers went awol “pretty frequently”. “Some return. Some don’t,” he said. “It’s about morale more than injury. They need a psychological reset. They go and see their families and reappear after a couple of months.” Did he understand them? “I don’t sympathise and I don’t condemn,” he replied.Hrebeniuk’s mechanised brigade, the 110th, last weektook the unusual step of saying it was critically short of personnel. It had enough drones and artillery, but no infantry, at a time of constant Russian attacks. “We need to break the stereotype that if you join up you will be dead in five minutes,” Hrebeniuk said. He added: “Simple things keep you alive, like digging in, cleaning your weapons, and paying attention during first aid training.”Reshetylova said there were hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers staying in their positions and “not going anywhere”. The recruitment crisis could be solved, she added, if Ukraine’s allies sent their own troops. If they did not, and Kyiv fell, Vladimir Putin would keep going. She said: “As I see it, it is Europe’s armies that are absent without leave. They don’t understand – or don’t want to understand – that this is their war too.”*Names have been changedExplore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropeVolodymyr ZelenskyyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Photograph: ClarkandCompany/Getty Images/iStockphotoAgreement between farmers, politicians and environmental groups led to a €170m action fund for plant based foodByDamian CarringtonFri 31 Jan 2025 07.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 31 Jan 2025 12.58 ESTShare“Plant-based foods are the future.” That is not a statement you would expect from a right-wing farming minister in a major meat-producing nation. Denmark produces more meat per capita than any other country in the world, with its 6 million people far outnumbered by its 30 million pigs, and it has a big dairy industry too. Yet this is how Jacob Jensen, from the Liberal party, introduced the nation’s world-firstaction plan for plant-based foods.“If we want to reduce the climate footprint within the agricultural sector, then we all have to eat more plant-based foods,” he said at the plan’s launch in October 2023, and since then the scheme has gone from strength to strength. Backed by a €170m government fund, it is nowsupporting plant-based foodfrom farm to fork, from making tempeh from broad beans and a chicken substitute from fungi to on-site tastings at kebab and burger shops and thefirst vegan chef degree.Globally,animal farming produces12%-20% of total global greenhouse gas emissions and significant cuts in meat and dairy consumption in rich countries isessential to tackling the climate crisis, scientists say. However, attempts to curb the huge impact of livestock on the environment in other countries have usually descended rapidly into bitter culture wars and tractors on the streets in protest.View image in fullscreenThe last few years have seen multiple protests across the continent by farmers who are up in arms over national policies – such as plans in the Netherlands to reduce livestock numbers – and over European wide green policies.Photograph: Norbert Voskens/SOPA Images/REX/ShutterstockSo how did Denmark’s plan to promote beans and vegetables come to get widespread support and funding?Food is deeply personal and has enormous cultural significance, making it a minefield for climate action. So the transition away from meat and towards plant-based eating had to be approached delicately, says Rune-Christoffer Dragsdahl, head of the Vegetarian Society of Denmark and one of the key actors in delivering the Danish plan. Dragsdahl says, appropriately enough, that carrots not sticks were crucial to getting agreement on the policy.“One of the key reasons was talking about what we want more of, instead of talking about what we want less of, that is how we got broader support,” he says. “There was a delicate balance. People had to feel welcome, even when they had not just differing opinions, but maybe even different versions of the truth. This was a tricky but important balance, because that’s how you secure the continued participation of people.”Getting farmers on board was vital and the Vegetarian Society had been putting on friendly events for food producers. Then, in 2021, it was invited to help the Danish Agriculture and Food Council (DAFC) produce the plant-based food strategy.Anders Martin Klöcker, the DAFC innovation director, says: “I am proud of that, because it was an unusual alliance.” Nonetheless, landing the action plan was tricky.“It was controversial,” says Klöcker. “You have a farming sector which has been predominantly based on animal products for centuries. They have difficulty understanding that now we should shift the diet.”The plant-based food plan was part of a bigger farming deal that also supported animal agriculture. “We consider it a ‘both-and’ not an ‘either-or’,” says Klöcker. “We don’t want it to be polarised. We consider [plant-based food] a market that’s interesting, which is also growing.”The support from farmers shifted the politics, says Dragsdahl: “It clearly helped make the right-wing parties more neutral, and thereby also made the central parties more daring – it was really important.”A politician who had a key role in finalising the action plan was Zenia Stampe, agriculture spokesperson for the centrist Social Liberal party. The task was initially daunting, she says: “Farming is still a big part of our identity and while climate was such a hot topic then, agriculture was not a part of that debate at all.”Stampe remembers an “eye-opening” early meeting with Dragsdahl, where she learned that aquarter of Denmark’s greenhouse gas emissionscome from agriculture, with livestock and feed crops occupying 80% of farmland.View image in fullscreenPeople lined up in front of the Gasoline Grill in Broens Gadekokken, the street food area in Copenhagen harbour.Photograph: O Kemppainen/Alamy“But the [Vegetarian Society and other allied groups] knew it was such a big taboo in Denmark, so they turned it around and presented plant-based food as a business opportunity,” she says. “I think that is the key to understanding why this succeeded.”The plant-based action plan also avoided using the terms vegan and vegetarian, which can be polarising, and did not set targets for cutting meat consumption or livestock numbers. It dished out itsfirst grantslast year.The new fully-government-funded degree at Copenhagen Hospitality College now has its first 26 students, who can choose either vegetarian or vegan paths. Thais Brask-Simonsen from catering company Compass Group says: “Vegetarian cuisine is booming, and both restaurants and canteens are screaming for this expertise.” Student Magda says connecting food and sustainability is vital: “I want to contribute by making some insanely tasty green food that makes people not miss meat.”The Vegetarian Society also has funding to work on better menu design. “You still find many places where there’s one vegan item at the bottom of the menu, which is just called vegan dish of the day, so it’s only chosen by very few people,” says Dragsdahl. “But if you call it something delicious, put it first on the menu, and maybe even have three vegan options, and then three meat options, many more people choose the veggie options.”One grant, won by the Association of Agricultural Colleges, is an appeal to the belly of farmers themselves. It is training the chefs that feed the student farmers in plant-based cooking, as well as include more pulses in the curriculum. “It should help normalise plant-based meals,” says Dragsdahl.Other grants focus on developing new plant-based products, and improving the taste and texture of meat and dairy alternatives. Klöcker would like to see more focus on product development, which he says has to go hand-in-hand with building demand to create successful businesses, and more focus on export opportunities – 85% of Danish food is sold overseas.A new €7bn green farming deal in 2024 saw a commitment from the Danish government to work towards an EU-wide action plan for plant-based foods. It has already been credited with influencingPortugal’s recent decision to produce an action planfor a low-carbon diet, and Denmark takes over the rotating presidency of the European Commission in July.Denmark was a leader in wind energy and in banning trans fats in food. But whether its plant-based food plan, still in its nascent stage, is similarly successful remains to be seen. So far it has certainly made farming the hottest climate issue in Denmark, but will it ultimately shift diets?“The theory of change is hopefully that the plan and fund will lead to an actual transformation, with less intensive livestock,” says Dragsdahl.Stampe is unsure: “I hope so. But to be honest, I don’t know yet. There will always be some people, saying: ‘Yeah, if you eat less meat, then I will eat more!’”The deal in 2024 saw sticks added to the carrots, with aworld-first tax on emissions from livestock, a plan to convert 140,000 hectares (346,000 acres) of low-lying farmland into natural areas and to establish 250,000 hectares of new forest.But Stampe says animal farming still gets far more government support than plant-based production. “The solutions to the climate crisis are not in the margins,” she says. “It is in the big shifts. So not from one type of animal production to another type of animal, but from animal-based to plant based food.”Klöcker accepts that even the best-produced animal products have bigger climate footprints than plant-based ones, and like Stampe sees a generational shift with younger people eating less meat.“But we have to have a market to do anything at all,” he says, and he does not think a transition to more plant-based eating will be fast.Klöcker points out that it took 30 years of nurturing supply and demand for organic food to reach today’s 12% market share in Denmark: “The worst thing would be a farmer or food company realising that [plant-based products] they developed don’t have a market – then you might really lose them for good.”Dragsdahl is more optimistic, but says continuing a measured approach will be essential: “There is a strong majority of Danes who are open to eating less meat. They understand it might be good for their health and the environment, but we should really not push it too hard or too far. Because then these people will just say: ‘Fuck off, it’s my plate.’”This article was amended on 31 January 2025. The Social Liberal party has not been part of either the current or the previous Danish government as earlier versions of the article indicated.Explore more on these topicsThe alternativesFoodVegetarianismDenmarkPlantsVeganismGreenhouse gas emissionsnewsShareReuse this content"

Or passion. Or, indeed, outbursts.“The English,” he noted in an aphorism that has hardly aged over the past 115 years, “endure the proximity of the continent with the same irritable gestures as a man who lives next door to a young music student.”That observation – and many others, ranging from the pithy to the waspish, the sarcastic and the downright horrified – are gathered together for the first time in an anthology of Camba’s London dispatches calledViviendo a la inglesa(Living the English Way).View image in fullscreenViviendo a la inglesa by Julio CambaPhotograph: HandoutDespite a taste for adventure – Camba had stowed away on a boat to Argentina at the age of 13, flirted with, and rejected, anarchism, and chronicled the progress of the young turks in Constantinople – the fog, starch and impenetrable social rituals of Edwardian England proved something of a challenge for him. But he distilled his frustrations into some exquisite sketches.Take his thoughts on the contrasting English and Spanish attitudes to time – thoughts that echo his contention that, “Deep down, all Englishmen are policemen … Deep down, every Spaniard is an anarchist.”“In London, you simply have to have a watch,” he wrote in April 1911. “These English genuinely believe that time is an important thing, and that there’s a big difference between 4pm and 5pm … InSpain, when you want to meet a friend at 11, you agree to meet at 10 or half past 10, and then you don’t turn up … [But] if an English person summons you to meet at 12 minutes past three and you turn up at quarter past three, it’s as if you’d turned up the following day.”Then there was the weather: “England is a waterproof place. The rain bounces off the English the way it bounces off English buildings.”And then, of course, there was the miraculous effect of alcohol on the national character. “The English people appeared to become a little more human as long as they were drinking,” he noted not long after his arrival. “They spoke with great animation and their movements appeared almost spontaneous. Some of them even roared with laughter, like people do.”Camba was just as scathing about the English capacity for romance.“This is what English people do with their sweethearts: they buy them chocolates,” he grimaced. “For an English lover, an evening of love is an evening in which many chocolates have been eaten.”View image in fullscreen‘The English people appeared to become a little more human as long as they were drinking.’Photograph: The DL Archive Collection/AlamyThe journalist was also aghast at the insistence on adhering to medieval displays of chivalric manners, such as removing one’s glove when shaking hands.“You arrive in London and lodge in a cheap boarding house, and yet you have to greet a haberdasher’s assistant using the same protocol that the first Duke of Norfolk employs with his relatives,” Camba complained. “Raise your visor and proffer a naked hand. No. This all needs to stop once and for all.”Although there are occasional references to the events of the period, includingthe siege of Sidney Street,the campaigns of the suffragette movementand thecoronation of George V, most of the 69 short articles inViviendo a la inglesaare barbed reflections on the English and their peculiar way of life.As Camba’s most recent biographer, Francisco Fuster, points out, the reporter was not exactly someone you would turn to for an objective, factual account of an historical event.“He doesn’t really talk about Churchill or elections or politicians – although he does sometimes touch on social affairs,” says Fuster, a cultural historian at the University of Valencia. “He’d been sent by his newspaper to explain how people lived in London. The title of the book gives you a clue: it’s not a story of objective facts, which is what you’d get from a normal correspondent.”To Fuster’s mind, Camba’s writings are more akin to those of a sociologist or a writer like Stefan Zweig.“Camba, in his way, was a chronicler of the 20th century,” says the historian. “Reading his work is like reading a history book, but a completely different kind of history book because you don’t get the names of kings or the dates of battles. You get a history of Europe from another point of view – from the point of view of daily life on the street.”The writer Ricardo Álamo, who edited the collection, says part of the appeal of Camba – who had a huge and devoted readership during his lifetime – is that his work remains as arresting as when it first appeared.“To read Camba is to read something modern, something that doesn’t go out of date,” he says. “His style is fresh and subtle – not pompous or rhetorical – and his ideas are original and full of irony, and are sometimes hilarious​ly sarcastic.”Although Camba’s work has enjoyed a renaissance over the past 10 years or so, it was neglected for decades, largely because of the articles he wrote in support of the Franco regime.But Álamo and Fuster both argue that Camba’s opposition to the Republican government that Franco overthrew was personal rather than ideological.“Following the arrival of the Second Republic, at the beginning of the 1930s, Camba felt ignored and ostracised by the Republican politicians, from whom he had hoped to receive an ambassadorial post,” says Álamo.When the Republican government declined to give him a diplomatic job – which would have allowed him to stop relying on journalism for his income – Camba turned on them.“He reacted by beginning to write articles against the republic,” says Fuster. “But although he did write some articles in favour of Franco, it wasn’t a deeply held conviction, because he went to live in Portugal during the early years of Francoism. He never wanted a dictatorship and was never part of any political party.”After his exile, Camba returned to Spain in 1949 and lived the last 12 years of his life in a modest room at the Palace hotel in Madrid, where he wrote very little and seemed unconcerned by the notion of securing his legacy.But for all the inertia of Camba’s final years, and the long decades of neglect, Fuster believes he was “the best Spanish correspondent of the 20th century”. During the first third of the 20th century, the correspondent travelled to Turkey, Paris, England, Germany, Italy, the US and Portugal, filing dispatches that “helped create the image that people in Spain had of Europe and the US”.It was, as Fuster points out, a very different era. And Camba was a very different breed of journalist.“We’re talking about a time when there was no television or internet; that image was created by newspapers,” he says.“And, what’s more, Camba was a very special kind of correspondent: he doesn’t really report on objective facts. He’s just wandering around London going to a bar or a club and talking to people on the streets.”Explore more on these topicsLondonSpainJournalism booksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Schools are shut, except for those run by volunteers from the pro-democracy resistance in the community. Months of airstrikes have left destruction. Even though the fighting has stopped, electricity is still not running properly. Instead, residents rely on solar power to charge their phones, and firewood and charcoal to cook.“We saw a lot of civilians who died during the battle [in those days]. We saw them on the streets, on the lanes, some of the bodies were decayed and some of them were freshly dead. Some died in their homes,” said Leo*, a 40-year-old driver, whose family spent months living with constant bombardments by the military, running to hide in the darkness of a homemade bunker each time jet fighters came.View image in fullscreenDestroyed and damaged buildings in Lashio in northern Shan State in August, following fighting between Myanmar’s military and Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA)Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesWhen Leo and his family were able to finally go outside again, the country’s widely loathed junta was, at least, gone. The city was at the centre of one of the military’s most humiliating defeats when it fell to an ethnic armed group, the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA) in August. Despite months of airstrikes, the military failed to retake the city. Together with aseries of other lossesacross the country, it gave a major morale boost to the wider movement to overthrow the military.MapIt marked the first loss of one of its 14 regional military commands, as well as the loss of a strategically important city on the border with China. In the aftermath, there was such anger among pro-military figures, demands grew for the resignation of junta chief Min Aung Hlaing.‘People will resist’The military, whichseized power in a coup in 2021, provoking an armed resistance, has now lost control of swathes of the country. And as the conflict enters its fifth year, it is on the brink of further losses, despite neighbouring China lending it greater support in an apparent attempt to stave off its ultimate collapse.The military faces opposition from a patchwork of groups: people’s defence forces, which formed after the coup to fight for the return of democracy, and ethnic armed organisations, which have long fought for independence. The size of these groups, their specific goals and the extent to which they are coordinated varies.View image in fullscreenProtesters step on a banner showing an image of Myanmar military chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing during a demonstration against the military coup in Yangon in February 2021.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesAcross the country, 95 towns have now fallen to the various opposition groups, according toMyanmar Peace Monitor. Last year, in northern Kachin state, more than 200 military bases and 14 towns were lost, including the rare-earth mining hubs of Chipwi and Pangwa town. In the west, almost all of Rakhine state, includingthe western regional command, fell. In the central Sagaing region, people’s defence forces captured Kawlin and Pinlebu, crucial towns needed to transport supplies to frontline areas.Estimates, includinga study commissioned by the BBC, suggest the military controls only 21% of the country’s territory, though it still holds the key, densely populated cities.Jason Tower, country director for the Burma program at United States Institute of Peace, said that while the Myanmar military was trying to maintain its power using airstrikes and other types of abuses, it was likely the next year would see “the continued weakening and collapse of the military”, with the junta losing more territory and its opponents coordinating more effectively.The military has promised elections this year, something its ally China is endorsing. But it is unclear how it will implement these given how much of the country is controlled by rival groups. “The regime will have to use significant violence to secure areas where it wants polling to take place, and we know that many people will resist including violently,” said Richard Horsey, Myanmar adviser to Crisis Group.View image in fullscreenMembers of the Mandalay People’s Defence Forces (MDY-PDF) near the frontline in northern Shan state.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesChina’s shifting responseWhen Lashio fell last year, there was speculation opposition groups might move down towards the centre of the country and threaten the major city Mandalay, a potential stepping stone towards the capital Naypyidaw.It was this that prompted a shift in China’s response to Myanmar. China, which has deep ties with both northern armed groups as well as being an ally of the military, had earlier approved of the MNDAA’s offensives, after growing tired of the junta’s failure to stop criminal scam compounds from growing on its border. But the MNDAA appeared to be pushing much further than China had anticipated, say analysts. Beijing responded by closing its border crossing and stopping the flow of resources to ethnic armed groups in northern Shan State.“While [China] had no love for the military regime, it was even more cautious about a disorderly collapse of power in Naypyidaw because it didn’t know what would come next,” said Horsey. The possibility of greater chaos, or of a pro-western government taking control, could pose a threat to China’s vast investments in the country.Yet even under such pressure, Lashio remains under the control of the MNDAA. China has demanded the group hand the territory back to the military, and this month announced a ceasefire between the two sides. The details of the agreement are unclear.View image in fullscreenA photo released in January 2025 by the Arakan Army shows a burning house at the site of a suspected air strike carried out by Myanmar’s military on Ramree island in western Rakhine State.Photograph: Arakan Army (AA)/AFP/Getty ImagesIn Lashio, people are returning to the city. A military curfew has been removed, and residents say they no longer live in fear of night-time visits by soldiers, who would demand to know of any visitors staying overnight at their property. But there are other concerns, including the fear of forced conscription by the MNDAA, something it has denied. There are also concerns over due process, as the MNDAA is ruling under martial law. It has carried out executions in another city it controls, Laukkai, also in northern Shan, following a public trial.The struggle to surviveVoicing criticism of the MNDAA is sensitive. “I don’t like the rule of MNDAA that much,” says Khin Lay*, 24. “But I do not dare to say that I don’t like.”MapAll she wants is peace, she says. The fighting last year began on 2 July, the day she gave birth. “I remember the date exactly,” she says. “I gave birth in the morning around 10.30 and, then I heard the fighting at night at 9.30. The hospital building reverberated with the sound of artillery fire.”She fled with her seven day-old baby, and 20-month-old girl, crammed on to a Toyota Alphard van with 14 others. The traffic was so intense as residents fled that what should have been a two and a half hour journey took 30 hours. By the evening they had run out of drinking water.“My baby is so lucky that he did not die on the way,” she said. A three-month-old baby died while his mother was carrying him on a motorbike.View image in fullscreenAn explosion occurs during a bombardment carried out by Myanmar’s military in Lashio in northern Shan State in September 2024.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesShe returned to Lashio in January because vaccines for her babies had run out at the hospital in the nearby town of Muse.She is focused on staying strong for her children, and trying to earn enough money so that she can afford to protect them from the worst of the conflict, but the local economy has been severely affected. “If I were lucky enough to earn a lot of income and if my business were doing well, I would get passports, go abroad, and settle there,” she said. “I would return after our country gains independence and becomes peaceful. This is just my imagination, and I’m not sure whether it’s possible or not.”The border with China has now been partly reopened, but for months supplies of anything from household goods and medicines to construction material, and fuel were completely cut off, causing the cost of living to soar to twice that of the major cities, Yangon and Mandalay. A litre of petrol is 7,500 kyats ($3.60), and a bag of rice is 290,000 kyats ($138).People have turned to money lending, or selling valuables to survive. “My nephew sells dry groceries and I buy from him on credit. I have borrowed some money from my sister. I sold my husband’s ring a few days ago,” says Daw Thein*, 47. Her husband had been working as a caddie at a golf club in the city, until they were forced to flee the fighting in Lashio last July.View image in fullscreenMembers of the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA) walk past a Myanmar military base after seizing it during clashes near Laukkaing township in Myanmar’s northern Shan state in October 2023.Photograph: Provided by Kokang Information Network/AFP/Getty ImagesAcross Myanmar, the conflict has caused poverty rates to soar, with half of the population living below the poverty line and a further one third barely above it. The UN has warned ofimminent risk of famine in western Rakhine state,as fierce conflict and trade blockades have led to total economic collapse. Health and education systems have been put under severe strain, and theintroduction of mandatory conscriptionby the military has caused an exodus of young people from the cities. Research by the United Nations Development Programme shows the country is falling into darkness, with less than half the population having access to electricity.MapIn Lashio, a pause in military airstrikes, and the clout of the MNDAA has allowed the administration to recover services such as electricity, at least partly. In other areas of the country, especially towns in central Myanmar that are now run by newer groups or subject to prolonged bombardments, setting up new administrations has been slower.The independent outletMyanmar Now reportedthe MNDAA had agreed to give Lashio back to the military by June. The MNDAA has denied this, however, and with the military facing pressure on frontlines across the country, it appears a distant prospect.View image in fullscreenMembers of Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) receive military equipment at a graduation ceremony after combat training near Namhkam, northern Shan State.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesThe military is now facing the possibility of more losses in Rakhine and Kachin state. Support offered by China has proved useful, but it has not saved the military and Beijing will expect concessions in return, say analysts.Even after months spent under bombardment Leo said he is determined the military’s opponents should continue. “I don’t want [the struggle] to stop just because of the pressures from powerful foreign countries,” he said. After overthrowing the Myanmar military, all groups will “unite as one with the people and work together to bring development of our country”.*Names have been changed throughout to protect identitiesExplore more on these topicsRights and freedomMyanmarSouth and central AsiaMyanmar coupfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Ethics expertswere also alarmed.Among Trump’s base, however, a similar backlash – smaller, more muted, but similarly anguished – has been taking hold.After a brief bubble as speculators raced to buy them, both Trump coins havemostlyplummetedin value. Within the online Maga community – which has a certain degree of overlap with crypto enthusiasts – some feel betrayed by the president’s embrace of what some conservatives view as little better than a penny-stock pump-and-dump scam.‘Trump’s grifting tendencies’: how the president’s crypto ties could spur corruptionRead moreTrump, who in 2021saidbitcoin “seems like a scam”, has since flipped on the issue. He was widely expected to be a “pro-crypto” president, with the crypto sector hoping he would be a broadminded sheriff who would grant their financial frontier new legitimacy; instead he embarrassed them by initiating a gold-rush on meme coins, considered the riskiest and least reputable form of mainstream cryptocurrency.Unlike traditional crypto-currencies that are “mined” and used in a blockchain, meme coins cannot be used as electronic currency and are generally regarded as having no enduring value. They are “minted” toexploit a viral moment.“Now, on the cusp of getting some liberalization of crypto regulations in this country, the main thing people are thinking about crypto is, ‘Oh, it’s just a casino for these meme coins,’” Nic Carter, a Trump supporter and cryptocurrency investor,toldthe New York Post. “It does the opposite of validating us, it makes it look completely unserious.”Similarly, keyboard Maga warriors who hoped that Trump would stick up for the American little guy are bitterly disappointed that he endorsed a financial scheme that immediately took little guys for a ride.The new president claimed his coin would “celebrate everything we stand for: WINNING!”, but not everyone seems persuaded.“I wish Trump was more tempered on this,” someone on a conservative Reddit forumdespairedafter Trump’s coin debuted. “He owns casinos and knows the addiction of gambling.” Another argued that meme coins prey “on the poor and most desperate”.“Can anyone make a cogent argument in favor of this?” one posterasked. Few did. “This is bad, and looks bad,” one person said.Others called the Trump token “degrad[ing] to the office of the Presidency”, “a lame money grab”, “a bad idea with a million ways to go wrong and derail his second term”, “shady”, and “kinda gross”. Another added, “This crypto is the most blatant ponzi scheme in history and we are the marks.”One conservative wrote that their litmus test was “if Biden pulled this shit, how would I feel? … I can’t imagine any other president doing this”.“The GOP has to find someone better for 2028,” someone said – a sentiment that was surprisingly common. “I want a real man like Vance to run this,” someone elsesaid.After a meme coin named IVANKA launched last week, Ivanka Trump was forced to clarify that she had no relationship with the venture, andcondemnedit as “being promoted without my consent or approval”. She said the coin “risks deceiving consumers and defrauding them of their hard-earned money”, an argument that some crypto critics might say applies to all meme coins, including Trump and Melania’s official tokens.The famously conservative Wall Street Journal editorial board, influential in conservative circles, ran an editorialcriticizingTrump’s turn as a crypto impresario. The piece noted a litany of legal, ethical and political problems with meme coins, “vehicles for speculation” that could open Trump to civil and criminal liabilities or be used by foreign adversaries to curry influence. “No careful President would get anywhere near this kind of political risk, and we can’t recall any President who has.”Trump Media announces plans to expand into cryptoRead moreThe Trump token’s website contains a disclaimer noting that the tokens are “not intended to be, or to be the subject of, an investment opportunity, investment contract, or security of any type”, though that language probably does not bear much relation with how the average investor views a meme coin.Undeterred, Trump’s wider business empire is stepping further into this space. On Tuesday, the Trump Media and Technology Group, which operates Trump’s social media platform Truth Social,announcedthe launch of a financial technology brand called “Truth.Fi”, through which the company plans to invest up to $250m in crypto-currencies and “crypto securities”, and other investment accounts.Ethics experts have widelycondemnedTrump’s coin as creating serious and unprecedented conflicts of interest or as one conservative on Redditbegs: “Please please please Mr. President. Don’t get involved with crypto.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpCryptocurrenciesFar right (US)RepublicansUS politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

This situation feels hopeless,” said Judith Saima, a 28-year-old merchant in Goma, where heavy fighting that cut the city off from the outside world and left bodies piling up in the streets only subsided two days ago.Access to food is a significant concern, after trade and agricultural supply routes were severed. “If this continues, we will all die, either from stray bullets or starvation,” said 26-year-old Ngise Ngeleka, a 26-year-old student living in the ULPG neighbourhood. Ngeleka said her neighbour had been hit by a bullet at the beginning of the week and that his body was still lying uncollected in the street.Adeline Tuma, who lives in the city with her four children, said: “We have nothing left to eat. My children cry from hunger. I make porridge without sugar. My shop has been looted. I curse this war. A new, grim chapter of our lives begins.”View image in fullscreenWorkers transport goods in vehicles at a bustling intersection in Goma.Photograph: Michel Lunanga/AFP/Getty ImagesThe UN said on Friday that at least 700 people had been killed and 2,800 injured in Goma since Sunday, according to an assessment conducted by the World Health Organization and the Congolese government.Travel by boat, which many people use to carry supplies, has effectively been banned since M23 occupied Minova, a port town along Lake Kivu, last month. Another route across a small border crossing linking Goma to Gisenyi inRwandahas also been blocked.Residents lost access to water and electricity on Sunday. On Thursday and Friday, power and mobile data services returned in some districts and the border with Rwanda, a lifeline for the city, was reopened, as M23 tried to show it could restore order and govern. The water supply is expected to return in the coming days. In the meantime, some residents have resorted to filling jerrycans from Lake Kivu.DRC mapM23 is the latest in a string of ethnic Tutsi-led insurgent groups that have operated in mineral-rich eastern DRC since a 2003 deal was meant to end wars that had killed 6 million people, mostly from hunger and disease. The group is backed by Rwanda, which says its primary interest is to eradicate fighters linked to the 1994 genocide. The Congolese government and several UN reports say in fact that Rwanda uses the group as a means to extract and then export valuable minerals for use in products such as mobiles phones.On Friday, the UN voiced alarm at rampant violence in eastern Congo, a day after expressing “deep concern” that the rebels were advancing south from Goma to Bukavu – capital of the neighbouring South Kivu province. The UN rights office said it had documented cases of summary executions and widespread rapes in recent days. “Conflict-related sexual violence has been an appalling feature of armed conflict in eastern DRC for decades,” a spokesperson said.For many in Goma, M23’s occupation brings back grim memories of the last time the group seized the city, in 2012. At the time it stayed for just 10 days, leaving when Rwanda’s international donors threatened to cut aid. This occupation already feels different.Children executed and women raped in front of their families as M23 militia unleashes fresh terror on DRCRead moreElisabeth Sikuli said: “In 2012, they entered in broad daylight. We heard a few bombs, but the clashes didn’t last long. This time, the situation is far worse. We spent three days hiding under our beds, without food.”Hospitals have been overwhelmed by people injured in the fighting, and relief efforts have been paralysed. Internally displaced people have gone without aid for days, prompting humanitarian organisations to issue urgent pleas for a cessation to the hostilities. Uniforms abandoned by exhausted Congolese troops have been picked up and worn by street children, some of whom have looted abandoned shops.“Although there are signs of reprieve in Goma after days of intense fighting, the need for shelter, food, water, medical supplies, and protection in the city remains overwhelming,” said Rose Tchwenko, Mercy Corps country director for DRC. “We are now in a race against time to save lives.”On Wednesday, M23declared its intention to remain in the cityand a day later Corneille Nangaa, head of Congo River Alliance, the political coalition backing the M23, asked residents “to go back to normal activities”. He also pledged to get children back in school within 48 hours and open a humanitarian corridor so people displaced by fighting could return home.At stake is a potential return to the situation that arose in the 1990s and 2000s, when Rwanda and Uganda and their proxy forces occupied and ran DRC’s eastern borderlands, managing trade, communications and transport.Not all people in Goma oppose the arrival of the Tutsi-led group. A senior UN official told Reuters this week: “A lot of people are sick and tired of the chaos. If they can trade, security improves, their daily lives improve, then M23 could be popular.”Olakire Senga said he thought the Congolese government had failed to protect its citizens. The doctor said: “I think we need to assess the maturity of those arriving and join them. Personally, I went out to welcome them.”Explore more on these topicsDemocratic Republic of the CongoRwandaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Although southern Madagascar experienced gusty winds owing to the storm, Elvis’s primary impacts on land were the result of the persistent rainfall. As of 9am on Thursday, Elvis contained maximum sustained winds of 40 knots and was tracking south-south-east, with no further effects on land expected before the storm undergoes extratropical transition by Sunday.The European windstorm season continued apace, with three named storms affecting western Europe. WhileStorm Éowyn was bringingstrong winds and heavy rain and snow to Ireland and Britain last weekend,Storm Herminiawas named by the Spanish national weather service. This was swiftly followed by Storm Ivo, named on Monday by the Portuguese national weather service. A strong jet stream across the North Atlantic was responsible for the rapid intensification of these systems.In Spain, Herminia brought gusts of 96mph to the Picos de Europa national park. Strong southwesterly winds also brought an unseasonably warm air mass to Spain, leading to January temperature records being broken. Valencia recorded a maximum temperature of 27.1C, beating the previous January record of 26.5C.Finistère in north-westernFrancehad gusts of 75mph on Sunday, and these strong winds continued into the new week, with much of the west coast of the country put on orange alert for winds on Tuesday.The rain from Herminia caused major problems, with parts of Brittany put on red alert for rain and flooding on Monday. In Rennes, the regional capital, about 400 people were evacuated after the worst flash flooding in 40 years. Eight other departments were put on orange alert, mostly for rain and flooding, with the French Alps put on orange alert for avalanches.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Trump also threatened to follow up with a further wave of tariffs against the European Union.Goods exported from Canada andMexicoto the US will be hit with a 25% tariff, while products from China face a 10% levy, the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, told reporters on Friday.The administration did not give exact details of the tariffs, which Trump has repeatedly said would start 1 February. Trump later suggested in the Oval Office that oil fromCanada, which exports millions of barrels of crude per day to the US, would “probably” face a lower tariff of 10% and that he expected his administration would impose duties related to oil and gas around 18 February.While the president insisted that nothing could be done by Canada, Mexico and China right now to forestall tariffs, officials were said to be scrambling to find a way out. Several situations under consideration in a bid to strike an 11th-hour deal,accordingto the Wall Street Journal.Leavitt dismissed reports that the US would delay implementation of the tariffs by a month as “false”, claiming that “starting tomorrow, those tariffs will be in place”.Canada has pledged to retaliate with a “forceful but reasonable” response. Mexico has also drawn up plans, but declined to provide details. China has said it will “firmly defend” its interests.The US is also looking at tariffs on drugs, steel, aluminum, copper, computer chips and “things associated with chips”, Trump said. He also threatened the EU, which he claimed had treated the US “horribly”, with substantial action.The presidenthas claimed imposing duties on goods from overseas will raise hundreds of billions of dollars for the federal government, while forcing countries – even two of America’s closest allies – to bend to his demands.Why Trump tariffs will be ‘very bad for America and for the world’Read moreBut economists have repeatedly warned that higher tariffs, a key pillar of Trump’s economic strategy, risk raising prices for millions of Americans, challenging the president’s pledge to bring down prices “rapidly” amid a wave of frustration over thecost of living.Trump acknowledged on Friday that his tariffs could cause “temporary short-term disruption”, but expressed hope that Americans would understand why they had been imposed. “Tariffs don’t cause inflation,” he claimed. “They cause success.”Investors appear apprehensive, too. Stocks on Wall Street fell after the White House press briefing, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing down 0.75% in New York.After his election victory in November, the president homed in on Canada and Mexico, the US’s neighbors, andChina, demanding they do more to stop “illegal aliens” and drugs such as fentanyl from crossing into the US. Trump said he would impose tariffs immediately upon entering office, but hours after his inauguration said he would do so on 1 February instead.Mexico and Canada have insisted in recent days that they stand prepared for Trump to make good on his threat.“We have plan A, plan B and plan C for whatever the US government decides,” Claudia Sheinbaum, the Mexican president, said on Friday. The country has previously signaled that it would “have to” respond with duties of its own if hit with US tariffs.Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, warned of potentially “difficult times” if Trump proceeds with tariffs.On Trudeau’s warning that Canada would put forward a “forceful but reasonable” response to US duties, Leavitt shot back at the White House press briefing: “I think Justin Trudeau would be wise to talk to President Trump directly before pushing outlandish comments like that to the media.”Chrystia Freeland, Canada’s former trade negotiator and finance minister, who isvying to succeed Trudeau, proposed a 100% tariff on all Tesla vehicles and on US wine, beer and spirits. “We need to be very targeted, very surgical, very precise,” she told the Canadian Press – in this case, targeting the Tesla chief, Elon Musk, at the heart of Trump’s inner circle.Trump, who mooted a 20% universal tariff on all foreign imports from across the world while running for re-election, has made clear that other key markets, including the European Union, are also in his sights.In his inaugural address, the president laid out his plan to overhaul the US’s economic ties with the world. “Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens,” he declared, claiming this would lead to “massive amounts of money pouring into our treasury, coming from foreign sources”.Tariffs are not charged on the exporter, but the importer – in this case, firms based in the US – and are often passed on to consumers. This is why economists caution that increasing duties on importscould exacerbate inflation.Undeterred, Trump has launched a consultation into the creation of an “external revenue service” for the collection of tariffs.The conservative Tax Foundation has estimated that Trump imposed about $80bn worth of tariffs on about $380bn worth of products in 2018 and 2019, describing it as “one of the largest tax increases in decades”. The Biden administration kept most of the tariffs in place, and increased tariffs on an additional $18bn of Chinese goods, including semiconductors and electric vehicles.In a speech earlier this week, Trump claimed his officials would introduce tariffs on overseas semiconductors, drugs and steel “in the very near future”, singling out Taiwan and suggesting that such duties would incentivize manufacturers to make such goods in the US.Imposing tariffs, at least using the conventional playbook, takes time. A necessary investigation requires 270 days by statute. But Trump’s officials have reportedly been exploring other options, such as the declaration of an economic emergency, in an attempt to move more quickly.Biggest US trading allies brace for a ‘game of chicken’ with Trump’s tariffsRead moreUS importers, or their customs brokers, are required by Customs and Border Protection to file an entry summary for goods arriving into the US, with details about their shipment, such as what it is, how much it is worth and where it is from. Goods are assigned a specific code according to theHarmonized Tariff Schedule, which has the applicable tariff rates.Importers are responsible for paying the duties calculated on the value of the goods they have imported.Have a question about Trump tariffs?

It is the first time in more than a century that a secretary’s first official visit abroad will be to Central America.“This is a truly historic visit that Secretary Rubio will be paying to the region,” said Mauricio Claver-Carone, United States special envoy for Latin America. “I can’t stress enough the historic nature of this visit and how it harkens back to President Trump’s overall message during his inauguration of the golden age of theAmericas.”Tension and defiance in Panama after Trump threatens to ‘take back’ canalRead moreTammy Bruce, the state department spokeswoman, added: “This is where we live. This is who we are. This is about not just wanting to have new partnerships – but that’s always good – but the nature of what it means to have an extended relationship with the people closest to you.”The visit will come just 10 days into a Trump administration that has already caused significant concern in the region, by declaring in his inaugural address that the US was “taking back” thePanamacanal and then proceeding to threaten Colombia with 25% tariffs for refusing to take US deportees sent to the country aboard military transport planes.“I think the president’s been pretty clear he wants to administer the canal again,” Rubio, who is scheduled to meet with Panamanian president José Raúl Mulino and tour the canal this weekend, said during a television interview.“Obviously, the Panamanians are not big fans of that idea. But that does not in any way replace the core reality that the Panama canal, we cannot allow any foreign power – particularly China – to hold that kind of potential control over it that they do. That just can’t continue.”Panama has launched an audit of several ports along the canal that are owned by a company based in China in a potential bid to appease Trump. But Panama’s comptroller has told the Guardian that the audits are motivated by politics and that they are not designed to deliver a peace offering to the United States.“I cannot negotiate and much less open a process of negotiation on the canal,” Mulino told reporters on Thursday. “That is sealed. The canal belongs to Panama.”Rubio also is expected to discuss curbing migration to the United States via Panama with Mulino. Panama’s government said that 300,000 migrants crossed the Darien Gap into Panama in 2024. That is 42% fewer than the previous year, Reuters reported.Rubio will then travel toEl Salvador, where he will meet with the hardline president Nayib Bukele, who has used a self-described “iron fist” to crack down on violence in the country.“Just decades ago – it was just a decade ago San Salvador was the murder capital of the world, and today it’s one of the safest cities in the world,” said Claver-Carone. “And those extraordinary measures, which are frankly the envy of a lot of countries throughout the western hemisphere, has really made him one of the most consequential leaders not only on security but a great ally on migration.”Throughout the visit, Rubio is expected to focus on combating growing Chinese influence in the region. China has become South America’s largest trading partner and is seeking to grow its “belt and road initiative” in Central America as well.“Everyone thought that China was literally going to become the most influential force throughout the Americas,” said Claver-Carone. “This is a re-pivot of the golden age of America, of the Americas, to leave, unequivocally, without a doubt, that the 21st century, akin to the 20th century, will be an American century.”Explore more on these topicsUS foreign policyMarco RubioPanamaAmericasCosta RicaGuatemalaDominican RepublicnewsShareReuse this content"

Number three are the massive subsidies that we’re giving to Canada and to Mexico in the form of deficits.”Officials in Ottawa and Mexico City have drawn up plans to retaliate against Washington with tariffs of their own, raising the prospect of a damaging trade war. Businessesinside the USandacross the worldhave warned of widespread disruption if the Trump administration pushes ahead.After his election victory last November, Trump announced on his social network that upon his return to office he would “sign all necessary documents” to impose a 25% tariff on Mexico and Canada. Mexico must stop “illegal aliens” from crossing its border with the US, he said, and Canada must halt the flow of drugs like fentanyl. “Until such time that they do, it is time for them to pay a very big price!”Trump did not, in fact, sign these documents following his inauguration. Instead, he introduced a deadline – 1 February – by which both countries are supposed to resolve his concerns.Claudia Sheinbaum, the Mexican president, has alreadytaken Trump throughthe various migration initiatives her government has undertaken. Experts haveraised questionsover Trump’s demand from Canada, with so little fentanyl entering the US through its northern border that the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) omitted to even mention Canadain a 2020 report. The Mexican government has sent signals it is prepared to do more on migration and fentanyl trafficking – evennotching up a record seizure soon after Trump’s threats began– but it has also sought to play down the prospects of a trade war.Canada sends 75% of all its goods and services exports to the United States, its largest trading partner and closest ally. Trudeau said the trade spat and diplomatic tangle “is not what we want”, but that if Trump followed through on his threats, “we will also act”.A first round of retaliatory tariffs would cause minimal damage to the US, covering C$37bn of its exports to Canada, but if needed, Canada’s federal government plans to escalate by imposing tariffs on C$110bn worth of goods.Canada’s dollar has plunged against its US counterpart and experts warned Canada’s economy could fall into a recession.“We don’t have a lot of good historical examples where we’ve had tariff shocks of this magnitude,” Tiff Macklem, the Bank of Canada governor, told reporters earlier this week. “Exactly how quickly, how big, how people react, what the implications are for inflation – there is a certain zone of uncertainty.”Trump’s vague demands to “secure the border” have unsettled and confused Canadian negotiators shuttling between Ottawa and Washington with increased frequency and desperation.“The reality is that a large, uncontrolled bully is using his position as the most powerful political leader in the world, to put pressure on a whole range of allies,” said Lawrence Herman, an international trade lawyer and senior fellow at the CD Howe Institute. “We have to, in Canada and the rest of the world, recognize that we’ve entered a new era.“With the Trump administration, there are no rules. There is no respect for international treaties or agreements. There is no longer value to the US signature on international documents.”Mark Carney, the frontrunner to replace Trudeau, said on Friday he was “foursquare” behind all lobbying efforts by Canadian ministers in Washington.The former governor of the Bank of Canada and Bank of England said Canada would “never back down to a bully” and that the “fever” gripping the US would eventually break.But others remain skeptical that a full resolution is possible.Herman, who advises governments and companies on trade issues, worries that tension between the two nations has “shattered” a shared history.“Repairing the longstanding relationship will be very, very difficult. It will depend on goodwill on the US side and Trump has dissipated most of that goodwill,” he said. “I don’t see it returning to where it was under the previous era. It’ll be a strained and difficult and contentious relationship going forward, and Canadians have to be prepared for that.”In Mexico, President Sheinbaum said on Wednesday: “We don’t think [the tariffs] will happen. And if they do, we have our plan.“People are worried here, and there is a sense of uncertainty – which is what Donald Trump seeks to create,” said Kenneth Smith Ramos, Mexico’s former chief negotiator during talks over the USMCA free trade deal, struck between the US, Mexico and Canada during the first Trump administration.“It’s a bit like a game of chicken: the two cars are hurtling towards each other at top speed,” he said. “Mexico has to send the signal that its car is not a little one but a big one that could also hurt the United States.”Additional reporting by Thomas Graham in Mexico CityHave a question about tariffs?

Eleven of the cities showed “significant increasing trends in rat numbers”, said the paperpublished in the journalScience Advances, and these trends were likely to continue.Over the past decade, rats increased by 390% in Washington DC, 300% in San Francisco, 186% in Toronto and 162% in New York according to researchers, who analysed public sightings and infestation reports.Some big cities, such as London and Paris, were not included because they did not provide the necessary data – but researchers said the findings would apply to many similar cities around the world. “There’d be no reason to expect it to be different in other places,” said lead researcher Jonathan Richardson, from the University of Richmond in Virginia.In Toronto, one of the worst-affected locations, a “perfect rat storm” has taken hold, with residents of Canada’s biggest city staring down a surging population.“When you walk the streets of Toronto, under your feet, deep in the sewage system, is a place teeming with rats,” said Alice Sinia, lead entomologist for Orkin, the country’s largest pest control company. “Increasingly we’re flushing them out into open spaces – either through construction or floods – and they have to go somewhere.”Toronto city’s helpline fielded1,600 rat-related calls in 2023, up from 940 in 2019 and Orkin has also experienced a surge in calls.“But the reality is, we don’t know how big the population is because no one has ever really studied it formally,” said Sinia.View image in fullscreenResearcher Jonathan Richardson surveys a rat infestation with students in the US city of Richmond, Virginia.Photograph: Courtesy of Jamie BettsTwo Toronto city councillors, Alejandra Bravo and Amber Morley,last year calledfor a formal management plan as a way to blunt the crisis.“It’s a really critical quality-of-life problem when people have all of a sudden been confronted with rats coming into their home or into their business or their place of work,” Bravo told theCanadian press, adding that it had morphed into a “kind of perfect rat storm”.Other cities with increasing rat populations included Oakland, Buffalo, Chicago, Boston, Kansas City and Cincinnati. The research focused on US cities, as well as Amsterdam, Toronto and Tokyo, as all of them gathered similar data on rat sightings. The research did not quantify the overall rat population, just relative increases in reports over time.Rising temperatures correlated with rising rat numbers, researchers wrote in the paper. As small mammals, rats struggle during winter, but in higher temperatures they can breed for more of the year and forage for longer.In Toronto, cold winters had long acted as “mother nature’s pest control”, said Sinia, killing off swaths of the population. But mild temperatures had helped rodents of all kinds in the city to keep breeding.The fact that rat numbers increased fastest in cities that were warming fastest was “the gloomiest outcome of the study”, said Richardson. Last year was thehottest on record, with average temperatures 1.6C above preindustrial levels.Rats causebillions of dollarsin damage by infiltrating buildings each year, and can transmitat least 60diseases to humans, as well as affecting the ecology of other species living in cities. In regions where they are an invasive species, they do huge damage to biodiversity. Research suggests people who encounter rats frequentlyhave poorer mental health. Globally, humanity’s “war on rats” costs anestimated $500meach year, according to the study.View image in fullscreenRats in New York, one of the cities with the greatest increase in infestations.Photograph: Anadolu/Anadolu Agency/Getty ImagesTokyo, Louisville and New Orleans bucked the trend with declining rat numbers. In Tokyo, Richardson speculated that cultural norms and expectations of cleanliness meant people were quick to report rodent sightings. In New Orleans there has been educational outreach on how to prevent infestations. “There are important lessons probably to be gleaned from those cities,” said Richardson.They lived through the ice age. Can the mighty musk ox survive the heat?Read moreResearchers say the best pest management strategies involve making the urban environment less rat-friendly – for example by putting rubbish in containers, and not in bags on the street – rather than removing rodents that are already there.Despite thousands of studies on lab rats, little was known about wild urban rats, said Richardson. “We need to know the battle that we’re fighting. Pretty much every city announces that they have a war on rats.”Sometimes there can be up to 100 rats in a single colony, which usually occupies less than one block. “I do not like rats,” he said, “but there is something fascinating about an organism that has been able to spread over the world and live in such proximity to us so successfully.”Explore more on these topicsUrban wildlifeThe age of extinctionAnimalsClimate crisisGlobal healthCanadaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

One was about the need for Venezuela to receive US deportation flights filled with “Venezuelan criminals” and the second that Maduro should immediately release North American citizens being held in Venezuelan jails.“If these requirements are not met obviously, as President Trump has said publicly, there will be consequences from the US government,” Claver-Carone added, insisting the talks did not relate to access to Venezuela’s oil reserves, which are the largest in the world. “There is no kind of trade-off here. There are no quid pro quos ... There are no negotiations,” he claimed.Grenell hinted at the trip last week, after the new US president’s inauguration, writing on X: “Donald Trump is President of the United States, again. And diplomacy is back. I’ve spoken to multiple officials in Venezuela today and will begin meetings early tomorrow morning. Talking is a tactic.”Reports of Grenell’s first overseas mission rekindled suspicions that the businessman author of The Art of the Dealcould be plotting some kind of agreement with Maduro, who recently extended his rule despite widespread suspicions that he lost last year’s presidential election.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At his 10 January swearing-in, Maduro again hinted he was open to talks, declaring: “I’m a man of dialogue. I know how to listen and I know how to learn.”Any deal between Trump and Maduro – which would probably involve deporting Venezuelan migrants from the US, Washington turning a blind eye to the collapse of Venezuela’s democracy, and US access to Venezuela’s huge oil reserves – would prove highly controversial, not least among Republicans in Florida, which boasts more than 3 million Latino voters.After Grenell’s trip to Caracas was reported, the Republican senator Rick Scott, Florida’s former governor, wrote on X: “I hope that during today’s visit, the only thing Richard Grenell focuses on is demanding the return of the kidnapped Americans, ensuring that Maduro takes back the thugs and gang members in our country, and finding a new country for Maduro, [interior minister] Diosdado [Cabello], and anyone else involved in this thuggish regime to relocate to ASAP.”An understanding between Trump and Maduro is far from assured. Trump’s administration contains several key proponents of his failed “maximum pressure” Venezuela policy, including the secretary of state,Marco Rubio, and Claver-Carone.Writingin the Wall Street Journalon Thursday, as he set off on a five-country tour of Central America, Rubio attacked the “illegitimate regimes” in Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela, accusing them of “intentionally amplifying the chaos” in the Americas.Earlier this month Trump publicly recognized Edmundo González, the apparent winner of last year’s election in Venezuela, as the country’s president-elect and called Maduro’s opponents “freedom fighters”.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationVenezuelaUS foreign policyNicolás MaduroAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

There are a few photos of the artists at work or posing in front of the completed mural, but almost nothing in the way of diaries or letters.And soon after its completion, the mural was hidden, and almost forgotten.In the 1940s, the manager of the building that housed the mural, by then a museum, began to covet a painting owned by the church, which depicts the transfer of enclosed nuns from one convent to another.“Supposedly, the director wanted the painting in the museum, but the church said no,” said Radic. “Finally, they said he could have it – but only if he covered up the mural, because it had nude female figures and a cross that’s upside down. And so they did.”Thirty years later, the mural was rediscovered “basically by accident” while workers were performing maintenance. “They realised that there was a false wall,” said Radic. “And when they opened it up, they realised they had this mural there.”By then it was in poor shape: damaged by humidity, covered in grime. “But the fact it was covered up so many years may actually have helped preserve it,” said Radic.It took two years to repair the damage and revive the original colours.Of all the murals in Mexico, Radic reckons this one might be unique. It is in a provincial Mexican city and uses a Mexican form, but is filled with international symbolism.Meanwhile the theme is universal – and perhaps timeless.By chance, the restored mural is being unveiled just as some fear a resurgence of fascism.“Sometimes, the stars align. And, you know, 90 years later, it’s basically the same situation,” said Radic, before adding: “But that depends upon your political viewpoint.”Explore more on these topicsMexicoArtNazismDiego RiveraCommunismAmericasPaintingnewsShareReuse this content"

As darkness fell on Friday, workers had started constructing a 30-metre long a ramp that they hope will allow them to reach the man, whose cab is covered in soil and other debris.As residents of Yashio, a town in Saitama prefecture, questioned the slow pace of the rescue operation, the local fire chief, Tetsuji Sato, described the scene at the traffic intersection where thesinkholeopened up as “extremely dangerous”.“We are planning to construct a slope from a safer spot so that we will be able to send down heavy equipment,” Sato said, adding that groundwater was continuing the leak inside the hole, which is still expanding. The Kyodo news agency reported the sinkhole was 15 metres deep and 40 metres wide.Residents living within a 200-metre radius of the site were ordered to evacuate, and 1.2 million people in nearby towns and cities have been asked to cut back on baths and laundry to prevent leaking sewage water from making the operation even more hazardous.“It’s difficult not to use the toilet, but we are asking people to do their best to use less water,” a prefectural official said.Authorities in Yashio believe the sinkhole was formed as a result of corroded sewage pipes, which allowed water to seep into the surrounding soil and loosen it. Some sewage water in the area has been collected and disinfected before being released into a nearby river to reduce the runoff into the hole.The rescue operation, in its fourth day, has been complicated by further erosion of the sinkhole walls, making it impossible for workers to remain below ground for long periods.Concern is growing for the health of the trapped truck driver, who spoke to rescue workers shortly after his vehicle fell into the hole on Tuesday morning, but has not been heard from since around noon the same day. The 72-hour period considered crucial to the survival of people who become trapped without food or water has passed.Workers had hoped to complete the slope by the end of Friday, but an official said it could take several days to complete.Once the ramp is complete, heavy equipment will be used to clear the rubble and rescue workers will venture into the sinkhole to search for the man, Kyodo said.Some people living nearby questioned why it was taking so long to locate the truck driver. “It feels rather abnormal that the search is taking this long,” Takuya Koroku, a 51-year-old factory worker, told Agence France-Presse. “I wonder if he could have been saved much sooner. I’m scared to go near it.”Explore more on these topicsSinkholesJapanAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

That is because doctors assume fertility is the only consideration in a desire to delay menopause, according to a study published in Internal Medicine Journal.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailLed by Dr Felicity Martin, the study analysed the medical records of adult women under the age of 48 receiving chemotherapy at the Peter MacCallumCancerCentre in Melbourne between August 2020 and December 2022.Hot flashes and mood swings: why perimenopausal symptoms get misdiagnosed – and how to treat themRead moreOf the 66 eligible patients, they found that one in four did not have a documented discussion regarding Goserelin, and that particular group of women were more likely to be older and have more children.Younger patients yet to have children and who were being referred to a fertility service were more likely to be prescribed Goserelin.Martin said that results indicated fertility is “at the forefront” of doctors’ minds when considering patients and Goserelin. “The women who are older and perhaps that already had their children or who weren’t interested in fertility preservation were less likely to have the discussion or be prescribed it.” She said doctors are “forgetting, potentially, that it’s not just important for fertility”.Early onset menopause can also carry increased risk of osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease, sexual dysfunction, and adverse effects on mood and wellbeing. Menopausal symptoms are often more severe in women with chemotherapy-induced premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) compared with those undergoing natural menopause, the researchers noted.Women on Goserelin – which is available on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme – take a monthly injection. Researchers want doctors to increase discussions and use of Goserelin in all premenopausal women, regardless of their fertility interests.The study results were filtered to only include patients who were prescribed an alkylating chemotherapy, commonly used to treat breast cancer, sarcoma, haematological and gynaecological malignancies, and which carries the highest risk of POI, Martin said.‘Matters as much as being kept alive’Mullen said her oncologist’s intervention in 2023 had a hugely positive impact post-diagnosis.“I’m so grateful that my oncologist didn’t overlook the suitability of Goserelin for me just because I was at an age where having children wasn’t on my agenda,” she said.Mullen said she chose to take the drug to potentially preserve her pre-menopausal years. “I don’t want to go into menopause at 47 and lose all those years I equate to being in a younger person’s body.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It matters as much as being kept alive in the weeks and months after diagnosis.”The researchers acknowledged the study’s limitations, including its small sample size and the fact that the results only came from the one specialised cancer centre.Associate Prof Nicholas Wilcken, a Sydney-based oncologist on the board of Breast Cancer Trials ANZ, called it a “very sound” study that “highlights a very important point: if premature menopause can be avoided it should be”.The big menopause swizz: do hormone supplements really work?Read moreWilcken said results were likely to be even worse in other centres. The Peter MacCallum Centre has been at the forefront of the issue, leadingthe original trial that showed the drug worked, he said.Dr Belinda Kiely, a breast medical oncologist, said Goserelin is often thought about in terms of preserving fertility but “the group we often overlook are women we can prevent early onset menopause”.Explore more on these topicsAustralia newsMenopauseOsteoporosisCancerBreast cancernewsShareReuse this content"

The documents show Alblas was regularly engaged on the reef issues and had met with other Unesco ambassadors, where she pushed for “a fair, consistent and transparent approach to climate affected World Heritage properties”.In April 2024, Australia’s reef envoy, Senator Nita Green, travelled to Unesco headquarters in Paris, joining Josh Thomas, the chief executive of the government’s Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, an environment department official and Alblas, for meetings with Unesco officials and committee members.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailIn May, a cable reported on one meeting Alblas had with Unesco’s World Heritage Centre in Paris, where she said: “Instead of singling the Great Barrier Reef with a threat of in Danger listing, we should be showcasing what managing World Heritage properties in an uncertain climate future looks like when it is done well.”A senior foreign affairs official also travelled to Paris in July and had meetings with senior Unesco directors where reef issues were also discussed.‘Catastrophic’: Great Barrier Reef hit by its most widespread coral bleaching, study findsRead moreOverseas Australian government staff posted in committee member countries were sent questionnaires to fill out to gather intelligence. Diplomats in Greece, Bulgaria, Argentina, Lebanon, Belgium and Jamaica were among those to complete the work.Staff were asked to identify environment groups, media outlets and journalists in their country with a “history of advocacy” or interest in the reef. They were asked to outline their member states’ position on world heritage issues, and its views on the reef being possibly listed as in-danger.Almost all the responses to the questionnaires were heavily redacted, as were several other cables and documents.In September, after the reef had again escaped an in-danger listing at the committee meeting in India, a government cable said “engagement with committee members” had been a “key element of Australia’s World Heritage advocacy strategy and developing and maintaining relationships with the new Committee will be crucial to Australia’s interests”.The documents also show the government is aware that its advocacy will need to be maintained until at least 2026, when the committee has said it could next consider a danger listing for the reef.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionPlaces on the world heritage list are inscribed because of their “outstanding value to humanity” but sites are placed on the in-danger list if there are current or potential threats to those values.In 2021 the Great Barrier Reef became the first site globally to be recommended for the danger list primarily because of the impacts of climate change.But after extensive lobbying from the Morrison government, the recommendation from Unesco and its advisers, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), was ignored by the world heritage committee.That decision raised concerns among world heritage experts that the committee was becoming increasingly politicised and too often was ignoring scientific and technical advice.Climate change is the most prevalent threat to world heritage sites, according to IUCN, with the threat considered high or very high at 83 sites around the world.The Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson, who requested the documents, said they revealed “a furious, coordinated and global lobbying effort to keep the Great Barrier Reef off the World Heritage in danger list”.He said he believed if the reef was placed on the in-danger list, it would draw attention to Australia’s fossil fuel export industry.“Successive pro-fossil fuel Australian governments know this, hence it’s not in their interest to see an in danger listing,” he said.“Australia simply cannot be the guardian of this greatest natural wonder of the world and also the third biggest exporter of fossil fuels on the planet. It is a stark choice between coal or coral.”He said the reef had become “one of the most politicised ecosystems on earth” and the documents “make clear the Albanese government is acutely aware of the disconnect between Australia’s claims on taking domestic action on climate change, and our ongoing significant fossil fuel exports.”Widespread mass bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef’s coral was first observed in 1998 and again in 2002, 2016, 2017, 2020 and 2022. Last summer’s bleaching was the most widespread with some areas seeing high levels of coral death.Whish-Wilson said it would be “farcical” if the reef continued to be kept off Unesco’s danger list, “and I suggest highly damaging to its reputation and standing as a global institution”.Dr Lissa Schindler, the Great Barrier Reef campaign manager at the Australian Marine Conservation Society, said: “The government views an in danger listing as a penalty against their international reputation. The documents show a strong focus on shaping perceptions, including managing criticism of Australia’s climate policies and fossil fuel exports. It’s clear they saw this as a high-stakes issue.“The government’s focus on lobbying while the reef was undergoing its worst bleaching event on record in 2024 is troubling. Lobbying may delay an ‘in-danger’ listing, but it doesn’t address the root causes of the reef’s decline.”Explore more on these topicsGreat Barrier ReefUnescoAustralian politicsTanya PliberseknewsShareReuse this content"

The other told the redress scheme he was groped on the genitals by Pell during a game in a swimming pool.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThe decision-maker for the redress scheme accepted the men’s accounts, the reports state.For a criminal case to be proven, a standard of proof of “beyond reasonable doubt” must be satisfied. The national redress scheme for people who have experienced institutional child sexual abuse has a lower standard: that the abuse was “reasonably likely”.The diocese of Ballarat disputed the accounts before the redress scheme, according to the ABC report. Pell, who died in 2023, maintained his innocence of any abuse.The two victims were boys – aged eight and nine – and lived in Ballarat when the abuse detailed in their claims took place. The boys did not know each other and attended different schools in the diocese.The ABC report documents the older victim told the redress scheme that he was a primary school student at St Francis Xavier primary school when he was raped in the school gymnasium after he had stolen Pell’s cardigan.In his complaint to the scheme, according to the ABC report, the man said: “I remember him saying ‘pull your pants down’ … I thought he was going to whip me with his belt. He didn’t.“He put something in my ass – I presume it was his penis. It was very painful. I was bleeding from my bottom afterward,” the man told the redress scheme.The man first reported the abuse in 2024. He was granted $95,000 in compensation from the scheme, which did not dispute his account, the ABC report states.The other boy, who told the redress scheme he was eight when he was touched on the genitals by Pell, was awarded $45,000 in compensation weeks before Pell died in January 2023.The Department of Social Services, which has responsibility for the national redress scheme, declined to comment on specific cases before the scheme.“Specific information about a person (such as an applicant or alleged perpetrator and number of claims) is protected information,” a spokesperson said.Pell was a parish priest and episcopal vicar for education in Ballarat in the 1970s, having been ordained as a priest in 1966.He was made a bishop in 1987 and a cardinal in 2003, and served in Rome as first prefect of the Secretariat for the Economy, responsible for the Holy See’s budget. He was widely described as the third-most powerful Catholic in the world.He was convicted in 2018 of child sexual abuse, but on appeal to the high court in 2020, the convictions were quashed and he was acquitted.He spent 406 days in prison.After Pell’s acquittal, the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse released its unredacted report. That report found that Pell knew there were paedophile priests preying on minors in the Ballarat and Melbourne dioceses, but that he did not act to protect children. Instead, the commission found, Pell was more concerned about the reputation of the church.The commission found that, by 1973, Pell was “conscious of child sexual abuse by clergy” and had “considered measures of avoiding situations which might provoke gossip about it”.The commission said Pell’s evidence he did not know about child sexual abuse by clergy was “implausible”.The final report issued by the royal commission found that a “catastrophic institutional failure” by the Catholic church in Ballarat to take action on cases of sexual abuse had led to more children being abused by its clergy.The national redress scheme for people who have experienced institutional child sexual abuse was established by the federal government in 2018 following a recommendation by the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse. The scheme was supported by the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference.In Australia, children, young adults, parents and teachers can contact theKids Helplineon 1800 55 1800; adult survivors can seek help atBlue Knot Foundationon 1300 657 380.

Like other spyware makers, Paragon sells use of its spyware, known as Graphite, to government agencies, who are supposed to use it to fight and prevent crime.Paragon’s spyware was allegedly delivered to targets who were placed on group chats without their permission, and sent malware through PDFs in the group chat. Paragon makes no-click spyware, which means users do not have to click on any link or attachment to be infected; it is simply delivered to the phone.It is not clear how long Cancellato may have been compromised. But the editor published a high-profile investigative story last year that exposed how members of Meloni’s far-right party’s youth wing had engaged in fascist chants, Nazi salutes and antisemitic rants.Fanpage’s undercover reporters – although not Cancellato personally – had infiltrated groups and chat forums used by members of the National Youth, a wing of Meloni’s Brothers of Italy party. The outletpublished clipsof National Youth members chanting “Duce” – a reference to Benito Mussolini – and “sieg Heil”, and boasting about their familial connections to historical figures linked to neo-fascist terrorism. The stories were published in May.Cancellato, 45, said he did not have reason to suspect in December that his mobile device had been compromised and has never been told by any authorities that he is under investigation. The news felt like a “violation”, he said.“We just began the technical analysis on the device in order to evaluate the actual extent of this attack, what was actually taken or spied on, and for how long. Obviously, it is also in our interest to know, if it’s possible to do so, who ordered this espionage activity,” Cancellato told the Guardian.Meloni’s party faced criticism in Italy and in Brussels following the publication of Fanpage’s reporting. A European Commission spokesperson at the time said: “The point of view of the European Commission and of President Ursula von der Leyen on the symbolism of fascism is very clear: we do not believe it is appropriate, we condemn it, we think it is morally wrong.”The president of the Jewish Community of Rome, Victor Fadlun, called for “appropriate actions [to] be taken” after the Fanpage reports. “It is imperative that society and institutions react strongly against all forms of hatred and discrimination,” he wrote on X.Giovanni Donzelli, a Brothers ofItalyMP and party organizer, said at the time there was “no place” for “racists, extremists, and antisemites” in his party.Paragon Solutions declined to comment.Have you received a notification from WhatsApp?

[the die is cast]” on social media alongside a picture of him shaking hands with Belgium’s King Philippe.The royal palace confirmed an accord for a right-leaning coalition, which still has to be formally signed off by members of the participating parties.Split between French- and Dutch-speaking communities, and with a highly complex political system, Belgium has an unenviable record of painfully protracted coalition discussions – reaching 541 days back in 2010-2011.This time around, five groups have been seeking to forge a coalition since June elections thatfailed to produce a clear majority– with talks led by 54-year-old De Wever after his party claimed the most seats.The right and centre-right came out on top in June’s elections, leading analysts to predict coalition talks could take less time than usual.But negotiations hit a wall during the summer over the issue of plugging the country’s budget deficit – 4.4% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2023.De Wever, mayor of Antwerp since 2013, has pushed for cuts in social benefits and reforms to the country’s pension system that have already sparked opposition from labour unions.The flamboyant politician had threatened to throw in the towel on the hunt for a coalition if no deal was reached Friday – and the agreement was struck with just hours to go.Negotiators needed one final marathon 60-hour session to iron out differences over their 800-page programme.The new government brings together three parties from Dutch-speaking Flanders: De Wever’s conservative N-VA, the centrist Christian-Democrats and the leftist Vooruit (Onward).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Opponents included members of Merz’s own CDU/CSU alliance who rebelled, as well as members of the pro-business Free Democratic party (FDP) who had voted for the original motion but wanted the law to return to internal committees for further debate.The “influx limitation law”, the name and detail of which has been criticised, was considered of such historic importance that the plenary hall was unusually full and some MPs were reportedly persuaded to leave their sickbeds to be present.Merz, who will lead the Christian Democratic Union into the 23 February elections, said his bill was necessary for German domestic security and denied he was working with the AfD, or had any intention of doing so.“There are many who are concerned about democracy, but there are also many who are concerned about security and order in this country and expect decisions to be made,” he said.The debate adjourned before it had even begun in order for behind-the-scenes negotiations that aimed to enable the law’s passage with the backing of mainstream parties and not the far right.Attempts by the Social Democrats (SPD), their coalition partner the Greens, as well as their former coalition partner the FDP, to stop the law’s passage by referring it back to committees earlier in the day were unsuccessful.When MPs returned to the plenary hall it was for an often rowdy, tension-filled and emotional debate.Much was made of the opposition to the proceedings, including the decision by a 99-year-old Holocaust survivor,Albrecht Weinberg, to return to the German state his order of merit over the Wednesday vote, as well as the resignation from the CDU of Michel Friedman, a prominent German-French publicist and former deputy chair of the Central Council of Jews in Germany.Merz said the law was necessary in response to a string of high-profile murders carried out by men with an immigrant background. The chancellor, Olaf Scholz, had said existing laws were sufficient to stop such attacks, if properly implemented.Between 66% and 67% of Germans are in favour of permanent controls on Germany’s borders, according to recent polls, including 56% of supporters of the Social Democrats.View image in fullscreenThe chancellor, Olaf Scholz, takes part in the vote. The bill was rejected by 350 to 338, out of 693 MPs who voted.Photograph: Odd Andersen/AFP/Getty ImagesAfter this week’s dramatic scenes in parliament – during which Merz, the conservative opposition leader, was accused of courting the far right – parallels have been drawn with the events that led to the Nazi party taking power through the political process, amid a lack of unity among mainstream parties.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. For more information see ourPrivacy Policy. We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionRolf Mützenich, the chair of the SPD parliamentary group, said: “Weimar failed because of the lack of unity in democracy. But Weimar also failed because the authoritarian mindset never completely disappeared.”He had urged Merz to reverse his decision and “re-establish the firewall” against cooperating with the AfD. He suggested that if Merz failed to do so he would have to live with a damaged political reputation.“Your fall from grace will always accompany you,” Mützenich said, to jeers from the CDU benches. “But we can still close the gateway to hell together.”In an extraordinary broadside against his erstwhile CDU rival Angela Merkel, who on Thursdaycriticised Merzfor his apparent U-turn over earlier refusals to work with the AfD, Merz said his own party had a “significant share of responsibility” for the fact that the AfD had sat in the Bundestag since 2017.The remarks were a reference to Merkel’s open door policy, during which almost 1 million people entered Germany in 2015, but Merz went on to say it was the fault of the three-way coalition under Scholz that the party had since been able to become “twice as strong”.The foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock of the Greens, had urged Merz to change his mind and drop the bill. “It’s not about yourself, it’s about Germany,” she said. “There are times when you have to correct your policy by 180 degrees. That is precisely the question now. Do the right thing.”The first opinion poll on Friday since the Wednesday vote showed the AfD’s position unchanged in advance of the election. It is now second in the polls with 22%. Merz’s CDU/CSU was down one percentage point to 29%, while the SPD of Olaf Scholz gained 1.5 percentage points, bringing it to 17%, its best showing since the end of December. The Greens gained half a percentage point.Protests have taken place across Germany over the perceived shift to the right of the German parliament. At the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin on Thursday evening, a line of young people held up a long string of illuminated letters spelling out the slogan “Hope and Resistance”. On a poster bearing the CDU’s name, the wordbrandmauer(firewall) had been crossed out and replaced with the wordbrandstifter(arsonist).Explore more on these topicsGermanyAlternative für Deutschland (AfD)MigrationThe far rightEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Bertha von Suttner (€200), the Austrian pacifist and first woman to win the Nobel peace prize, is apparently worth 10 times the Polish-French scientist Marie Curie, an option for the €20.In the “rivers and birds” table option, a seascape of a northern gannet flying over big ocean waves is envisioned for the €200 note, with the European court of auditors on the back, while the European parliament is placed on the smallest €5 note, with a mountain spring and “wallcreeper next to a mountain landscape” on the other side.View image in fullscreenCould a northern gannet grace the €200 note?Photograph: Stuart Greenhalgh/AlamySince2016, the ECB has no longer issued a €500 note due to “concerns that this banknote could facilitate illicit activities”.Rob Wainwright, the then director of Europol, told the Dutch public broadcaster NOS at the time that the notes were far too handy for crime. “What we are seeing at Europol is that criminals and terrorists are using the €500 note … as their denomination of choice,” he said. “One million euros in €500 notes … can be moved in one small briefcase. Very convenient for these criminals and terrorists.”The leading European figures selected by the ECB could prove controversial, according to Reuters, as only six of the eurozone’s 20 countries are represented. Initial reactionson social mediahave also been critical, with calls for more focus on price stability instead of new notes. “Don’t fall for the ‘we love Europe’,” said one commentator on X. “Buy gold, silver and commodities.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When the euro banknotes were created bythe Austrian designer Robert Kalina, his “ages and styles of Europe” notes featured seven abstract, fictional bridges representing different design eras, rather than choosing one country’s designs or historical figures over the others. However, all these carefully neutral bridges now belong to the Netherlands, since the Dutch designer Robin Stamrecreated themin his home town of Spijkenissein 2011.The ECB still needed to organise a contest for EU designers, a jury, public consultation on the shortlist and the governing council decision, before a two-year process to get the notes into circulation, a spokesperson said. The cost of the redesign is understood to be between 5 cents and 8 cents per banknote.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionEuroCurrenciesGraphic designLudwig van BeethovenEuropean Central BankMaria CallasnewsShareReuse this content"

Seconds later, the grainy security video appeared to show a powerful explosion, sending plumes of smoke and sparks into the air, and the thieves rush into the museum in the north-eastern city of Assen.Minutes later they were gone. But the mystery of what exactly took place during their few minutes in theDrents Museum– and what came afterwards – has left officials in the Netherlands scrambling for answers, and prompted a row that has stretched to the other side of Europe.The daring heist took place last Saturday, with police saying they were notified at 3.45am local time. By then, the thieves had made off with a handful of objects, including the near-2,500-year-old gold Helmet of Coțofenești – one of Romania’s most revered national treasures.View image in fullscreenA Dacian golden wristband. Three gold bracelets dating from 50BC were taken.Photograph: Drents Museum/APThree gold bracelets dating from 50BC were also taken. The items were part of an exhibit, featuring more than 600 artefacts on loan, that had sought to offer visitors a glimpse of the glory of the Dacia civilisation, an ancient agrarian society that once thrived in what is today Romania.The helmet, in particular, had long been celebrated across Romania as a symbol of the country’s rich history, its image gracing school history textbooks, postage stamps and even a gold coin issued by the country’s national bank.“The helmet is one of the most popular and well-known ancient gold objects in Romania,” said Andrea Teunissen-Oprea, the honorary consul for Romania in the Netherlands. “Some people here are saying that it’s as if the Dutch would wake up and discover that [Rembrandt’s] The Night Watch was missing.”Dramatically studded and adorned with intricate designs that depict a lamb being sacrificed and mythical creatures such as a griffin, the helmet was believed to have been used during ceremonies. “It is unique in the world,” said Teunissen-Oprea. “Because there are no written documents from this period, the archaeological discoveries are incredibly important for Romania.”News of the heist had set off an “uproar” across Romania, she said, as mourning over the potential loss of the objects gave way to fury among the art world, politicians and media.“Even in our most pessimistic dreams, we would not have believed this to be possible,” said the director of Romania’s National History Museum, Ernest Oberländer-Târnoveanu, earlier this week. Hewas sackedfrom his role amid anger that the objects had been loaned out.View image in fullscreenThe Romanian prime minister alleged that the Drents Museum was not sufficiently guarded, which the museum denied.Photograph: Hollandse Hoogte/Rex/ShutterstockThe prime minister of Romania, Marcel Ciolacu, mused about claiming “unprecedented damages” from the Dutch museum. He alleged that it was not sufficiently guarded – a claim the Drents Museum rebuffed – as he sprang into action, announcing that Romania would send a team of experts including forensic police officers to help with the investigation, while the loan of the objects would be investigated domestically.“This is a very serious situation,” he wrote on social media, “but this robbery, which must be resolved swiftly, must not become fuel for the spread of all kinds of conspiracy theories by those who aim to make easy political capital.”The comment appeared to be a reference to Romania’s far-right AUR movement. Emboldenedafter its strong showingin the presidential and parliamentary elections in late 2024, the party had seized on the theft to call for government resignations. The robbery was “a direct attack on our national history and identity”, it said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Dozens of detectives and specialist officers combed through the scores of tips that had poured into a dedicated hotline. On Wednesday, after a days-long manhunt, police saidthey had arrestedthree people.“The suspects are held under strict conditions and are being questioned about their role in the heist,” said Dutch police, who also released a photograph of another suspect and noted that they had not ruled out further arrests.The Drents Museum described the arrests as offering a glimmer of hope. “We are awaiting further developments with bated breath,” it said in a statement. “The recovery without damage would be, for all, a fantastic next step. Not only for us, but also for the Romanian population.”Police said the focus was now on recovering the stolen artefacts. It was in some ways a race against time, as the global headlines over the heist meant the objects were likely now too well-known to be sold as they were, sparking fears the thieves would destroy the priceless objects in an attempt to sell what might amount to only about 1kg of gold.It would be a relatively small payoff for such a daring feat, said Teunissen-Oprea. “There’s really a question of why they did it. Why only those four things? Because there were 600 other things there.”She was among the many frantically hoping that the pieces would be found intact. “We are praying that the pieces are found and not melted down,” she said. “It would be a huge loss not only for Romania, but for the entire cultural heritage ofEurope.”Explore more on these topicsNetherlandsRomaniaMuseumsEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

There was also very, very little supplies and assistance that the agency could give them.”She added: “We’ve been calling for the release of hostages for months on end … These claims that hostages have been held in Unrwa premises, even if they were vacated, are absolutely serious.“We’ve repeatedly called for independent investigations into these claims, including the misuse and disregard of Unrwa premises by Palestinian armed groups. That also includes Hamas.”An Israeli law banning the activities of Unrwa in Israelcame into forceon Thursday and international staff were forced to leave, a decision the agency predicted would “sabotage Gaza’s recovery and political transition” and critics say will jeopardise urgent humanitarian aid efforts in the region.The Israeli government has accused Unrwa, which enjoys widespread international support and has more than 30,000 staff, of employing 190 Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants, and 12 people who took part in the 7 October 2023 attacks. The agency fired nine employees after an investigation but denied knowingly aiding armed groups.Damari and her mother gave the prime minister an update on Damari’s condition on Friday, and the conditions she lived under while she was held hostage, and then urged Starmer to ensure the Red Cross has access to people still being held captive in Gaza.“It’s a miracle that she survived, and we need to get aid to remaining hostages now,” her mother posted on X, along with a photograph of her holding the phone for her daughter to speak into.Damari was taken from her home in the Kfar Aza kibbutz on 7 October and shot in the hand, then “blindfolded and forced into her own car with two other friends”, her family said previously.Both Damari and her mother thanked Starmer for the government’s help bringing about her release on 19 January, and her mother said the prime minister invited Damari to visit Downing Street when she had recovered.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelUnited NationsAidGazaHamasKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

They said there was a clear risk Israel was breaching international law in its treatment of Palestinian prisoners, and in restricting aid into Gaza.No human rights concern would stop UK selling F-35 parts for Israel, say NGOsRead moreInternal government correspondence revealed in Mr Justice Chamberlain’s judgment shows that the defence secretary, John Healey, convinced the business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, that the licence to sell UK F-35 components for use by Israel could not be withdrawn without significant effects upon the whole F-35 programme and Nato security.He wrote: “Such a suspension of F-35 licensing leading to the consequent disruption for partner aircraft, even for a brief period, would have a profound impact on international peace and security.“It would undermine US confidence in the UK and Nato at a critical juncture in our collective history and set back relations. Our adversaries would not wait to take advantage of any perceived weakness, having global ramifications.”The government has admitted to the court without caveat that the F-35 parts could be used to break international humanitarian law.Part of the evidence that Ministry of Defence officials have given to the court about the integration of the F-35 programme and its role in Nato in combating Russia has been kept closed.But ministers have said the loss of UK components, some of which are exclusively supplied by the UK to the F-35 global spares pool, would have an effect in days, and in the event of a war with Russia lead to a lengthy land campaign due to the reduction in air power.Ministers also claim contractually the UK could not withhold spares without a consensus to allow this in the Washington-based board that oversees the F-35 programme.David Lammy, the foreign secretary, specifically acknowledged to the court that “Israel’s actions in Gaza continue to lead to immense loss of civilian life, widespread destruction to civilian infrastructure, and immense suffering”.UK government lawyers have also told the court that Israeli F-35s do not assist Israel’s unlawful occupation of the Palestinian territories or help Israel to commit unproved acts of genocide.The case has been brought by the Palestinian human rights group Al-Haq alongside the Global Legal Action Network, but they have been joined by Oxfam, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There is a powerful public interest in a quick, final determination of its legality, one way or the other.”He said he had heard no argument that the ceasefire in Gaza made the case irrelevant.Shawan Jabarin, the general director of Al-Haq, said: “Gaza is destroyed, it is unlivable. Palestinians in Gaza have been killed and erased by weapons whose components are supplied to Israel by the UK government, acting in full knowledge of the consequences.”Explore more on these topicsDefence policyMilitaryIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Israel has previously said it does not have intelligence confirming that claim, but last week the Israeli military’s spokesperson, R Adm Daniel Hagari, said there were “grave concerns” for the fate of Shiri and her two children.Relatives of the Bibas family said in a statement: “We said then, and we say now: we hold on to hope and continue waiting for their return. We await clarity regarding their condition.”Those concerns were underlined by reports earlier this week that relatives of eight of the 33 Israelis had been informed by Gal Hirsch, the lead Israeli official dealing with hostages and the missing, that Hamas’s claims that they were dead were in line with Israel’s intelligence assessment.Yizhar Lifshitz, whose father, Oded Lifshitz, 84, is on the list of the initial 33 to be returned, told Ynet: “It’s not exactly data. It’s Hamas saying [the number of] ‘alive’, ‘released’ and ‘dead’.‘I told my son to keep strong – let’s wait for dad’: Thailand hopes for return of its last Hamas hostageRead more“There’s a grave concern for his life after this last indication. The last sign of life for him was on day 25.”The Bibas family have been a particular focus in Israel and abroad. Earlier this week, supporters asked people to wear orange, signifying the colour of the boys’ hair.“The information we received is not good,” Jimmy Miller, a cousin of Shiri Bibas, told the Jewish News Service last week. “The army is afraid about the state in which they will be returned, but nothing is proven yet. They fear the information we had received a year ago is real, but we won’t know the truth until we see it with our own eyes.”Israel is set to release 183 prisoners on Saturday in the fourth hostage-prisoner exchange under the Gaza ceasefire deal, a Palestinian advocacy group said on Friday night, more than doubling the previous reported figure.“The updated number of prisoners to be released tomorrow is 183,” said Palestinian Prisoners’ Club spokesperson Amani Sarahneh, after previously announcing that 90 prisoners would be released from Israeli jails.Even as Israelis have braced themselves for bad news about the Bibas family, supporters have clung to hope.At a rally in Tel Aviv on Thursday, Leah Corry, 65, a special needs teacher who knows the children’s grandparents, told the Guardian: “My heart says they might be alive, but from a rational point of view, thinking logically, they aren’t with us any more. Because of their ages, because there has been no proof of life.“If they were alive, everyone would want them to come out. I think the families know they are dead. There are no children coming out in the releases.”Tal Sabbah, 37, an operations manager, said he had first heard reports more than a year ago that the Bibas children and their mother had been killed. Like Corry, he thought the release of adult male hostages was confirmation they would not be returned alive.“It breaks my heart,” Sabbah said, particularly after becoming a father for the first time, but he said it was something he had accepted. “I think I’ve processed it already quite a long time ago.“Now it is like the final confirmation. I think, as sad as it is, it is also an important piece of the puzzle, just to know.”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warHamasIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

Because of a history of deep-vein thrombosis, she could not have a tag attached to her ankle. No wrist tag that fitted her could be found.On Friday afternoon she was released from Eastwood Park prison on home detention curfew. It is understood that a 15cm wrist strap previously deemed unsuitable for her was considered usable.Delap’s brother, Mick Delap, said: “Gaie is of course delighted to be back at home. She is enormously grateful for the support she has received not just from family and friends, but from many generous and committed individuals and organisations.”Initially, Delap was informed she would be released on 17 March but last Friday she was told it had been delayed until 7 April.Her release on Friday follows representations by her lawyer Raj Chada, at Hodge Jones and Allen, supported by the Good Law Project. When they received no response, a letter before action was sent to the Ministry of Justice.Lawyers acting for the justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, said Delap’s release meant there was no longer any need to reply to the letter. Delap’s legal team will not need to bring a challenge against the Ministry of Justice about her recall to prison on 20 December 2024.A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said on Friday: “Ms Delap has now been fitted with a tag and has been placed on home detention curfew.”Jolyon Maugham of the Good Law Project welcomed Delap’s release. “Although we’re delighted Gaie has been released today this isn’t the end of the story,” he said. “We are now considering what action may be taken against the Ministry of Justice and Serco, who provide tags on behalf of the government, for a breach of equality law.“The Good Law Project’s position is that climate protesters are being disproportionately policed. The public interest would be much better served if the police went after real criminals.”Mick Delap called the news a victory for common sense. “This is not compassion – it’s the law finally being applied as it should be. And her release today shows that if challenged peacefully by enough people, and if backed by proper reporting, those tasked with applying the law can be persuaded to do their job,” he said.“Gaie is keen that we shouldn’t forget the large numbers of prisoners, especially women, serving equally unjust terms of recall whose suffering Gaie’s case has highlighted.”Her case was one of 16 in the court of appeal this week. On Wednesday, 16 convicted climate activists called for judges to reduce their prison sentences in a rare mass appeal. They claim the terms were excessive and breach international human rights laws.The court of appeal reviewed the jail sentences related to four separate cases involving Just Stop Oil activists between July and September 2024.Explore more on these topicsPrisons and probationJust Stop OilUK criminal justiceProtestBristolEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

But the two categories appear to have been discarded.The existing inspection report format uses four to six sub-grades, including quality of education, and leadership and management, with a cumulative headline grade.The current scale of four grades, ranging from inadequate to outstanding, will be replaced by five steps, with “exemplary” as the new top grade, down to “causing concern” at the bottom, according to the FT.Ofsted did not comment on the reports.An earlier presentation by Ofsted stated: “We want report cards to provide more nuance by inspecting each of the proposed evaluation areas against the proposed evaluation scale so that leaders and parents can understand the areas of strength and areas of development in the provision.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He had been diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease.Tributes were paid at the memorial service by the peers Paul Boateng and Simon Woolley, as well as the former head of the equal rights watchdog Sir Trevor Phillips, the TV presenter Sherrie Eugene-Hart, and in a written statement from the former boxer Frank Bruno, to an audience that included the actor David Harewood.The service was also attended by civic leaders including the former Bristol mayor Marvin Rees, the leader of Bristol city council, Tony Dyer, and His Majesty’s representative, the lord lieutenant Peaches Golding.Music chosen to reflect Stephenson’s broad tastes was played, including classical choral music and Labi Siffre’s (Something Inside) So Strong.Addressing the congregation, Boateng said: “None of us would be here if Paul hadn’t refused to give up his seat when they told him to, if he hadn’t faced the humiliation of arrest, the fingerprinting, the day in court; none of us would be here.”Stephenson was made an OBE for his services to equal opportunities in 2009 and was awarded honorary doctorates at three UK universities.Paul Stephenson: the hero who refused to leave a pub – and helped desegregate BritainRead moreHe was the first black person to be granted the freedom of the city of Bristol, and received a Pride of Britain lifetime achievement award in 2017.Bruno’s tribute said: “I am sure today you will hear many stories about Paul. I am only disappointed that, while alive, his life was not honoured more nationally – not just in the south-west but across the entire UK – with far more substantial recognition.”He added: “I feel that when God created Paul, the mould was destroyed. We will never see the likes of Paul Stephenson again. May we all live happier, easier lives thanks to his actions.”Stephenson was born in Rochford, Essex, in 1937. At three years old he was evacuated to a care home in Great Dunmow in the Essex countryside with seven white children, where he stayed for seven years.In 1953 he joined the RAF as a cadet, serving until 1960. He went to college to study youth work before moving to Bristol in 1962 to be a youth and community development worker and a supply teacher.In 2012 he released his autobiography,Memoirs of a Black Englishman.The dean of Bristol, the Very Rev Dr Mandy Ford, said: “It is a great privilege and honour for us to be hosting this service to give thanks for the legacy of Paul Stephenson. Paul was a true giant who leaves a lasting legacy in the city of Bristol and beyond.”Explore more on these topicsRaceBlack British cultureBristolProtestnewsShareReuse this content"

The chancellorsignalled her supportfor a third runway at Heathrow this week as part of the government’s latest push to stimulate the economy.One ally of the energy secretary, Ed Miliband, who is leading the government’s climate agenda, said the formerLabourleader would have a “punchy” response for any attempt to give consent to Rosebank. The ally said: “Ed will come to that fight armed with a lot of evidence about what Rosebank will do to our carbon emissions.”A spokesperson for Miliband declined to comment.A Labour backbencher said: “[A decision around Rosebank] will be a moment to speak out. There are a lot of us, on every wing of the party, who would go absolutely nuts if that happened.”Another Labour MP said: “Not many in the party are going to man the barricades over Heathrow, but Rosebank is a very different matter altogether. There would be massive resistance if they try and give consent for that.”The Rosebank developmentlost a significant court casethis week when a judge in Scotland ruled the decision by the previous government to give it the green light had been unlawful. The judge ruled that ministers should not have given it consent without knowing how much carbon dioxide would be generated by burning the oil the field will produce over its lifetime.Equinor, the Norwegian energy company that is leading the Rosebank project, is expected to carry out that more detailed assessment and come back with a renewed consent application later this year. An Equinor spokespersonsaid after the rulingit would continue to work with the government on securing consent, adding: “Rosebank is critical for the UK’s economic growth.”But while the decision is technically up to the independent North Sea Transition Authority, government officials say it is likely to be so sensitive that the prime minister himself will have to weigh in.Labour came into government last year promising not to issue any new licences for oil and gas fields in the North Sea. The Rosebank project, however, already has its licence and can continue developing the field until it gets environmental consent to start pumping oil out of the ground.A source close to Starmer said the prime minister had not ruled out giving the go-ahead for the field but would want to see the application first.Many, however, think it has been made more likely by the government’s renewed push for growth, after Reeves signalled her approval for another runway at Heathrow as well as further liberalisation of the planning regime.Asked last week about the clash between her economic agenda and the government’s environmental targets,Reeves said: “Growth is the number-one mission of this government, because growth underpins everything else, whether that is improving our schools and our hospitals, or indeed being able to get to net zero.”One oil and gas lobbyist said: “Three months ago I would have been less confident that the government would give consent. But Trump and Labour’s post-Christmas growth zeal makes it significantly more likely.” Equinor said the project would generate jobs for 4,000 people.Reeves’s apparent downgrading of the government’s climate mission is already causing unease in Labour circles. The backbencher Clive Lewis wrote in the Guardian on Friday: “A growing suspicion looms that our government lacks a coherent governing philosophy or ideological compass beyond the vague pursuit of ‘growth’. But if growth at any cost is the mantra, the costs will soon become painfully clear.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But some say they are looking out for any further sign of the government walking away from its green agenda.One Labour MP told the Guardian: “We are proud that we’re the most green government the country has ever had. That’s important, and not something you’d want to lose.”Another said: “Once Justin Trudeau is out [as Canadian prime minister], Keir will essentially be the world leader who is the most prominently committed to climate. I think we should not shy away from taking on that mantle.”Miliband is preparing to publish the results of a recent consultation with the energy industry and the public more generally about how the government should account for the emissions from oil and gas produced in the UK.Government officials say the outcome of that consultation will be vital in deciding whether or not they can give consent to a new oilfield while also remaining within Labour’s CO2reduction commitments.Campaigners argue that the project is unlikely to produce the growth promised by its backers.Tessa Khan, the executive director of Uplift, said: “Renewables are the key growth sector of the UK, both in terms of investment and jobs, and where our global advantage lies.“But that sector is now in competition with the oil and gas industry for workers, supply chains, port space and other resources, not to mention the disastrous signals doubling down on oil and gas sends to clean-energy investors.”Explore more on these topicsLabourOil (Environment)Oil (Business)Keir StarmerRachel ReevesHeathrow airportHeathrow third runwaynewsShareReuse this content"

They were put on trial at the Old Bailey largely on his word. All pleaded not guilty.All but one were convicted and jailed, despite jurors hearing accusations that police officers had lied, used violence and made threats. De Souza received a sentence of six months’ detention.The five convicted men attempted to appeal against their convictions and sentences in 1973 but were refused.In 2021, after evidence of the corrupt and racist practices of Ridgewell emerged, De Souza’s co-accused – Paul Green, Courtney Harriott, Cleveland Davison and Texo Johnson – had their convictions overturned by the court of appeal.Their cases had been referred by the Criminal Cases Review Commission but De Souza had still not been found. The then chair of the CCRC, Helen Pitcher, gave a statement asking for De Souza or his family to come forward.In December De Souza made an application to the CCRC, which announced on Friday it had referred his conviction back to the court of appeal.De Souza’s lawyer, Jenny Wiltshire, a partner at Hickman & Rose, said: “While it is good news that the CCRC has referred Mr De Souza’s conviction to the court of appeal, it is a tragedy that is has taken over 50 years for the miscarriage of justice he suffered to start to be rectified.“Derek Ridgewell, the corrupt police officer at the heart of this case and others like it, was convicted in 1980. It was at that point that Ridgewell’s employer, British TransportPolice, should have immediately reviewed every criminal investigation in which he was involved.“But it didn’t. As a result it has taken half a century for the individual people victimised by him to come forward and fight to clear their names.”Wiltshire said Ridgewell’s corruption was not confined to the Stockwell Sixand Oval Fourcases, adding: “I am not confident that all his victims have yet been identified.”View image in fullscreenPaul Green (left) and Cleveland Davidson outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London in July 2021, after having their convictions overturned (along with Courtney Harriott) by the court of appeal.

He was jailed for seven years and died of a heart attack in prison in 1982, aged 37.The Stockwell Six case began after Ridgewell had been put in charge of a new mugging squad in the capital in 1972.

Ridgewell claimed he had defended himself and arrested them with undercover officers.Only one man, Everett Mullins, was acquitted at the time because it was shown that his reading ability was not good enough for him to have understood the signed statement written for him by Ridgewell.The former Det Supt Graham Satchwell, who co-wrote a book on Ridgewell with Winston Trew, another of his victims, said it was “impossible to overstate” the impact of the wrongful convictions. “He really did smash up lives and families,” Satchwell said.Matt Foot, the co-director of the miscarriages of justice organisation Appeal, who has represented many of Ridgewell’s victims, said their long wait for justice showed the need for reform. “It’s high time we changed the law so that when police officers like DS Ridgewell are sent to prison their files are automatically reviewed for miscarriages of justice,” he said.A spokesperson for the Ministry of Justice said there were no plans to change the law at the moment.In a statement, the CCRC said it was still looking for more victims of Ridgewell’s corrupt policing: “Anyone else who believes they might be a victim of a miscarriage of justice, convicted in a case involving Derek Ridgewell, is urged to contact the CCRC.”Explore more on these topicsPoliceUK criminal justiceLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

People went in for their frying pans and came out with a Jeffrey Archer thriller. That’s brilliant. If it disappears, we lose that.”The company confirmed it is “exploring potential strategic options” including a “possible sale”. Its high street business is profitable, with £452m of revenue last year and £32m of profit.“As a child, I used to get WH Smith gift vouchers for Christmas to spend on books, so to hear the chain is selling its high street stores produces a very particular nostalgic twang,” said Victoria Selman, author of novels including Truly Darkly Deeply.“I don’t think the importance of the book sections in WH Smith and shops like it can be overstated,” said Sarah Underwood, whose most recent book is Gentlest of Wild Things. “They are critical in getting books into the hands of teenagers, especially those who are more reluctant readers and won’t generally visit bookshops, or those who can’t access books at the relatively higher price points there.”In many towns across the UK, WH Smith is the only accessible bookshop. It’s a huge blow for readersJess PopplewellIn many towns across the UK, “WH Smith is the only accessible bookshop, so I think it’s a huge blow for readers who might now find themselves in a book desert”, said Jess Popplewell, author of The Dark Within Us. She hopes that independent bookshops will emerge as replacements.The chain is “such a valuable part of our high street”, said Rosie Talbot, whose latest book is Phantom Hearts. WH Smith was established in 1792 on London’s Little Grosvenor Street – now Broadbent Street – by Henry Walton Smith and his wife Anna. Its high street stores now employ about 5,000 staff.Multiple authors told the Guardian that a sale would negatively impact writers. It would be “one more nail in the coffin for British writers”, said Rubin. “Britain’s never really going to compete with Germany in building cars or China in electronics, but we can stake a place on the world stage with our literature.” He called for more government support, including tax breaks, for authors, the publishing industry and bookshops.Selman said that being selected for the Richard and Judy book club, run in partnership with WH Smith, provided her “with a brilliant opportunity to reach new readers who might not otherwise have come across my novels”. The potential sale would “likely mean the end of the book club and therefore the closing off of yet more opportunities for writers to stand out from the crowd in an increasingly crowded and competitive marketplace”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

The company’s “ability to reach a broad demographic of readers remains important”, added Bloomsbury.A sale “would be incredibly damaging for the publishing industry and authors”, said David Headley, managing director of publisher Goldsboro Books. It would leave a gap in the promotion of commercial fiction and books by emerging writers, particularly as it raises questions about the future of the Richard and Judy book club.“As the channels though which people buy books become fewer, the world narrows,” added Chris Vick, whose books include Shadow Creatures. “There is less choice, less visibility and – in the end – fewer readers.”Explore more on these topicsBooksWH SmithBooksellersnewsShareReuse this content"

But, he said, the NTSB would not be releasing information from the device immediately as investigations into the crash that killed 67 people aboard both aircraft continued.Recorders for the passenger plane were recovered Thursday night. The plane’s data recorder was “in good condition”, but the cockpit voice recorder “had water intrusion”, a problem investigators are now dealing with, Inman said.Investigators have “a very high level of confidence” that they will get information from that device, he added.Meanwhile, air traffic control conducted interviews with witnesses Friday, Inman said, adding those interviews would continue through Friday night and into the coming days.Inman’s comments Friday came after Donald Trump said that the Black Hawk helicopter had been “flying too high, by a lot” at the time of the crash. The president delivered that assertion even as investigators continued to piece together the reasons for the disaster and had not arrived at a conclusion.The president’s claim seemed to stem from questions aboutthe angleat which the helicopter had been flying, as well as whether the air traffic control tower had been understaffed.Washington DC plane crash: more than 40 bodies recovered; Trump claims army helicopter was flying too high – live updatesRead moreAll 64 people on the passenger plane, along with the three people in the army helicopter,died on Wednesday nightafter the two aircraft collided in midair close to the Reagan National airport. The bodies of more than 40 people had been recovered from the icy Potomac River, where the wreckage now lies. Most of those recovered victims had been identified, though work was still continuing to identify others.The US transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, confirmed that the Federal Aviation Administration would immediately restrict helicopter traffic around the Reagan airport, saying the decision would ensure “the safety of airplane and helicopter traffic”.“The American people deserve full confidence in our aviation system, and today’s action is a significant step towards restoring that,” he said.Emergency medical helicopters as well as those actively working in law enforcement and air defense are exempt from the restrictions. The presidential helicopter Marine One is exempt, too.There have been claims that the staffing levels in the air traffic control tower, and the congested skies around the capital, played a role in the crash.In a highly unusual and subjective move, especially at these early stages of a painstaking official accident investigation, the US president weighed in on social media, not just to repeat his statement about the helicopter’s altitude that he made on Thursday, but with his own comments. Trump alleged that the helicopter had been flying above the required height limit in the clear night sky on Wednesday, as the commercial jet was on final approach to land at Reagan.ABC News aired claims that the Black Hawk had been flying at 400ft, when it should have been at 200ft.“The Blackhawk helicopter was flying too high, by a lot,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “It was far above the 200 ft limit. That’s not really too complicated to understand, is it???”At the White House press briefing, the press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, backed up the president, saying he simply stated that “the helicopter was flying higher than it should have been, which is one of the reasons that led to this collision. And the other reasons for that are still being investigated.”In the wake of the disaster, Trump has also implied, without any evidence, that diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs in aviation administration and air traffic control under previous Democratic administrations contributed to the crash.“It doesn’t matter what they look like, how they speak, who they are,” Trump said on Thursday about air traffic controllers. “They have to be talented, naturally talented. Geniuses. Can’t have regular people doing their job.”The president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, Nick Daniels, said he stood behind “every highly skilled, highly trained air traffic controller that is out there”.In an interview withCBS News, Daniels outlined the many tests and trainings required for the job, and said: “It doesn’t matter their race, color, religion, you can know you are in the best hands that take that responsibility very seriously every day.”Investigators have pointed out that the causes of the crash and any potential lessons from it are still to be determined. Previously, reports abounded from anonymous sources in government that double the number of air traffic controllers should have been dealing with guiding aircraft that night.Todd Inman, a member of the National Transportation Safety Board, told ABC’s Good Morning America that “we don’t have determination” yet as to whether staffing levels contributed to the crash.“The only conclusion I know is we met with several hundred family members who lost their loved ones in the Potomac. We don’t need that to happen any more,” he said, choking up as he spoke on air.The Illinois representative Jesús García, a Democrat who sits on the House subcommittee on aviation, accused Trump in an interviewwith CNNof “exploiting disaster to continue to spread racist lies and divisiveness across the country, simply to score political points with his base”.He added: “We don’t know what occurred and whether it was human error that caused this flight or other factors.”Maryland’s governor, Wes Moore, also a Democrat, criticized Trump’s remarks, too, including the commentTrump madewhen asked by the media whether he would visit the site of the crash. The president said: “You want me to go swimming?”Moore said: “When this country needed comfort, we got chaos. When this country needed healing, we got hatred.”An initial FAA report obtained by US media organisations said staffing levels were “not normal for the time of day and volume of traffic” before a military helicopter collided with a passenger jet in the heart of Washington DC.According to the report, the separate roles of coordinating helicopter traffic and arriving and departing planes had been combined when the collision happened, the Associated Press reported. But it further reported a source saying staffing had been normal. The Washington Post said two people had been handling the jobs of four inside the control tower.Map of crashThe helicopter and the passenger plane had been flying in a “standard flight pattern” on a clear night before the crash, Duffy said.The US army had an increase in very serious aviation incidents during the last fiscal year, with 15 flight and two ground incidents that resulted in deaths of service members, destruction of aircraft or more than $2.5m in damage to the airframe, the Associated Press reported.Explore more on these topicsWashington DC plane crashWashington DCUS militaryAir transportnewsShareReuse this content"

In the memo, which was reviewed by the Guardian, officials instructed website managers across the agency to “identify and archive or unpublish any landing pages focused on climate change”. . It also included a Friday deadline to list the mentions in a spreadsheet for further review.On Friday, USDA officials clarified that the content should not be deleted. “USDA needs to adhere to requirements around records retention, so Archive or Unpublish [sic] landing pages focused on climate change,” an email sent to agency public affairs directors read.As of publication, the USDA’s Climate Hubs – helpful sites that connect producers to local programs and research – are still live, but many sites were down, including the USFS Climate Change Resource Center, Climate Action Tracker, and the National Roadmap for Responding to Climate Change.The sites featured important tools and information to help mitigate the effects of climate change and research. For now, the administration has effectively barred access to dozens of programs set up to help a wide range of communities – from farmers to firefighters – as they navigate changing conditions.The changes are part of adizzying flurry of ordersreshaping the federal government’s policies on global heating.Trump repealed environmental protections put in place by Joe Biden, declared a misguided energy emergency to hasten already-booming fossil fuel extraction, and withdrew from the Paris climate agreement.The administration also added confusion and chaos within federal agencies by halting hiring and pausing projects, along with issuing a widespread buyout offer that would guarantee federal workers pay and benefits through September 2025 if they resign within the next week.Changes at other federal websites on Friday signaled other major shifts in policy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Infectious Diseases Society of America, a medical association, issued a statement decrying the removal of information about HIV and people who are transgender. Access is “critical to efforts to end the HIV epidemic”, the organization’s leaders said.It is unclear what the agencies will do with the websites or the policies and studies once detailed on them; links to the landing pages are still live, even if the information on each page has been archived.The Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpClimate crisisUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Trump also threatened to follow up with a further wave of tariffs against the European Union.Goods exported from Canada andMexicoto the US will be hit with a 25% tariff, while products from China face a 10% levy, the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, told reporters on Friday.The administration did not give exact details of the tariffs, which Trump has repeatedly said would start 1 February. Trump later suggested in the Oval Office that oil fromCanada, which exports millions of barrels of crude per day to the US, would “probably” face a lower tariff of 10% and that he expected his administration would impose duties related to oil and gas around 18 February.While the president insisted that nothing could be done by Canada, Mexico and China right now to forestall tariffs, officials were said to be scrambling to find a way out. Several situations under consideration in a bid to strike an 11th-hour deal,accordingto the Wall Street Journal.Leavitt dismissed reports that the US would delay implementation of the tariffs by a month as “false”, claiming that “starting tomorrow, those tariffs will be in place”.Canada has pledged to retaliate with a “forceful but reasonable” response. Mexico has also drawn up plans, but declined to provide details. China has said it will “firmly defend” its interests.The US is also looking at tariffs on drugs, steel, aluminum, copper, computer chips and “things associated with chips”, Trump said. He also threatened the EU, which he claimed had treated the US “horribly”, with substantial action.The presidenthas claimed imposing duties on goods from overseas will raise hundreds of billions of dollars for the federal government, while forcing countries – even two of America’s closest allies – to bend to his demands.Why Trump tariffs will be ‘very bad for America and for the world’Read moreBut economists have repeatedly warned that higher tariffs, a key pillar of Trump’s economic strategy, risk raising prices for millions of Americans, challenging the president’s pledge to bring down prices “rapidly” amid a wave of frustration over thecost of living.Trump acknowledged on Friday that his tariffs could cause “temporary short-term disruption”, but expressed hope that Americans would understand why they had been imposed. “Tariffs don’t cause inflation,” he claimed. “They cause success.”Investors appear apprehensive, too. Stocks on Wall Street fell after the White House press briefing, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing down 0.75% in New York.After his election victory in November, the president homed in on Canada and Mexico, the US’s neighbors, andChina, demanding they do more to stop “illegal aliens” and drugs such as fentanyl from crossing into the US. Trump said he would impose tariffs immediately upon entering office, but hours after his inauguration said he would do so on 1 February instead.Mexico and Canada have insisted in recent days that they stand prepared for Trump to make good on his threat.“We have plan A, plan B and plan C for whatever the US government decides,” Claudia Sheinbaum, the Mexican president, said on Friday. The country has previously signaled that it would “have to” respond with duties of its own if hit with US tariffs.Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, warned of potentially “difficult times” if Trump proceeds with tariffs.On Trudeau’s warning that Canada would put forward a “forceful but reasonable” response to US duties, Leavitt shot back at the White House press briefing: “I think Justin Trudeau would be wise to talk to President Trump directly before pushing outlandish comments like that to the media.”Chrystia Freeland, Canada’s former trade negotiator and finance minister, who isvying to succeed Trudeau, proposed a 100% tariff on all Tesla vehicles and on US wine, beer and spirits. “We need to be very targeted, very surgical, very precise,” she told the Canadian Press – in this case, targeting the Tesla chief, Elon Musk, at the heart of Trump’s inner circle.Trump, who mooted a 20% universal tariff on all foreign imports from across the world while running for re-election, has made clear that other key markets, including the European Union, are also in his sights.In his inaugural address, the president laid out his plan to overhaul the US’s economic ties with the world. “Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens,” he declared, claiming this would lead to “massive amounts of money pouring into our treasury, coming from foreign sources”.Tariffs are not charged on the exporter, but the importer – in this case, firms based in the US – and are often passed on to consumers. This is why economists caution that increasing duties on importscould exacerbate inflation.Undeterred, Trump has launched a consultation into the creation of an “external revenue service” for the collection of tariffs.The conservative Tax Foundation has estimated that Trump imposed about $80bn worth of tariffs on about $380bn worth of products in 2018 and 2019, describing it as “one of the largest tax increases in decades”. The Biden administration kept most of the tariffs in place, and increased tariffs on an additional $18bn of Chinese goods, including semiconductors and electric vehicles.In a speech earlier this week, Trump claimed his officials would introduce tariffs on overseas semiconductors, drugs and steel “in the very near future”, singling out Taiwan and suggesting that such duties would incentivize manufacturers to make such goods in the US.Imposing tariffs, at least using the conventional playbook, takes time. A necessary investigation requires 270 days by statute. But Trump’s officials have reportedly been exploring other options, such as the declaration of an economic emergency, in an attempt to move more quickly.Biggest US trading allies brace for a ‘game of chicken’ with Trump’s tariffsRead moreUS importers, or their customs brokers, are required by Customs and Border Protection to file an entry summary for goods arriving into the US, with details about their shipment, such as what it is, how much it is worth and where it is from. Goods are assigned a specific code according to theHarmonized Tariff Schedule, which has the applicable tariff rates.Importers are responsible for paying the duties calculated on the value of the goods they have imported.Have a question about Trump tariffs?

Wilcox, the first Black woman to serve on the board, has pledged to pursue “all legal avenues” to challenge her firing.“It was unprecedented to have a sitting board member terminated because of her positions that she’s taken in cases. That is clearly contrary to law,” said Lauren McFerran, chair of the NLRB until last month, when her reappointment wasblockedin the US Senate. “In this case, the president made no pretense of accusing member Wilcox of any misconduct, which would be ridiculous.“She’s a dedicated public servant. She had a sterling reputation. He did not, to my knowledge, provide her with any opportunity for a hearing or any advanced notice, he just summarily fired her because he disagreed with her decisions as a board member. That’s never happened before.”Members of the NLRB, according to the National Labor Relations Act, can only be removed by a president “for neglect of duty or malfeasance in office, but for no other cause”.McFerranservedas a member of the NLRB from 2014 to 2019, wasreappointedunder the Trump administration in 2020, and was chair the agency from January 2021 until December.“There is real danger in attacking the existence of independent regulatory agencies, particularly independent adjudicators,” she added. “Congress made a judgment that certain areas of critical government decision making should be insulated from the day-to-day influence of the president. I think that’s particularly important when we’re talking about people who are functionally serving as judges.”McFerran also noted given Wilcox’s intent to challenge her removal in court, if new board members are appointed, any decisions made without her can be deemed invalid if her termination is overturned, creating uncertainty for federal labor laws.“We want parties who bring their cases before agencies like the board to have fair tribunals,” concluded McFerran. “When I was at the board, I never had to worry that if I was hearing a case and I rejected the position of somebody who was an ally of the president, or even rejected the position of the presidentially appointed general counsel, that it would cost me my job. And that’s the environment that future board members could be operating in now, which basically just takes away the independence of independent agencies, and I think that’s a real loss for the government.”Wilma B Liebman, whochairedthe NLRB from 2009 to 2011, under Barack Obama, and before that served as a board member under Bill Clinton and George W Bush, called Wilcox’s termination “brazen and shocking, contrary to long existing supreme court precedent, the clear language of the statute (the NLRA), and decades of custom”.“Singling out a Black woman for termination, reeks of discriminatory motive,” Liebman said. “The White House is perilously rolling the dice here, but their aim obviously is to cause chaos and impede the board’s operation. Her termination, along with the termination of other members of bipartisan multimember boards or commissions, sets a dangerous precedent and threat to the rule of law, further polarizing and politicizing administrative agency operations and the law.”This goes “way beyond the state of polarization and politicization that has existed already for years”, she added.SomeNLRB functions, such as processing unfair labor practice charges, do not require three serving board members, while the chief administrative law judge can handle some motions and requests without a quorum on the board. But cases where a board decision is required or requested are in effect halted.While McFerran noted that a lot of “routine steps” can continue within the NLRB, she warned: “Push comes to shove, if any party wants to take advantage of the fact that there’s not a quorum of the board to try to kind of to put an indefinite pause on their case, they can pretty easily do so.”Firms including SpaceX, led by Trump ally Elon Musk, and Amazon havefiledchallenges against the NLRB in court, alleging the agency is unconstitutional. Federal courts are currently reviewing many of these cases, which could eventually reach the supreme court.William B Gould IV, NLRB chair from 1994 to 1998, claimed Wilcox’s termination was a bid to weaken the labor movement.“Trump is playing a role, that he is well used to, and that is the role of usurping the rule of law,” he said. “I think it’s usurpation and an attack on the rule of law to politicize in a way which Congress and the Constitution never intended, to allow for the dismissal of board members when the President doesn’t like what they’ve done.”It is unclear how the courts will rule on the termination, Gould noted, particularly given the conservative makeup of the supreme court, should it hear the case. Butin the mean time, the removal will “paralyze the board and put the board adjudicatively out of business”, he said, “which is exactly what Mr Trump and his allies would want, because it promotes the democracy for workers, and they don’t want that”.A White House official said: “These were far-left appointees with radical records of upending longstanding labor law, and they have no place as senior appointees in the Trump administration, which was given a mandate by the American people to undo the radical policies they created.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpLaw (US)US politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Ethics expertswere also alarmed.Among Trump’s base, however, a similar backlash – smaller, more muted, but similarly anguished – has been taking hold.After a brief bubble as speculators raced to buy them, both Trump coins havemostlyplummetedin value. Within the online Maga community – which has a certain degree of overlap with crypto enthusiasts – some feel betrayed by the president’s embrace of what some conservatives view as little better than a penny-stock pump-and-dump scam.‘Trump’s grifting tendencies’: how the president’s crypto ties could spur corruptionRead moreTrump, who in 2021saidbitcoin “seems like a scam”, has since flipped on the issue. He was widely expected to be a “pro-crypto” president, with the crypto sector hoping he would be a broadminded sheriff who would grant their financial frontier new legitimacy; instead he embarrassed them by initiating a gold-rush on meme coins, considered the riskiest and least reputable form of mainstream cryptocurrency.Unlike traditional crypto-currencies that are “mined” and used in a blockchain, meme coins cannot be used as electronic currency and are generally regarded as having no enduring value. They are “minted” toexploit a viral moment.“Now, on the cusp of getting some liberalization of crypto regulations in this country, the main thing people are thinking about crypto is, ‘Oh, it’s just a casino for these meme coins,’” Nic Carter, a Trump supporter and cryptocurrency investor,toldthe New York Post. “It does the opposite of validating us, it makes it look completely unserious.”Similarly, keyboard Maga warriors who hoped that Trump would stick up for the American little guy are bitterly disappointed that he endorsed a financial scheme that immediately took little guys for a ride.The new president claimed his coin would “celebrate everything we stand for: WINNING!”, but not everyone seems persuaded.“I wish Trump was more tempered on this,” someone on a conservative Reddit forumdespairedafter Trump’s coin debuted. “He owns casinos and knows the addiction of gambling.” Another argued that meme coins prey “on the poor and most desperate”.“Can anyone make a cogent argument in favor of this?” one posterasked. Few did. “This is bad, and looks bad,” one person said.Others called the Trump token “degrad[ing] to the office of the Presidency”, “a lame money grab”, “a bad idea with a million ways to go wrong and derail his second term”, “shady”, and “kinda gross”. Another added, “This crypto is the most blatant ponzi scheme in history and we are the marks.”One conservative wrote that their litmus test was “if Biden pulled this shit, how would I feel? … I can’t imagine any other president doing this”.“The GOP has to find someone better for 2028,” someone said – a sentiment that was surprisingly common. “I want a real man like Vance to run this,” someone elsesaid.After a meme coin named IVANKA launched last week, Ivanka Trump was forced to clarify that she had no relationship with the venture, andcondemnedit as “being promoted without my consent or approval”. She said the coin “risks deceiving consumers and defrauding them of their hard-earned money”, an argument that some crypto critics might say applies to all meme coins, including Trump and Melania’s official tokens.The famously conservative Wall Street Journal editorial board, influential in conservative circles, ran an editorialcriticizingTrump’s turn as a crypto impresario. The piece noted a litany of legal, ethical and political problems with meme coins, “vehicles for speculation” that could open Trump to civil and criminal liabilities or be used by foreign adversaries to curry influence. “No careful President would get anywhere near this kind of political risk, and we can’t recall any President who has.”Trump Media announces plans to expand into cryptoRead moreThe Trump token’s website contains a disclaimer noting that the tokens are “not intended to be, or to be the subject of, an investment opportunity, investment contract, or security of any type”, though that language probably does not bear much relation with how the average investor views a meme coin.Undeterred, Trump’s wider business empire is stepping further into this space. On Tuesday, the Trump Media and Technology Group, which operates Trump’s social media platform Truth Social,announcedthe launch of a financial technology brand called “Truth.Fi”, through which the company plans to invest up to $250m in crypto-currencies and “crypto securities”, and other investment accounts.Ethics experts have widelycondemnedTrump’s coin as creating serious and unprecedented conflicts of interest or as one conservative on Redditbegs: “Please please please Mr. President. Don’t get involved with crypto.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpCryptocurrenciesFar right (US)RepublicansUS politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

Trump also threatenedChina with a 10% tariffunless its stops fentanyl shipments, while he maintained his longer-term threat of a 60% tariff on Chinese goods.“It’s inconceivable that other countries won’t retaliate,” said Stiglitz, who was chairman of Bill Clinton’s council of economic advisers. “Even if some of the governments might not want to retaliate, their citizens will demand that you can’t allow yourself to be beaten up. When you make like a gorilla thumping on his chest, are countries just going to say, ‘Are we chopped liver?’ Their politics will demand that they do something.”The tariffs, tensions and fears of retaliation and a trade war will probably cause many businesses to reduce their planned investments, and that, economists say, will hurt economies worldwide.Marcus Noland, executive vice-president of the Peterson Institute for InternationalEconomics, said: “The impact of imposing these tariffs,” will “have the effect of depressing US economic growth, contributing to a higher rate of inflation, and those effects will be worse if the other countries retaliate in kind”.Trump insists that his aggressive trade policies will be a win-win for Americans. On inauguration day, the White House issued his“America First Trade Policy” memo, saying: “I am establishing a robust and reinvigorated trade policy that promotes investment and productivity, enhances our nation’s industrial and technological advantages, defends our economic and national security, and–above all–benefits American workers, manufacturers, farmers, ranchers, entrepreneurs and businesses.”But many economists say this is wishful thinking, predicting that, if implemented, Trump’s tariffs will injure many US manufacturers, farmers and workers. Jim Stanford, a prominent Canadian economist who was long the top economist for Canada’s auto workers’ union, warned that if Trump imposes 25% tariffs onCanada, it would badly damage the US and Canadian auto industries.“The Canadian and US auto industries have been intertwined for 60 years,” Stanford said. “What happens if they put a 25% tariff on all the auto parts and products coming from Canada andMexico? Some auto parts cross the border eight times before they’re put in the final vehicle.” For instance, some basic steel might be shipped from Mexico to the US, where it is molded into a carburetor part and then that piece is shipped to Canada where the carburetor is produced before being shipped to Mexico to be installed during final assembly after which the car is ultimately sold in the US.“The tariffs would apply each time parts cross the border,” Stanford said. “That 25% would be compounded on each step. The impact on costs would be astounding.”Stanford said it was wrong for Trump to suggest that Canada and its automakers would pay for those 25% tariffs. “By and large, that’s false. It’s clearly going to raise auto prices in America. It is Americans who will directly pay for it. There’s no doubt about that.”Economists note that one result of sizable tariffs is that consumers ultimately fork over more money to the government when they buy imports and that overall leaves consumers with less money to buy goods, and that hurts manufacturers and retailers.Noland, of the Peterson Institute, noted that Trump and other supporters of across-the-board tariffs “claim it will aid industrial revitalization. What we found is it actually tends to have the opposite effect. It tends to damage the industrial sector by decreasing efficiency in production relative to other countries.”When Trump hitChinawith tariffs during his first term in office, China retaliated in particular against US agricultural exports, hurting American farmers. Noland predicted that if Trump again slaps tariffs on China, farmers would again get hit by retaliation.Eswar Prasad, a Cornell University expert on trade policy, warned that Trump’s tariffs will have additional undesirable effects. “US exporters will face a particularly tough time, as they are likely to face rising tariff barriers in their foreign markets,” Prasad said. “In addition, tariffs are likely to drive up the dollar and reduce the competitiveness of their exports in global markets.”He added that the looming threat of tariffs and the unpredictability of what they will be is “fomenting enormous uncertainty in the global business environment, which is harmful for business investment and job creation”.Stiglitz sees another worrisome downside to Trump’s tariff plans and the likely retaliation against the US. When central bankers see inflation climbing due to tariffs, “central banks will raise interest rates,” Stiglitz said. “That has a chance of leading to the worst of possible outcomes – interest rates going up with stagflation, interest rates going up in the face of a weak economy.”In some ways, Stiglitz explained, this would prove counterproductive to one of Trump’s goals for tariffs: to have them help pay for “Trump’s tax cuts for billionaires”. “If growth slows down, tax revenues will slow down,” he said.David Seif, Nomura’s chief economist for developed markets, said several Trump policies, including tax cuts and reduced regulations, could help offset tariffs’ harmful effects on economic growth. But because of Trump’s tariffs, he said, “there is likely to be higher inflation this year than there otherwise would be, and that might limit the Federal Reserve to a single rate cut this year.” That would undercut Trump’s hopes of getting the Fed to rapidly cut rates.Seif said theTrump administrationseems to be considering two waves of tariffs – a near-term wave, for instance, to get countries to slow the flow of immigrants and fentanyl to the US. Then he sees a longer-term wave of perhaps large, across-the-board tariffs aimed at generating revenue and strengthening US manufacturing.But economists warn that with the US near full employment – the jobless rate is just 4.1% – it could be hard to find enough workers to significantly expand the manufacturing sector, especially when many immigrant workers face deportation.Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive policy thinktank, said it was hard to predict what will happen on tariffs because “there is a kind of war going on in the Republican party between where the Maga folks are on trade and where the chamber of commerce is.”Owens said many people are asking, how do Trump’s tariff policies, which will probably result in higher costs for consumers, square with his promise to lower prices? She warned that tariffs will hit less affluent Americans hardest because they “spend a disproportionate amount of their income on consumption”.Owens noted that Trump advisers have talked up how tariffs will help US workers while also helping finance trillions in tax cuts for the rich. “If these tariffs are to pay for tax cuts for billionaires,” Owens asked, “doesn’t the supposed benefits that tariffs have for the working class get canceled out somewhat?”The Guardian is co-publishing this piece withthe Century FoundationExplore more on these topicsUS economyDonald TrumpUS politicsEconomicsTrump administrationCanadaMexicoanalysisShareReuse this content"

Those sports, meanwhile, are played in venues and uniforms plastered with the logos of yet more betting houses, airing on broadcasts that sprinkle in mentions of gambling sponsors.The experience on sports podcasts and websites and apps is much the same. But why? As the biggest event on theUS sportscalendar – the Super Bowl – approaches, how did we get to a place where sports have been reduced to a kind of raw material to be refined and packaged into the real product: the no-sweat, profit-boosted, five-leg, in-game parlay bonus bet?The answer is simple: because the mushrooming sports betting industry has converted an advertising blitz – pegged at more thana billion dollarsa year from 2021 through 2023 by the American Gaming Association – into a highly effective machine for drawing and keeping customers, particularly young men. As one addiction expert says: “Gambling offers the false promise of spectacular success. The psyche of young men has not changed. But every societal touchstone is promoting gambling expansion.”Fanduel network shows an industry bought and paid for by gamblingRead moreIn 2018, the US supreme court overturned a federal law that banned states from legalizing sports betting – with Nevada grandfathered in. Thirty-eight states rushed to allow sports gambling in a half-blind pursuit of the attendant tax revenues. At the same time, 30 of them also permitted mobile and online gambling. Last year, Americans wagered about $150bn on sports, up 23% from 2023 and more than 50% from 2022. The sports betting handle in 2023 was more than $1,000 per capita in seven different states.At the same time, totalbankruptcies haveclimbed by as much as 30% in the states where sports betting is newly legal. Calls to problem gambling hotlines are soaring. And Gamblers Anonymous meetingsare seeingan influx of young, male attendees, who are disproportionately affected.Somewhere between 60 and 80% of high school students reported having gambled in the last year,the National Council on Problem Gambling reported in 2023.A studycommissioned by the NCAA found that 58% of 18-to-22-year-olds had bet on sports – although it should be said that in most states this is illegal before the age of 21. On college campuses, that number was 67%, and the betting happened at a higher frequency. While most people can limit gambling to a bit of occasional fun, medical journal the Lancet publisheda paperin November finding that 16.3% of adolescents worldwide who bet on sports developed a gambling addiction. (The Sports Betting Alliance, an industry group, pointed to studies conducted inMassachusetts,IndianaandConnecticutthat found the rate of problem gamblers across the population to be roughly between 1 and 2%.)It all amounts to aswelling problemas the way wewatch,experienceandengage withsports has been fundamentally altered by the betting bonanza.Normalization of a taboo“This is already a public health crisis,” says US representative Paul Tonko. “Of all the addictions, gambling has the highest potential for suicide attempts of any mental health disorder. When the US supreme court in 2018 gave the green light to states to allow for mobile sports gambling, they did that without consideration of the negative impacts that could be associated with it.”Tonko is the rare lawmaker in Washington DC with an appetite to take on the sports betting boom, introducing the SAFE Bet Act with US senator Richard Blumentha in September, which aims to create consumer protections around mobile sports gambling and curb advertising. “You have a very vulnerable audience that is being targeted,” Tonko says. “[The advertising for sports betting] really is designed to pull you in at a tender age, before you’re perhaps able to manage that risk assessment.”Over the course of an NBA or NHL broadcast, the viewer will see the logo of a betting company or hear some reference made to gambling 2.8 times per minute, according toa study.“ESPN is a 24-7 casino ad right now,” says Dr Timothy Fong, an addiction psychiatrist and the co-director of UCLA’sGamblingStudies Program. “The normalization has gone so deep, so fast. [Sports] gambling has gone so viral that it’s beyond normalization. It’s endemic.”Not all that long ago, legalized sports gambling anywhere in the US but Nevada was unthinkable. This message was shouted at the public most loudly by the very leagues that now swim in betting money. Which is to say that the gambling industry, such as it was then, had two hurdles to clear: the law and the zeitgeist. While placing a bet with a guy you knew was hardly uncommon, something about it felt illicit. It wasn’t the sort of thing you would want your mom to know about. By carpet-bombing our culture with ads, though, the sports betting industry polished its reputation, one ad at a time. How can something be wrong when it’s everywhere and seemingly everyone is doing it?Before long, everyonewasdoing it. If you were surrounded by young men, at any rate.Not the dough but the dopamine“The success of mobile, real-time gambling is coinciding with evolutions in technology and that’s a big part of it,” says Dr Stephen Shapiro, a sports management professor at the University of South Carolina who researches sports gambling and consumer behavior. “There would be so many more barriers to entry in the past. You would have to go to a sports book and bet in more of a seedy environment. A college-aged student would have been less likely to partake in it.” Whereas gambling used to be a solitary pursuit, young men now do it together as a bonding experience. Mobile betting is woven into the social fabric of dorm life.Mobile sports betting apps perform so well for their creators because they have been optimized to get users to gamble more and gamble faster, experts say. To chase the action, in the betting parlance. That’s why betting on games is no longer limited to a lone wager on the outcome, or a player’s performance over the course of the whole contest. Instead, it has been broken down into hundreds – sometimes thousands – of mini-bets on every last play and possibility, the in-game bets powered by the advanced metrics the leagues sell the betting companies.The psychology of sports betting apps is modeled on the slot machine, argues Dr Richard Daynard, a law professor at Northeastern University and the founder and president of its Public Health Advocacy Institute. The apps are designed to be played quickly and aggressively to trigger repeated hits of dopamine and, eventually, addiction. “This has nothing to do with ordinary sports betting,” Daynard says. “Until you had online sports betting, nobody had ever bet on whether the next pitch was going to be faster or slower than 95 mph. You’re betting on all these micro-propositions. It’s just an opportunity to push the button.”“Fast-food gambling is essentially what this is,” adds Fong. “Highly processed gambling, sanitized and synthesized by a computer that is exactly designed to hit the dopamine.”The AI-powered in-game bets appear and disappear so fast that it’s impossible for the user to work out whether the odds on them are worth the wager. If the art of successful sports gambling is spotting inefficiencies or outright errors in the betting lines, that edge is negated by the lightning-fast decision-making required for these bets. And that’s exactly the point, to accelerate the heedless users’ betting action and the mathematical probability that they will lose. The sharp betters, after all, know better than to touch those sorts of wagers.“Gambling addiction has nothing to do with money. It has to do with how the product makes you feel, the action, the anticipation,” says Dr Harry Levant, a gambling addiction therapist and the director of PHAI at Northeastern. “The light-up of the dopamine occurs in the anticipation of the result, not the actual result. What’s happened here is we’ve taken a known addictive product and we’ve come up with a way to market and distribute it to people at lightspeed. If you take a 22-year-old, whose risk-reward system of their brain is not formed until they’re 26, and you give them an addictive product, and you push it at them at light speed, you’re going to hurt them.”The smartphone, meanwhile, is itself built to function as a dopamine-delivery machine. It is the perfect device to exacerbate the gambler’s worst impulses. Smartphones are designed to keep you coming back to them, picking them up throughout the day and flicking through the same few apps for fresh dopamine hits from messages, content or games. Betting apps readily offer all of those. And once they have burrowed into your digital routine, they are hard to ignore. To the gambling addict, having betting apps on their phone is a little like an alcoholic taking up residence in the brewery, or a meth addict living inside his dealer’s lab.One of the biggest betting firms, FanDuel, denies that its app purposely dials up dopamine and points out that it is compliant with regulations. “FanDuel works in strict accordance with all laws and standards set forth by each state regulator,” a spokesperson said.The Responsible Online Gaming Association, which represents most of the major sports books including FanDuel and DraftKings, said in a statement that “All our operators’ mobile platforms feature responsible gaming tools, including deposit limits, time limits, wager limits, and time-out features, which allow users to set personal limits to help ensure their experience remains recreational.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He had noFanDuel account – Levant is a recovering gambling addict himself, after all – but within a few seconds and a few taps, he had downloaded the app and was a final click away from being able to bet on the next serve of a second-tier Challenger tennis tournament in Buenos Aires between two players he, and most everyone else, had never heard of. And then on the next serve and the next. “The human brain is not built to handle that level of constant action,” Levant says. “The product itself isn’t designed for recreational purposes. Why is that bet here right now? Why is there betting oneveryserve?”Because, as one FanDuel slogan puts it, the thing is to “Make every moment more.” Betting is marketed as a second-screen experience to augment the emotion of watching a game. You’re supposed to cherish even the so-called garbage time late in games when the outcome is almost certain, again per FanDuel, and invest in every last play.View image in fullscreenKnowledge of sports often gives gamblers the illusion of control.Photograph: Matt Slocum/APSkill v chanceAnother FanDuel motto: “Never waste a hunch.” The betting houses subtly suggest that skill and knowledge will inoculate you from risk. That if you know ball, you’re not really gambling.There seems to be a broad belief among sports betters that they aren’t merely gambling on the odds of something happening, like putting their chips on 22 black at the roulette table or telling the croupier to hit them with another card in blackjack. Rather, they believe that they are monetizing their innate knowledge and feel for a sport.An Australian studybacks this up, finding that young, male sports gamblers’ “knowledge, skill, and control reduced beliefs about risks and contributed to risky patterns of sports betting regardless of their individual risk or problem gambling status.”The reading of risk is also clouded by the special offers a sports betting company will ping to your phone whenever you haven’t placed a wager in a while.A different Australian studyfound that betting inducements gave young men a feel of greater control over betting outcomes. Yetanother studysuggested that those inducements produce riskier betting behavior.Still, they are hard to ignore when they blow up your phone. “People are stepping back [from mobile betting] because they’re hurting,” says Mark Gottlieb, executive director of the PHAI. “They know this is a struggle for them. And then they are provided with odds-boosts and deposit matches very aggressively through text-messaging, in-app messaging and emails. The technology is there for these platforms to recognize that certain customers are demonstrating potentially problem-gambling behaviors.”“These promotions are designed to keep you in action,” says Levant. “They’re doing what your neighborhood drug dealer does. They don’t want you to pause.”FanDueldenies this, pointing to wide-ranging efforts to prevent and help problem gamblers. “FanDuel and its parent company Flutter invested $100m in responsible gaming technology, advocacy and product development in 2024,” the spokesperson said.The cultureFong, the father of two sports-besotted teenaged boys, frets that the culture navigated by today’s young men only exacerbates the allure of mobile sports gambling. The podcasts they listen to and the influencers they take their cues from all echo the same message, Fong says. Namely, they have no worth if they aren’t getting rich quick and outsmarting their peers along the way. “Particularly young men go, ‘OK, I’ve been told I need to make spectacular success,’” says Fong. “You combine it with massive, massive advertising. All those forces are pointing towards that 18-to-24-year-old guy, tickling his dopamine circuits. Gambling offers the false promise of spectacular success. The psyche of young men has not changed. But every societal touchstone is promoting gambling expansion.”Yet once gambling tips over into addiction, the stigma remains pervasive. In fact, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders – the standard guideline for mental health – did not reclassify a gambling problem from an impulse-control disorder to an addictive disorder until 2013.What’s more, it is perhaps the easiest addiction to hide. “Unlike other addictions, there are no natural, visible warning signs,” says Levant. “You can’t drink $1,000 of vodka in one night. I can make a $1,000 bet right now and I’ll show no visible manifestation.”In a space where young men bond over their love and knowledge of sports, and betting has become central to this dynamic, being open about lost bets challenges their image of themselves and their status within the group. Until the money runs out and their problem becomes impossible to hide, they chase their losses and dig themselves into an ever deeper hole.After all, their phone is right there, in their pockets, promising a solution. It’s a more appealing prospect than admitting to their friends that they do not, in fact, know ball.Leander Schaerlaeckens is at work on a book about the United States men’s national soccer team, out in 2026.

Not so fast …The World Series champions have been accused of becoming baseball’s Manchester City, spending their way to success. But there are differencesTom DartFri 31 Jan 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 31 Jan 2025 08.10 ESTShareDeferred contracts were once baseball’s annual joke played on the New York Mets.They released veteran third baseman Bobby Bonilla after a dismal season in 1999. But rather than pay the $5.9m left on his contract as a lump sum, the club offered a 25-year deferred deal at a munificent 8% interest rate.Bonilla retired in 2001. Since 2011 he has picked up an annual cheque from the Mets for nearly $1.2m, as he will through to 2035, the year he turns 72. The notoriety of this ludicrous arrangement may help explain why deferred deals have since been used sparingly in Major League Baseball. But theLos Angeles Dodgersare making the strategy famous again.Shohei Ohtanideferredall but $20m of the 10-year, $700m deal he signed with the Dodgers before the 2024 season. The 30-year-old makes $2m a year until 2034 then $68m annually for a decade. It’s an exceptionally team-friendly arrangement for a megastar in his prime. And it’s far from the only time the Dodgers have deployed the win-now, pay-later strategy amid a staggering and controversial signing spree that is building them into baseball’s sole super-club, with a squad that’s America’s answer to European soccer’s galacticos.Ferocious, calm and deadly: why the Mets agreed to pay Juan Soto $765mRead moreIn the past five years Los Angeles have committed more than$1bn to eight playersin deferred salaries while also paying hefty signing bonuses and being among the league leaders in annual payroll in the here-and-now. Since cruising past the New York Yankees in last year’s World Series the Dodgers have strengthened their already-deep squad, with the reported signing of 37-year-old reliever Kirby Yates to a one-year, $13m contract taking their off-season spending tomore than $450m.Spring training does not begin until mid-February but rivals are already pessimistic, perhaps even panicked, about their prospects of stopping the Dodgers, who also won the World Series in 2020 and have topped the National League West division in11 of the past 12 seasons.Even MLB’smost valuable franchise, the Yankees – hardly impecunious and so dominant in the late 1990s and early 2000s that thethen-Boston Red Sox presidentnicknamed them the Evil Empire – appear to be throwing in the towel. “It’s difficult for most of us owners to be able to do the kinds of things that they’re doing,” club executive Hal Steinbrennergrumbled to the YES Networkthis week.In 2013 the Dodgers netted a 25-year, $8.35bn regional broadcast deal that hands them asignificant financial advantageover other teams in the league. They also enjoy by far the largestaverage attendancein MLB. Most important, though, is the determination of their owners to assemble the best possible roster despite MLB rules designed to hit the brakes on runaway spending to promote competitive balance.It’s not often you find billionaires so eager to pay a punitive tax rate. But at the end of January, one payroll tracker,Cot’s Baseball Contracts, projected the Dodgers’ 40-man 2025 payroll at $389m for the purposes of MLB’s “luxury tax”, which brings down the financial hammer on clubs that spend over $241m a year. Adding roughly $110m in penalties will take Los Angeles’ likely outlay this year to about $500m,ESPN reported.The Philadelphia Phillies ($308m), Yankees ($303m), Mets ($300m), Toronto Blue Jays ($254m) and San Diego Padres ($249m) are also poised to exceed the threshold, a year after arecord nine teamswent over the limit. At the other end of the scale, baseball’s cheapest club, the Miami Marlins, have a miserly estimated payroll of $84m. The Dodgers are set to pay more in tax penalties than at least five teams will spend on salaries.As the only North American major league without a salary cap,MLBis uniquely vulnerable to the climate of inequality that has taken hold in European soccer in recent decades, with a handful of big clubs dominating thanks to overwhelming financial superiority.When owners tried to institute a hard salary cap in 1994 players went on strike and the World Series was cancelled. Mindful of that calamity, today’s complex arrangement is a form of compromise, designed to create a climate where players can get rich, owners can keep a lid on costs and any team, more or less, can dream of postseason glory. The luxury tax – formally known as Competitive Balance Tax – was introduced in 1997, with the pot going towards player benefits and team revenue-sharing.But what if owners come along who don’t much care about cost controls or economic conventions? The former Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger coined the term “financial doping” to describe the way Chelsea spent their way to success in England in the mid-2000s thanks to the largesse of a billionaire owner, Roman Abramovich. While not illegal, Chelsea’s strategy, to Wenger, was unsporting because they were living beyond their “natural resources”.In the way that their blitz is upending baseball’s financial norms, the Dodgers’ tactics are “definitely the same thing,” says Raymond D Sauer, economics professor emeritus at Clemson University in South Carolina. “The Dodgers are clearly pushing the limits. The league has incentives to curtail it, pretty strong disincentives to overspend beyond a certain level … [But] if you’re willing to mortgage the future and spend now, that would have been a good strategy for most of the last couple of decades.” He elaborates: “They’re paying more than market for the best aggregation of talent on a club. It doesn’t mean they’re going to win the World Series but it means they get a much better chance.”View image in fullscreenMuch of Shohei Ohtani’s huge contract has been deferred, giving the Dodgers more flexibility to spend now.Photograph: Chung Sung-Jun/Getty ImagesSuch a large deferral ostensibly reduces Ohtani’s earnings, since inflation means that a dollar today will be worth less in the future, but the ultimate value of the deal to him willdepend on the tax regimeof wherever he’s living when the big bucks arrive. It has disturbed some California lawmakers: onestate senatorproposed changing the tax laws, arguing that the structure will potentially allow the Japanese slugger and pitcher to avoid $90m in state taxes.Crucially for the Dodgers, it helps their cashflow and luxury tax obligations in the present, giving them more flexibility to add to their roster, though theycan’t fully evade the tax– Ohtani’s salary counts as $46m a year for its purposes – and must put much of the deferred money in low-risk liquid accounts, a rule intended to ensure teams can pay future bills.“There are times where that deal lines up in a more straightforward way, there’s times where it’s less straightforward. Including deferrals helps as a lever to find that overlap,” Dodgers president of baseball operations Andrew Friedmantold reporters in December.“It’s been a useful tool for us. But we have no hard-and-fast rule. We just like to get deals done.”While the Dodgers are on the hook for more than $1bn between 2028 and 2046, the next-biggest deferrers, the Mets, owe $137m down the line, the Red Sox $131m and no other team more than $50m, according toSpotrac figures cited by ESPN.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s reasonable to think the Dodgers are a little wiser: they are controlled by Guggenheim Baseball Management, an investment group led by Mark Walter, a billionaire financial asset manager. They bought the Dodgers in 2012 for $2.15bn, almost doubling thethen-record pricefor a North American franchise. Some economists felt they hadoverpaid wildly. But the Dodgers’ value has probablytrebledand success only adds to the asset’s worth.Their appealing location and winning reputation also gives the Dodgers an edge when competing for widely affordable free agents such as the Japanese pitcher Roki Sasaki. He chose them ahead of the Padres and Blue Jays, whoreportedly offered him more money. But Sasaki called the Dodgers’ array of talents“incredible”.That said, Walter and his fellow Dodgers owner, Todd Boehly, are also co-owners of Chelsea, acquired from Abramovich in 2022. Chelsea have spent about $1.3bn on transfers in the Boehly era yet are presently sixth in the Premier League table, level on points with Bournemouth, one of the division’slowest spenders. Is that a warning for LA?Sauer points out that baseball’s playoffs add uncertainty. It wouldn’t be a surprise if the Dodgers break the Seattle Mariners’ modern-day record of 116 wins in a 162-game regular season, set in 2001. But the Mariners didn’t even reach the World Series that year, losing to the 95-win Yankees. Indeed, the team with the best regular-season record usuallydon’t win the World Series.Among American major leagues, baseball is “the most similar” to European soccer in its structural enabling of inequality, Sauer says, “but we turn the championship into a cup competition… So that randomises the outcomes a little bit more than you have in leagues like the Premier League or La Liga.”The unheralded Arizona Diamondbacks ousted the Dodgers in the 2023 postseason before losing the World Series to another unlikely contender, the Texas Rangers. Texas and Arizona did not even reach the playoffs in 2022 or 2024. “Once you get to the postseason, anything can happen,” Steinbrenner told YES. “We’ve seen that time and time again. We’ll see who’s there at the end.”The Yankees are among a handful of teams deep-pocketed enough to challenge the Dodgers if ownership chooses to flash the cash, but there remain cheaper routes to glory, such as developing young players and unearthing hidden gems from untapped markets – although, as it happens, the Dodgersare pretty good at that too.The Houston Astros won their first World Series in 2017, beating the Dodgers in a triumph later tarnished by a sign-stealing scandal. All the same, the Astros assembled a very talented side for roughlyhalf the priceof the Dodgers’ roster, in part because of an extensive Latin American scouting network that helped them find prospects such as Venezuela’s Jose Altuve.“The approach with Houston was more grassroots, it was going to players, families, trainers and going to the fields, going to the homes and one by one … spending time to explain our commitment to the player and to the market, and our commitment to develop the player to his full potential,” says Oz Ocampo, the former Astros international director and former Marlins assistant general manager. “We focused mostly on the Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Cuba and Mexico.”Baseball’s wealthiest owners may become targets of fan ire for a perceived lack of ambition compared to Los Angeles. But it could suit them for the Dodgers to be outliers, the new Evil Empire, if growing resentment can be channeled into greater restrictions. Were the Dodgers to retain the World Series this year and next while continuing to outspend and out-defer everyone else, becoming the first team to win three in a row since the 1998-2000 Yankees, it’s possible that MLB, worried that predictability hurts profitability, will feel compelled to act with the goal of maintaining competitive balance. The current collective bargaining agreement expires after the 2026 season.“I think a hard salary cap would be challenging just given the history of labour negotiations to this point,” says Ocampo, now a global sports professor at Rice University in Houston. “Competitive balance is something that has been a priority for MLB and something that has in part driven a lot of the collective bargaining agreements over the years,” he adds. “You could see MLB and the players’ association trying to get to an agreement that allows for that competitive balance to remain one of the priorities.”Owners who are less inclined to spend than the Dodgers would love a salary cap. “The owners will try again, I’m sure, if they have a chance,” Sauer says. “A ‘three-peat’ by the Dodgers – if we get that you might see some negative reaction and the owners trying to capitalise on that negative public sentiment to put more stringent restraints on the market.” And that is a fight that could lead to a work stoppage placing the 2027 season in jeopardy.

On a five-a-side pitch at the top of one of the city’s many inclines, a group of determined girls are being put through their paces by a coach from Albion in the Community. They’re running hard, working through passing exercises, keeping warm. And at the side of the pitch is the Premier League’s chief executive, Richard Masters, standing under an umbrella looking happy.Masters describes the community and social programmes his competition supports as “the other half of the Premier League”. His trip to Brighton commemorates the beginning of a process that will anoint 100 “community captains”, celebrating the work of individuals in clubs up and down the football pyramid. He says: “I’ve always said if other stuff might be getting you down and you need an injection of enthusiasm, just go to a community programme and you’ll feel better about what you’re involved in.”Since taking the top job at the world’s biggest domestic football league in 2019, Masters will have likely needed the odd injection. Called “The Master of Corruption” by one Everton banner aggrieved at the club’s profitability and sustainability punishments, he is also regularly labelled as a puppet, either of the so-called big six, or maybe the red cartel, or the collection of clubs that feature on the mobile hoarding regularly parked outside Premier League shareholder meetings reading “Richard’s Masters”. He is the face of opposition tothe football regulatorand the man who puts noses out of joint when he doesn’t congratulate Erling Haaland on getting a new contract. He gets it in the neck most days.How Bournemouth became the Premier League’s latest model clubRead morePerhaps not unsurprisingly, therefore, he feels the Premier League’s work in the community does not receive the credit it deserves. “I think that Premier League football is part of British culture,” Masters says. “It doesn’t define it, but it’s part of it. There are more than 6,000 people employed by community foundations across the country, the Primary Stars [educational] programme is active in 19,000 schools. So yes, I do think we’re culturally relevant.”He also stands by the social values the league looks to articulate across the season. No Room for Racism, Rainbow Laces, the mental health campaign Inside Matters – all share a thread of inclusion, and the league’s support for equality and diversity comes at a time when such values are under direct attack from politicians. “The message that football is for everyone is non- negotiable,” says Masters, who rejects any claims of politicising sport. “I would just ask the question: ‘To what extent is making clear statements about discrimination, about racism, political?’ I don’t believe it is political. We are an apolitical, politically neutral organisation with multi-faith. Everybody is welcome. So to me these are not political statements.”This season the Rainbow Laces campaign was the subject of pushback from some players,including Manchester United’s Noussair Mazraouiand theIpswich captain Sam Morsy, who objected on religious grounds. Masters says the protest had “made us think about [the campaign] again” but not to change position. “It’s a very simple message of inclusion,” he says. “Everyone should feel like they are welcome at Premier League matches. It’s not enforced on players, it never has been, and to some extent it’s a shame that it’s been mildly politicised during that period. So whether it’s that message or another message we’ll continue to make sure that the LGBTQ+ community know that they’re welcome at Premier League football matches and Premier League grounds, whether that’s on the pitch, in the stands or in the employment chains.”View image in fullscreenA Kicks session at Brighton’s Manor Gym – Richard Masters says such community and social programmes are ‘the other half of the Premier League’.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianMasters says the modern Premier League is “four things together”. Not only “a fantastic football competition, it’s also an amazing story of soft power around the world, of inward investment and community social impact [which] make it unique. I can’t think of anyone else or anything else that does it in quite the same way. Of course we’re immensely proud of that and we’d like to keep all four of those things spinning at the same time in a positive direction.”The task of spinning plates usually ends with at least one smashing to the floor, and Masters does acknowledge some tensions between his four pillars. Such as the increase in ticket pricing which has caused outrage and organisation among match-going fans. Masters cites stats that show average ticket prices across the league are £39, and the £30 away ticket rule. However, with season tickets going up and concessions under threat he acknowledges clubs have work to do. “So our clubs, in my view, fully understand their fanbase,” he says. “We are 99% sold out at matches, that is a great thing and our clubs know the value of that. I think they will get it right in the end and ensure that football remains affordable to a broad cross-section of people.”As for the regulator, Masters remains unwaveringly sceptical, suspicious of mission creep and the throttling of the jeopardy he says is the key ingredient behind the Premier League’s success. “The essential theory is that in the interest of trying to do good in football, the regulator may come in and affect that ability to invest, that ability to inspire and the ability to deliver jeopardy,” he says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Whilst we have got the same name scratched on the trophy, it’s incredibly competitive still to win the Premier League. We’re not blind to long-term trends, and we do understand that we have a responsibility to the rest of the pyramid.”Masters has clearly grown into his role, more confident and relaxed than the man who had to hold the tiller as football was thrown around by the crises of Covid. Read between the lines of some of his remarks and there also appears to be more flexibility than previously. There are bigger challenges to come, Manchester City’s 130 charges foremost among them, a topic Masters says he doesn’t want to discuss. It’s an unrelenting job but one that has its benefits, and sometimes they can be found as the rain bounces off the astroturf.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueFootball politicsSport politicsFootball ticket pricesinterviewsShareReuse this content"

City will host the first leg on 11 February before travelling to the Bernabéu on 19 February.Champions League playoffs: Manchester City to face Madrid, Celtic land BayernRead moreIt is the fourth successive season that Guardiola’s side have drawn the 15-timeChampions Leaguewinners. City, who are preparing to face Arsenal in the Premier League on Sunday, also play Newcastle, Liverpool, Tottenham and Leyton Orient in the FA Cup to make it seven games in 24 days.“The schedule is what it is,” said Guardiola. “In the Premier League everyone has to play everyone but what normally happens is we have tougher schedules for the [Premier League] teams in Europe. It’s tough playing against Real Madrid, the problem is in the middle playing Newcastle.” He sarcastically added: “They are always so kind with the calendar, for many years it always happened that way.”Guardiola has previously argued English teams that compete in Europe should be afforded extra days’ rest by the domestic fixture schedulers. Now in his ninth season at City, he wearily accepts that is unlikely to happen.“Are you asking me that question? Come on, don’t make me say something impolite,” Guardiola said in response to a further question about the fixture list. “I’m not complaining because we’ve had incredible success with this calendar. We accept it. We won the treble and the quadruple doing it like this. We survive and if we don’t survive it’s because the opponents are better.“When I was training at Barcelona I followed the Premier League – because it’s the most attractive league in the world – and Sir Alex Ferguson, José Mourinho, Arsène Wenger made the same complaints. It’s been this way for nine years. Do you think it’s going to change? The broadcasters decide, they don’t ask me.“They play on Friday before the Champions League in Portugal and France, to have one more day [rest]. It’s not a problem, it’s fine. No surprises when we see the calendar. The schedule we have in February we’ve had in previous seasons many times.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The draw could be nicer, yes. Real Madrid is extremely difficult and we’re going to play with a two or three-day recovery.

The 35-year-old Northern Irishman found the cup with a sand wedge on the par-three 15th hole at Spyglass Hill Golf Course and will now head into Friday’s second round two shots behind leader Russell Henley.The hole-in-one marked the second career ace for McIlroy, who made his first during the 2023 Travelers Championship.“It’s such an elevated tee that the ball’s in the air and you know it’s on line but you don’t know whether to say, ‘Go!’ or ‘Sit!’ or ‘Spin,’ or ‘Release’,” McIlroy said. “You’re looking at it and you’re watching where it might land on the green and the thing just disappears. It was a good swing, a good wedge shot and it was obviously a nice little moment.”McIlroy’s was not the day’s only hole-in-one. Irishman Shane Lowry landed one of his own on the famous par-three seventh at Pebble Beach, with the ball landing short of the pin and rolling in. Lowry used social media site X to call it the “shot of my dreams”.Henley made birdie on his final two holes to end the day at the top of the leaderboard, with his eight-under 64 at Spyglass Hill putting him one ahead of six others including England’s Justin Rose.The tournament also marked the return of Scottie Scheffler, who missed a month of the Tour after a freak kitchen accident over Christmas. The American recovered from an early bogey for a round of 67 and a share of 15th place.Explore more on these topicsGolfRory McIlroyUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

You provide a platform to a lot of dumb and ignorant people.”Mitchell, who competes in the featherweight division of MMA’s largest promotion, made the comments on the first episode of his ArkanSanity Podcast, where he suggested that Hitler was a “good guy” who “fought for his country”.“Here’s what I say about [Elon Musk] heiling Hitler, heiling the Nazis: I really don’t think that he was, because I honestly think that Hitler was a good guy based upon my own research, not my public education indoctrination,” Mitchell said.He added: “I really do think before Hitler got on meth, he was a guy I’d go fishing with. He fought for his country. He wanted to purify it by kicking the greedy Jews out, that were destroying his country and turning them all into gays. They were gaying out the kids. They were queering out the women. They were queering out the dudes. Do you know where the first tranny surgery ever was? Happened to be in Germany before Hitler took over.”Despite views White described as “dumb and ignorant”, the longtime UFC head defended Mitchell’s right to express them.“It’s free speech,” White said. “That’s the beautiful thing about this business, for all of you who hate Bryce Mitchell, you get to see him hopefully get his ass whooped on global television.”Explore more on these topicsUFCMMAUS sportsShareReuse this content"

It is interesting that four of Forest’s past five – and five of their past eight – Premier League games rank in their bottom eight of the season on pass completion. “We have to perform much better,” he said. “We have to be more solid and play better football. We have so many things to improve.” Though results in that period, at least until last week, continued to be good they have relied on statistically unlikely displays of finishing prowess. Before their trip to Bournemouth, Forest had scored with nine of their previous 12 shots on target in all competitions and the last time a Chris Wood shot on target failed to go in was before Christmas. Both Nuno and Fabian Hürzeler were sent off for misconduct duringa rancorous conclusion to the fixturebetween these sides at the Amex Stadium last September.Simon BurntonNottingham Forest v Brighton, Saturday 12.30pm (all times GMT)2Eyes on the spots at BournemouthDarren England has never taken charge of a senior Liverpool game, and has been kept away from the club entirely since he, as VAR,was key in the calamitous decisionto disallow a Luis Díaz goal against Tottenham last season (the assistant VAR in that game, Dan Cook, will have the same role here). England is being gradually reintroduced to the Reds – he was fourth official for Liverpool’s trip to Wolves in September – but is still not being let anywhere near Anfield. This will be a test of England’s nerve, should any member of the home team go down in their opponents’ penalty area. Having awarded only one penalty in the Premier League this season (only one referee, Michael Salisbury, has given none), this game between the league’s leading penalty-winners – Bournemouth have been awarded seven this season, scoring six; Liverpool have scored all of their five – could be a particular test. Bournemouth have already beaten three of the current top four at home this season, and are looking to complete a very impressive set.SBBournemouth v Liverpool, Saturday 3pmView image in fullscreenIllia Zabarnyi (left) with Dean Huijsen during Bournemouth training this week. Both have excelled in the Cherries’ rise.Photograph: Robin Jones/AFC Bournemouth/Getty Images3Everton hit by injuries for crunch gameSean Dyche registered three Premier League wins in five months and 19 games before being sacked as Everton manager. David Moyes can equal his predecessor’s tally in 14 days, and from four games, with victory over Leicester. As Dyche knew only too well, however, obstacles often emerge when Everton attempt to build momentum. Thevaluable away win at Brightoncame at the cost of losing Orel Mangala for the rest of the season with an ACL injury, and Dominic Calvert-Lewin for several weeks with a hamstring problem. Both had responded brightly to Moyes’ arrival and leave holes that need filling before Monday’s transfer deadline. Beto is Everton’s only fit striker and must seize the opportunity presented by Calvert-Lewin’s absence if he is to have a long-term future at Goodison Park. A meeting of two teams hovering just above the relegation zone should be tense but Moyes’ impact, and Leicester’s comeback to end a run of seven successive league defeatsat Tottenham last weekend, may liberate players for a game of huge significance.Andy HunterEverton v Leicester, Saturday 3pm4Ipswich enter potentially decisive runGoing into this weekend no team have played more games against top-half sides than Ipswich and Wolves, 14 of whose 23 fixtures have been against the division’s better teams (Fulham have played the fewest, with nine). But while Wolves’ next few games are also against teams from the top 10, four of Ipswich’s next five are against other members of the bottom half, including Tottenham andManchester United. If they are going to push up the table this would seem the time, especially starting at home against the bottomest of them all. Of course, a game against the team above them, one of only four that they have taken points off this season, also presents an opportunity for Southampton. “We need some positive situation. I think if we win against Ipswich, it will be huge for us,” said Ivan Juric, predicting it would infuse them with “lots of confidence, and then we can do good things”. Saints are surely running out of straws to clutch, and this fixture may reveal whether any rising desperation serves as inspiration or distraction.SBIpswich vSouthampton, Saturday 3pmView image in fullscreenThe Ipswich manager, Kieran McKenna, faces a vital spell for his side.Photograph: Mark Leech/Offside/Getty Images5Tonali eyed to steady fickle MagpiesNewcastle can be a chameleon side and, as they prepare to host Fulham on Saturday, no one is quite sure of their true colours. Might we see the irrepressible team that recently completed a nine-match winning run, or the ensemble that surrendered4-1 to Bournemouthin their most recent home game? One thing is clear: Newcastle invariably play well when Sandro Tonali excels deep in central midfield. Although Tonali remained one of Eddie Howe’s better players against Bournemouth, Andoni Iraola’s side succeeded where others have failed in restricting the Italy midfielder’s room for manoeuvre and cutting the supply line to Alexander Isak. Can Fulham do likewise in a pivotal month for Newcastle? Howe’s side have Premier League games at Manchester City and Liverpool and at home to Nottingham Forest, in addition to Wednesday’s Carabao Cup semi-final second leg at home to Arsenal.Louise TaylorNewcastle vFulham, Saturday 3pm6Pereira keen to strengthen Wolves packLast weekend, Wolves’ slender defeat at home to Arsenal proved a sapping experience and then Leicester’s shock win at Tottenham pushed Vítor Pereira’s side back into the relegation zone. The manager cut a relaxed figure at Molineux despite a third successive loss but wants reinforcements before Monday’s transfer deadline. Wolves’ sporting director, Matt Hobbs, has stressed the importance of being efficient this month but with time ticking the defender Emmanuel Agbadou – a £16.6m buy from Reims – is their only new face. Talks for another centre-back, Lens’ Kevin Danso, have stalled and Wolves require additions in all departments, with the Dynamo Kyiv and Ukraine midfielder Volodymyr Brazhko a target. Pereira is also keen on signing a forward, with Jørgen Strand Larsen sidelined with a hamstring injury. With 15 games to go, the first at home toAston Villa, it does not feel an overstatement to suggest the next few days could define their season.Ben Fisherskip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The question is whether that has done any damage to the swagger with which they until recently went into home fixtures. There is the potential for aLads-it’s-Tottenhameffect on Sunday, given the visitors’ haul of seven points from their past 11 games (precisely half of Brentford’s tally in the same period). The inevitable attention on Ange Postecoglou will distract from that on Brentford’s Yoane Wissa, the subject of considerable transfer buzz this month and linked with a move to Spurs this week, who has missed the last two games between these sides.SBBrentford v Tottenham, Sunday 2pmView image in fullscreenBryan Mbeumo (left) and Yoane Wissa have had eyes on them from other clubs during January.Photograph: Pedro Porru/SPP/Shutterstock8Transfer clock ticks for exiled RashfordJanuary’s episode of The Trials and Tribulations of Ruben Amorim has been dominated byMarcus Rashford’s futureand whether the forward will leave Manchester United on loan. Meanwhile the head coach has to win games, a demand that would be easier if, as he said on Wednesday, he could use the forward’s pacy “one-on-one” smarts. But no. Rashford remains unlikely to be in the squad for the visit of a Crystal Palace side that have lost only one of their past seven games. The reverse did come in their last outing – 2-1 to Brentford. With Rashford in exile, Amad Diallo’s verve and speed is United’s best hope of securing a second Premier League win in a row for the first time in this troubled campaign.Jamie JacksonManchester United vCrystal Palace, Sunday 2pmView image in fullscreenMarcus Rashford remains out in the cold for United.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/Reuters9Arteta keen to ‘humble’ former employersA lot has changed since Arsenal and Manchester City last locked horns in a bad-tempered clash in September, with things not exactly going to plan for either Mikel Arteta or Pep Guardiola since. But with his side on a four-game unbeaten run against their former title rivals, and six points clear of them as they attempt to chase down the leaders, Liverpool, Arteta can extend the gap even further on Sunday at the Emirates. Arsenal caused City’s defence lots of problems from set pieces in the2-2 drawearlier in the season. They went ahead after Gabriel Magalhães scored from a corner, only for John Stones to pop up with a late equaliser after Rodri was forced off with a serious knee injury. Erling Haaland had to be pulled away from Arteta at the full-time whistle after telling him to “stay humble,” and there will be no room for sentiment again as the Arsenal manager attempts to pile more misery on his former employers.Ed AaronsArsenal vManchester City, Sunday 4.30pm10Will Sánchez get another chance?Enzo Maresca has been defending Robert Sánchez but the goalkeeping situation at Chelsea is not sustainable. Sánchez has made five errors leading to a goal this season – a division high, putting the Spaniard level with Ipswich’s Arijanet Muric – and he waspoor against City last weekend. Erling Haaland could not believe it when Chelsea’s goalkeeper came hurtling out of his area to try to deal with a long ball from Ederson in the second half. The result was an easy goal for City and more difficult questions for Maresca to answer. It is not clear why Sánchez was chosen as his No 1, especially as he was behind Djordje Petrovic last season. Petrovic did well but is now on loan at Strasbourg. Sánchez did not convince under Mauricio Pochettino. Not much has changed. He was erratic then and is erratic now. Filip Jörgensen was signed last summer and has not had many opportunities in the league. Maresca must consider bringing him in against West Ham. Sánchez is clearly making his defenders nervous.Jacob SteinbergChelsea v West Ham, Monday 8pmPosTeamPGDPts1Liverpool2233532Arsenal2323473Nottm Forest236444Man City2317415Newcastle2314416Chelsea2315407AFC Bournemouth2315408Aston Villa23-1379Brighton2343410Fulham2333311Brentford2323112Man Utd23-42913Crystal Palace23-42714West Ham23-162715Tottenham Hotspur2392416Everton22-92317Leicester23-241718Wolverhampton23-201619Ipswich23-261620Southampton23-376Premier League top scorers: see who isleading the race.Comments on this piece will open on Friday morning.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTen things to look out for this weekendNottingham ForestBrighton & Hove AlbionBournemouthLiverpoolEvertonLeicester CityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Great news, on the other hand, for new 63-year-old wide forward Jorge Vital, now weighing up a number of offers from Serie A and Saudi Pro League clubs, and whom Manchester United are hopeful of shifting from the wage bill before the end of the transfer window.For this cash-strapped theatre of ghosts, trying to build its new cast of dreams on the bones of the old, perhaps every pound helps. Corporate box guests at Old Trafford no longer get a free match programme each and are instead invited to download the dictated thoughts of Amorim via a QR code. Free cereal bars for matchday stewards were cut at the beginning of the season. The annual £100 staff Christmas bonus was replaced by a £40 M&S voucher. Concessionary tickets for children and the senior citizens were temporarily withdrawn.This is Austerity United, after all, and we’re all theoretically in this together. Losses of £313m in the past three years have put the club on the brink of breaching profit and sustainability rules (PSR). According to the most recent accounts, they still owe £410m in outstanding transfer fees to other clubs. “If we do not act now,” the club wrote in a letter to fans last week, “we are in danger of … significantly impacting our ability to compete on the pitch.”Rashford has heart set on Barcelona but deal rests on exits from La Liga clubRead moreDoubtless it will not have escaped your attention that United’s ability to compete on the pitch has been significantly impacted for a while now, and for reasons only tangentially connected to finance. Or that many of the same people now mandating mass redundancies and ticket price rises also approved the£21.4m costof sacking Erik ten Hag and replacing him with Amorim. Or the total package of around £100m in fees and wages for the struggling Matthijs de Ligt. Or the cost ofhiring Dan Ashworth for five months. Still: got to get those cereal bars off the ledger.In the meantime, the fourth-richest club in the world is somehow sitting 12th in its own domestic league. What does it take to get this side back to, say, top-three level? Maybe seven new players – a goalkeeper, two wing-backs, a centre-half, another passing midfielder, a striker and another winger/No 10 to play behind the striker. Let’s also say you get lucky and a teenager like Ayden Heaven or Chido Obi-Martin makes the leap to the first team. So maybe you need six new signings who are available, would choose United over other clubs, and offer an immediate upgrade on what you already have.Even if you can find them, in the new age of parsimony you no longer have nine-figure sums lying around the place. So you also need to get rid of players you want to sell. Victor Lindelöf, Tyrell Malacia, Harry Maguire, Christian Eriksen, Casemiro and Antony could all be lost without too much heartache. But of course these are distressed assets unlikely to command much value in a crowded market. At which point you need to pull the other lever: getting rid of players you don’t want to sell.It is now eight months since Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo stalked the Wembley turf in golden sunshine, the two academy teenagers who hadjust won United the FA Cup. Now the club have made it clear they are prepared to listen to offers for both. Garnacho could even leave for Chelsea before the transfer deadline on Monday night, for a fee of between £50m and £60m. Mainoo – so impressive in a more advanced roleagainst FCSB on Thursday– looks to be staying, but will now know he too is expendable.View image in fullscreenRuben Amorim’s Manchester United side have lost six of their last 10 league games but won five of their last six in all competitions.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAPainted on the stairs at Carrington are the words “Youth, Courage, Success”. It is a reminder of the club’s heritage, the proud record ofmore than 4,000 consecutive gamesin which a United academy player has featured in the match-day squad. In the current climate, however, the slogan takes on a slightly different meaning. Revenue generated from selling academy products counts as “pure profit” under PSR. And for clubs with the courage to cut loose their best young players, youth can provide an entirely different route to success.The model United are seeking to emulate here is Chelsea, who for most of the past couple of decades have made little secret of the fact they regard their academy as a revenue farm, a place where talent is nurtured, fattened and sold on. In the past few years, as the new ownership consortium has skirted around breaking PSR, Cobham graduates like Conor Gallagher, Mason Mount, Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Callum Hudson-Odoi, Ian Maatsen, Lewis Hall and Billy Gilmour have all been profitably moved on. Three seasons ago under Thomas Tuchel, Chelsea gave 25% of their league minutes to academy graduates. This season, it’s just 12%, most of those to Levi Colwill.At the time Chelsea’s strategy generated a certain tension within the fanbase. For many local supporters with emotional ties to the region as well as the club the sale of academy products was almost a kind of betrayal: a severing of the link between the club and its roots. For most international fans, largely untethered by geography or history, this mattered less. What mattered more was the splendour of the current product, and if selling academy gems allowed them to invest more heavily in their replacements, then this was simply the nature of doing business.These days, with Chelsea challenging for the top three, you’d struggle to find many fans pining for the old pin-ups. Few Chelsea supporters would now swap out Moises Caicedo for Gallagher, or Cole Palmer for Mount. Perhaps this is the kind of collective amnesia United’s hierarchy are also banking on: that an increasingly globalised fanbase will prefer the endorphin rush of new signings over the pull of heritage. That like the stalwart Scott McTominay, sold to Napoli last summer, the respective services of Garnacho, Rashford, even Mainoo, will be mourned lightly, briefly and then not at all.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This week, a video emerged of United fans at Craven Cottage haranguing him over ticket prices. “We’re northerners, come on, mate,” one fan beseeches him. “Oh, come on,” Ratcliffe mutters as he winds his car window up, almost disgusted by the audacity of the attempt at kinship. Northerner, United fan, slash-and-burn capitalist … but not necessarily in that order!Perhaps it should not surprise anyone that a man so attached to north-west England that he lives in Monaco, so invested in the wider resonance of football that he has ordered big cuts to the club’s charitable foundation, should also regard the lineage and inheritance of the academy in such bleak, transactional terms. Manchester is just a word on a shirt, a handy gimmick, something to sell the tourists. And there are no people here, just product: cells on a spreadsheet that can be cut and copied at will.View image in fullscreenJim Ratcliffe (centre) has recently been harangued by fans over Manchester United’s ticket prices.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAA few months ago a photograph started doing the rounds online. It’s a screengrab from Google Street View, taken in Wythenshawe in 2009, showing an 11-year-old kid standing at the side of the road. He’s in his football kit, waiting for a lift to training at the United academy. We’re encouraged to think it’s Rashford.Certainly it would make a lovely story. But, of course, we don’t know for sure. The face is blurred out, the outline hazy. Taken out of context, it’s just a pile of red pixels. In reality it could be anybody, going anywhere.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedTransfer windowcommentShareReuse this content"

Haaland scored the first goal but City needed a late John Stones strike to rescue a point against a team they have not defeated in their past four meetings. Arsenal have finished as runners-up to City in the past two seasons and Ødegaard is expecting an extra edge to proceedings.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead more“It is normal when you play these big games that there is a big rivalry,” he said. “You are competing and you want to be the best. So that’s how it should be and there should be a little bit of heat sometimes. But then I think a lot of the players know each other from the national team – England, Brazil, me with Erling – so on the pitch and off the pitch it is a bit different. When we are on the pitch, then it’s a good battle.”Ødegaard, asked whether he had been surprised by Haaland’s outburst towards Arteta, said: “In football, games like this, the emotions are so high and the adrenaline is there and everything. So that’s something that can happen on the pitch and then when you walk off the pitch, then you are done with it. It is not something I think too much about. We are good friends. Him and a few of the other boys from the national team, we have a little group chat, so we stay in touch there and we speak every now and then. To be fair, not about football, just about random things. We haven’t spoken about the game, but he is a good friend.”Arsenal’s hopes of signing the Norway Under-21 midfielder Sverre Nypan in this window appear to be over after he decided to stay at Rosenborg until the summer. The 18-year-old has been compared to Ødegaard and also held talks with City’s sister club Girona and Aston Villa this week but has opted to defer a decision on his future.Arsenalare believed to be in talks with his representatives over a potential summer move.Creative responsibility will continue to fall on Ødegaard, who admitted his return of only one Premier League goal this season “hasn’t been good enough”. David Raya is a doubt to face City owing to a muscular injury that meant the goalkeeper sat out thevictory over Gironathat secured qualification for the last 16 of the Champions League.Arsenal are set to head for a warm-weather training camp in Dubai after the second leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final against Newcastle on Wednesday, and Ødegaard is hoping they can replicate their brilliant form of the second half of last season, when they dropped only five points from their last 18 matches.View image in fullscreenNeto played in goal for Arsenal against Girona because of David Raya’s injury and the Brazilian could face Manchester City.Photograph: David Price/Arsenal FC/Getty Images“We’re in a good position and we have to remember that,” he said. “But I feel like we have another gear to hit and it was the same last year. We really hit top form towards the end of the season. Hopefully we can do that again.”Ødegaard added: “When you’ve been so close, you get even more hungry, you get even more determination to do it, especially last year when we were there on the last day and really could feel it was that close. I feel the whole squad is ready now to push for it.“I have been dreaming about this since I was a young kid. To win one of the big trophies and especially the Premier League was always something special growing up so this would be the biggest dream. It’s what we work for every day and I think it’s important to stay in the moment and not look too far ahead. Just focus on the day by day and keep going and in the end hopefully we will be rewarded.”Explore more on these topicsArsenalManchester CitynewsShareReuse this content"

The initial fee is about £65m and represents a significant profit for Villa, who signed him from Chicago Fire for £18m.

Watkins reacted to scoring in Wednesday’s Champions League winagainst Celticby tapping the badge in celebration.“Yes, he is happy to stay,” Emery said. “You can ask him, but we asked him how he is feeling every day, every year he has been here with Aston Villa, with us and without us. We talked with him and he is very focused on the message we have. The commitment of Ollie Watkins with us is a huge commitment, he appreciates a lot how Aston Villa was always supporting him, helping him and when we joined him here two years ago, how we worked with him, always trying to get the best of him. Now we need him, like he needed Aston Villa.”The fee for Durán is the second biggest Villa have received behind the £100m Manchester City paid for Jack Grealish.Al-Nassrhave also made an improved offer of £75m for Kaoru Mitoma but had that rejected by Brighton and are set to give up on their hopes of signing the Japan winger.An initial £54.4m offer was rejected on Thursday by Brighton for the 27-year-old, who signed a new contract worth about £80,000 a week in October 2023 and will have two years on his deal at the end of the season. He is believed to be not interested in moving to Saudi Arabia at this stage of his career.Neymar has completed his return to Santos after leaving another Saudi Arabian club,Al-Hilal.

The former Bournemouth and Portsmouth midfielder was also responsible for players such as Justin Kluivert to the Vitality Stadium. He wasappointed Liverpool’s sporting directorby Michael Edwards, a friend from their time together at Fratton Park.How Bournemouth became the Premier League’s latest model clubRead moreLiverpool’s visit to Bournemouth on Saturday could be a significant moment in the title race and Slot, who rested nine senior players from Wednesday’s Champions Leaguetrip to PSV Eindhoven, says Hughes’s astute recruitment is largely responsible for the challenge his team faces. The Liverpool head coach, who was himself appointed by Hughes, said: “It’s one of the toughest games. They’ve shown already bybeating Arsenalthere andbeating Citythere. Theylost to Chelseabut missed a penalty, and have conceded only seven goals at home.“The second half [of Liverpool’s3-0 victory over Bournemouthin September] we played against them showed me they are a serious team. If you are 3-0 down and can keep competing and working that hard in the second half that tells you a lot about the mentality of the team. Combined with the quality they have – and Richard left that club in a very, very good place, not only with the quality of the players they have but because he hired a very good manager – then it’s no surprise to me that they are able to compete with every single team in the league.”Slot said he has tapped into Hughes’s knowledge of his former club in preparation for Liverpool’s visit but added: “He tells us what we are already seeing. It’s not that important if he tells me things I don’t know like whether a player is married and has children, that will not influence the game tomorrow. But he definitely sees the things we are seeing because of their playing style and the manager is the same. What I see he confirms is true.“They have a lot of quality, created by Richard. He hired a fantastic manager. Justin [Kluivert] is one of the many examples where Richard deserves a lot of credit. You need quality and that is what Richard brought there.”Slot, meanwhile, insisted it is no surprise that Saudi Arabia’s sports minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki al-Faisal,wants Mohamed Salah in the Saudi Pro League. “I would be surprised if there was anyone around the world saying: ‘We don’t want Mo Salah,’” the Dutchman said. “Everyone wants him – including us. We want him to extend [his contract], of course. That is clear but I am not surprised that Saudi wants him. I would not be surprised if other countries wanted him as well.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Perhaps the manager has been burned by what happened at the end of last season when he took issue with how many of them wanted Spurs to lose against Manchester City rather than win and help Arsenal towards the title.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead moreHowever, as Postecoglou again admitted, he had failed to bring unity to Spurs given the continuing enmity towards Levy and it is clear he would prefer not to have such a sideshow. Much better would be the type of support his young team heard on Thursday night in thehome win over Elfsborgin the Europa League, although there were still choruses of “Levy out”.“I’ve always felt when you are trying to build something successful, you need to be united,” Postecoglou said. “I have probably failed in trying to unify the club. Part of that is just because of the form we are in in the league, which allows people’s minds to go away from the here and now.“I thought the crowd were good [against Elfsborg]. They understood we had a young squad out there and they got genuinely excited towards the end of the game seeing the young boys. That’s what we’re trying to tap into because we’re going to need the support in this last phase of the season to hopefully create something special.“I have often said I can’t sit here and dictate to people what they should or shouldn’t do. My role is to try and create an environment where we are unified and we have to be unified. Particularly when you go through tough times, the last thing you want is splintering in our mindset and focus.”Postecoglou was asked whether he felt unity at the club was impossible given the dynamics between Levy and some fans, or if he was hopeful of it still becoming a reality. “It’s not that it can’t happen, it just makes it more difficult,” the manager said. “It’s not an unusual situation for me – I’ve faced it before at other clubs. Usually when you get things right on the field that gets everyone aligned again. All I can do is my utmost to get the team back on track in the league and give our supporters the priority of just enjoying our football team.”What Postecoglou wants from Levy before the closure of the transfer window on Monday night is a signing or two. He has been calling for action in the market for weeks and it was no different on Friday. Postecoglou needs a player for the front line and the club have indicated a readiness to pay €60m (£50m) for Bayern Munich’s Mathys Tel. The forward, though, has other offers and is not inclined to join Spurs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Romero has been out since early December with a thigh injury and Postecoglou said the situation was “tricky,” with no comeback date for the Argentina international. “It’s just a slower healer with him and it is one we are looking at on a week-to-week basis,” he said. Dragusin went off with a knee problem against Elfsborg and while there is no clarity on its severity, the concern is obvious.The Australian will be without nine injured players at Brentford but he reported that six of them – Guglielmo Vicario, Destiny Udogie, James Maddison, Brennan Johnson, Wilson Odobert and Timo Werner – should return to training in the week leading up to the visit of Manchester United on 16 February. Dominic Solanke is expected to be out until late February.Postecoglou talked about the United game as being “a point for us to relaunch our campaign”. As things stand, none of the injured players are likely to be available for Thursday’s Carabao Cup semi-final second leg at Liverpool or for the FA Cup fourth round tie at Aston Villa three days later. He hoped the situation was about to improve but added: “Every time I’ve seen the light at the end of the tunnel it’s usually been an oncoming train. We seem to be losing players as we get them back.”Explore more on these topicsAnge PostecoglouTottenham HotspurnewsShareReuse this content"

City have been contacted by the Guardian for a response.Transfer window verdict: how every WSL club fared in January | Tom GarryRead moreIt was the second time in just over 24 hours that Kelly had aired her disappointment at City, having posted a longer statement on social media on Wednesday night, accusing the club of dictating who she could and could not join.On Thursday, the 27-year-old wrote: “So disappointed to find out tonight that people at the club are briefing journalists against me if I am to sign at a club before the window shuts. They’ve called reporters to assassinate my character and tried to plant negative stories about me in the football media.”She added that any such allegations against her were false, before concluding: “To those responsible, I am disappointed in this. As I said in my previous statement, I just want to find happiness again.”City’s head coach, Gareth Taylor, was asked about the comments before Sunday’s home WSL game against Arsenal, for which Kelly will be ineligible. “I’d rather not go into specifics,” he said. “What I would say is, it’s been really disappointing [for it] to come to this, and the ending it transpired to.“I’ve always tried to represent the club in the right way, really dignified in the good moments, the difficult moments, and I certainly work for a club that has real integrity. It’s really disappointing. It’s been a challenging couple of days, for many people, not just for myself, but obviously a lot of people here at the club as well.“And we never like to hear that a player has not had a good experience of being at the club. And I’m sure that’s not the case for the whole period she’s been at the club. Maybe this more recent period, of not playing, but we certainly try to support every single player that we work with. But we’re in a selection-based business, where difficult decisions have to be made for the betterment of the team, and sometimes people and players can fall on the sharp end of that. [But] Arsenal is a rival and they made the best offer, so we’ve certainly not stood in the way of a player being able to go and make the move they want to make.”At one stage in his press conference, Taylor asked for no further questions about Kelly’s exit. The Guardian understands that City accepted bids for Kelly from Arsenal and Brighton but that a bid from Manchester United was rejected because City did not feel it was sufficient and were unwilling to help strengthen their local rivals. According to Sky Sports, Kelly turned down the chance to join Brighton earlier in the window.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We run this tight ship as a real business – we have to do that. Arsenal made the best offer so it was a simple one for us.”Kelly had been seeking a move after being frozen out, making only one start in the WSL this season amid reports linking her with a transfer. She said in her statement on Wednesday that she accepted she had no future at City beyond the end of her contract in June.Kelly broke her silence in an apparent last-resort plea to be permitted to leave. “The situation has dragged on far too long, it’s disappointing and not right,” she posted. “Ultimately I just want to be happy again.”Explore more on these topicsManchester City WomenWomen's Super LeagueArsenal WomenWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

But the club remain limited by PSR calculations for this financial year and are unlikely to feel the full benefits of the takeover until the summer.Men’s transfer window January 2025: all deals from Europe’s top five leaguesRead moreMoyes has been trying to strengthen his squad since returning as Everton manager three weeks ago but Alcaraz is the closest he has come to getting a deal over the line. The 22-year-old is due to undergo a medical with Everton before a proposed loan with a view to a permanent transfer.The midfielder started the season at Southampton and appeared as a substitute in theiropening-day defeat at Newcastlebefore joining Flamengo for a club record €18m. As the Brazilian season overlaps with a Premier League campaign, and has now ended, he is eligible to play for a third club this campaign. Everton’s need for reinforcements has increased with the midfielder Orel Mangala out for the rest of the season with an ACL injury and Dominic Calvert-Lewin sidelined for the long-term by a hamstring problem.“It’s certainly not for the want of trying,” said Moyes on the lack of signings. “Undoubtedly we’re still hampered with PSR. I’m really jealous of watching a lot of teams who can attempt to go for players at expensive prices. At the moment, we’re not quite there but we don’t want to get ourselves in a position we’ve been in before with points deductions so we have to be really mindful of what we do. We hope to bring in some players but maybe it’s not the ones who, if we really had the money, we’d be trying to do.”The Everton manager admits the PSR challenges have increased his admiration for the business conducted by his predecessor, Sean Dyche, and director of football, Kevin Thelwell, to keep the club afloat in the Premier League in recent seasons. “I’ve been really surprised at the way it’s restricting the football club,” Moyes added. “Everton’s a huge football club and should be competing with many of the big clubs in the country and hopefully spending in a way where it’s right and challenging for the big players who are available.“There’s not that many in January, to be honest, but the PSR is hindering us. I think I can see now why the last few years at Everton have been so difficult. The people who’ve had to work under the restrictions have done a remarkable job.”Moyes is also trying to make a permanent signing before Monday’s transfer deadline. Mangala is expected to return to his parent club, Lyon, freeing up the loan option for Alcaraz,while Armando Broja could stay at Everton as his ankle ligament injury is not as bad as first suspected. The striker is facing six weeks on the sidelines rather than 10-12.Everton have won their last two league games and a third, against relegation rivals Leicester on Saturday, could have far-reaching implications according to Moyes. The Everton manager explained: “I think three points would be crucial for us. We’ve got a lot of boys out of contract this summer, maybe waiting to see the position we’re in. It might allow us to start planning if people see that it looks as if we’re going to be a Premier League team.“While we’re in this position it’s very difficult to make plans or try to put plans in place. A win tomorrow would be really important for us as a team and a club.”Explore more on these topicsEvertonDavid MoyesTransfer windownewsShareReuse this content"

Between 1998 and 2001, Napear nearly wore his phrase out watching Jason “White Chocolate” Williams – a small, harmless-looking six-footer out of a tiny West Virginia town with a heavy drawl – who had happened to have one of the biggest bags (skill-sets for you association football folks) in the game. But rather than hitting three-pointers or dunks, Williams was a master of something different. Assists were his business, and business was booming. Buttery bounce passes, alley-oops, behind-the-back, off-the-elbow, through-your-legs, what-the-heck-was-that dimes for his teammates, Williams had no equal. You don’t have to like NBA basketball to appreciatewhat is going on here.Williams may not have been the best NBA point-guard but in terms of bums-off-seats, jaw-dropping excitement, he is a Hall of Famer. The NBA equivalent of Adel Taarabt, but with the aesthetic of Jay Spearing. The streets will simply never fail to recall. From white chocolate to white shirts, Williams had quite a different vibe to the follically-blessed José María Gutiérrez, better known as former Real Madrid footballer Guti, but both athletes shared something in common: a love of assists. Ostentatious acts performed under the guise of selflessness. A gift or a curse depending on what colour shirt you are wearing. For both Williams and Guti, their shared magnum opus was the no-look assist; 15 years and one day ago, the Spaniard blessed us with his greatest ever.Deportivo La Coruña v Real Madrid in January 2010 was not a game for tricks and flicks. The visitors hadn’t won at the Riazor in 19 years and trailed Barcelona by eight points in the title race, with Marca previewing the match as “a Game of Life or Death”. Yet, despite being just 1-0 up, Guti delivered an assist so disrespectful that late Spanish journalist David Gistau described his backheel as having “the disdain of someone treading on a hamster”. After a swift Madrid counter-attack, Kaká had put Guti through on goal. But rather than finish simply past Deportivo’s goalkeeper Daniel Aranzubia, the Spaniard beautifully backheeled the ball for Karim Benzema, a teammate initially so semi-detached from proceedings he may as well have been sold on Rightmove.Watch the goal back and it is scarcely believable that this wasn’t just a kick around in the park with Guti’s mates. How on earth did Guti even know Benzema was vaguely available, unless there was a large mirror nestled behind Aranzubia’s goal? To have the audacity, the chutzpah, to even try a backheel pass at full pelt in that situation is ridiculous. Either that, or Guti was so desperate to avoid using his weaker right foot to shoot that he was willing to risk it all. Forget the why, or the how. Just enjoyprobably the greatest assist of all time. Here’s to Guti, here’s to Jason Williams and here’s to the very concept of being silly, a criminally-underrated trio devoted to having fun even when they are not supposed to.QUOTE OF THE DAY“So disappointed to find out tonight that people at the club are briefing journalists against me if I am to sign at a club before the window shuts.

Breaking for 5-4, he had to repel another fightback from Borg until finally sealing the deal on his second match point.“Leo’s a very good player.

I’m very happy to be here and very excited to get started. You look at the history of the trophies Chelsea have won and I’m an ambitious player and person, so for me, it is a good fit.“Speaking to Paul Green, Sonia [Bompastor] and Camille [Abily] , I just got such a good feeling from them. It has been really positive. I want to play for this club and fight for the badge.”Walsh, who was a key part of the Lionesses side that won the 2022 Euros, was keen to return to England and Chelsea, admirers for many years, acted quickly to secure her signature.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Their deal for Walsh will also be widely seen as a further boost to Chelsea’s hopes of more silverware this season, as they strengthen their squad again despite being seven points clear at the top of the WSL, in their pursuit of a sixth consecutive title. Sonia Bompastor’s side are also through to the League Cup semi-finals, the fifth round of the FA Cup and the Champions League quarter-finals.The 27-year-old is eligible to be registered for Chelsea’s Champions League squad for the knockout stages and therefore could theoretically be set for a reunion against her former side if they were to meet in the competition this season. The quarter-final draw takes place on Friday 7 February.Walsh has helped Barcelona win back-to-back Champions League titles in the past two seasons, but is believed to have told the club she wanted to be closer to her family.Arsenal targeted Walsh last summer and she was reportedly the subject of a bid from the club, who have been heavily linked with her for several months. Her move to Chelsea will be seen as a bitter blow to Arsenal, who were also interested in Girma before her decision to join Chelsea.Walsh’s latest transfer fee would mean that two of the five most expensive transfers in women’s football would involve the former Manchester City midfielder as she moved to Barcelona from City for around £400,000 in 2022.Explore more on these topicsChelsea WomenKeira WalshWomen's footballWomen's Super LeagueBarcelona WomennewsShareReuse this content"

They, like Barcelona, can offer Champions League football after qualifying for the last 16.Manchester United ease into last 16 as Dalot and Mainoo see off SteauaRead moreRashford has rejected offers from several other clubs, including Tottenham, because of his determination to join Barça. Under La Liga’s squad cost limit rules they will have to generate funds to spend the money required to sign Rashford. They are prepared in principle to cover most or all of his £365,000-a-week salary. With less than four full days until the window shuts at 11pm GMT on Monday, United hope a player out of favour under Ruben Amorim can secure a transfer.If Rashford departs, United would be interested in bringing in the versatile Bayern Munich forward Mathys Tel, who is also a target for Tottenham and Villa, though it is understood he is not inclined to join Spurs.Before Thursday’s2-0 Europa League win over FCSBin Bucharest, Amorim indicated there may be a route back into his first-team plans for Rashford should the forward stay.“You can look at our team and imagine the profile of the players,” the head coach said. “Now imagine a talent like Rashford. Our team should be so much better with Rashford. But he has to change. If he changes, we are more than welcome to put in a talent like Rashford. And we need it.”Amorim has not selected Rashford sinceUnited’s 2-1 win at Viktoria Plzenon 12 December, citing “training reasons”. Two days after being dropped Rashford said hewanted a “new challenge”and he has since been in only one match-day squad, for the 2-0 defeat by Newcastle on 30 December.Alejandro Garnacho was dropped along with Rashford for the game against Manchester City in December and Amorim is pleased with how the Argentinian forward has responded. Garnacho created Kobbie Mainoo’s goal against FSCB.Amorim said: “He changed right away since that game against City. The way he understands things and that I just want to help him. He changed in everything: the approach when you talk with him, the way he recovers. He understands that sometimes I am a different coach, that I am demanding in myway and sometimes it is hard … but he understands that it is never in a bad way.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now, he sometimes plays and sometimes not – he wasn’t comfortable – but maybe it is something to do with that. In that [attacking midfield] position [against FSCB], I feel that he was more happy to play. I felt it watching him. That is important because if they are happy, they play better. I think he can change position.”Amorim did not deny that Mainoo and Garnacho, as homegrown players, were vulnerable to any realistic offer. “That part is true,” he said. “But I want players like Kobbie and Garnacho. The focus is that we have to improve our academy. To play, to feel the shirt, but also to sell them.”United are close to sealing a deal to sign theLecce full-back Patrick Dorgufor about €30m (£25m). Amorim said Tyrell Malacia was not ideally suited to his system as a wing-back “because he’s not so offensive” and that Luke Shaw needed “a little bit more time” to be match ready.Explore more on these topicsMarcus RashfordManchester UnitedBarcelonaAston VillaTransfer windownewsShareReuse this content"

The England and WalesCricketBoard has now raised around £279m after similar stakes in Oval Invincibles (£60m) and Birmingham Phoenix (£40m) were claimed 24 hours earlier.IPL billionaires and Birmingham City owners win auction for Hundred teamsRead moreWith four teams still to be auctioned off, theECBis now on course to far exceed a combined target of £350m for its eight 49% stakes. The money raised is due to be shared among the 18 first-class counties, Marylebone Cricket Club and the recreational game, with host venues able to sell their remaining 51% if desired.Defending champions in the women’s Hundred, but bottom feeders in three of the four men’s tournaments to date, London Spirit were always likely to attract the highest amount of interest given the prestige of co-owning teams that play home fixtures at Lord’s.However, an overall valuation of £295m has still surpassed all expectations. After a three-hour auction – “a battle of the egos” according to one insider – the consortium led by Nikesh Arora, chief executive of cyber-security firm Palo Alto, prevailed.This group, which also features Sundar Pichai (Google), Satya Nadella (Microsoft) and Shantanu Narayen (Adobe), will now begin a period of exclusivity with MCC to finalise the deal. They beat competition from Sanjiv Goenka, owner of Lucknow Super Giants, Avram Glazer’s Lancer Capital, and Cain International, led by Chelsea director Jonathan Goldstein and backed by the club’s joint-owner, Todd Boehly.There will likely be a knock-on effect, with those who missed out still able to bid for stakes in the remaining teams. Goenka, who was tipped as favourite for the stake in London Spirit, only to finish runner-up, is now expected to turn his attention to Manchester Originals. If so, it could see a target of £100m for 49% of the Originals similarly surpassed when it is auctioned on Monday.Of the first four teams sold, just one, Oval Invincibles, has returned a partner from the Indian Premier League. Reliance, owners of Mumbai Indians and run by the Ambani family, secured that stake on Thursday, with Birmingham City investors Knighthead claiming the right to buy 49% of Birmingham Phoenix later that day.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Like other spyware makers, Paragon’s hacking software is used by government clients and WhatsApp said it had not been able to identify the clients who ordered the alleged attacks.Experts said the targeting was a “zero-click” attack, which means targets would not have had to click on any malicious links to be infected.WhatsApp declined to disclose where the journalists and members of civil society were based, including whether they were based in the US.Paragon has a US office in Chantilly, Virginia. The company has faced recent scrutiny after Wired magazine in October reported that it had entered into a $2m contract with the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s homeland security investigations division.The division reportedly issued a stop-work order for the contract to verify whether it complied with a Biden administration executive order that restricted the use of spyware by the federal government. The Trump administration has revoked dozens of the Biden administration’s executive orders in its first two weeks in office, but the 2023 order, which prohibited the use of spyware that posed a risk to national security remains in effect.WhatsApp said it had sent Paragon a “cease and desist” letter and that it was exploring its legal options. WhatsApp said the alleged attacks had been disrupted in December and that it was not clear how long the targets may have been under threat.The company is currently notifying victims of the alleged hacking, who will be contacted by WhatsApp.“WhatsApp has disrupted a spyware campaign by Paragon that targeted a number of users including journalists and members of civil society. We’ve reached out directly to people who we believe were affected. This is the latest example of why spyware companies must be held accountable for their unlawful actions. WhatsApp will continue to protect people’s ability to communicate privately,” a company spokesperson said.Paragon Solutions declined to comment.A person close to the company told the Guardian that Paragon had 35 government customers, that all of them could be considered democratic, and that Paragon did not do business with countries, including some democracies, that have previously been accused of abusing spyware. The person said that included Greece, Poland, Hungary, Mexico and India.Paragon’s spyware is known as Graphite and has capabilities that are comparable to NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware. Once a phone is infected with Graphite, the operator of the spyware has total access to the phone, including being able to read messages that are sent via encrypted applications like WhatsApp and Signal.The company, which was founded by the former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak, has been the subject of media reports inIsraelrecently, after it was reported that the group was sold to a US private equity firm, AE Industrial Partners, for $900m.Reports suggested the deal had not yet received full regulatory approval in Israel. Cyberweapons like Graphite and Pegasus are regulated by the Israeli ministry of defence. The Guardian reached out to AE Industrial Partners, which is based in Boca Raton, Florida. Paragon is not listed among the company’s investments on its website.“For some time Paragon has had the reputation of a ‘better’ spyware company not implicated in obvious abuses, but WhatsApp’s recent revelations suggest otherwise. This is not just a question of some bad apples – these types of abuses are a feature of the commercial spyware industry,” said Natalia Krapiva, senior tech legal counsel at Access Now.WhatsApp said it believed the so-called vector, or means by which the infection was delivered to users, was through a malicious pdf file that was sent to individuals who were added to group chats. WhatsApp said it could say with “confidence” that Paragon was linked to this targeting.John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto, which tracks and identifies digital threats against civil society, said Citizen Lab provided WhatsApp with some information that helped the company understand the vector that was used against the company’s users.The group is expected to publish a report in the future that will provide more details about the alleged targeting.WhatsApp announced the news just weeks after a judge in California ruled in the company’s favor in a landmark case against NSO Group, the high-profile spyware maker that in 2021 was placed by the Biden administration on a commerce department blacklist. At the time, the Biden administration said it had placed NSO on the so-called entity list because the company had engaged in activities “that are contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States”.NSO has lobbied members of Congress to be taken off the list.WhatsApp filed a lawsuit against NSO in 2019 after it said 1,400 users had been infected by the company’s spyware. In December, a judge, Phyllis Hamilton, ruled that NSO was liable for the attacks, and that NSO had violated state and federal US hacking laws and WhatsApp’s own terms of service.Have you been affected?

Researchers have foundthat thermogalvanic hydrogel, for example, could be used to keep a mobile phone battery cool while turning the waste heat into electricity.In theory reversing this process enables the generation of cooling power, but previous studies have shown this effect to have limited potential. By optimising the chemicals used in the process, researchers found that they were able to improve the hydrogalvanic cell’s cooling power by 70%.Electricity used to power refrigerators combined with gas leakages from fridges and freezers into the atmosphere make them a significant source of greenhouse emissions. Fifty per cent of UK food refrigeration emissions are from electrical power, with 37% of UK food refrigeration electrical emissions from domestic refrigerators, according to a study published by theInternational Journal of Refrigeration.Future research conducted by this team will include optimising the system’s design and investigating other potential commercial use.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Like other spyware makers, Paragon sells use of its spyware, known as Graphite, to government agencies, who are supposed to use it to fight and prevent crime.Paragon’s spyware was allegedly delivered to targets who were placed on group chats without their permission, and sent malware through PDFs in the group chat. Paragon makes no-click spyware, which means users do not have to click on any link or attachment to be infected; it is simply delivered to the phone.It is not clear how long Cancellato may have been compromised. But the editor published a high-profile investigative story last year that exposed how members of Meloni’s far-right party’s youth wing had engaged in fascist chants, Nazi salutes and antisemitic rants.Fanpage’s undercover reporters – although not Cancellato personally – had infiltrated groups and chat forums used by members of the National Youth, a wing of Meloni’s Brothers of Italy party. The outletpublished clipsof National Youth members chanting “Duce” – a reference to Benito Mussolini – and “sieg Heil”, and boasting about their familial connections to historical figures linked to neo-fascist terrorism. The stories were published in May.Cancellato, 45, said he did not have reason to suspect in December that his mobile device had been compromised and has never been told by any authorities that he is under investigation. The news felt like a “violation”, he said.“We just began the technical analysis on the device in order to evaluate the actual extent of this attack, what was actually taken or spied on, and for how long. Obviously, it is also in our interest to know, if it’s possible to do so, who ordered this espionage activity,” Cancellato told the Guardian.Meloni’s party faced criticism in Italy and in Brussels following the publication of Fanpage’s reporting. A European Commission spokesperson at the time said: “The point of view of the European Commission and of President Ursula von der Leyen on the symbolism of fascism is very clear: we do not believe it is appropriate, we condemn it, we think it is morally wrong.”The president of the Jewish Community of Rome, Victor Fadlun, called for “appropriate actions [to] be taken” after the Fanpage reports. “It is imperative that society and institutions react strongly against all forms of hatred and discrimination,” he wrote on X.Giovanni Donzelli, a Brothers ofItalyMP and party organizer, said at the time there was “no place” for “racists, extremists, and antisemites” in his party.Paragon Solutions declined to comment.Have you received a notification from WhatsApp?

Final Fantasy VII puts you in the middle of a raid. Mass Effect 2 introduces you to a world, then immediately destroys it. Sonic the Hedgehog bombards you with impossibly fast objects hurtling through a world of colourful danger.I have never played a game in my life that starts by telling you not to be a Nazi. But that’s what greeted me when I playedIndiana Jonesand the Great Circle. Before a single artefact was raided, before a whip was cracked, before you even see lead actor Troy Baker doing his best Harrison Ford impression in next generation graphics (amazing!), comes this warning:The story and contents of this game are not intended to and should not be construed in any way to condone, glorify or endorse the beliefs, ideologies, events, actions, persons or behaviour of the Nazi and fascist regimes …It’s difficult to see howanyonecould possibly construe the fascists in this game as something worthy of imitation. Quite apart from their moral repugnancy, they aresuper dumb. Whether in Vatican City or in Thailand, they are terrible fighters, and so deaf you can crawl right past them. They make very bad decisions in what is, according to some well written dialogue, clearly a toxic workplace environment where their young male insecurity is weaponised by a few charismatic older leaders who don’t care about them. Who would want to jointhatsystem?View image in fullscreenThe game’s comically, brilliantly detestable uber-villain, Herr Voss.Photograph: BethesdaBut then, in the middle of playing this, the Trump cult retook the US. A load of real Nazis were immediately released from jail, because they were fashing for Donald. And the world’s richest man apparently sieg-heiled live on stage in front of a televised audience of millions, and is actively promoting far right parties in Germany and the UK. This was on day one! Across the globe, dumb young men suckled on Joe Rogan’s raw milk lapped it up.I was so happy escaping into the virtual world of Indiana Jones. It’s crazy that a game featuring Hitler and Mussolini on their rise to power feels comforting, but here at least it is entirely permitted – indeed encouraged – to punch the Nazis. The more I played the game, the more it became about getting one over them, as I lured them one by one into a corner and punched the hell out of them. The joy of creeping through an encampment of fash and nicking stuff from their safes right under their noses was only matched by the euphoria I felt shoving one of them off the edge of a battleship stuck at the top of a Himalayan mountain.Actually, I had so much fun knocking Nazis out with candlesticks that the rest of the game became a bit of a drag. Maybe I’ve played too much Uncharted and Tomb Raider, but I no longer find it exciting to wander around caves looking for ropes to swing off while solving puzzles. That’s the boring side of archaeology. That is why nobody wanted to be one, before Indiana Jones added Nazi-punching to the job description. The archaeological sections feel as if they take for ever (though I am sure Elon Musk completes them in minutes, having paid someone else todo it for him).View image in fullscreen‘I no longer find it exciting to wander around caves’ … Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.Photograph: BethesdaI also keep getting stuck halfway through opening doors, thanks to the clunky controls. I am at an age where I get bored by any kind of mundane activity in games. Turning keys in locks, searching for objects, eating food … I’d do away with all of it. I want locked doors to fly open and every object within to magically fly into my infinite-sized backpack and stomach. I have spent nearly 30 years as a dad searching rooms for things that are lost.

One part where you go from sliding down a mountain in the Himalayas to running around Shanghai under bomber attack before flying your own plane out of there is the most fun section of a game I can remember. It was so immersive that the day after I completed it, I felt the same sadness I feel when I finish binge-watching a brilliant TV series.There are still people out there who think video games have nothing to do with real life. Well, I have just spent three weeks surrounded by fascists hellbent on world domination. The only thing that told me I was in a game rather than real life was that I was personally able to stop them.

I can hardly imagine your distressMarina HydeIf China has done to Sam Altman what his OpenAI has been accused of doing to creatives, it would take a heart of stone not to laughFri 31 Jan 2025 09.44 ESTLast modified on Fri 31 Jan 2025 12.18 ESTShareIonce saw an episode ofAmerica’s Dumbest Criminalswhere a man called the cops to report his car stolen, only for it to turn out he’d stolen it from someone else in the first place. I couldn’t help thinking of him this week while watching OpenAI’s Sam Altman wet his pants about the fact that a Chinese hedge fund might have made unauthorised use of his own chatbot models, including ChatGPT, to train its new little side project. This is the cheaper, more open, extremely share-price-slashing DeepSeek.As news of DeepSeekplayed havocwith the tech stock market, OpenAI pressed its hanky to its nose andreleased a statement: “We are aware of and reviewing indications that DeepSeek may have inappropriately distilled our models, and will share information as we know more,” this ran. “We take aggressive, proactive countermeasures to protect our technology.” Oooooooooh! I want to say “welcome to America’s Dumbest Tech Barons”, except I can’t, because I think we all know that no law enforcement is coming to get Sam for the stuffhe’salleged to have madeunauthorised use offirst. That was the good type of alleged theft, whatever the claims of all thelawsuitsbelatedly trying to claw something back for the alleged copyright victims of his firm’s own inappropriate methods.So, to put it another way … wait, Sam – you’re not telling us that the Chinese hedge fund crawled all over your IP without asking and took it for themselves? Oh my God, IMAGINE?! You must feel used and abused. Financially violated. Like all your years of creativity were just grist to some other bastard’s mill. Like a host organism. Like a schmuck. Like Earth’s most screamingly preposterous hypocrite.Anyway, are you particularly familiar with Sam Altman? I think he’s becoming almost my worst one. Elon Musk remains the edgelord overlord to beat, of course, but honestly, it’s getting extremely difficult to avoid appreciating just how much of a super-irritant the OpenAI boss has become. Physically, he resembles the kind of actor who shows up to an audition thinking he’s a perfect leading man, but who gets cast as the puppy-eyed loner who just happens to take a trophy from each one of his victims. Which, in a funny kind of way, I guess he is. Sam’s got every living creative down there in hisbasement well. “It feeds my machine its script, or it gets the hose … ” I think I have to say here that he and OpenAI deny all this. The unauthorised scraping of human creativity, I mean – I’m not sure if anyone’s asked him about the basement well, so do consider that one unsolved.But where were we? Ah yes: the Altman journey. “To anyone familiar with the history of Germany in the 1930s,” declared Samback in 2016, “it’s chilling to watch Trump in action.” Well, now. Purely going on Sam’s own rather crass analogy, he now seems to have turned into one of those German industrialists who gladly popped into the chancellery for a slice of cake. And, indeed, for a slice ofthecake.But as I say, that’s Sam’s analogy – anyone who’s ever skimmed over his recommended books list knows he’s very much rooted in the business history section of the airport bookshop, and consequently shouldn’t be relied upon to produce a single comparison that isn’t with either the Third Reich or ancient Rome. If you want to feature on his recommended books list next year, just get the freebie version of ChatGPT to fart you out something called Rome: the First Reich. He will find it “fascinating”, “unexpected”, and “really thought-provoking”.Needless to say, Samwas thereat the inauguration of the current American caesar. As far as I could see, he didn’t make the cut of those tech titans placed in front of Trump’s supposed actual cabinet. I did, however, note that he was filmed having some bulging-eyed chat withJake and Logan Paul– YouTubers, podcasters, energy drink dealers, and “boxers”. I suppose one of the comic pleasures of these times is watching the nerds making common cause with the guys who would 100% have given them a wedgie in school, purely because they are now all rich. Money’s one weird side-effect is to unite some of the worst wedgers and wedgees.Alas, like the rest of theSilicon Valleyhorror-moguls, Sam is now a fact of all our lives, and – along with the Trump administration he is thoroughly cosied up to – is telling everyone how to think about DeepSeek. This is really a key dynamic of the next few years: being told we should be very worried about what the authoritarian Chinese are doing by Silicon Valley authoritarians we should also be extremely worried about. For us little people, the choice seems to be between being data-jacked and screwed over by the undemocratic Chinese, or being data-jacked and screwed over by the post-democratic tech bros. Once again, it’s the old syphilis or Ebola menu choice.The only thing worse than being this impotent and option-free is having to listen to the Silicon Valley gazillionaires whining about it all, and demanding more public money to defend themselves. But why wouldn’t they? Their whining always works. Every time they say we should get rid of all government subsidies while keeping their own, or threaten to abandon building projects if required to pay normal taxes like everyone else, they get what they want. Already Trump’s AI tsar is gibbering obligingly that it’s“possible”that theft of OpenAI’s IP has occurred.As the entrepreneur and investor Scott Galloway has pointed out on numerous occasions, big tech are thebiggest welfare queensthat ever stalked the Earth. They’ve all drawn vast benefits from public money, chased countless tax breaks and demanded even more. Far from being some heroic form of risk-taking done without a single handout, theirs is the capitalism of the school bake sale – someone else buys all the ingredients and does most of the cooking, and the kids then claim they have turned a profit for the good of humanity.Meanwhile, it’s left to sidelined Cassandras to flash the warning lights. This week, Yoshua Bengio, the Canadian computer scientist and a so-called godfather of AI, warned of theshock arrivalof DeepSeek that: “It’s going to mean a closer race, which usually is not a good thing from the point of view ofAI safety.” You’ll note that barely a day goes by without someone described as a “godfather of AI” coming out to caution against its increasingly malign potential and capabilities. AI seems to have more godparents than even Sleeping Beauty. And, regrettably, more than one significant prick.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDeepSeekOpinionArtificial intelligence (AI)Stock marketsSam AltmanSilicon ValleyChinacommentShareReuse this content"

Former rivals, most notably Apple’s Steve Jobs, have since departed this dimension, while the Gates Foundation, focusing on unsexy but important technologies such as malaria nets, was doing “effective altruism” long before that became a fashionable term among philosophically minded tech bros.Time, then, to look back. In the first of what the author threatens will be a trilogy of memoirs, Gates recounts the first two decades of his life, from his birth in 1955 to the founding of Microsoft and its agreement to supply a version of the Basic programming language to Apple Computer in 1977.He grows up in a pleasant suburb of Seattle with a lawyer father and a schoolteacher mother. His intellectual development is keyed to an origin scene in which he is fascinated by his grandmother’s skill at card games around the family dining table. The eight-year-old Gates realises that gin rummy and sevens are systems of dynamic data that the player can learn to manipulate.As he tells it, Gates was a rather disruptive schoolchild, always playing the smart alec and not wanting to try too hard, until he first learned to use a computer terminal under the guidance of an influential maths teacher named Bill Dougall. (I wanted to learn more about this man than Gates supplies in a still extraordinary thumbnail sketch: “He had been a World War II Navy pilot and worked as an aeronautical engineer at Boeing. Somewhere along the way he earned a degree in French Literature from the Sorbonne in Paris on top of graduate degrees in engineering and education.”)Ah, the computer terminal. It is 1968, so the school terminal communicates with a mainframe elsewhere. Soon enough, the 13-year-old Gates has taught it to play noughts and crosses. He is hooked. He befriends another pupil, Paul Allen – who will later introduce him to alcohol and LSD – and together they pore over programming manuals deep into the night. Gates plans a vast simulation war game, but he and his friends get their first taste of writing actually useful software when they are asked to automate class scheduling after their school merges with another. Success with this leads the children, now calling themselves the Lakeside Programming Group, to write a payroll program for local businesses, and later to create software for traffic engineers.There follows a smooth transition to Harvard, where in the ferment of anti-war campus protests our hero is more interested in the arrival, one day in 1969, of a PDP-10 computer. Gates takes classes in maths but also chemistry and the Greek classics. Realising he doesn’t have it in him to become a pure mathematician, he goes all-in on computers once a new home machine, the Altair, is announced. He and Paul Allen will write its Basic, having decided to call themselves “Micro-Soft”.The early home computer scene, Gates notes, was a countercultural, hippy thing: cheap computers “represented a triumph of the masses against the monolithic corporations and establishment forces that controlled access to computing”, and so software was widely “shared”, or copied among people for free. It was Gates himself who, notoriously, pushed back against this culture when he found out most users of his Basic weren’t paying for it. By “stealing software”, he wrote in an open letter in 1976, “you prevent good software from being written. Who can afford to do professional work for nothing?” This rubbed a lot of people up the wrong way and still does, at least in the more militant parts of the “open-source” world. But he had a point. And that, readers, is why your Office 365 account just renewed for another year.Fans of Word and Excel, though, will have to wait for subsequent volumes of Gates’s recollections, as will those who want more about his later battles with Apple, though Steve Jobs does get an amusing walk-on part. (Micro-Soft’s general manager keeps a notebook of sales calls, on one page of which we read: “11.15 Steve Jobs calls. Was very rude.”). This volume, still, is more than just a geek’s inventory of early achievements. There is a genuine gratitude for influential mentors, and a wry mood of self-deprecation throughout. Gates gleefully records his first preschool report: “He seemed determined to impress us with his complete lack of concern for any phase of school life.” Later, he explains how he acquired a sudden interest in theatre classes. “Admittedly the main draw for me was the higher percentage of girls in drama. And since the main activity in the class was to read lines to each other, the odds were very good that I’d actually talk to one.” Strikingly, unlike most “self-made” billionaires, Gates emphasises the “unearned privilege” of his upbringing and the peculiar circumstances – “mostly out of my control” – that enabled his career. Adorably, he even admits to still having panic dreams about his university exams.The book’s most touching pages recount how one of his closest friends and colleagues in the programming group, Kent Evans, died in a mountaineering accident when he was 17. “Throughout my life, I have tended to deal with loss by avoiding it,” Gates writes. He says later that if he were growing up today, he would probably be identified as “on the autism spectrum”, and now regrets some of his early behaviour, though “I wouldn’t change the brain I was given for anything”. There is a sense of the writer, older and wiser, trying to redeem the past through understanding it better, a thing that no one has yet seenElon Muskor Mark Zuckerberg attempt in public. That alone makes Bill Gates a more human tech titan than most of his rivals, past and present.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

In a fury ofexecutive orders, the restored president has frozen hiring at the federal government, cut off large amounts of science and research funding, ended or severely curtailed international programs in women’s health and HIV treatment, attempted to unilaterally amend the constitution to deny citizenship to hundreds of thousands, cut off aid to Ukraine, provoked a diplomatic spat with Colombia and renamed the Gulf of Mexico in official documents as “the Gulf of America”.Many of these moves are stunts and distractions, meant to appeaseDonald Trump’s base of aggrieved culture warriors. Others are meant to further Trump’s personal power, and to make sure that no obstacles will be presented to his second term agenda of malice, retribution and corrupt self-dealing.On Monday, Trump made a move that belongs in the latter camp. Disregarding the formal process that is required by law before nonpolitical federal civil servants can be terminated, Trump’s acting attorney general, James McHenry, summarily fired more than a dozen justice department career prosecutors. All of those fired had been assigned to the two federal criminal investigations of Trump pursued by the former special counsel Jack Smith in the classified documents and January 6 cases. In a letter informing the attorneys of their termination, McHenry wrote that their involvement in the cases was the impetus for their firing. “Given your significant role in prosecuting the president,” McHenry wrote, “I do not believe that the leadership of the department can trust you to assist in implementing the president’s agenda faithfully.”Trump wants to reverse America’s decline. Good luck | Samuel MoynRead moreIt is the kind of sentence that has been produced by the profound shift in the constitutional order under Trump. In another lifetime – before Trump’s entry into national politics – the notion that the Department of Justice existed to “implement the president’s agenda” was the kind of thing that people could end their careers by merely suggesting.The Department of Justice’s independence was once so fiercely protected that when Obama’s attorney general, Loretta Lynch, exchanged pleasantries with former president Bill Clinton on a tarmac in Phoenix in 2016, the incident ballooned into a national scandal that contributed to Hillary Clinton’s electoral defeat later that year. When Richard Nixon tried to exert pressure on the justice department to drop its investigations of him in 1973, demanding that the Watergate special counsel Archibald Cox be fired for his political disloyalty in much the same way that Trump has now moved to fire the lawyers who worked for Smith, the justice department officials were so aggrieved by Nixon’s overreach that both the attorney general and deputy attorney general resigned immediately, in an episode so dramatic that it became known as the “Saturday Night Massacre”.But what was then considered an unacceptable and arrogant presumption of executive power by Nixon barely registers as an offense from Trump, who has issued a blistering series of actions rewarding his friends and followers and punishing his enemies in the week since he returned to power. Hepardoned 1,500 peopleinvolved in the January 6 attack, including those who had been found guilty of violent offenses, and some have already allegedly reoffended following their release.But no matter: to Trump, violence committed in his interests is no sin. And he has rescinded the protection details of officials and former officials who have been subjected to threats by his supporters,including Anthony Fauci; to Trump, those who displease him are not entitled to protection from violence. They deserve what they get, and any number of the roving violent January 6 rioters who have now been released may be inclined to give it to them.We do not like to admit it, but it may be time to state plainly what many of us already know: that Trump has already largely remade our constitutional order. Powers that no one would have imagined that the president had just two weeks ago, when the office was occupied by a Democrat, are noddingly assumed to be within his purview now.It is hardly a debate, now, whether the president has the power to impose tariffs without the cooperation of Congress, though the legal question is far from settled; it is assumed that his bizarre directives to suspend funding that has already been appropriated by Congress must be obeyed. The firing of the prosecutors is a transparent overreach, but it is not clear that anyone will be able to stop him: if the lawyers sue to try to enforce their own rights as civil servants – or to try to force the president to recognize the limits of his own power – it seems perfectly likely that the large number of Trump-appointed judges on the federal bench will retroactively rewrite the law to say that Trump, if not other presidents, has in fact had this power all along.Trump unleashed chaos by freezing and unfreezing $3tn in federal grants and loans. Why? | Robert ReichRead moreSuch is the vision of the constitution that Trump seeks to impose: one in which his whim becomes law, one in which the power of his office is constrained only by the limits of his imagination. When Trump suspended birthright citizenship last week, a judicial order suspending the declaration’s effect went into place quickly. But that case will wind its way up, to the highest echelons of our very conservative judiciary, and though the law is clear, the extent of the US supreme court’s willingness to abase itself for the sake of Trump’s whims is not. The Trumpist vision of the constitution, after all, is that it says whatever Trump wants it to say. And there are some in the judiciary who believe that their job is to create post-hoc rationalizations for why everything this president does it legal.Is the justice department a mere accessory for Trump’s agenda? The Republicans seem to think so. But this is their vision of all government, now: as tools for the exercise of one man’s will. Trump’s vision of governance reminds me of nothing so much as the declaration attributed to Louis XIV: “L’état, c’est moi”: I am the state. There is a word for a government that runs this way, contorting itself merely to one man’s will. But that word is not “democracy”.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsUS newsOpinionTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS justice systemLaw (US)US politicsUS Capitol attackcommentShareReuse this content"

This will only escalate unless western governments actFri 31 Jan 2025 10.26 ESTLast modified on Fri 31 Jan 2025 13.22 ESTShareAs if this world needs more bloodshed, here comes another major war knocking on the door of the crumbling international order. This week’sferocious assault and captureof the largest city in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) by rebels backed by troops from its tiny neighbour, Rwanda,marks an escalationwith far reaching consequences beyond Africa. It also exposes the complacency of western governments, who many Congolese accuse of paving the way for this crisis.The rebellion,known as the M23, has been snowballing since 2021. In recent months, M23 seized swathes of territory as it encircled Goma, a city nestled below a group of volcanoes facing the Rwandan border. This week, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, called for Rwanda to stop supporting M23 and toremove its troopsfrom Congolese territory, adding that the conflict had inflicted a “devastating toll” on civilians, millions of whom need aid. In DRC’s capital, Kinshasa,angry protesterslit fires and attacked the Rwandan, French and US embassies.The M23 rebellion is the latest in a line of several Congolese insurgencies backed by Rwanda’s president,Paul Kagame, over nearly three decades. A darling of many western countries, Kagame rose to power in the wake of the 1994 genocide, against whose perpetrators he fought as a rebel commander. He has long argued his interventions in DRC are driven by his mission to safeguard his ethnic Tutsi group, which has at times been the butt of pogroms and political persecution in eastern Congo and from which M23 draws its leadership.Yet the series of wars involving Rwanda and the Congolese state since Kagame took power have been about much more than this. Rwanda-backed rebels, who controlled much of eastern DRC in the late 1990s, extracted massive amounts of mineral wealth. After anational peace deal in 2002that integrated Congolese Tutsi officers and politicians into military and political institutions under the watch of the world’s biggest UN peacekeeping mission, some of them again rebelled in 2004 and 2008 as they pushed for more military privileges and access to power and local resources. Formed in 2012 as the latest iteration of those rebellions, the M23briefly took Gomabefore they were defeated the following year.Throughout the cycle of wars, western officials defended Rwandain closed diplomatic circles, routinely playing down evidence of Rwandan backing for these rebellions. Kagame had charmed donors with his government’s efficient implementation of aid projects. His western friends held up Rwanda as a feelgood story of post-genocidal reconstruction. Only when theevidence unearthedby UN security council investigators of Rwandan involvement in DRC became overwhelming in 2012, did the UK, EU and US finallytemporarily haltsome aid to the country. Todayas much as a thirdof Rwanda’s budget is still donor supported.When DRC’s president, Felix Tshisekedi, took power in 2019, he tried to reset the dial, inviting the Rwandan army into eastern DRC to attack and degrade Rwandan Hutu rebels, whose leadership included commanders who participated in the 1994 genocide. But by this time, M23 soldiers had begun to re-establish a camp near one of the volcanoes and were looking for outside support again. The rebellion escalated in 2021 after a series of stalled talks between M23 representatives and the Congolese government concerning the possible reintegration of some M23 membersinto state institutions.Rwanda had by then become an even more prized ally for the west. The UK’s Conservative government had hitched its immigration policy to a plan to deport migrants to Rwanda. In mid-2021, thousands of Rwandan troops began deploying into northern Mozambique, where a jihadist rebellion now backed by Islamic State has taken root around an area where a massive gas deposit is being developed by the French energy giant TotalEnergies. The European Union has provided financial assistance for Rwanda’s operations there. Brussels has also inked a minerals supply agreement with Rwanda, inviting criticismfrom rights groupswho say this legitimises war booty from Congo. Western officials, including the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, havedemanded that Kagame withdrawfrom DRC. But it is unclear whether they will force the hand of Rwanda’s president, who now also courts countries such as Turkey and Qatar as alternative friends.The Congolese government has meanwhile fallen back on a motley crew of military allies. They include regional troops from SouthAfricaand Tanzania, and a range of ethnic militia, including the Rwandan Hutu rebels that Tshisekedi had previously allowed the Rwandan army to target. Hundreds of eastern European mercenaries backing DRC’s army have surrendered. Some western diplomats now fear Congolese military commanders will seek Russian government assistance to fight against a rebellion that can be compared to the Russian-backed insurgency in Donbas.Western officials need to now use all their remaining leverage to demand the M23 withdraw and force political negotiations that can settle the political and material underpinnings of the repeated cycle of rebellions. If not, the war in DRC could yet draw in a number of regional actors, as it did in the 1990s. It could also open space for coup-mongering and Russian interference in the giant central African nation. That playbook has already unfolded in theSahel regionof west Africa. It must be avoided at all costs in DRC. The international order, already close to unravelling, will depend on it.Dino Mahtani is an independent researcher and writerExplore more on these topicsDemocratic Republic of the CongoOpinionAfricaRwandaUnited NationsPaul KagamecommentShareReuse this content"

Plant more trees and eat more homegrown food. Compost. Regift unwanted items and op-shop for clothes.-Hannah, Wellington, New ZealandBuy less. Enjoy people instead of stuff.-Mary, Portland Maine, USAAs I’ve done for the last 50 years, eat vegetarian, use a bicycle, reduce electricity usage and learn from First Nations elders.-David, CanberraUse the bus more often for short trips instead of the car, try the “no spend” month in February and minimise plastics. I already compost and use solar power.-Jan, Tullimbar, NSWDon’t be a beach bum: how to reduce your environmental footprint in the sandRead moreI love the idea of trying to buy nothing for an entire month. What a challenge. If I can pull that off, maybe I’ll do it for more than just one month. It’ll be great to see how creative I can get and what I learn about alternatives.-Laurie, San Francisco, USAGet politicalWith an Australian federal election coming this year. I will be writing to my local MPs starting in February. If taking climate action is new for you, I would suggest connecting with people who are involved in climate action in your local area.No air con? Try these DIY tricks to keep your house cool and your energy use lowRead moreGroups like Parents for Climate, the Knitting Nannas, Australian Youth Climate Coalition and Australian Conservation Foundation are great starting points. Being involved in groups like this help you connect with people with similar concerns and values and encourage you to take action and be involved.-Felicity, Seven HillsProvide time, expertise and effort to the environmental section of a small political party I joined (last year’s resolution) in order to identify opportunities for effective environmental legislation proposals. Increase contributions in environmental groups and media.Examine the possibility of joining an citizen energy co-op. Join a voluntary wildfire watch in nearby forests.-Yiorgos, Athens, GreeceJoin a collectiveEncourage more people to join a group of activists. Use Climate Freak approach to educate more people about climate change and risks. Talk about climate change and environmental breakdown using corporate social media. Be engaged in “clicktivism” online-Jakub, Lake Macquarie, NSWCreate awareness about the fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty regularly. Be more organised in my climate action. Help people to understand the link between plastic, petrochemicals and the climate crisis. More self care.-Leanne, St George, QLDKeep pushing for a worldwide shift away from animal agriculture, one of the largest contributors to environmental destruction. Protest against fossil fuels. Reduce consumption as much as possible. We need collective action; small individual changes are good, but collective change is really needed.-Robin, MelbourneConvince more people that while tiny incremental lifestyle changes are fine, and make us feel good, real change will only come when we hold decision makers who keep making things worse accountable, and when destroying the environment is no longer profitable. This will only happen with persistent disruptive action. We need to be on the streets, in boardrooms and in parliament all the time.-Catherine, MelbourneThink localFocus more on local solutions. Things I can do myself like composting and public transport, participating in local climate related initiatives.-Peter, MelbourneBuy organic when I can, explore new plant based recipes to increase plant-based family meals to five a week (from four), save up for external insulation and trade my hybrid car for a secondhand electric car.-L Ramsay, DublinCut back on meatI am not eating any of the products of animal husbandry, which is so polluting. So no meat or dairy products. I can eat fish, preferably small fish such as sardines, which have accumulated fewer toxins. So I am not a vegetarian or a vegan, my gripe is with animal husbandry, which is cruel and polluting.-Tony, Vicchio, ItalySay no to AITo avoid AI of any kind as much as possible. Learn how to delete it from apps, block, avoid as much as possible without being an ass about it. We have a very low (maybe even negative) carbon footprint in very ordinary suburbia, but the energy consumption of AI datacentres makes all these negligible by comparison.-Linda, Coffs HarbourGo electricI can make the biggest difference by supporting our local Electric Homes Ballarat project - trying to ensure as many people as possible are supported to make important changes to their homes by transitioning off gas to all electric.Buying an EV, sealing doors and windows, increasing insulation, having efficient all-electric heating, cooling, hot water and cooking along with adding solar panels, saves a fortune in power bills in the long run and are the most significant changes households can make to reduce their effect on the climate.Making these changes can be the difference between a home that emits seven tonnes of C02 a year and one that is net zero, or actually feeding back into the grid.-Sally, Buninyong, VictoriaExplore more on these topicsGreenhouse gas emissionsChange by degreesClimate crisisShareReuse this content"

We’re ready to work with Westminster to forge closer bonds with EuropeJohn Swinney is the first minister of ScotlandFri 31 Jan 2025 07.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 31 Jan 2025 11.57 ESTShareThe pantomime season may be over, but when it comes to the government’s much-repeated claim to be pursuing economic growth above all else, the cry of “It’s behind you” is sounding ever louder. This classic panto joke works when everyone in the audience can see something clearly but the character on stage pretends not to. So it is with Boris Johnson’sBrexitdeal and Rachel Reeves’s attempts to kickstart the economy. Reeves and Keir Starmer are ignoring what is blindingly obvious to everyone else: Brexit is a significant drag on Britain’s growth prospects. They know it’s true but refuse to acknowledge it and, more importantly, to do anything about it.There is, however, nothing comical about this situation. The hard Brexit negotiated by Johnson took the UK out of the EU, the single market and the customs union and brought an end to freedom of movement. As a result, people are paying the price throughhigher food bills, lower growth and therefore lower tax revenue that could and should be spent on the NHS.Today marks the fifth anniversary of the UK formally leaving this great project – in which countries come together on the basis of agreed values – to share and enhance sovereignty for the common good. For Starmer, however, it seems Nigel Farage is more of an influence on his decision-making than the interests ofScotland, where European freedom of movement in particular enriched our country in so many ways, culturally and economically.To be clear, I don’t see freedom of movement as merely a trade-off to secure business access to the huge single market. They are complementary benefits, helping business, communities and our world-class universities. Enabling people to live, love, work and study across the European Union is one of the EU’s great achievements. And, of course, Brexit was driven through despite the fact thatScotland, as well asNorthern Ireland, voted decisively to remain in the EU. This itself calls into question the idea of the UK as a voluntary union of equal partners.The EU is not perfect, but its founding values – human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights – are precious fundamentals in our society that I want to protect and nurture. Those values are, however, being challenged internally and externally. So, as the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, made clear in herspeech in Davoslast week, that is all the more reason for countries that believe in cooperation to continue to work together in a shared endeavour to champion those values.For many people, although those values will be keenly felt, it is the economic cost that matters most. This week the Scottish government presented yetmore evidenceof the continuing damage to trade and GDP as a result of hard Brexit. It simply isn’t possible to claim that growth is the number one priority while engaging in a Westminster conspiracy of silence over Brexit. Labour appears to be casting around in an ever greater panic for ideas to boost growth, while ignoring all the evidence of the damage caused by the Brexit deal it inherited but refuses to seek to change in any meaningful way.I believe it is time to fight back against that hard Brexit Westminster consensus. In the short term, the government needs to clarify urgently what it actually wants from its much-vaunted “reset” of European relations. The Scottish government is clear on our priorities: for example, we need an ambitiousveterinary agreementto help our food and drink industry; we need closer cooperation on energy to help boost investment and tackle the climate emergency; and we badly need a youth mobility scheme to open up greater educational opportunities for our young people again.A bolder and necessary step would be to join the single market and the customs union and refuel our trade withEurope. The Scottish government would be a willing partner with the UK government and the EU in pursuit of those goals, which would have a real impact on people’s lives. I urge the government therefore to think again about its self-defeating red lines and to seek a genuinely closer relationship with our fellow Europeans.For Scotland, the real prize, of course, is to become a member state in our own right for the first time. It is striking that EU countries very similar to Scotland enjoy higher productivity and greater equality than the UK. For Ireland, it has been said persuasively that it was the policy flexibility that came with independence, alongside EU membership, that enabled economic take-off.For the rest of the UK, it seems inevitable that the journey back to being an EU member state will start at some point. Surely it is better to start that journey now than to continue to put up with such ongoing, needless economic damage.John Swinney is the first minister of ScotlandExplore more on these topicsBrexitOpinionEuropean UnionEuropeScotlandLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

You know the tide has turned when even the royals have stoppedFri 31 Jan 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 31 Jan 2025 09.27 ESTShareMaybe I shouldn’t admit this, but when I saw the photo of Princess Beatrice’s new baby, I laughed. Hear me out, though, before you decide I’m a horrible person: I expect baby Athena – beautiful name – is perfectly lovely, and having arrived early, as my son did, will have quite a lot of feeding and growing to be getting on with. I say I “expect” she is, because we don’t actually know what Athena looks like. In the photograph her parents released of her, her entire face is hidden by her own raised sleeve in aGarbo-esque pleaof “I want to be alone”.So yes, I did laugh, but I also thought, well, fair play. I’m not one of those members of the British public who feels entitled to information about the royals, or photographs of their offspring. Athena is, as far as I’m concerned, entitled to her privacy and good on her parents for trying to maintain that, because, after all, she is too small to give her own consent.What I find humorous is just how much the image reveals of that modern negotiation that so many parents find themselves faced with, when it comes to social media. Like anyone, Athena’s parents are proud of their new baby, and want to show her off, but they really don’t want to show her face. More noteworthy still is that Beatrice is a mother who comes from a tradition where, shortly after giving birth, a woman is expected to put on a pastel dress, beige tights and a full face of makeup and present herself and her baby to the world’s media while everyone pretends not to know that she is leaking milk and lochia and was probably swearing and vomiting mere hours ago.It took an outsider, Meghan Markle, to take a stand against this insanity, and in the years since, she and Prince Harry have been judicious in how they have shared images of their children. He has been outspoken about the impact that being photographed in childhood has had on his subsequent mental health. You could argue that royal babies were the canaries in the coalmine on this. When social media took over the world, suddenly everyone had their children waving from the proverbial balcony, but prior to that, it was only really a very small group of kids who knew how it felt to be so surveilled, and to have one’s image disseminated widely among adults who are strangers.So you know the tide is turning on posting kids’ photos on social media when even the monarchy isn’t playing ball. In the time since I became a parent, people have become more and more vocal about social media as a children’s rights issue, to the point where most of my friends don’t put their children online at all any more.The ones who do use “close friends” filters, or take photos using gently amusing compromises, whether it’s a face obscured by an object or emoji, or the use of “unidentifiable” angles (I have friends I have known for years whose children I would only recognise by the backs of their heads). Others only send pictures on WhatsApp, Google Drive, email, or specific apps that have been developed for that very purpose. Some hardliners don’t even do that. I expect the sharp decline in user experience of all social media platforms will have only exacerbated this tendency.Of course, the “momfluencer” is thriving, but now so is the backlash. There are some brilliant influencers out there with good intentions, but the dark side is so very dark. The most recentscandalinvolves the former YouTubers James and Myka Stauffer, who created content out of adopting a child – until they gave him up.When I started writing columns about parenting, I speculated that the first social media “Mommie Dearest” memoir would be on its way soon, and so it has come to pass. Theharrowing testimonyof Shari, the eldest daughter of the influencer Ruby Franke – nowjailed for child abusein the US – should give pause to those making money from photographs and footage of their children and those who consume this content. Though an extreme example, it’s a sobering lesson in the cruelty that can occur behind a wholesome, algorithm-optimised facade.When I last wrote about this subject, a primary school teacher told me that children often confide in her that they dislike how much their parents share about them online. I think about that often, as everyone should. Because if that’s what children are saying, then the least we can do is listen to them.What’s workingI’m thrilled to announce that The Republic of Parenthood is going to become a book, not only featuring collected essays but also new material and beautiful illustrations from the artist Pia Bramley. It’s out this summer, but you can see a sneak preview of the coverhere. I’m so grateful to all the readers who kept telling me that it should become a book! It’s all thanks to you.What’s notThe £3 folding Ikea sick bowl – a sick bowl should always be sole purpose, I feel – has been out again, but I am out of practice with my aim, and must have done 10 loads of laundry on Sunday night.

It was also a warning shot to wavering Labour MPs. The message was blunt: get on board with the government’s economic strategy or step aside. Growth, we were told, is the non-negotiable mission.This was not a sudden shift but a reaffirmation ofher stance at Davos, where she made clear that “the answer can’t always be no”. That answer, now firmly codified, prioritises GDP growth above all else.Heathrow airport expansionis in; net zero,bats and newts are out. The promise? A revitalised economy, busy high streets and more bobbies on the beat – a Labour-friendly vision of progress designed to bolster morale and stuff leaflets with “good news” ahead of the next election.This strategy is fraught with risk. Some may call it bold; others, a sign of desperation. A growing suspicion looms that our government lacks a coherent governing philosophy or ideological compass beyond the vague pursuit of “growth”. But if growth at any cost is the mantra, the costs will soon become painfully clear. Why pledge to be clean and green, only to undermine that commitment with a Heathrow expansion promise six months later? Burning the furniture to stay warm doesn’t signal confidence – it reeks of panic.Labour’s plan for ‘growth’ won’t take off, but it will leave ordinary people behind | Aditya ChakraborttyRead moreRegardless of the motivation, Labour has crossed the Rubicon. Approving Heathrow expansion is an irreversible break with our pre-election pledges. In 2021, Reeves stood in front of the Labour party conference and declared that she would be the “first-ever green chancellor”. Now, Labour isaccused of obstructingtheclimate and nature billand abandoning its ambitious decarbonisation plans. The rapid turnaround is striking.There is also an international dimension. Has Donald Trump’s resurgence made it easier for Labour to jettison some of its social and environmental commitments? Some may argue that when mass deportations and the dismantling of the state are politically feasible in one of our closest allies, progressives here should be grateful for a Labour government – even one shifting ever rightwards. But the Heathrow expansion and the realignment it signals do not insulate the UK from the political forces that enabled Trump, it accelerates them. Remember our pledge torebuild trust in politics? Climate U-turns like this do the exact opposite. Indeed, they fuel the very climate scepticism the right peddles. After all, if we genuinely think the climate crisis is an existential threat, why undermine combatting it?As much as it pains me to say, Heathrow is just the most visible indicator of Labour’s shift. The changes are stacking up.BlackRock’s influence is growing. Austerity and deregulation are back in fashion. Zero tolerance for benefit fraud is in; stricter taxation onnon-doms is out. Post-2008 banking regulations areset to be dismantled, while the long-touted climate and nature bill is quietly sidelined.This raises the fundamental question: whose growth are we talking about? We know that the economic benefits of Heathrow expansion, AI development and financial and planning deregulation will not be evenly distributed. The winners will be the same old symbols of financial capitalism’s excesses – property developers pushing high-rise luxury flats while social housing crumbles; financial institutions such as BlackRock dictating investment priorities that benefit the wealthiest; and corporations such as Amazon,notorious for union-bustingand exploitative labour practices, reaping profits from deregulation.The losers? The very working-class communities thatLabourhas to champion, who will probably see little of the wealth generated while facing increased job insecurity from AI disruption, unaffordable housing due to continued speculative investment and environmental degradation from unbridled development.The economic orthodoxy the chancellor is embracing has been tried before. Joe Biden’s Democrats achieved GDP growth but still struggled against Trump’s populism. Why? Because growth, when concentrated in the hands of the few, does not translate into security or prosperity for the many. Starmer understood this implicitly when he stated back in 2022 thattrickle-down economics “is a piss take”.Reeves once championed the foundation economy – lifelong learning, public services, local industries and wealth redistribution. Whatever happened to that vision? Instead of pinning hopes on trickle-down promises from Heathrow and hedge funds, Labour should be levelling up wealth, not just GDP statistics.That means “growth” that serves people, not just profit. Of course, investing in AI, the life sciences and renewable energy is critical, but so too is sustainable farming,rewildingand well-paid jobs in adult social care – an urgent necessity for an ageing society, yet perpetually sidelined.The choices Labour is making will define not just its electoral prospects but the political landscape of the UK for years to come. This is not just about Heathrow, banking regulations or benefit fraud crackdowns. It is about whether my party can offer a vision of growth that actually works for the people who need it most – or whether it will leave that space open for its populist opponents to fill.Clive Lewis is the Labour MP for Norwich SouthExplore more on these topicsEconomic policyOpinionEconomic growth (GDP)Heathrow third runwayRachel ReevesKeir StarmerLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

There are two vegan sushi restaurants, three vegan ramen spots. There are a few vegan delis. All the convenience stores have a vegan section. There’s an abundance of vegan bakeries. There’s a place that does vegan peking duck – it’s good, I promise. Many of these vegan places proudly have a rainbow flag on display. I’m not talking about Los Angeles or New York. I’m not even talking about Copenhagen. My neighbourhood is called Śródmieście. The vegan paradise I’m talking about – it’s Warsaw.If you don’t believe me, well, Warsaw has been rankedamong the top vegan citiesin the world by HappyCow (a vegan ranking website) for the past six years. In 2022, it wasNational Geographic’s number one vegan cityin the world. Maybe your perception of Poland is allkielbasa(sausage) and conservative politics. Herring and hate. It’s more complicated than that. In the past two decades there has been a quiet vegan revolution in the country.In reality, it shouldn’t be too much of a shock that Polish food lends itself well to veganism. Prior to falling under the long shadow of the iron curtain, Polish cuisine was mostly plant-based. Only the aristocracy had easy access to meat, fish and dairy products. Most of the people in the country were peasants and they ate what they grew. The cuisine was full of root vegetables, potatoes and earthy greens.This was a plant-based diet by default, not ideology.As today, this cuisine was heavy on soups and stews. An old favourite was a vegetable soup, flavoured with sugar and cinnamon to which beer was added at the end to create a yeasted acidity. That one didn’t stand the test of time. Cracovian Jews used to makeobwarzanek, parboiled rye dough shaped into a circle, and sell it from carts on the streets of the city. This fared a little better – it likely inspiredwhat we know today as bagels.In the communist era, meat was a luxury, despite everyone’s alleged equality. Meat production was inefficient, which meant ordinary people did not have the money to afford the scant supply. This meant people craved meat as a status symbol – particularly because the socialist elite did have access to animal proteins. When the USSR collapsed people wanted to eat meat – and as market forces entered agriculture and people gradually gained disposable income, they spent heavily on it.But asPolandbecame a mature liberal democracy appetites changed. For the younger generation that grew up in a time of relative abundance, animal products were so commonplace they failed to have much lustre.“I lived in Madrid as an Erasmus student and I found it hard to sustain my social life without eating meat … Whereas in Warsaw, I honestly cannot recall the last time I went to a restaurant that did not have a vegan option in their offering,” Michał Korkosz, AKA Rozkoszny, told me. Rozkoszny is one of the most prominent vegetarian food influencers in the country –with more than 700k followers on instagram. His cookbooks Fresh from Poland and Polish’d, which offer vegetarian twists on classic Polish recipes, have sold 230,000 copies and been translated into three languages.In some cases, Rozkoszny celebrates the plant-based foods of old Poland.Schabowy z kani(parasol mushroom schnitzel) is a traditional recipe, one known to seemingly every Polish grandma. Similar to a regular schnitzel, the mushroom is prepped, paneed, and then fried, often served alongside young boiled potatoes andmizeria(Polish tzatziki). In other cases, he takes traditional dishes and gives them a modern twist to make them vegan.Żurekis a popular soup traditionally made with stock of smoked pork ribs and served with various kinds ofkielbasa(sausage). But inżurekas proposed by Rozkoszny, the soup is made with miso – hardly a traditional Polish staple, but now widely available – and roasted mushrooms.Before becoming a bestselling author and influencer, Rozkoszny studied politics and sociology. He’s attuned to the fact that what you eat can be a political statement. He once conducted a study in which he interviewed a number of Polish MPs on their diets and tried to map their politics. “The more left-leaning a politician, the more likely they were to have a vegetarian diet and eat international cuisines,” he told me. A 2019 study by Ipsos showed similar results. Polish politicians were asked: “What actions are you willing to take to help fight climate change?” Among politicians from the left, 30% stated that they would give up meat, versus a mere 11% for the right wing Law and Justice party.“Veganism tends to be perceived as a pejorative term,” according to Anna Spurek, the chief operating officer at the Green REV Institute, Poland’s first vegan thinktank. “The meat lobby and interest groups use it to polarise society.” It has been a common refrain of rightwing politicians that veganism is anti-Polish – that it is a similar form of propaganda to the “LGBT agenda” – and that vegans are “insane and detached from reality,” she said.But veganism should be an idea that transcends neat political brackets. For one, Spurek thinks that the Polish idea ofsolidarność– solidarity, and the name of the political movement that helped bring down communism in Poland – can also include the concept of interspecies unity and green politics. And in a way veganism represents a return to Poland’s peasant roots, and a more conscious and healthy way of eating. Across Poland, even in rural areas, diets are increasingly plant-based.While veganism has been caught in Poland’s increasingly polarised politics, its impact on the culture is obvious everywhere.With Barclay Bram, I run a vegan Polish supper club in London called Bracia (it means brothers in Polish). Many people in London comment that this seems like something that could only happen here – and we see their surprise when we tell them how vegan-friendly Poland is. Recently, we’ve been doing events back in Warsaw. In February, we’re taking over Lotos, a traditional restaurant open since 1958, famous for itsnóżki w galarecie(legs in jelly – literally a chicken soup served cold so the collagen has become gelatinous, with veg and carrots suspended in it). The owner, Hanna Szymańska, told us she’s looking forward to putting out a vegan menu for the night: “You have to move with the times.”Karol Adamiak is a chef from Warsaw.

Experts and politicians hope someone else has the answerGaby HinsliffSuch a profound social change needs consensus and leadership. Those tasked with seeing this through are offering neitherFri 31 Jan 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 31 Jan 2025 09.26 ESTShareThere is something about the sound of Prof Sir Chris Whitty’s voice that inexorably takes me back. Whenever he speaks it’s hard not to think about R numbers and social distancing, masks and variants. His was the judgment we learned to trust in the days when the only certainty was that thousands were going to die; his the not-quite-inscrutable face we studied for clues that some politician had just said something stupid. For those reasons and more, I would very much like to know what the chief medical officer thinks about assisted dying for terminally ill people. Butwhen he came before the committeescrutinising this most sensitive of issues on Wednesday, he wouldn’t say.Whitty answered all questions posed about the proposed new law, including how accurately doctors can predict that someone has only six months left. (Not entirely, though he explained that they’re better at predicting that death will come in the foreseeable future – which seems more important here than whether it’s five, six or seven months exactly, though Whitty didn’t say the last part.) He wasn’t asked how well doctors can predict what that death might be like: how much pain or indignity it’s likely to involve, which might be equally hard to say but is what I’d want to know. (Some apply for assisted death without ever using the option, just to know it is there if needed.)But on the principle of whether doctors should be allowed to help patients die, Whitty said he must be neutral. It was “entirely for society” to decide.For much of Tuesday, the committee heard from people who studiedly had no view. The General Medical Council, which investigates complaints against doctors, is officially neutral. The British Medical Association moved from opposed to neutral after re-surveying members, which you might take to mean doctors are warming to this or – as the anti-assisted dying MP Danny Kruger hinted in committee – that more activist junior doctors are (polling suggests palliative care doctors remain overwhelmingly opposed).The prime minister is officially neutral, although everyone thinks he’sprivately in favour: medicine’s in-house journal, the BMJ, says it “continues to strive to represent all voices”. The committee heard this week from individuals with strong views – the British palliative care doctor Rachel Clarke, who is against, anAustralian counterpartevangelising about how well it works there – but many institutions remain uneasily on the fence precisely because there’s no consensus among members, making it impossible for one individual to speak authoritatively on behalf of the divided masses. But ultimately, that’s what making laws requires politicians to do.I still want to be convinced by this bill. My father’s was what people call a good death – peaceful, with enough warning for us all to be there – and why shouldn’t everyone have that? But a nagging worry remains about people feeling obliged to take the quick way out given pinched NHS resources, horribly patchy palliative care and guilt about burdening children. It is an unfortunate coincidence for this bill to run alongside yet another review of funding long-term care, leaving the idea that you could save everyone a fortune by taking yourself to Dignitas hanging unhelpfully over both.I believe in open parliamentary scrutiny, and hoped it would clarify things. But social change this profound needs both consensus – a sense that the country decisively wants change, that parliament is catching up with, not outrunning public opinion – and authoritative leadership. Currently it has neither.The clearest lead comes from the health secretary, Wes Streeting,who is vocally opposed. Though I understand the prime minister’s desire not to force his own views on an issue of conscience, in practice that means devolving the public handling of Kim Leadbeater’s bill to a backbench committee – some members more impressive than others – while ministers get dragged in behind the scenes anyway. This week brought reports that because the courts might be overloaded if judges heard every assisted dying application, professionalpanels could process them instead, a potential relaxation of safeguards said to have ministerial backing.As for consensus, though polls show abouttwo-thirds of the public in favour of assisted dying, polls also showtwo-thirds of young Americans are optimistic about the Trump presidency: let’s just say people often don’t know how they’ll feel about the future until they’ve been carefully walked through all possible ramifications.If society is to decide, who or what is society and how can we be sure what it thinks? There are models – the extensive public debate running up tothe Irish referendum on legalising abortionis one, the philosopherMary Warnock’s report on regulating IVFanother – which could have given parliament a more confident starting point. As it is, dozens of MPs are thought to have voted for the bill to reach this stage of scrutiny butreserved final judgment– a thoroughly sensible holding position, but one that reinforces the sense of everyone looking anxiously to someone else for a lead.Whatever this is it’s not the Irish model, which blew the argument wide open for everyone. And it’s not the Warnock one, which derived its intellectual and moral authority from establishing core principles that endured even as the science rapidly evolved. Is it so unreasonable to ask that the business of ending a life be handled with the same care and thought as the business of creating it?Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Alex [James, Blur bassist] was hanging out with her at the time and he’d invited me down to the studio. I think we were all in a high party mode at the time. I sat down and had quite a good banter with her straight away.We were quite lairy with each other. I said: “I can sit down and write a song, a perfect song.” And she said: “All right, well go on then.” And I sat down and I wrote the song which became Green Fields in one go. I don’t remember a lot more about that evening, but that’s how I met her.We’d always hang out with each other when I was in Paris. She’d hang out with all the Nick Cave people. I didn’t see her so much when she got back to London and the last few years I didn’t really see her at all.She had always been highly regarded in my family house. My mum had been obsessed with her album Broken English. I can clearly remember her dancing around the living room singing Why D’Ya Do It?And as a person she was just lovely, beautiful, wonderful. I’m just going through thepictures of her you’ve got in the Guardianand the people she worked with – that’s quite a roll call. I bet you everyone says they absolutely loved her.As for her qualities as a singer – well, she was authentic. She wasn’t the greatest of singers, but then again, that’s not what made her so special. It was the life lived through that voice, that journey from being this seemingly sweet, innocent beauty into this incredible sort of matriarch of indie.Was she motherly to me? No. We always had a laugh. She had an endless source of incredible, somewhat salacious stories about people who had all become much more circumscribed in their behaviour. She was always a bit cynical about how people were transformed into pillars of the establishment. But she was always true to her creed.Blur made a song with her, called Kissin Time. I only vaguely remember it. I mean, look, we were just another of her backing bands.Rufus Wainright: ‘I partied for a week with Marianne … and my mother’There was never anyone like her, and there never will be. There was a strange dichotomy between this will-o-the-wisp flowery beauty and this hard, gnarly rock’n’roll figure. She had these two strains, which were very strong, and yet kind of complete opposites.She was a big fan of my mother [Kate McGarrigle], of the McGarrigle sisters, and occasionally she would come to their shows. I met her backstage when I was a little kid, occasionally. But it was really through [esteemed music producer] Hal Willner that I got to know her: he would do these tribute shows, to Harry Smith or Leonard Cohen, and she would show up. I always loved her album Broken English, with [the lyrics from The Ballad of Lucy Jordan] “She realised she’d never ride/Through Paris in a sports car …”. But when she did a Kurt Weill tribute with Hal, and sang the Ballad of the Soldier’s Wife, that’s when she really clicked.And then itreallygelled when I started hanging out with Carrie Fisher, because Marianne and Carrie were very, very close. I had several wild evenings seated between them, kind of along for the ride. They were completely classic, original legends, who seemed to live in a universe all their own, and it was very decadent, incredibly funny and totally rock’n’roll. One of the craziest times was when I had a week of partying with Marianne and my mother, which I’m not going to get into too many details of – it was quite intense. I think I went to rehab two weeks later. But we’d talk about music, funny jokes, sex, the craziness of life.Marianne was someone who struggled with addiction for many years, and she never quite won that battle. It was always haunting her. So I think, even if she was sober, there was a little bit of the devil in her, always, and on one hand you were very attracted to that, and very inspired, but you also had to be careful.But the main thing about her, putting the drugs aside, is that she was a great fan of music. She was really affected by a wonderful song or brilliant performance. She clocked pretty early on that I was on a fairly good [career] track, and she really was excited for me. And it was when she came to me and said: “Rufus, you’ve really made it”, that I knew that I had. I knew there wasn’t a modicum of bullshit in her assessments in general.That’s what I most cherish about the relationship with her: when she was clear-eyed, and engaged artistically, she was such a rich judge of depth and meaning, and the true brilliance of what music can be. There was nothing cheap about her whatsoever.Explore more on these topicsDamon AlbarnMarianne FaithfullPop and rockRufus WainwrightfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And then there are moments when greatness sneaks up on you in the form of an 82-year-old Hollywood legend, materialising like a grumpy mirage, one metre from your face, during what you thought was a routine Disney presentation of new movies and TV shows.Harrison Ford is not a man one simply stumbles upon. He is a force of nature, a living relic of an era when leading men didn’t have to spend six months on a chicken-and-rice diet before taking their shirts off. And yet, here he is, looking suitably nonplussed with the entire concept of being on a stage, fielding questions alongside his Captain America: Brave New World co-stars in an impromptu Q&A with all the enthusiasm of a guy who somehow finds himself trapped in the world’s most boring hostage video.Harrison Ford’s MCU debut can wait. I prefer his whisky adsRead moreAnd perhaps this is the true magic of Disney, that an actor such as Ford can be persuaded to star as Thaddeus “Thunderbolt” Ross (now the new president of the USA) in aMarvelmovie about a guy with metal wings whose job is to save us all from a sinister genius whose head is rapidly outgrowing his ambitions (Tim Blake Nelson’s The Leader) and a gang of snake-themed terrorists who, despite their name, are disappointingly not actually snakes. It’s a classic Marvel dilemma: can Sam Wilson protect democracy, avert global catastrophe, and stop Harrison Ford from walking off set midway through a fight scene because he’s had enough of this nonsense?During his appearance at Disney’s 2025 slate presentation, Ford was typically gracious about the work done by the late William Hurt, who starred as Ross in previous Marvel and 20th Century Fox films but passed away in 2022. “I’m beginning to understand that this is a big family and I’m a small part of it,” he said with that habit of gruff understatement Ford-watchers have come to know and love. “The attraction of Marvel films for me is watching wonderful actors have fun and play. So when the opportunity came along I was grateful. It’s a new genre and audience for me, and it was fun.”The assembled audience is also treated to an exclusive clip of the new film, out 14 February, in which we already know Ford will end up transforming into the Red Hulk. It’s an action-packed set piece in which Wilson (Anthony Mackie) infiltrates an enemy base, and showcases the new winged Captain America suit, which we’re told was given to Sam by those helpful Wakandans. . Marvel has always been a franchise built on increasingly wobbly physics, but even the most generous audience might struggle to believe that a bloke with no serum and no billionaire gadgets could stand toe-to-toe with a bad guy whose brain is so large it requires its own postcode.View image in fullscreenEnough of this nonsense … Ford as Red Hulk/President Thaddeus Ross.Photograph: Marvel StudiosElsewhere on the slate of new movies, we were treated to an intriguing look at the upcoming Thunderbolts*, which increasingly looks like it will be Marvel’s answer to The Suicide Squad, but with fewer talking sharks and more ex-Avengers. The return of David Harbour’s Red Guardian and Florence Pugh’s Yelena Belova, and plenty of heavily accented eastern European badinage, might well be worth the price of admission alone. Wyatt Russell’s John Walker/US Agent looks as if he’s been through the mill since we last saw him in the Disney+ show The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, and there’s still no confirmation of why the Thunderbolts* have an asterisk next to their name. Will this one be Marvel’s new Guardians of the Galaxy? Or just another Eternals – a film that technically exists, gets released, but is then spoken about as often as Thor: The Dark World? We’ll find out in May when the movie hits cinemas.Also on the slate is Tron: Ares, starring Jared Leto as the titular AI, who arrives in the real world from the digital domain with an undisclosed but dangerous mission. Footage shown didn’t go that far beyond what we’ve seen in trailers, but it all looks visually splendid, with light cycles flying here there and everywhere through human cities. There’s no way of knowing, of course whether all this incredibly expensive-looking digital sorcery will end up getting lost in a logic vortex by the time the titles roll this October.Jeff Bridgesis back again, and let’s hope there’s a better part written for him this time than the two versions of Kevin Flynn that turned up fairly pointlessly in 2010’s Tron: Legacy.That’s the thing about living legends – it’s only worth wheeling them out for a late-stage encore if you can give them something meatier than looking vaguely mystical or, in Harrison Ford’s case, brilliantly playing the US president with all the enthusiasm of a man who just found out his Light Cycle got impounded.Explore more on these topicsFilmWeek in geekSuperhero moviesHarrison FordMarvelWalt Disney CompanyDisney+Jared LetofeaturesShareReuse this content"

Elizabeth Bennet as a YouTuber! As the BBC marks the author’s 250th anniversary with four-parter Miss Austen, we pick her finest television outingsMichael HoganFri 31 Jan 2025 10.52 ESTLast modified on Fri 31 Jan 2025 10.56 ESTShareIt is a truth universally acknowledged that every article aboutJane Austenmust begin with “It is a truth universally acknowledged”. Now we’ve got it out of the way, we can proceed.To mark the 250th anniversary of her birth, new Sunday night BBC drama Miss Austen stars Keeley Hawes as the novelist’s sister, Cassandra, and tackles the long-standing literary mystery of why Cassie burned her famous sibling’s letters after she died. But how does it stack up within the canon of small-screen Austens? We’ve cast our net wide to include riffs and reboots as well as straight-up bonnet-and-breeches adaptations. Here are our all-time top 20, ranked from Plain Janes to Superbrains …20.Mansfield Park(1983)Mansfield Park is one of Austen’s least adapted novels and this stodgy BBC Two six-parter – the first-ever screen version, remarkably – demonstrated why. An earnest Fanny Price shared a screen with her terribly-coiffed cousin (and, ick, love interest) Edmund, joined distractingly by Gorden Kaye. At which point viewers said: “Sacre bleu, isn’t that René From ’Allo ’Allo?”19.Clueless(1996-99)Hello? As if. OK, so we’re stretching the definition of Austen dramas a tad but this TV take on the Californian high school comedy was based on the film which was, in turn, inspired by Emma. Sadly, the series lacked either Alicia Silverstone or Paul Rudd. If it were the film it would rank way higher. But it totally isn’t. Whatever.18.The Real Jane Austen(2002)This serviceable docudrama starred former Brookside and Emmerdale actor Gillian Kearney as the author but it was narrator Anna Chancellor – a distant relative of Austen, fact fans – who stole the show. Erring more towards docu than drama, it was a little dry.17.Northanger Abbey(1987)Made for the BBC’s Screen Two strand, this feature-length adaptation of Austen’s Gothic pastiche was atmospheric enough, if lacking in chemistry between its leads. Without Austen’s arch narrator, it struggled for nuance and ye olde lolz.16.Sense & Sensibility(1981)A year after their second-best pop at P&P (see No 12), the BBC made this version of S&S with some of the same cast and crew. The visuals have dated, the humour clunks and it’s all a bit boringly beige.15.Sanditon(2019-2023)View image in fullscreenTheo James and Rose Williams as Sidney and Charlotte in Sanditon.Photograph: Simon Ridgway/Red Planet Pictures/ITVAdapted from Austen’s unfinished novel, this frothy saga set in the titular seaside resort never found its feet. Nor indeed its channel. After one series, it switched from ITV to BritBox. But later still aired on ITV, confusingly. Top-hatted hunk Theo James also bailed after the first series, so they had to retrospectively kill him off. Not ideal.14.Miss Austen Regrets(1987)Based on Austen’s surviving letters, this bittersweet quasi-biopic starred Olivia Williams as the author. Approaching her 40th birthday (she died at 41), Jane reflects wistfully on her life and loves, while helping her favourite niece Fanny (Imogen Poots) vet potential husbands. The new Miss Austen (minus the regrets) is way better.13.Sense and Sensibility(2008)View image in fullscreenA rare sunny day in Sense and Sensibility (2008).Photograph: BBC/PAProlific adaptor Andrew Davies’s stated aim with this sexed-up BBC three-parter was to make viewers forget Ang Lee’s 1995 film. Hattie Morahan and Charity Wakefield played the Dashwood sisters, with David Morrissey and Dominic Cooper as their love interests. The weather was so soggy during filming that Davies added a gratuitous shot of wet-shirted Dan Stevens chopping logs in the rain. A knowing nod to “that” Pride & Predge lake scene.12.Pride & Prejudice(1980)It would later be blown out of the Pemberley lake water by the peerless 1995 version, but this five-parter adapted by novelist Fay Weldon is unjustly forgotten. Faithful to the novel and slyly funny, it looks a little fusty by today’s standards but otherwise stands up well.11.Emma(1996)Overshadowed by the Gwyneth Paltrow version, which was released the same year, this ITV film pulled in 12 million viewers. Samantha Morton was great as Harriet Smith but Mark Strong’s receding hairline drew attention to the age gap between Mr Knightley and Kate Beckinsale’s girlish Emma. Everyone’s relentless rudeness to the servants may have been period appropriate but it was still annoying.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Blake Ritson made for a winningly gawky Edmund, while Hayley Atwell stole scenes as Fanny Price’s two-faced frenemy Mary.9.The Lizzie Bennet Diaries(2012-2013)The first ever web series to win an Emmy neatly reworked Pride & Prejudice in 100 snappy episodes, originally released on YouTube twice per week. A media student starts a vlog for her thesis, a wealthy dimwit called Bing Lee moves into a nearby mansion, his try-hard hipster mate Darcy visits and we’re off. Supporting characters get their own episodes. Characters’ tweets pop up on screen. Addictive and innovative.8.Persuasion(2007)One of Austen’s more subtle stories was adapted with fitting nuance for ITV. Sally Hawkins was superb as Anne Elliot, with diary entries in voiceover taking us inside her head. Rupert Penry-Jones smouldered as Captain Wentworth, while Julia Davis and Tobias Menzies lent sterling support. Understated, perhaps, but it looks like a work of unparalleled genius compared to the 2022Dakota Johnson aberration.7.Northanger Abbey(2007)View image in fullscreenTwilight with corsets … Carey Mulligan and Felicity Jones in Northanger Abbey.Photograph: Album/AlamyThis ITV iteration is underseen and underrated. Felicity Jones sparkled as the Goth-fixated heroine with a rampant imagination. A young Carey Mulligan caught the eye as her two-faced friend, while JJ Feild made for a dashing romantic hero. With its steamy dream sequences, it was like Twilight with corsets and carriages.6.Miss Austen(2025)Why did Cassandra Austen commit “an act of literary vandalism” by burning her sister’s letters? Cleverly adapted fromGill Hornby’s bestselling novel, this gorgeous new series persuasively suggests Cassandra has been misunderstood by history, and paints a poignant picture of sisterly love. The fantasticPatsy Ferranis heartbreaking in flashback as young Jane. In case you need further invitation, it also boasts an amusingly idiotic vicar and some adorable pygmy goats.5.Emma(2009)View image in fullscreenSwooningly soppy … Romola Garai and Jonny Lee Miller in Emma, 2009.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamySmug busybody Emma Woodhouse can be irritating in the wrong hands but Romola Garai’s terrific portrayal in this BBC series made viewers root for her. Jonny Lee Miller charmed as Mr Knightley, the great Michael Gambon twinkled as Emma’s father, and Miranda Hart provided comic relief as the wittering Miss Bates. Sensitively rendered and gently ironic with a swooningly soppy ending.4.Death Comesto Pemberley(2013)View image in fullscreenKiller cast … James Norton in Death Comes to Pemberley.Photograph: Album/AlamyAusten meets Agatha Christie anyone? This gripping three-part murder mystery, based on PD James’s novel, was a cosy-crime continuation of Pride & Prejudice. Handsome production values and a smart script made it a respectful mashup. A killer cast was led by Anna Maxwell Martin, Matthew Rhys and Jenna Coleman. It aired at Christmas and made for near perfect festive viewing. Pass the Quality Street, darling mother.3.Lostin Austen(2008)View image in fullscreenLost in Austen.Photograph: ITVThis playful fantasy followed Amanda (Jemima Rooper), a modern-day Austen fan who stumbled into the world of Pride & Prejudice through a portal in her bathroom. She joined the Bennet family and tried not to ruin everything, while Lizzie (Gemma Arterton) was stuck in 21st-century London. A riotously fun romcom ensued. Hugh Bonneville and Alex Kingston were a hoot as Mr and Mrs Bennet.2.Persuasion(1995)This feature-length BBC Two drama had the misfortune to drop in the same year as Andrew Davies’s Pride & Prejudice and Emma Thompson’s Sense & Sensibility, meaning it is often overlooked. Directed byRoger Michell, it deserves way better. Amanda Root captured the essence of Anne Elliot and Ciarán Hinds was downright magnificent as Captain Wentworth. A tender tale of lost love and second chances with an exquisite ending. It rightly won five Baftas. Aye aye, Captain.1.Pride & Prejudice(1995)“Ooh, Mr Darcy,” indeed. A nation came over aflutter and had to fan itself whenColin Firthemerged wet-shirted from a lake like a Penguin Classics edition of Daniel Craig. Yet this peerless series was far more than its signature scene. Screenwriter Andrew Davies deftly combined Austen’s social satire with unabashed romance. An audience of 10 million were rapt as sparks flew between Jennifer Ehle’s spirited Elizabeth Bennet and Firth’s aloof Fitzwilliam Darcy. The all-conquering series kickstarted the Austen-aissance, flinging open the ballroom doors to everything from Bridget Jones to Bridgerton.

Sam Wollaston travels to Costa Rica to see what it’s like – but things do not go to planSam WollastonFri 31 Jan 2025 08.00 ESTShareIam slithering across the forest floor, stealthily, silently, like a pit viper perhaps? But that would make me the predator and I think I’m the prey here. Actually – to be honest – slithering and stealthily are wishful thinking; it’s more like trying to creep, a little stooped, in an attempt to be less visible toBear Grylls, who is hunting me. Although – further honesty alert! – he’s not really hunting me. We’ll come to that.I’m trying to remember what Grylls said in his brief about how to avoid detection. A lot of things beginning with S: sound obviously, though it’s hard to be quiet here because the forest floor is covered in dry leaves and twigs. Smell is another; wish I’d gone easier on the Lynx Jungle Fresh – hopefully Bear is upwind. Shadow, silhouette and shine are also no-nos, some of which Grylls himself helped with by rubbing dirt on my face.Time for some explanation. Grylls has a new TV show, Celebrity Bear Hunt, on Netflix. Twelve celebs – including a Spice Girl, a Saturday, a Strictly judge, an Inbetweener and a former tennis player – are holed up in a beach house on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica. After instruction from Grylls, they are given tasks – build a shelter, jump off a moving boat, that kind of thing. If they fail, they get released into the Bear Pit, an area of terrifying and dangerous jungle, where they must evade capture as Grylls hunts them down. It’s the Scouts meets The Hunger Games, with Holly “Right, deep breath” Willoughby presenting.Netflix has invited a few journalists and influencers (I like to think I straddle the genres) to Costa Rica during filming, to try a task, have a chat with the main man, and – crucially – experience a Bear Hunt. Yes, I have come to Costa Rica to be hunted, in the jungle, by Bear Grylls. IfMel B, Una Healy, Shirley Ballas, Joe Thomas andBoris Beckercan, then I can too.View image in fullscreen‘I always want to be building people to learn skills’, says GryllsPhotograph: Netflix/PAI know, a long way to go for a stunt, and there are questions about whether it warrants the flight. But here’s my lame attempt at justification: I spent some time in Costa Rica in my 20s, teaching English, and here was an opportunity to return for the first time. I remember a few days in Santa Rosa national park on the Pacific coast, watching turtles lay eggs on the beach, sharks cruising in the river mouth, crocodiles fishing in the shallows. I actually quite fancy my chances against an Old Etonian TV presenter … Oh, but on arrival, we are told that Grylls won’t be hunting us after all, due to the heavy filming schedule, and “some safety concerns”, though it’s apparently safe enough for Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen. (Flamboyantroom-changerLLB is also a contestant. Completing the lineup: Steph McGovern, Leomie Anderson, Kola Bokinni, Danny Cipriani,Big ZuuandLottie Moss). We are promised a chat with Grylls, and taken to see the camp where the celebrities are living – while they’re off doing a task, so we don’t meet any.The camp is lovely, like a rustic yoga retreat. But I’m wondering why I had to have a rigorous medical – and every travel vaccination under the sun – to tour a beach house then sit in an air-conditioned portacabin.To be fair, the show does sound fun. I’m looking forward to Mel B’s encounter with a crocodile (who was more scared?) and Becker opening up about being banged up. It’s a big operation. Millions of Netflix dollars, a crew of 300. We visit some mudflats for a task – dismantle a shelter, then build it again. Mucky, not too tricky, I’m prepared, I don’t give up, I survive. C’mon, take me to that Pit …No, first a briefing from the health and safety team. Things to watch out for: snakes, spiders, scorpions, ticks, death apple trees … bloody hell, it is beginning to sound ominous. We put on helmets and harnesses, and a veteran named Scottie in full combat gear leads us into the Bear Pit.View image in fullscreenGrylls with Holly Willoughby and the celebrity contestants.Photograph: Tom Dymond/NetflixWe walk for a few yards and pause by a map. Suddenly I feel a tap on my shoulder … Oh, hello! Bear Grylls has snuck up, wearing black and carrying a coiled rope. He tells us about the stuff beginning with S that will give us away – sound, smell etc – before rubbing dirt on our faces. “To break up your shape, take the shine off you, as well as protect you from ants and mosquitoes.”Not that it matters, now that he’s not actually going to be hunting us. He does have time for a quick stroll through the Bear Pit, talking as we walk, hitting us with the Bear Grylls shtick. “I always want to be building people to learn skills …. Men and women want to be alert in life, be on the front foot … You’ve got thousands of years of primal stuff driving through you, these are natural skills for you.”When I ask if we’ve gone soft, the so-called snowflake generation, he talks about mettle. “It’s a muscle. If we try nothing, never step out of our comfort zone, your mettle muscle gets weak.” There is a snowflake state of mind, but it’s not generational or encapsulated by young people. “As chief scout [he led the young person’s groupuntil July 2024] I see young people I’m incredibly impressed by – resilient, motivated, positive, determined to change the world, combat climate change, start businesses. They’re not just going to coast. But if you don’t get any training in resilience you get weak.”Do we need survival skills – building shelters or crawling through the forest – in the modern world, though? They are transferable, he says. “It’s a reflection of how to be tough in everyday life.” We come to a trap that has been set in the path, covered with leaves, which Grylls demonstrates using a young influencer. Stand there, and … whoosh! Suddenly there’s an influencer hanging in the air in a net, like a trawler’s haul. Not so influential up there, are you?There’s a lesson here, says Grylls: don’t get track happy. “The easy path never leads anywhere good.” He also has a thing about people living in green, amber and red. “Green is walking along looking at your phone, not concentrating, someone could be walking past naked and you wouldn’t notice. It’s how most people live – but we didn’t become the dominant species by living in green. Then you have amber, when you’re more alert, aware and looking around you. And red which is high intensity, like a soldier going through the door of a building. You can’t live in red for long, like 30 seconds. This place is about trying to live alert, when to push, when to hold back.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Bear Pit doesn’t seem that wild or terrifying; we’ve walked along a path for a few minutes from the road, it’s scrubby rather than thick forest. I think he senses our disappointment – that we’ve been put on the easy path and it’s not going anywhere good. “Do you want to have a little experience of stalking?”Yes please Bear. We need to hurry, he’s not got much time, he’ll go over there by that tree on the path, we’ll try to sneak up on him without being seen. “Use the cover, be smart, I’m going to see who gets the closest to me, without me spotting you,” he says. “Like Grandmother’s Footsteps …”Seriously?! I’ve had every health check available, been vaccinated to the eyeballs, and come all the way to Costa bloody Rica to play Grandmother’s Footsteps!That’s when I meet a man called Diego behind a tree – who agrees to swap headwear, giving me his green cap, which has bits of foliage sticking out of it. A bike mechanic from San Jose, he’s been hired to make sure Mel B et al are OK. Quite a few of the trees have people behind them. Oh, and here’s a fence. You know what, this Bear Pit is less scary than the London park at the bottom of my road, and considerably smaller. One of the health and safety team tells me it’s 500 or 600 metres long, and 300 metres wide at its widest, and it’s someone’s private land. “Not jungle by any means,” admits Scottie.I know, it shouldn’t be a massive surprise: reality TV isn’t quite as it seems. And I’m sure it will look the part on the telly. But I am shocked at just how unwild the Bear Pit is. It’s a little strip of privately owned dry woodland, just off the road to the beach. There’s a house just over there – I can hear the dog.Even wearing Diego’s leafy headgear, my lame stoop and underfoot crunching mean I don’t get very close and I’m soon spotted. “Behind the tree,” Grylls calls, from the path. The influencer who a short time ago was hanging in the air in a net wins, proving perhaps that gen Z has plenty of mettle (or is good at Grandmother’s Footsteps). A couple of all-terrain vehicles arrive (there’s also a track into the Bear Pit) to take us the short way back to the production base, air-conditioned cabins and a fridge full of cold drinks.Some of the celebrities are due on site for an actual Bear Hunt. We’re herded politely but smartly on to a bus and whisked away to avoid any unscheduled encounters.The following day, the flight out of Guanacaste Airport takes us up the Pacific coast and over Santa Rosa national park. It’s a vast carpet of green where the trees don’t have health and safety people hiding behind them; where the squawking, chatter and howling comes not from crew radios and celebrities on the hunt for fame, but from macaws and monkeys. Where the crackle of breaking twigs is not Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen crashing through the undergrowth but a herd of peccaries on the prowl.Celebrity Bear Hunt is on Netflix on Wednesday 5 February.Explore more on these topicsBear GryllsReality TVfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Bridget Jones fans have been grieving since 2013, when Helen Fielding’s third novel, Mad About the Boy, was published sans Bridget’s hot human-rights lawyer husband. The outcry made front page news (as did the copies that wereaccidentally printedwith 40 pages from David Jason’s memoir). People could not believe that romcom’s favourite reindeer-jumper-wearing dish, who proved that –ding dong!– nice mendokiss like that, was no more.“Someone ran out of the pub shouting: ‘You’ve murdered Colin Firth!’”Fielding says over a video call, tulips arranged on a huge wooden table in the background, as well they should in a boho-posh Primrose Hill kitchen. “I just want to point out that he is fictional. Colin Firth is not dead.”His reaction after being told over the phone? “‘You’ve murdered the wrong one; it should have been Mrs Grant,’” grins Fielding. Grant plays Firth’s love rival, the publishing scoundrel Daniel Cleaver. “They call each other Mrs Firth and Mrs Grant.”But how didRenée Zellweger, who has played Bridget for nearly 25 years, feel? “Rotten!” she says, when we meet a few days after Fielding’s call. “I was a crazy person mourning this fictional character. I was weeping. It was also for that shared experience with Colin: seeing him in his suit and beautiful coat, with his briefcase, looking dapper and very Mark Darcy. This is the end … we won’t get to do this any more.”Today, the only blue thing about Zellweger as she nestles in a Claridge’s hotel suite is her invitingly fluffy jumper, matched with hotel slippers (even double Oscar winners don’t pass on a freebie). She is warm and softly spoken as she pours water for everybody, including her new co-starsChiwetel EjioforandLeo Woodall. But she also has a mischievous laugh that can be heard right down the corridor. It erupts surprisingly frequently: when she notices that journalists are eating cookies with her face on them (“I’ve never craved a cookie with my face on it before, but suddenly I do!”), and when Ejiofor explains that I am talking about children’s toys and not sex toys (“I did pause”).View image in fullscreenZellweger as Bridget Jones in Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy.Photograph: Jay Maidment/Universal PicturesIt’s impossible to think of anyone else playing Bridget, but Zellwegger’s Texas twang is a reminder of the scepticism in 2001 that an American could play this British icon. Bridget had started life as the star of Fielding’s “silly” Independent column in 1995, but she quickly became London’s ultimate thirtysomething singleton, as readers followed her urban family’s chardonnay-fuelled antics.The column took swipes at what society expected women to be (“You career girls! Can’t put it off forever, you know: tick-tock-tick-tock,”Aunt Unatells her, at a tarts-and-vicars party). The column became a bestselling book series and then a film franchise, in which Zellweger perfectly captured Bridget’s everywoman essence, as she dodged “smug marrieds”, dealt with “fuckwits” and navigated relationships with Daniel (who told her: “Like your tits in that top”) and Mark (who told her: “I like you just the way you are”).Back then, Zellweger said that sherelated to Bridget’s struggleswith the social pressure on women to get married and have children. She is adamant that things have changed since: “To choose not to have children isn’t that exceptional, is it? I think it’s quite common.”What would she say to her thirtysomething self now? “Girl, slow down. Moving from place to place, constantly living out of your suitcase – I never unpacked until I was probably 41.” It explains why she took a six-year hiatus in 2010; still, she says she doesn’t regret it. “There was a lot to treasure.” That said, during that period, she adds: “I scrutinised myself. And because I wasn’t taking care of myself in my 30s, I didn’t make great choices all the time … It’s really easy to forget yourself in the mix.”Here she is, then, ahead of the London premiere of the fourth film (2016’s Bridget Jones’s Baby wasn’t based on a novel). Bridget and Mark had two children, got married and lived happily ever after … for a while. Now, Bridget is a widow and looking after Billy and Mabel. Unlike the other films, Mad About the Boy is a tear-jerking exploration of grief. But Bridget also experiences the joys and struggles of being a single mother. “She loves the children just as they are, in the way that Mark said: ‘I love you just as you are.’ Those two children know that and they share her playfulness,” says Fielding. But now, she is ready to take the next steps – ie have sex with someone. She writes in her diary: “Bridget Jones, it’s time to live.”It is the chapter in Bridget’s life that is closest to Fielding’s own, says Zellweger. Kevin Curran, Fielding’s ex-partner and father of her two children, died of cancer in 2016, the same year that her friendCarrie Fisherdied. Fielding started writing the screenplay during the pandemic, when loss was even more palpable. “I wanted to show how you can feel both a sense of humour and a sense of perspective – your friends, your community, your resilience can get you through these things and you can still laugh,” she says.The good times roll as Bridget returns to her hotshot TV producer job, drinks blue cocktails (a throwback to her infamous blue soup disaster) and meets toyboy Roxster (Woodall) on Tinder (“Bridget isn’t going to be anyone’s old bat,” says Fielding). It is joyous to see a fiftysomething mother enjoying a whirlwind of romance and sex – even if a child’s doll left in the bed gets in the way (“How did that happen?” asks Roxster. “I used protection”). There’s even a sexy swimming pool scene: Roxster dives in to save a tiny dog and – in a nod to Mark – rips off his wet white shirt. “I felt some pressure for that day, because I knew that it was all about kind of being ogled,” says Woodall. “What if I was un-ogle-able?”“It’s not a bad job, is it?” adds Zellweger. “It’s not a bad day at work.”View image in fullscreenMad about the boys … Bridget Jones (Zellweger) with(left)Mr Walliker (Ejiofor) and(right)Roxster (Woodall).Composite: Jay Maidment/Universal PicturesAnother potential new love comes in the form of Billy’s science teacher, Mr Wallaker (Ejiofor). He is stern and sensible, but intrigued by Bridget’s free-spiritedness; he ends up ripping his top off, too. Is this the Captain Von Trapp that Bridget has been dreaming about all this time? “That’s great!” Zellweger squeals. “Maybe they should have run over the hill together?” Ejiofor adds.This is Oscar-nominee Ejiofor’s first time as the romantic lead, but given thathe once said love is “as vital as breathing”, and was chivalrous enough to move my heavy chair closer to the interview circle, the schmaltz has been inside him all along. “I’ve been sitting there quietly, patiently waiting,” he says, laughing.And yet Bridget still needs to defend her decisions – as in her 30s, she feels like “a duck out of water” at a dinner party where the other guests are smug marrieds. It suggests that women can’t win, that even widows are social outsiders. But in the film, when the men make comments such as: “Still on your own?” and: “You’re still in good nick,” mouthy mate Shazza (Sally Phillips) shuts them up. “What we’re showing is that women can win and smug marrieds have got to stop asking intrusive questions like that,” says Fielding of the scene. “There is no one way to live.”Bridget has inspired these discussions ever since Fielding first put pen to paper. Some womencelebrate Bridget’s candourabout her calorie-, work- and romance-related anxieties; othersfind those obsessions anti-feminist. “In the first book, there is the line: ‘There is nothing so unattractive to a man as strident feminism,’ which was an ironic joke,” Fielding says. “But if you’re not a fan of humour and irony, that is going to annoy you.”One thing that everyone agrees on is that there is no male equivalent of Bridget, someone who expresses men’s anxieties and aspirations. James Bond, I suggest. “But do guys see themselves as Bond after leaving the cinema?” asks Ejiofor.Given how critical some of the response to Bridget has been, it may be surprising that Zellweger – who in 2016penned an excellent essayon the tabloids’ sexist fixation with her appearance – thinks the sheer volume of the discourse is positive. “Isn’t that a cool thing that Helen created this character that people want to talk about for 30 years?” she says. “I think people see themselves in her imperfections, vulnerability and fear. Her authenticity and transparent humanity make it easy for folks to feel that ‘I know her’.” As for the bad stuff? “I don’t know anything about that, because I don’t look for it.”Anyway, there are more urgent things to discuss, such as where are Bridget’s massive knickers? Zellweger recently said the rumour is that Grant took them home.View image in fullscreenHugh Grant and Casper Knopf in Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyGrant does return in Bridget’s life, fans will be relieved to know, after going missing in the third film. This time, Daniel is Bridget’s babysitter, but still trying it on with nurses in his 60s. But Grant also insisted on rewriting his backstory to include an estranged son. “I think if he had just been walking up and down Kings Road chatting up girls for 24 years, it would have been hard to endure him,’ he toldVanity Fair.How does such a badly behaved character remain so endearing? “That’s the Hugh Grant magic right there,” says Zellweger. “Even though he’s dastardly, you can’t help but love him.”But does Grant have the knickers? “Someone told me they were signed and sold,” says Zellweger. “Maybe he’ll wear them to the premiere?” laughs Ejiofor. Or perhaps they are part of a random film fan’s private collection, I suggest.The awkward silence is a deathly way to end things. “Sorry,” I say, in an excruciating Bridget moment.Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy is released on 13 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsRenée ZellwegerBridget Jones' DiaryHelen FieldinginterviewsShareReuse this content"

But on fourth album Jupiter, she’s learned to ‘ride the waves’Fri 31 Jan 2025 06.32 ESTShareNao is trying to articulate how it feels to be on the verge of releasing a new album. When this thing that’s been yours and yours alone has to be launched into the world. “It feels really similar to being pregnant,” the 37-year-old mum of two decides. Her answer feels apt; we’re currently sitting in an east London cinema cafe hemmed in by buggies while a mum-and-baby screening of erotic thrillerBabygirlplays next door. “It’s really exciting in the beginning, then it gets a bit tedious,” she continues. “And you’re stuck in the process because you need to finish it. Get it out.” Sometimes, she says, it can also be just as painful.Not that you’d know it from listening to this month’s fourth album, Jupiter, a typically featherlight concoction of pillow-soft soul, experimental R&B and airy acoustic ruminations all anchored by her angelic, otherworldly voice. It also carries just a dash of the electronic-leaning “wonky funk” that saw Nao (born Neo Joshua) hailed as one to watch when she emerged in 2015. But Jupiter’s overarching sense of contentment has been hard won after years spent battling an illness that prevented her from touring.Jupiter is a sequel of sorts to 2018’s Grammy and Mercury prize-nominated second albumSaturn, an emotionally tumultuous opus named after the astrological concept of Saturn return, a sort of crossroads a person reaches roughly every 27 to 29 years, before entering the next stage of their life. While that album dealt with the ups and downs of her 20s, 2021’sAnd Then Life Was Beautiful, released into post-pandemic’s upside-down world, searched desperately for joy. Shortly before it came out, Nao revealed she’d been diagnosed with myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), a disabling condition that left her profoundly fatigued and darkened by what she calls a low-grade depression. “You can only do a small percentage of what you were capable of,” she says, nursing a coffee, a rare treat while following a low-carb diet that helps her recovery (she will return to touring later this year). “For example, walking to meet you here, I’d probably have to take a taxi home. And then I’d be in bed for the rest of the day.”View image in fullscreenNao.Photograph: Lillie EigerJupiter’s title was very specifically chosen because it’s “the planet of joy”, she says. “It’s a planet of good fortune and good luck. And I really wanted to bring that into my life.” She singles out the balm-like Happy People, which glides around a sun-kissed Afrobeat lilt, as a key song. “It came from realising who was important to me in my life,” she says. “I think when you’re in your 20s you’re trying to make as many friends as possible. Then you get into your 30s, you have big transitions in life, and actually the fewer people the better.”Her candour is refreshing. When I say that she is underrated and that collaborations with the likes of Stormzy, Mura Masa, Chic, Lianne La Havas, Disclosure and Ezra Collective should have made her a household name, she doesn’t see it as a compliment. “It’s like saying you’re good enough to succeed but you haven’t quite yet. I get a lot of comments saying I’m underrated, which is fine, but I’ve had to work a lot on what my idea of success is.” While she’d love to “stream in the billions”, she’s also happy with where she’s at. “I just have to become present and think actually you’re doing all right. You’re all the things you wanted to be; you’re, I hope, still credible; you make the music that you want; you still sell out your tours, but also you’re a mum and you get to pick up your kids from school and drop them off.”She thinks doing things at her own pace – she didn’t sign a record deal until she was 27 – has helped with her outlook. Born in Nottingham and raised mainly in London, Nao saw her early music career take place behind the scenes. At 18 her voice won her a place at London’s Guildhall School , but she struggled to believe in herself. “I’m not really sure how I got in,,” she says. She compares it to the 2014 filmWhiplash, in which a jazz drummer is pushed to the brink by his instructor. “I was working at 5am in the morning to basically not be embarrassed and not be humiliated by the teachers. That definitely stayed with me for a long time.” She felt she had to “work and overwork and overwork to be on top of it.”She stuck it out and four years later started taking any job in music she could, be it teaching, or as part of a beatbox group, or singing backing vocals for the likes of Jarvis Cocker. In 2014, a manager discovered her singing in a club and signed her. From there she started cultivating a fanbase via SoundCloud, before releasing her first EP in 2014 on her own label. After signing that label to RCA, she released her electronic-leaning debut album, 2016’sFor All We Know, on a wave of hype. The album peaked inside the Top 20, which meant the pressure mounted around its follow-up, Saturn. Asked at the time how she was feeling about that album’s release, she admitted to being nervous, contemplated retirement, and joked that if people hate the album she’ll “just die”.“Oh my gosh, did I say that?” she says now. “It’s such a snapshot into where my brain was at that time. You have all the hype and the engine kind of just went on its own like, ‘Oh, this is what’s happening to me.’ On the second album, that hype machine dies down and you’re left with, ‘OK, what? Fuck. Does anyone actually like me any more? What’s left of me?’”Over time, as her 30s rolled out in front of her, she made the decision to stop caring about other people’s expectations. During the promotion for And Then Life Was Beautiful, she told a journalist she’d avoided songs about motherhood because she couldn’t write about it “in a way that wouldn’t put people off!” Pregnant with her second child while recording Jupiter, the album’s stripped-back highlight 30 Something features the lyric “I love my baby daughter, sometimes motherhood’s whatever”.“We don’t get the full picture of what being a parent is until you’re in it,” she says, as we become surrounded by mums scurrying out of the film holding crying babies. “My own experience was all emotions all at once. It was like: ‘This is fucking amazing, the best thing that’s ever happened to me’, and also, literally five minutes later, ‘This is really shit’.”With a new album that reflects a relatable urge to seek out light in a dark world, I assumed she’d have some pearls of wisdom for her younger self, that one who felt like giving up just before Saturn’s release. After a long pause and a deep breath she looks me in the eye. I’m braced for a nugget of positivity, but her answer is far more realistic. “I’d just tell her, you know, it doesn’t get any better,” she states. “You’re going to have to chill out and ride the waves. You’re going to have to get more resilient … And it’s not that deep. Maybe that’s what I’d say; it’s not that deep.”Jupiter is out on 21 February.Explore more on these topicsMusicR&BfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Greenwich Village club hosted stand-ups like Ray Romano and Jon Stewart early in their careers, and although tourists now flock to the venue in the hope of seeing an A-lister do a surprise drop-in, young comics can still get their start there. Case in point: last weekend,Madonnadid a set at the Comedy Cellar. You may be able to draw nearly 2 million people to Rio’s Copacabana beach for a concert, but in the cutthroat world of comedy, you still have to start from the bottom.A report in the Sun said that Madonna tested out material for about 30 minutes, and that she was accompanied to the club by her friend Amy Schumer, who later went on Howard Stern to big up Madonna’s act. “She has something in her that’s interested in standup and she knows that, like anything else, you have to work really hard on it. She is kind of working on her set and it’s not cringey,” Schumer told Stern. “She’s funny! She’s got jokes. She’s got things to say. She’s got tea.”Becoming Madonna review – a megastar’s extraordinary ascent to pop royaltyRead moreThis news was, like most news about Madonna, met with derision and scepticism from many corners of the internet. Some of these critiques are valid – from young comics, for example, complaining about a comedy dilettante getting coveted stage time at the snap of a finger – but most, sceptical about the idea that someone like Madonnacould ever befunny,are less convincing. To be a fan of Madonna is to know that she is a genuine kook and, at the very least, someone who’s always been interested in using humour to puncture the sanctimonious, impenetrable vibe that most pop stars give off.The press tour around Madonna’s turn in Evita and the album that followed, 1998’s Ray of Light, may have enshrined in the cultural memory the image of her as someone only willing to talk about spirituality and inner serenity, but really, that only lasted a few brief years. Madonna is rarely remembered as a great actor, but in films like Desperately Seeking Susan and A League of Their Own, Madonna is capable of seeming spunky, weird, and skin-crawlingly dry, often in the space of a single sentence, playing off co-stars Rosanna Arquette and Rosie O’Donnell, respectively, with the kind of over-the-top goofiness that only a true ham can muster.Directly after Ray of Light, it seemed like Madonna was sick of being taken so seriously, and enlisted the most ridiculous of comedians to help her loosen up. Sacha Baron Cohen’s Ali G character was, amazingly, a key figure in the promotion of her 2000 album Music, appearing in the video for the title track and introducing her as Maradona on a European music show; a year earlier, she cut Beautiful Stranger, a song for Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, and seduced Powers at the end of the track’s music video. In moments like these, the line between outlandish comedy character and over-the-top pop star became thinner than ever.Later in her career, comedy became a way for Madonna to communicate more directly with her fans and the public. In 2012, after being dogged for years by comparisons to Lady Gaga, Madonna incorporated a mashup of her track Express Yourself and Gaga’s very similar song Born This Way into the set list of her MDNA Tour, adding in the hook of She’s Not Me for good measure. A few years later, she appeared onstage in a full clown costume for a show in Melbourne titled Tears of a Clown, in which bawdy jokes cut the tension between acoustic renditions of sad deep cuts and Elliott Smith covers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

None of the above moments suggest that Madonna would make a particularlygoodstandup, either – for proof, just check out the time she tested material on The Tonight Show.

Mostly we turn it on ourselves’: Neko Case on songwriting, survival – and her mother’s faked deathElle HuntThe Grammy-nominated indie icon has written her memoir, and confronted a shocking deception by her family. But now, she says, it’s the music industry that really angers herFri 31 Jan 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 31 Jan 2025 05.43 ESTShareWhen the singer-songwriterNeko Casewas growing up in poverty in rural Washington, it did not occur to her to question her parents or their indifference to her. “Kids don’t think things are weird,” Case, 54, says with a shrug. “It’s like: well, this is my reality, so this is what reality is.” So when Case’s father picked her up from her grandmother’s house one day and told her that her mother had died, from terminal cancer she had kept secret, Case believed him. She attended her mother’s wake with her father, her relatives on her mother’s side and 20 or 30 other mourners.About a year and half later, Case left school to find her dad waiting unexpectedly. He informed her that her mother was at home, apparently back from the dead. Case was told that her mother had faked her death to spare her family the pain of a drawn-out demise, then had been miraculously cured in Hawaii. At the time, she was so overjoyed – and so young – that she didn’t doubt their story. It wasn’t until she was a “full-blown adult” that she grasped the magnitude of the deception – and the fact that her mother, whose description of her illness would often change, had probably never had cancer. “I never even thought it was weird until I told somebody the story one day,” she says.View image in fullscreenCase on stage at the Newport Folk Festival in Rhode Island, July 2023.Photograph: Douglas Mason/Getty ImagesShe never asked why the death was faked, but her mother continued to come in and out of her life in the ensuing years. “That was her grift: to make me want her and then disappear all over again,” Case writes. “That’s what I can’t forgive.” Eventually she decides, in a moment of horrifying clarity, her mother faked her death “because she didn’t want me”.The “incredibly long time” it took Case to make sense of her childhood reflects the self-deception she had to cultivate to survive it. “When you’re a kid and you love your parents, you will go to any lengths to believe the most outrageous lies,” she says now. “And you will continue the lies yourself, and embellish them and grow them, like they’re your tomato plants, or something – you don’t even know you’re doing it.”In Case’s new memoir, The Harder I Fight the More I Love You, she attempts to impose order on her tangled roots – from her childhood, characterised by poverty and neglect, to her escape into music via the Seattle punk scene. She didn’t want to write a memoir, she says; that was just what she got offered money to produce: “It was during the pandemic and I was in dire straits financially.”But she had no misgivings about putting the story in print. “I’m an oversharer – I tell my friends these things all the time, and it helps,” Case says. “It doesn’t necessarily make anything better, per se, but it feels good to have somebody hear you.”Simultaneously a solo artist and a member of the Canadian supergroup the New Pornographers, Case is known for her distinctive, flaming contralto and gothicAmericana. Two solo albums, 2009’s Middle Cyclone and 2013’s The Worse Things Get, the Harder I Fight, the Harder I Fight, the More I Love You, were nominated for Grammys; in 2013, she formed the supergroup case/lang/veirs with kd lang and Laura Veirs. Her lyrics – filled with folkloric wisdom, wildlife and natural imagery – invoke a world where human logic ranks second to animal instinct, and “civilisation” is only a flimsy veneer over red-in-tooth-and-claw reality. Case displays those same carnal instincts when she says she is smelly (“so I’m glad this is a Zoom”) and discombobulated by menopause. Her trademark auburn hair is magnificently intermingled with grey; her forearms are tattooed with the phrases “Scorned as timber” and “Beloved of the sky”.Until The Worse Things Get …, her sixth album, Case said she never explicitly wrote songs about her life. Her memoir, however, reveals her love of animals, music and mythology as lifelines through her “feral” childhood. Case was born in Virginia, the result of a backseat fumble between two poor teenagers who divorced after a few years of marriage. Both parents drank; her dad smoked and grew marijuana. Case spent hours alone in inhospitable residences and was so hungry that she would eat uncooked rice and flour. Bored and lonely at her dad’s, she would kill time by biting the heads off fleas.Yet hers is not a misery memoir: Case tells these stories with honesty, heart and deadpan humour. “When you tell people how poor you were when you were growing up, they are like: ‘Oh, that’s so sad’ – but it was actually pretty funny,” she says.There was also trauma. At 14, Case was raped by the 19-year-old brother of a schoolmate. At the time, she blamed herself. Now, she directs her rage at the adults who failed to protect her – chiefly her mother. “There’s a certain amount of saturation that happened to me, at a very young age, of: ‘I cannot take this; this is too much for a human being,’” Case says matter-of-factly. The trauma remains, as does the rage. “I come to it quicker than other people do, but I’m also better at controlling it than I used to be. People don’t talk a lot about women’s rage, or women’s violence – but it’s a real thing. It’s very real, and mostly we turn it on ourselves.”As a child, Case quickly forgave her mother’s deception, but their relationship deteriorated with time and her mother’s descent into alcoholism. At 16, Case requested a legal emancipation; her mother readily agreed. With no money and only short-term accommodation, Case ended up dropping out of high school, too hungry to learn. “Of course, I didn’t make that connection when I was young – I thought I was a loser.”View image in fullscreenThe New Pornographers, with Case (second left).Photograph: Jennifer JimenezMusic was Case’s salvation long before she had any idea of making it herself. She embedded herself in the Seattle and Portland punk scenes, taught herself to drum and started playing in bands. After moving to Vancouver for art school, Case founded Maow: a scrappy, pop-punk three-piece that stood out for their homemade fur bikinis. In 1997, she released her debut solo album, The Virginian, and started playing with the New Pornographers. But finding success did not make up for the struggle, Case says. “The idea that you have to suffer to be an artist, I think it must have been made up. It’s like some sort of trust-fund tourism – ‘I’ve really got to be authentic; I need to understand that squalor.’” If her upbringing had been stable, “I would have been a much better musician, because I’d have started earlier – I would have had people backing me up and some sort of safety to experiment.”Case’s father died in 2004 from a heart attack and long-term alcoholism. She cut all contact with her mother in 2010; Case does not know if she is alive or dead (although she has long allowed the latter to stand in the press). Case still feels the impact of her upbringing in her anxiety. “I have an incredibly hard time trusting people, and also there’s a contradiction, where I trust too easily.” Although she is in a long-term relationship and has a teenage stepdaughter, she never considered becoming a parent: “There’s no way.”I don’t really feel like a woman or a man – I’m kind of this other thingBut Case’s anger is tempered by hard-won compassion and awareness of the impact of intergenerational trauma. Both her parents were allegedly sexually abused as children. Her mother was raped again when Case was 18 and still in denial about her own assault. Although she had largely processed her past by the time she started writing her memoir, pulling the threads together made them easier to carry, says Case. “I was able to put a lot of things in the book … [Now] I know where it is and I can go check it out if I need to; I don’t have to walk around with it all the time.”She sees herself as the family firefighter, surveying the damage done and deciding: “This ends here. I’m chopping that shit down, I’m putting that out, I’m going to do a controlled burn over there: this is not going to go on any more.”“Yet Case would never have written the memoir if music still paid the bills. “I used to get royalty cheques and they would get me through lean times – not any more,” Case says grimly. Alongside promoting the book, she is staging rehearsals for the musical adaptation of Thelma & Louise she has spent eight years writing with the film’s screenwriter, Callie Khouri.It is rewarding work, but her struggle to stay afloat financially “is a brand new anger that I’m trying to learn how to deal with”, Case says. She is scathing about the creative industries’ structural exploitation of artists: “The way things are set up benefits them, but not you. Be it publishing, music or theatre – each one of them has their disgusting pitfalls.”View image in fullscreenCase (right) with Laura Veirs and kd lang in Portland in 2016.Photograph: Don Ryan/APBut Case remains committed to the possibility of positive change – and the potential of productive, “protective rage” to achieve it. She has felt inspired by younger generations’ pushback against gender roles and a “patriarchal, colonial” status quo. “It’s heroic; I feel absolutely liberated by the way people talk.” Were she coming of age today, it is “pretty likely” that she would identify as non-binary, Case says. “I don’t really feel like a woman or a man, necessarily – I’m kind of this other thing.”As a young person, she felt very conflicted about gender: “I couldn’t put those things into words”. Now, she has finally gained mastery over her rage and clarity over her targets – just in time for Donald Trump’s second presidency. Case believes the attacks on women and transgender people reflect not the US public, but “a very small group of very rich people who are pandering to fundamentalism. It’s just such a great way to get people angry and to control them … and people are absolutely going to suffer.”Her own strategy, for the next four years and beyond, is to refuse to be cowed. “I’m not giving them my fear, I’m not going to be depressed, I’m not going to be afraid – I’m just going to fight like hell and I’m going to love doing it.”View image in fullscreenAn extract from The Harder I Fight the More I Love YouAbout a year after I’d moved to Illinois I was standing on a stage, and my field of vision was moving inward, the edges blurring. The summer sun was hitting my body like a hammer, and a wave of nausea surged up in answer. None of this was how I expected to feel playing at [country institution] the Grand Ole Opry.When my agent called to tell me I’d been asked to play there, in 2001, I was floored. My gramma Mary Ann had been a huge fan of the Opry stars all her life. I was so proud and nervous, and I couldn’t wait to tell her. When the date finally came, it was the height of the hottest July. Boiling in Chicago and only getting hotter as the band and I crept down the cracked highway south toward Nashville.When we finally pulled up to Opryland, it was 98 degrees [37C] and not a cloud in the sky. The sun was punishing, and the humidity swamp-aquatic. Even breathing was hard. I had to steel myself to keep on task as we unpacked the van. “Load-in” was to an outdoor stage right next to a barbecue pit – it was more like we were playing adjacent to the Opry than in it, which was a little disappointing but ultimately no big deal. It had a roof but no walls, so the Nashville sun muscled across it at different angles as the day went on, magnetised to the black stage.We did our soundcheck, then retreated to the air-conditioning of the actual Opry building to get ready. I was in my orange “Wilderness Pilots Do It in the Bush” T-shirt, which had a cute cartoon beaver with pontoons on his feet. It was just a silly thing, but I was quickly pulled aside and told my shirt wasn’t appropriate for the Opry’s family atmosphere. I was a little embarrassed. “This isn’t what I was gonna wear,” I said, a little grossed out by this random employee’s seriousness.I’m not stupid, I thought.Yeesh!But never mind. As I moved through the building’s backstage, I saw Little Jimmy Dickens and Jan Howard. I was star-struck. I was such a fan and thrilled to be introduced by our guide. Little Jimmy was gracious and Jan Howard looked at me like I was a piece of sweaty cheese rind. I didn’t let it get me down – I was at the Opry to make my gramma proud.Showtime came and we hit the sweltering stage, the sun now beating directly in front of it. The barbecue pit was smoking like a steam engine. Organ meats sizzling away in the pit, me and my band sizzling away on the black skillet of the stage. I have never before or since been that hot. There was no water anywhere.I was miserable but trying to keep a brave face, so sweaty that my hands kept slipping off the neck of my guitar. We made it through two-thirds of our set and finally I was hallucinating. The world had gone dark in that tunnelled way it does when you’re about to pass out. That I might puke started to seem more and more like a real possibility. I leaned into the mic and said, “Thank you!” to the audience, calling the break before the encore early.I knew I needed water – badly. As I reached the exit stairs, a woman barred my path. She lookedveryserious.“I need 40 more minutes up there!” she snapped. This was the Grand Ole Opry’s manager, who had booked me for the show.“FINE!” I said. I was so thirsty and so mad. I registered her less as a person and more like a freshly locked gate that was stopping me from getting water.I staggered back on stage and, as I walked out, I pulled my shirt over my head. I was wearing a bra, so I wasn’t naked, but I also wasn’t thinking. It wasn’t an act of punk-rock defiance. I just had an animal need to cool down inanyway possible. The band and I took our positions and began another song (at least Ithinkwe did?). Soon the power had been cut and I saw the front-of-house engineer laughing his head off.We were done. I put my shirt back on and guzzled some water that had finally materialised. I was red as a beet. The manager stormed up to me. She did a lot of yelling. I felt so sick and ashamed. She was that kind of mad where I could tell she was enjoying her own righteousness as she shouted away.Finally, she delivered the classic line, the one we’d both been waiting for: “You’llNEVERplay this town again!” She stormed away.We packed up our gear and limped back to the van. I don’t think we even got paid. I was upset that I had let my bandmates down, but they were kind souls and rallied around me. Still, the realisation that I’d blown it was as heavy as the air and twice as uncomfortable. When I got back to Chicago, I wrote the manager a long letter of apology explaining that I wasn’t trying to be rebellious, I had literally just hadheatstroke, and that I felt terrible for what had happened. She sent a smug reply to my agent and that was that. I was never going to play that town again.I thought about what men had to do to get banned from the Opry. Hank Williams got booted after missing several shows (this was when he was in his alcoholic slide). Johnny Cash had gotten drunk and, during his show, bashed out all the footlights with his mic. I hadn’t been drunk. I hadn’t sworn at anyone. I hadn’t sent glass flying out at the audience. I’d been overheated and sick. Granted, I wasn’t a star and never would be. I was OK with that part, but I was just heartbroken I had blown my shot at playing the Opry. I so badly wanted to do it for my gramma, to make her proud of me.A few years went by, and I was booked to play the Ryman, which was home to the Opry for decades before it moved over to the Opry House. When I got there, no one looked at me like I was a cheese rind or got in a tizzy about what I might wear on stage. Everyone was friendly and helpful. As my band and I went on stage in that glorious old auditorium, I could feel the magic of playing where so many other musicians I loved had played before.Thisis where it was, not the Christian megapark that had booked me to help sell hotdogs. It was so decent and loving and healing. My gramma had died by then, but I was sure she could feel it anyway. Forever after, I was certain that the institutional cult that’s dedicated to deciding what is “country music” – and what isn’t – wasn’t worth my time. It only exists to exclude people.No one can stop you from “playing this town again!” or from being yourself or from making dumb, innocent mistakes. No gatekeeper can stop you from playing country music or evolving it past the confines of the tight decades of time they are so desperate to preserve. When it comes to making new things, they can’t stop you for being Black or a girl or gay or divorced. That’s the only real “can’t” – and don’t let them forget it.The Harder I Fight The More I Love You: A Memoir is published by Headline (£25).

It was announced last month thatEwan McGregorwill play the lead role of an architect in the play. On Friday it was announced that Debicki has been cast as the architect’s former student, whose arrival disrupts a Hamptons house party thrown by his wife, who will be played by Kate Fleetwood.The play, inspired by Henrik Ibsen’s classic The Master Builder, will be directed by Michael Grandage. Debicki said that Raicek’s script “caught my attention immediately with its blazing exploration of the pain and great beauty that is endured and experienced should we take the risk in life to love someone”.View image in fullscreenElizabeth Debicki, Ewan McGregor and Kate Fleetwood star in My Master Builder.Illustration: FeastDebicki studied drama at the University of Melbourne’s Victorian College of the Arts and graduated in 2010. Soon afterwards she was cast in Baz Luhrmann’s film of The Great Gatsby. In 2013 she starred with Cate Blanchett and Isabelle Huppert in Sydney Theatre Company’s production ofThe Maids by Jean Genet.Raicek’s other work includes the plays Fire Season, inspired by Shakespeare’s Measure for Measure, and Tulla, about the artist Edvard Munch. Her debut novel, The Plunge, is to be published this year. Fleetwood, whose recent productions include A View from the Bridge and 101 Dalmatians, called My Master Builder “a bold and arresting retelling” of Ibsen. “It’s a play about memories, the way we lodge them and narrate them, for better or for worse,” said Fleetwood.The play will run at Wyndham’s theatre, which is currently home to the sold-out productionInside No 9: Stage/Fright. My Master Builder begins previews on 17 April and will close on 12 July.

Diane Samuels’ theatrical refraction of the 90-year-old Holocaust survivorMiriam Freedmanhas these, but also incorporates superflex yoga and meditation, the former thankfully not subject to audience participation but the latter an important element of the show.An early section resembles a communal mindfulness exercise, as we close our eyes and focus on breathing in and out. Breath subsequently becomes the central metaphor – proof of survival but, in a sequence where Miriam hides in a flat in Slovakia while Nazi soldiers stamp the stairwell, respiration may be a fatal giveaway. Escaping to London, “Eva” – the less-Jewish name Miriam used in her occupied homeland – attended classes given by Irina Tweedie, a Sufi teacher (hence the yoga and meditation), who intuited the young woman’s deep trauma but never asked about it because Freedman, for many years, could not remember out loud.In this sense, the play structurally resembles Kurt Vonnegut’s 1969 novelSlaughterhouse-Five, which approaches blocked horrors – in that case, witnessing the firebombing of Dresden – through a circuit of diversions and apparent asides – in this case, about porridge, back pain and eye colour – that ultimately have appalling meaning.View image in fullscreenMultitudinous talent … from left, Caroline Gruber, Zoe Goriely and Matthew James Hinchliffe.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/the GuardianThe deceptively loose form is kept taut by director Ben Caplan’s well-paced staging on Isabella Van Braeckel’s set where strands of mesh containing newsprint resemble fishing nets that have trawled the wartime archive and a bowl of red roses takes on a simple but terrible symbolism of life and death.A cast of three brings multitudinous talent to the multiplicity of forms. Caroline Gruber’s older Miriam captures the improbable humour and forgiveness that Freedman – who took a reluctant curtain call with the actors on press night – brings to her reflections. Newcomer Zoe Goriely, between eye-watering yoga stretches, shows the accelerating terror of young Eva and the reasons for her long postwar silence. Matthew James Hinchliffe provides a live backing track with instruments including clarinet (effects ranging from breathing to sirens) and, with a bunch of keys, the ominous percussion of a Slovakian janitor.Samuels’ Kindertransport (1993) is one of the strongest theatrical pieces ofHolocausteducation and remembrance and, in the week of the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz and at a time of alarmingly rising antisemitism, she has created a worthy companion piece.AtArcola theatre, London, until 1 March.Explore more on these topicsTheatreArcola theatreHolocaustreviewsShareReuse this content"

Can you even begin to grasp what that would look like? Maybe you can if in the last few years you’ve seenFoeorFingernailsorDon’t Worry DarlingorSwan SongorLove Meor The Pod Generation orThe SubstanceorPossessoror any one of the many attempts to recall the magic of at least some of the sci-fi anthology’s earlier episodes. It’s not as if the Charlie Brooker-created series was the first to spin “what if?” nightmares from the dangers of tech but its stickiness has had a noticeable effect on younger creators eager to Say Something about the times we live in.Presence review – Soderbergh’s ghost’s-eye movie plays it cool with an unhappy familyRead moreCompanion, a wink-wink pre-Valentine’s sci-fi comedy, is not just part of that trend but also belongs at the back of the long line of post-Get Out social thrillers, standing behind Fresh and Blink Twice, using an outlandish conceit to comment on something we’re all too aware of. The film, from the first-time writer-director Drew Hancock, is an attempt to skewer a certain, familiar type of shitty guy whose outward nice bro persona betrays a corroded and controlling core. He’s played by Jack Quaid, son of Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid, who has cleverly turned his handsome and charming nepo baby privilege into something ultimately petulant and pathetic. It worked well as one of the Reddit-pilled killers in Scream 5 and works well here too, even if his character feels a little under-baked.I should add that, even if trailers have already semi-ruined the big reveal, ideal consumption of Companion might require reading the bare minimum, rather like least year’s similarly twistyStrange Darling. So consider the extremely spoiler-averse warned.Cards are revealed relatively early here, though, a relief given how awkwardly Hancock tries to keep them hidden before then. While the best films that lead to a big twist keep you intrigued and maybe unsettled before being genuinely surprised, the worst keep you frustrated at how little makes sensewithoutan inevitable reveal on the way. With every huh or what or why one might utter in the first act, you can almost hear Hancock reassuring us that it’s fine, a twist is coming to save the day. We begin as Quaid’s scrappy good guy Josh takes his hopelessly devoted girlfriend Iris (Heretic standout Sophie Thatcher) away for the weekend (always a bad sign in a modern thriller) to spend time with his friends at a sleek, remote mansion. But she’s convinced they don’t like her and is forever feeling marooned on the outskirts, a feeling compounded when something terrible soon happens …It turns out that Iris’s unwavering obsession with Josh (sex on demand, a constant need to be near and compliment him) is not in fact a natural inclination but one that was programmed by him. She arrived in a package (their supermarket meet-cute was picked off a romcom list) and his smartphone dictates her every characteristic, both physical and mental. But unlike in the recent Netflix-acquired hit Subservience or in next year’s upcoming M3GAN spin-off Soulm8te, it’s not the robot that’s the one to fear but rather those that have chosen to purchase and then play with her. What does it say about the kind of man who would prefer a dynamic such as this and how much should he be punished for playing god with technology?Sundance 2025: the 10 films not to miss at this year’s festivalRead moreThere’s some brief fun in the unravelling chaos of a plan gone wrong, when the film recalls darkly comic 90s noirs like Best Laid Plans and Dead Man’s Curve, but it peters out too fast, any big ideas and reveals exhausted too soon. Hancock mostly chooses comedy over thriller but his script isn’t really sharp or funny enough for that lane, its smug jokes about programming and simple, grasping gender commentary becoming repetitive. Quaid is a believable asshole once again but his character’s whiny one-note brand of online sexism is too obvious, the film never quite managing to get us fully invested in the empowered female takes down shitty male thrust of the last act. It’s as superficial yet as assured as Blink Twice was last year, not really saying all that much yet possessing an unearned swagger anyway.Like a lot of first-time writer-directors (including Companion’s producer Zach Cregger, whose showy filmBarbarianimpressed others more than it did me back in 2023), Hancock is a far better director than writer, and so the film is more sleekly made than it is thoughtfully written (he adds far more gloss than $10m would suggest), with convenient inconsistencies, a short yet stretched runtime and a rather flat fight-to-the-death Terminator-esque finale leaving things on a so-what shrug. For a film about advanced technology, it’s all awfully simple.Companion is out in US and UK cinemas nowExplore more on these topicsScience fiction and fantasy filmsThrillersreviewsShareReuse this content"

Over mostly self-produced beats, his lyrics, often written freely in streams of consciousness, sit in cosy corners of cut-and-stitched samples, comparable with the drifting verses of his friend and mentor Earl Sweatshirt or the smoother edges of Buffalo’s Westside Gunn. This approach won’t always lead anywhere especially illuminating, but, much like his artistic idol MF Doom, the miniature worlds he moulds are consistently inviting.View image in fullscreenMike: Showbiz! album artOn Showbiz! – his tenth album – Mike paints in the gaps between life on the road and his rootedness in the studio. These are fleeting fragments of songs, rarely running over a couple of minutes. But they are packed with rich detail: an anxious sax loop on The Weight (2k20) as Mike spirals over the death of his mother; on Pieces of a Dream, meandering keys pan drunkenly from left to right as he repeats: “I ain’t sober yet.” His lackadaisical style belies this close focus.Recorded in phases at his home over the course of a year, Showbiz! often feels like something being worked out in real time. On Artist of the Century he rolls a refrain between his lips – “The prize isn’t much, but the price is abundant” – as if reminding himself that his craft, rather than the steady stream of acclaim he’s become used to, is why he’s really doing this.Explore more on these topicsRapreviewsShareReuse this content"

This gathering was a shimli, a Welsh word that falls from the tongue with a similar softness to Carmarthenshire folk singer Owen Shiers’s delivery of these 11 quietly political songs.View image in fullscreenCynefin: Shimli album artRecording as Cynefin (a Welsh word for a place where we feel we belong), Shiers’s second album mixes traditional ballads, musical settings of poems and originals built on stories collected from rural west Walians, all sung in Welsh. Their arrangements are pastoral and lyrical, weaving in horns, double bass, piano and strings in a way that tilts towards Robert Kirby’s work with Nick Drake, while also sounding strangely sun-kissed and filmic (imagine Wales by way of a short hop to Iberia).In 19th-century fishing ballad Pysgota/Fishing, Shiers’s guitar arpeggios echo the ripples of the river Teifi: once, but no longer, a thriving waterway. May carol Mae’r Nen Yn Ei Glesni (The Heavens Are Greening) is warmed into life by the Machynlleth Wind Band, while a spaghetti western flourish fills Shiers’s whistling on Cornicyll (Lapwing).The voices of Shiers’s interviewees also open Shili Ga Bwd (Wormwood) and Pont Llanio (a song about a factory that was a thriving community hub now long closed and choked with weeds), recalling King Creosote and Jon Hopkins’ moving experiments on 2010’s Mercury-nominated Diamond Mine. In his bilingual liner notes, Shiers calls this album “a stake in the ground for the diverse and the disappearing in our age of homogenisation and mass amnesia”, although he foregoes anger in his sound for a gentler sense of contemplation. His voice, plain and unadorned, also veers the album away from easy nostalgia but still offers a cosseting tone of communion.Also out this monthGavin Fairhall Leverare composer/fiddler James Patrick Gavin, double-bassist Tim Fairhall and multi-instrumentalist Adrian Lever, and Tearing Down Walls (self-released) is an exhilarating mashing together of Celtic and eastern European traditional music and jazz harmony.

In this regard,The Straight Storyserves as a career outlier. However, despite lacking all his trademark dread and disquiet, it deserves to go down as one of his very best. Based on the true story of Alvin Straight, a man who, in 1994, took his 5mph lawnmower on a 240-mile road trip to visit his sick brother, it shimmers with awestruck wonder. Lead actor Richard Farnsworth was in the latter stages of terminal cancer during filming, and his stubborn determination to see the journey through is reflected throughout the whole movie. A perfect film with a perfect ending.Sunday 2 February, 4.10pm, Film4You’re Cordially InvitedView image in fullscreenYou will have the time of your life … Reese Witherspoon and Will Ferrell in You’re Cordially Invited.Photograph: Glen WilsonIn the same way that 2022’sTicket to Paradisefelt like a comforting throwback thanks to Julia Roberts and George Clooney’s easy romcom patter, this feels like a treat for nostalgists. It stars Will Ferrell and Reese Witherspoon as two people who double-book a wedding venue with inevitable slapstick repercussions. It’s the sort of unapologetically broad comedy that doesn’t get made any more, complete with gratuitous alligator wrestling. Will you remember it a year from now? No. Will you have the time of your life watching it now?

A horror about two young people whose nostalgic connection to an old TV show warps their sense of reality, the film manages to visually mimic the old VHS horrors of the 1980s while maintaining a strong modern message about gender identity. Martin Scorsese is a fan, calling it “emotionally and psychologically powerful.” More than anything, though, it will creep you out to a stupendous degree.Saturday 1 February, 9.40am, 10.35pm, Sky Cinema PremiereOpen FireView image in fullscreenEndlessly fascinating … Rupert Graves as David Martin in Open Fire.Photograph: United Archives GmbH/AlamyFor those wondering howPaul Greengrasswas able to transition from ITV journalist to Hollywood power player, the answer is with films like Open Fire. This is his first work of filmed fiction; a 1994 made-for-TV movie about the real-life manhunt for escaped criminal David Martin, and the police blunder that led to a national scandal. As a finished piece of work it’s undoubtedly a little rough around the edges, and very much of its time. But as an artefact of Greengrass’s progress, it’sendlessly fascinating.Saturday 1 February, 11.10pm, Talking Pictures TVskip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The media refused to touch her story, so Ito started to document her struggle to be heard.Black Box Diariesis that document; a brave and gruelling account of one woman’s effort to change an entire culture.

Gibson was a young Australian who established herself as a “wellness guru” by falsely claiming to have mitigated multiple cancer pathologies via a range of dietary tricks and alternative medicines. This glossy, pacy dramatisation of Gibson’s deadly tissue of lies is distinguished by a fine, nuanced central performance from Kaitlyn Dever, who portrays Gibson as corrupted and parasitical but also desperately needy and in denial about the true gravity and consequences of her actions.Netflix, from Thursday 6 FebruaryClean SlateView image in fullscreenSweet home Alabama … Laverne Cox in Desiree as Clean Slate.Photograph: Courtesy of PrimeUnhappy Alabama teen Desmond moved to New York, became Desiree and started working in a gallery. A couple of decades on, Desiree (Laverne Cox) has run out of money and faces unfinished business at home. Can she return to Alabama and reconnect with her good-hearted but traditional father Harry? This sitcom (executive produced by the late Norman Lear) tracks the tentative rebuilding of Desiree and Harry’s relationship via endless gender-based awkwardness and a “pronoun jar” for any accidental linguistic mishaps. It’s broad but underpinned by an abiding warmth.Prime Video, from Thursday 6 FebruaryCommon Side EffectsView image in fullscreenIt’s a miracle mushroom! … Common Side Effects.Illustration: Adult SwimThis animation is surprisingly straight-faced and earnest for an Adult Swim production – and none the worse for it.

However, that changes when he meets Marta (Verónica Echegui), a free-spirited and commitment-phobic woman at a party.

So much so that they decide to plug it in. What could possibly go wrong? As secrets from the past start to unravel, it’s easy to guess where this German sci-fi might be going; it doesn’t feel like too much of a spoiler to say that the robot (Cassandra) turns out to have a little more autonomy than is desirable, not to mention a very personal agenda.

Another strong cast has been assembled: Michael Chiklis, Taylor Schilling, Rhea Perlman, Abigail Breslin and Malcolm-Jamal Warner.

Probably all of us are a little – but the artists at the centre of this year’s Photo Brussels festival have embraced the technology to bring us an intriguing and, at times, optimistic exploration of one of the most concerning developments of our time.The ambitious curation by the photography academic Michel Poivert gathers together 17 projects at Brussels’ Hangar gallery. Together their creations reveal the visual and intellectual potential, along with the current limits, of this wave of “promptography”.Cherry AirlinesPascal Sgro invites us to step inside an imaginary world onboard his fictional Cherry Airlines, taking an unsettling journey back to the 1950s. Each image, created using AI, blurs the boundaries between reality and invention and suggests glossy ads for a golden age of air travel. Sgro prompts reflection on progress and aspiration, and the paradox of the environmental cost of lifestyle.View image in fullscreenImages in the Cherry Airlines seriesView image in fullscreenServing up a fantasy lunch and a comfortable nap in the plush cabin, he tells the story of the pursuit of luxury that has fuelled the climate crisis.View image in fullscreenUne HistoireParalleleIn their series Une Histoire Parallele, the artists Brodbeck and de Barbuat took a deep dive into the image data banks ofMidjourney, an AI programme that creates images from text descriptions. Using the software’s literal language prompts, they wanted to see how they could recreate some of the world’s most famous photographs. The work was made between 2022 and 2023 and really highlighted the flaws and prejudices in source data, questioning the role of the internet in appropriation and stereotyping.View image in fullscreenFor example, facial features take on a generic form with only a hint of ethnicity – at the time, there were inadequate source images of people of ethnic minority. In the AI-generated recreation of Annie Leibovitz’s iconic portrait ofJohn Lennon and Yoko Ono, the data results repeatedly showed Lennon clothed, despite prompts that he should be naked. Not so with Ono – the AI process kept reversing the request, presuming that it is more usual for women to be naked.View image in fullscreenThe subject of Dorothea Lange’sMigrant Motherappears to have had some cosmetic work done, the result of Midjourney’s advertising bias. Each of these images presents a sense of confusion between what we recognise and the flaws in the detail – the hands for example.BárbarasHonouring the unsung women who have played a significant part in shaping the Brazil we know today was the mission of the artist Claudia Jaguaribe. So little was known about her primary subject, Bárbara de Alencar, whose name crops up on street signs and the occasional building, that Jaguaribe delved into AI-driven historical, iconographic and photographic research to visualise her story. During her research, she discovered that de Alencar – a business woman, an educator and a revolutionary – was in fact one of her ancestors.View image in fullscreenFrom the series Bárbaras, 2024, an AI portrait of Espercanca Garcia, who was an enslaved Afro-Brazilian, born in 1751, and is considered the first female lawyer in BrazilJaguaribe used AI to create an informed series of portraits of other unrecognised women of significance, entitled Bárbaras, which she has represented through collage as stamps and postcards.View image in fullscreenAnother in the series is Aqualtune, an AI portrait of a warrior princess from what was known in her time as Kongo who, during her enslavement in Brazil, was branded on her chest with a flower design made by a hot iron. She fought for her freedom and that of others during the mid-17th centurySilent HeroUsing AI to fill in gaps in historical reference also powers the project by Alexey Yurenev to answer questions about the role his Russian grandfather played in the Red Army during the second world war. His grandfather, he knew, was considered a war hero but as he was no longer alive, Yurenev couldn’t question him as to what part, exactly, he had played.View image in fullscreenSilent Hero created by Alexey YurenevYurenev came up with a method to use image data sources to create machine-generated amalgamations of people, places and events that he then presented to surviving war veterans.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenAI images created by Alexey Yurenev for his project Silent Hero, which is on display at the Hangar gallery for Photo BrusselsThese impressionistic images tapped into a psychological narrative that refreshed the veterans’ interpretations of conflict. Their response was remarkable and prompted fascinating historical testimonies.It was as if the images I created kissed awake their memoriesAlexey YurenevView image in fullscreenA Red Army veteran who was interviewed by Alexey Yurenev for his project Silent Hero, which is on display at the Hangar galleryNew New YorkMarrying nostalgia with AI technology gives rise to this series created by Robin Lopvet that revisits the history of photography in New York during the 20th century. From reportage to street photography, his computer-generated reflections play, often with humour, on techniques in colour printing and aesthetic that defined an era.View image in fullscreenImages from the series New New YorkView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenThe question he seems to be asking is: Can photography only literally describe the world? Or can we use imagination and fiction, like cinematic creations, to explain it?For those who prefer a more traditional approach and like to enjoy some pure photography, Photo Brussels is not short of treasure.View image in fullscreenOrdeal by Roses #32, 1961At the galleries participating throughout the city you can feast your eyes, for example, on the vintage prints of the Japanese photographer Eikoh Hosoe. On display at Galerie Eric Mouchet is his emblematic series Ordeal by Roses, which was dedicated to the novelist Yukio Mishima. Born in 1933, Hosoe rose to international fame as an avant garde artist during the 60s and died just a few months ago. His work pays homage to his love of European Renaissance painting and the art of eroticism.View image in fullscreenFrom the series on display at Galerie Eric MouchetTimeless NapoliNestled into gallery Stieglitz 19 are fragments of life in Napoli by the photographer Anders Petersen. His edgy, intensely cropped black and white prints don’t try to make sense of the chaos of the city but they tell it how it is, bursting with character and atmosphere. The images have such a classic, timeless quality that it comes as a surprise to find that he made them as recently as 2022.View image in fullscreenImages in the series Napoli, 2022View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenWolfIn contrast with the claustrophobia of Naples, you can almost taste the mountain air of the European wilderness at Nationale 8 Gallery. In a departure from his roots in reportage and an urban life, Frederik Buyckx took a fine art approach to his project Wolfand went on an adventure to reconnect with the natural world.In reaching some of Europe’s most challenging environments I wanted to see what it’s like to have to put up with the force of nature, to show its beauty but at the same time the harshness of coping with itView image in fullscreenImages from the series Wolf by Frederik BuyckxView image in fullscreenPhoto Brusselsruns until 23 February at venues across Brussels, Belgium.

And so the ranch water was born: a grown-up margarita with the added smoky depth of mezcal, and soda to keep things light and refreshing.Ranch waterServes120ml fresh lime juice, plus a little extra to rim the glass¼ tspTajín, to rim the glass40ml blanco tequila– we useCazcabel10ml mezcal– we use Koch Elemental½ fresh jalapeño chilli1 pinchflaky sea saltSoda, to topDip the rim of a highball glass first in lime juice and then in Tajín, to coat.

This sleek, moderately fancy celebration of all things from Athens to the coast of Crete is currently working hard to channel a sun-kissed sojourn on the Aegean, in winter, in London. Yet step inside, away from the concrete and drizzle outside, and the place is airy, opulent and verging on the semi-Californian. This is movie-set Greece hewn in tones of dappled, early evening Athenian sunshine, all bronze, peach, tan and gold, and enhanced with tasteful lighting, velvety soft furnishings and comfortable leather banquettes. Before I walked in, I was just a woman in thermals with a flaky nose, but then – bang! – I’m suddenly Christina Onassis sipping a mulberrymournorakiin a rustic yet dashingly chic taverna.All this and a kitchen headed byAngelos Togias, ex ofthe Connaught, and with a clear vision to honour the many wonderful things about modern Greek cooking and ingredients. We begin with a “tasting” of five olive oils in tiny bowls with house flatbread, each of them passionately explained by our server as if they were the finest wines from the cellar. Doesn’t the 245 Organic 0.8% have subtle wafts of citrus and fresh grass? How about the fuller, fruitier aroma of the Mitira Lesvos? As a non-drinker nowadays, I found the ceremony of the experience rather delightful – why do we reserve such nerdiness mainly for wine?View image in fullscreenKrokodilos’ taramas cream is ‘miles away from the usual pink, whiffy mush’.But perhaps you’re already saying no, thank you, having been burnt by other renditions of allegedly traditional Greek food in Great Britain. Yes, there are some fine examples out there – my belovedHand Cafe in Stratford, east London, for one, where sweetbougatsa, good coffee and the likes of fragrant, freshly made courgette and fetastriftiare to be found – but who among us has not, at some point, stared sadly at a bowl of roughly chopped red onion, unripe tomato and unlovable, catering-pack feta and muttered: “This is not how the Greek salad was when we were on holiday.”Here at Krokodilos, however, there’s a sense that Togias and his team are aching to change all that. From the dozen or so starter options, some are instantly recognisable. Yes, there’s tarama and whipped fava, through which to scoop some lovely fermented potato flatbread, but there is also much more unusual and unexpected stuff, such as sharp, citrussy stone bass dressed in blood orange and fennel. Even a humble-sounding “beetroot salad” turns out to be a rather complex plate of beets, fermented apple, peanuts, raisins andgalomizithracheese.View image in fullscreen‘Generous and heady’: Krokodilos’ prawn saganaki.That apparently predictable taramasalata, by the way, is miles away from the pink, whiffy mush to which we have somehow grown tolerant as a nation. Krokodilos’ “taramas cream” is the richest, most decadent bowl of pale, barley-coloured, salty, cured roe (bottarga from Messolonghi, no less) with a judicious scattering of dill and topped with a runny egg yolk. “Ilikethis place,” I said while devouring this pungent concoction. “It’s well handy.” There are tiny, romantic tables, as well as larger areas for groups, should you need them, plus it’s in a part of London where good, reasonably priced places to eat at and/or entertain are all too rare.The mains menu is equally enthralling. A properly good rabbitstifado, monkfish fricassée, grilled octopus with avièrgeemulsion and lambdolmadakia… So I was at fault for ordering the prawnsaganaki–not because it wasn’t delicious, but because I was wearing white, and foolishly imagined that I’d be able to eat this generous and heady tomato, feta and prawn stew and emerge unsplattered. I began with aplomb, dipping the remains of my wild mushroom-topped flatbread into the sauce, but things got messy very soon thereafter.View image in fullscreen‘The star of the show’: Krokodilos’ greek yoghurt with quince and cardamom oil.The front of house, thankfully, feigned ignorance and swept me into the dessert selection, from which the Greek yoghurt with quince and cardamom oil might seem the healthy option, but it is served as if it’s the star of the show, in a supremely elegant glass and with a recommendation to pair it with an eight-year-old Gaia vin santo. We also cleared akaridopitachocolate and walnut cake withkaimakiice-cream.Krokodilos is flying way under the radar right now, possibly due to its location, the time of year and the fact that its owners have opened so many places at roughly the same time. But what we have here is averyamenable place to spend a couple of hours, imagining you’re feeling the sun on your face when in reality you won’t see it for another six months. Bring a bib, order the saganaki and think of summer. Better days are ahead.KrokodilosLancer Square, 28A Kensington Church Street, London W8, 020-8191 2783.

Food styling assistant: Áine Pretty-McGrath.The sweet spotScandinavian food and drinkRichard Hart’s recipe for Scandinavian cardamom bunsAn adventure in Scandinavian baking, from starter to finishRichard HartFri 31 Jan 2025 10.00 ESTShareIn Scandinavia, people are crazy about cardamom buns. They’re usually much drier than I’d like, and after much testing I’ve found that the secret to making a much moister bun is underproofing the dough. Normally, baking something that’s underproofed is nothing but disappointing, but in this instance it’s the way to go. A slightly underproofed centre lets the dough hold on to that sticky, gooey texture you want in a cardamom (or cinnamon) bun.Cardamom bunsPrep10 minProve3 hrChillOvernightCook1 hr 50 minMakes12125g rye flour125g warm water (28C/84F)For the starter60ghot water(40C/104F)60gwholewheat flour24g 12-hour wheat or rye starter– see methodFor the dough204gplain flour204gbread flour55gsugar41gmilk powder143gwarm water(30C/86F)65geggs122gfreshly fed starter(see above)8gsalt4ginstant dry yeast102gbutter51gneutral oilFor the cardamom sugar252gsugar16gground cardamom3gsaltFor the cardamom schmear200gsoftened butter100gcardamom sugar(above)For the cardamom syrup71gcardamom sugar(above)29gwaterTo finish60g softened butter, for greasingA pinch of ground cardamom, to garnishIn a clean jar or plastic container, combine 50g of the rye flour and 50g of the water and mix well by hand to form a dough. It will be quite sticky. Use a dough scraper to scrape any excess from your fingers and back into the mixture. Take its temperature: if it’s below 25C, set the container in a larger container of warm water to bring it up a few degrees. The water should completely surround the starter container to insulate it. Put a lid on the container. As long as you’re keeping the starter warm enough, you can leave it alone for 24 hours.Check on your starter: To be honest, it probably won’t look all that different. It may have separated a bit, with some liquid at the top, and if that’s the case, just mix the liquid back in. Put your clean fingers into the mixture and stir it around a bit, to add some oxygen. Take its temperature and warm the container in warm water as necessary. Cover the container and let it sit again for 24 hours.By now, you should be seeing some noticeable bubbling and expansion in the mixture. Add 25g of the flour and 25g of the water and mix it in by hand. Scrape the excess off your fingers and add it to the mixture.The next day, check for bubbling and expansion, which should be evident by day four. Discard half the mixture and mix in the remaining 50g flour and 50g water. If there is no evidence of fermentation in your mixture, and if you see red or orange streaks of mould or other visible growths, chuck it out, buy some fresh flour, and start over.By day five, you should have a nicely fermented starter, with real, clear signs of active life. You are now ready to use this starter to make bread. From here, you will maintain a daily feeding schedule by discarding about 90% of it and refreshing it with flour and water, equal parts by weight. For a rye starter, you can do this once a day. For wheat, I recommend feeding it twice a dayIn a medium bowl, use your hands to mix the water, flour, and 12-hour starter for a minute or so, then take the mix’s temperature: it should be 30-35C (86-95F). If it isn’t, put the bowl into a larger bowl of warm or cold water, depending on which direction you need it to go. Scrape the excess mixture off your fingers back into the bowl, then rinse your hands in the bowl of warm water. Now, use a plastic scraper to push the starter mix together, getting everything off the insides of the bowl and into one cohesive body, then cover the bowl with a tea towel and leave the freshly fed starter in a warm, draught-free place. Set a timer for 45 minutes.Once the starter is ready, in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, combine both the flours with the sugar, milk powder, water, eggs and starter, and mix on medium speed to combine. The mixture will look wet at this point. Let it rest for 30 minutes.Add the salt and yeast, and mix the dough thoroughly on medium for about 10 minutes, until completely smooth and very strong.Add half the butter and mix again until fully incorporated. Add the remaining butter and mix again until that, too, is incorporated. Add the half the oil, allow it to be completely absorbed, then add the rest. Ideally, the dough shouldn’t be too warm (not higher than 82F/ 28C).Transfer the dough to an oiled container that’s large enough to hold double its size and leave to ferment at room temperature for 45 minutes to an hour, until bubbly and slightly increased in volume. Cover with a tea towel and refrigerate overnight, or for up to 12 hours.Make the cardamom sugar: In a bowl, combine the sugar, cardamom and salt, and mix well, cover and set aside.The next day, make the cardamom schmear. In a small bowl, combine the butter and 100g cardamom sugar, and mix until the sugar is well incorporated. Keep this mixture at room temperature so that it will spread easily across the dough.Use a pastry brush to brush the insides of a 12-hole muffin tin with the softened butter. Turn the chilled dough out on to a work surface and roll out into a 55cm × 25cm rectangle that’s about 5mm thick. Using a palette knife, small spatula or butter knife, spread the schmear in an even layer over the dough, working quickly so the dough doesn’t warm up, then sprinkle evenly with 100g of the cardamom sugar.With one short side of the dough facing you, fold it in half by bringing the top edge down to meet the bottom edge. Roll it out again, this time to a 40cm × 25cm rectangle about 2cm-thick and horizontally oriented.Use a pizza cutter or sharp knife to cut the dough into 12 long strips. Hold each end of one strip in your hands, twist in opposite directions, then roll on to itself into a snail shape. Tuck the loose ends underneath to keep the strip from unraveling while baking, then put each one in the prepared muffin tin. Proof in a warm place for an hour, until they have expanded to one and a half times their original size. If you poke your finger into the dough, it should leave an impression but still spring back slightly. The dough is underproofed at this point, which will result in a moister bun.Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, combine the remaining 71g cardamom sugar and the water. Bring to a boil, then take off the heat and leave to cool to room temperature.Heat the oven to 185C(365F)/gas 4½. Bake the buns for 10-12 minutes, until deep golden brown and the internal temperature is at least 98C(208F). While they’re still warm, invert the buns on to a rack, brush with cardamom syrup and garnish with ground cardamom. Serve warm.This is an edited extract from Bread, by Richard Hart, published by Hardie Grant at £28.

It feels good to admit that, because the assumption is that, being a drinks writer, I should adore any and all forms of inebriation. But I (shock!) have things I loathe just as any other person does, even when it comes to booze. I don’t like cardio or jobsworths, either, and that will never change. I do, however, want to change the gin thing.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I’ve abstained from the expansive world of gin with my philistine resistance to garnishes, tonic water and any glass that requires both hands to drink from. So, in a bid to get over my irrational fears, I put out a call for gin experts to prescribe me a failsafe drink. “If someone says they don’t like gin, I ask if it’s just London dry gin that they don’t like, which tends to be most people’s association with the category,” says Alexander Watson, founder ofRenais. “I’d invite them to try something with a softer profile, because there’s just so much variety nowadays. With this kind of gin, I’d recommend a dry martini with a twist of lemon, where the heat of the liquid is taken out a little by the temperature of the drink, and there’s also a small bit of dilution.”As several gin advocates I’ve dated have pointed out, itmightalso be that I just don’t like tonic, a point picked up byspirits writer and gin expert Sarah Miller: “Try different mixers – soda water, lemonade, ginger ale, even cola. And if it’s the juniper you don’t like, go for less traditional gins that lean towards different flavours.” Damola Timeyin, co-founder ofSpearhead Spirits, a premium African spirits company, agrees: “I’m a sucker for anything sweet, so for me the perfect gin cocktail is a gimlet. We make a palm and pineapple gin that goes great in a gimlet, especially when garnished with a slice of grilled pineapple.”That’s probably one to consider when summer finally returns, but what if you want something classic that’s not a gin and tonic? “ATom Collinsmade with a good entry-level gin such as Martin Miller’s or Hendricks is a good gateway drink,” Sarah Miller tells me. “Gin, lemon juice, sugar syrup and soda water.”No tonic water? Say no more. I head to the supermarket to gather the ingredients, the result froths in the glass and I feel the cold water of redemption rush over my palate. I need just the one hand to drink it, too (I use the other for crisps).Four gins for non-gin fansMartin Miller’s Gin£30 Waitrose, 40%. A good staple to have in your arsenal.
