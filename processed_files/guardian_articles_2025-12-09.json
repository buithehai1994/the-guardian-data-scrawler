Just don’t forget to engage your brainMarina HydeThe Green party leader is riding high in the polls. But across the political spectrum, uncritical adulation leads nowhere fastTue 9 Dec 2025 06.57 ESTLast modified on Tue 9 Dec 2025 12.35 ESTShareShortly after Donald Trump launched his first White House run in 2015, television’s Kelly Osbourne made one of her regular appearances on The View, which is basically the American version of Loose Women but doesn’t feel the need to have a cringey title. Trump had made someextremely nasty commentsabout Mexican immigrants, and Kelly had a rhetorical question for the other ladies gathered round the wood-effect dining table that morning. “You kick every Latino out of this country,”she sassed, “then WHO is going to be cleaning your toilet, Donald Trump?”Oooooof. The reaction from fellow panellist Rosie Perez was instantaneously negative, to the point that even Kelly realised in the moment that this needed clean-up. Apparently there weren’t any willing rubber-gloved Latinos on hand, so madam was going to have to do it herself. “I didn’t mean it like that,” Osbourne shot back. “Come on! You know I would never mean it like that! I’m not part of this argument.” Amedia firestormnonetheless ensued, though Kelly declined to apologise for even the appearance of racism, I think on the basis that people like her simply are not capable of subconsciously holding unpleasant views that they accidentally reveal while making important TV appearances.I must say I thought of Kelly’s faux pas when I saw Green party leader Zack Polanskiappearing on Question Timelast week. If you missed this moment, or are trying to avoid it because you quite want to vote for him and are already trying to avoid the boob-hypnosis video (more on that later!), Zack took the opportunity of the show’s immigration special to explain to the audience: “One in five care workers are foreign nationals. I don’t know about you, but I don’t particularly want to wipe someone’s bum, and I’m very grateful for the people who do this work.”Again: ooooooof. Sothat’swhat they’re there for – and, indeed,that’swhat care work is. Still, what a standup guy for being grateful.And thank goodness for the anti-woke vibe shift, right? After all, Zack metaphorically showing his arse while talking about elderly and disabled people’s “bums” is precisely the sort of thing that the cancellers would have cancelled you for as recently as a year ago. Imagine my synthetic shock, then, to note so many of the great witch-hunters of the past decade finding absolutely nothing to see here. Imagine my synthetic wonderment at all theGreen partydevotees who are able to defend this moment as coming from a good place. I guess that like Kelly, people like Zack simply are not capable of subconsciously holding unpleasant views that they accidentally reveal while making important TV appearances.Indeed, Polanski’s reflexive supporters point to the fact his partner works in palliative care, a line of reasoning that feels not entirely unrelated to that old rhetorical masterstroke: “How can I hate women? My mum’s one.” But the Greens are currentlypolling almost equalwith the Tories and Labour, meaning any criticism of them is conveniently dismissed by vocal supporters as evidence that critics are “rattled”. If only Kelly Osbourne had been polling at 16% 10 years ago – it would have saved her a lot of flak.And in many ways, there can be no more sobering comment on the utter failures of this century’s various governments than the fact that 16% of the country is currently intending to vote for a guy who once told a woman he could make her breasts bigger by hypnosis. “This is an extremely new approach,” Polanski claimed in a video of the 2013 session, which he knew upfront was for anarticle for the Sun, “but I can see it becoming popular very quickly, because it’s so safe and a lot cheaper than a boob job.” Oh dear.Yet so tribal is our politics these days that Zack’s “extremely new approach” in this department is routinely defended as an adorable form of altruism by people who would literally never stop decrying it had the boob-hypnosis been performed by any other male party leader. “His crime?” explained a hilariouspro-Polanski opinion articlein the Evening Standard. “Remaining professional while being bated [sic] and volunteering his time and skills to help a woman feel at ease with her body … A Prime Minister who could boost cup sizes would boost the national mood and inspire more patriotism than the current competitive flag loving.” Okaaay!Listen, nobody’s perfect. People have always held their nose at aspects of politicians’ characters in order to be able to put a cross in one box or another. But across the political spectrum in recent years, that sort of realistic clearsightedness has evaporated in favour of something much more likestan culture, where your idol has to be ferociously defended even when they’re in the wrong, simply because they’re your idol. In fact, because they’re your idol, they are axiomatically incapable of being in the wrong. This tendency is most definitely not limited to the left of that spectrum – you get it with Donald Trump or Nigel Farage or anyone whose supporters frequently refuse to be honest with themselves in the face of inconvenient revelations. But these are dangerous waters for a political culture.

I said: “I love you Martin Parr!” I couldn’t help it. He was a hero of mine. And over the years he became my best artist friend.We were fellow travellers. He was funny, very dry and a big fan of comedy. One of the things we shared is that we both took comedy seriously. The problem with British culture, especially in the art world, is that it suffers from what I call “performative seriousness”. We tend to privilege misery. If you think of someone likeDon McCullin– another great British photographer – it’s all about suffering and doom and we are being told it isvery importantphotography. Whereas Martin’s work was funny, albeit in a very discomfiting way, which I think is why he got a lot of pushback from the British cultural establishment.Like me, Martin was an equal-opportunities piss-taker. Nobody was safe. He travelled the entire country taking pictures, which is why I consider him to be our national photographer.View image in fullscreen‘He had an amazing eye for details’ … The Perry family (from left): Florence, Philippa and Grayson, 2012.Photograph: Martin Parr/Magnum PhotosHe had an amazing eye for details. His bookLuxuryinvolved him going to all these vulgar events full of wealthy people. He might photograph a woman in a beautiful satin suit, but he would focus on the grease stain on her lapel, or a fly that had landed on a hat. That’s what made it a Martin Parr photograph.We did a kind of collaboration for my showSuper Rich Interior Decoration, which was all about art collectors and money laundering and tax evasion. I asked if I could use some of his pictures of rich people and he gave me the key to his digital archive. I went through it and really loved the ones he’d taken of rich women’s hands. They’d be covered in diamonds, holding glasses of champagne, and you could see all the veiny, grasping details, with these lurid nails on the end. They looked like little claws and they were perfectly suited to the subject matter of my works.I was a fan of so many of his images. His early black-and-white stuff, before he made his super-saturated colour photographs in the 1980s, was also brilliant. People aren’t so familiar with that –his work up in Yorkshire, in the Methodist chapels. But he served his time as an excellent black-and-white photographer before he became famous with The Last Resort.Martin travelled the world as well as the UK – he accrued so many air miles that he was able to take his wife Susie around the world for a month on them. We always said that we should do a travel series together, where we visited the 10 most disappointing tourist attractions in the world. That would have been hilarious. He was always saying: “Oh you should go to Machu Picchu, it’s just a crowded misty mountain top!”View image in fullscreen‘He served his time as a black-and-white photographer’ … Mayor of Todmorden’s inaugural banquet, West Yorkshire, 1977.Photograph: Martin Parr/Magnum PhotosHe would often dispense advice on photography to people when he was at events. I remember him telling people they shouldn’t smile in their holiday photographs, and that they should take pictures of their food.Well, look at Instagram now. He was certainly a very early adopter of that one.He did whole books about food, and all sorts. The last book he gave me wasall about smoking. He would get obsessed with things, like the last parking space in a car park, and make a book out of it. He was an obsessive collector as well. When I used to stay with him in Bristol he always had five or 10 bids going on eBay at once, for Saddam Hussein watches or Barack Obama potato chip packets, or whatever it was he was collecting that week. He had space memorabilia, political memorabilia, a huge collection of stuff on the miners’ strike.Martin always liked to complain about how he was an absolute celebrity abroad but that nobody in Britain knew who he was. I think that helped him, though. I went out with him once on a shoot and got to see how he worked. He was this invisible character wandering around. Nobody noticed him. Then suddenly he would pounce. He’d get in really close, push the button and then walk away. He’d be gone before the person had even realised they’d had their photograph taken!‘I often noticed he was in a hurry’Wendy Jones, collaborator on Parr’s biographyWorking withMartin Parron his biography Utterly Lazy and Inattentive: Martin Parr in Words and Pictures was first and foremost fun. Martin was drily witty and able to turn a good phrase. The photographs – of which we had 50,000 on Magnum to choose from – were also funny, some laugh-out-loud funny, most notably The Conservative Midsummer Madness Party. It’s an iconic picture of Conservatives looking uptight and not at all relaxed in 1980s Bath.I worked with Martin concertedly and continually for the last two years to write the biography. When it came to choosing the photos, Martin would politely ask me first, I would defer to him, then he would be decisive. He knew immediately which photos worked, which illustrated a particular part in his life best, which of his photographs were technically the most accomplished. I discovered he was reluctant to talk about himself. It took 250,000 words of interviews to get a 40,000-word biography, often asking the same question in different ways to encourage him to tell his life story.View image in fullscreen‘Martin was humble’ … New Brighton, England, from The Last Resort, 1983-85.Photograph: Martin Parr/Magnum PhotosAnd Martin was humble. Though one of our greatest photographers and social documentarians, he was awed and delighted when other celebrated photographers turned up at the Martin Parr Foundation in Bristol. He would smile, chat away and discuss new photo books, for which he had a lifelong passion. I often noticed Martin was in a hurry. “Next photo!” he would call as we skipped through his archive trying to choose. “Next question!” he would say. We worked together with alacrity, and I am so glad we did. The book was published 10 weeks ago, in the nick of time before his death.I can only think now of all the trends, fashions and changes in society that will happen over the next decades, which we won’t have Martin to document for us. Most of all, I liked how Martin looked anonymous and invisible in his nice Marks & Spencer jumper, dressed like a conventional accountant from the suburbs, someone’s slightly boring dad. We didn’t see him, but he was seeing us. I was with Martin last Monday, six days before he died. “I haven’t taken any photos today!” he said in exasperation. “Right, let’s go!” he said. Then he got in a cab and was whisked away.‘He captured ordinary extraordinariness’Maria Balshaw, director of TateMartin’s photographic world was the changing spectacle of UK life in all its ordinary extraordinariness. From his earliest work in a still postwar Manchester, to British coastal towns from Blackpool to Rothesay on Bute, his cool eye has always captured the something more of daily life. His knowledge and passion for photography was also capacious and his wry humour and candour mean he will be a much-missed and hugely influential force in British visual culture. In addition to his own work he was a passionate collector and his extraordinary photobook collection is held jointly by Tate and theLuma Foundation, Arles, a fitting legacy to his truly international influence.‘We were chalk and cheese – but it wasn’t a problem’Don McCullin, photographerPhotography had been wallowing around the black-and-white world for years but Martin brought it into the modern world. He had a very powerful way of looking. He slicked it up a bit with this rather gaudy colour. We all have our timings in life and Martin was the man who came along at the right time.View image in fullscreenSophisticated, intelligent … Glenbeigh Races, County Kerry, Ireland, taken from A Fair Day, 1983.Photograph: Martin Parr/Magnum PhotosHe’d been a very good black-and-white photographer in the early days of his career. But when he took up colour he became a kind of David Hockney of the photographic world. It was a real right-hand turn. And he didn’t have an easy time of it. In the early days his work was seen as a bit of a joke. A lot of photographers at the time – and I include myself in this – thought photography should be black and white. It shouldn’t be, of course, because there are seven colours in the spectrum.Martin had a very good eye. He was sophisticated, an intelligent man. There was a great deal of humour in his work. He wasn’t taking the mickey, but he was showing us all that there’s humour in human life. The seaside was his grazing ground, and his work was in the similar vein of those saucy old postcards you’d see of fat ladies on the beach.He would visit me in Somerset with a load of my books to sign. He was an extremely nice man, totally unselfish. With his foundation he did his utmost to keep photography alive. It’s a tragedy we’ve lost him, because he would have gone on supporting and promoting photography.View image in fullscreen‘He was showing us all that there’s humour in human life’ … Ramsgate, England, 1996.Photograph: Martin Parr/Magnum PhotosHis output was extraordinary. He produced dozens upon dozens of books and there are people out there who absolutely adore him. He attracted huge crowds, much bigger than I ever could. He brought a lot of pleasure to people who didn’t necessarily want to look at the kind of pictures that I take, the downside of humanity.Our work was in total contrast – it didn’t gel together. We were chalk and cheese. But we exhibited together in France last year atLa Gacilly Photo festivalin Brittany. I have no problems with people doing things differently to me. Life should be a bit of a fruit salad. And that’s exactly what Martin’s work looked like: a glorious fruit salad.‘He never lost a sense of wonder’Jamie Hawkesworth, photographerI remember getting an email from Martin when I was first starting out. It was completely out of the blue. I’d just finishedmy series on Preston Bus Stationand he got in touch to request a copy and some prints. I thought: Jesus, an email from Martin Parr! It felt really special.From time to time he would contact me to say he had liked some work I’d done. Then, when myBritish Isles bookcame out, I ended up going to theMartin Parr Foundationto do a talk there. He, his team and I finished the evening eating a curry cooked by his wife, which is a lovely moment to remember.The key to Martin’s success was that he never lost that sense of wonder. In my experience the hardest thing with photography is holding on to the curiosity and naivety you had when you first fell in love with it. Martin never lost that, he always had a curious eye.View image in fullscreen‘He inspired me in a strange way’ … O’Connell Bridge, Dublin, taken from Bad Weather, 1981.Photograph: Martin Parr/Magnum PhotosI came to photography quite late. I remember going to Preston library and going through an A to Z of all the photographers out there. The first thing I found of his was a book of his early black-and-white stuff. It had this picture of a guy with an umbrella walking in the rain. That’s the image that has always stood out for me, even though it’s not what you would call a classic Martin Parr photograph.He inspired me in a strange way: his work made me realise that I wanted to take pictures differently to the way he did. I realised I needed to go up to people and ask to take their picture. But it was seeing his work that helped me arrive at that.Photography can be a fragile thing. If you take on board what other people say you can get a bit lost. But Martin always remained very honest and true to himself. His way of seeing was just this unwavering force.‘He helped me edit a book, then we played poker’Ewen Spencer, photographerMy first photography teacher was the brilliant Geoff Weston. He introduced me to Martin’s work and shortly afterwards described the meaning of photography as “death”. Quite a dark concept when the technical act of making a picture is about the manipulation of light.Martin became a household name in the 90s. It can be argued that he also increased the acceptance of photography as an artistic pursuit in the UK.I am still in awe of him and was very pleased to meet him and befriend him via our mutual friend Elaine Constantine in 2002. Both Martin and Elaine are rare kinds within the world of photography in that they readily celebrated and promoted other artists. Martin celebrated so many people and gave many a start by his recommendation. I was fortunate to benefit from his praise, I enjoyed the plaudits but I relished the approval.View image in fullscreenPassionate, engaging … Gourock Lido, Scotland. Inverclyde, 2004.Photograph: Martin Parr/Magnum PhotosAs a young upstart, while working on my first photobook Martin helped me edit the images in one intense meeting at Elaine’s house on Essex Road in London. We then all played poker together.He sat front row in a lecture I gave at Newport photography course and proceeded to heckle me, taking the piss as I watched the room swell with people and then as the lecture came to a close proceeded to ask insightful and tender questions in front of almost every student and staff member on the course. I’m convinced he had something to do with the numbers on that day.We contacted one another often to discuss forthcoming work. He’d buy prints and books for the foundation and I’d try desperately to swap a print for one of his, always very early morning emails.There are so many encounters and meetings they all seem slightly odd and hilarious now. I’ll miss him but he’s never really gone is he? The king is dead, long live the king.‘The rhubarb farmers loved his pictures of them’Simon Wallis, secretary and chief executive, Royal Academy of Arts, LondonMartin was a passionate and engaging advocate for the power of photography as a vital and evolving art form. He spent untold hours with me sharing his wide-ranging enthusiasms embodied in his peerless library of tens of thousands of photography books. I hugely enjoyed working with him on his exhibitionThe Rhubarb Triangle and Other Storiesat the Hepworth Wakefield gallery in 2016.View image in fullscreenHumour, irony, insatiable curiosity … Acropolis, 1991.Photograph: Martin Parr/Magnum PhotosMartin had a longstanding connection to Yorkshire and his seminal seriesThe Non-Conformistswas created at the beginning of his career when he lived in the county. He immersed himself in exploring the local area of Wakefield and his photographs captured fascinating aspects of the rhubarb business. From the back-breaking work of moving the rhubarb from field to forcing shed, the freezing cold and exhausting labour of picking the vegetable by candlelight (or occasionally by head-torch), and the consumption of rhubarb by coach parties and food tourists, his work told a compelling visual narrative. At the show’s packed opening it was so heartening to see all the rhubarb farmers and workers proudly looking at what he had captured of their lives and work.He had boundless energy, generosity and curiosity in the world and the local cultures around him. His huge body of photography leaves us a rich and varied legacy brought together in his many publications. He helped us see the world around us in such a vivid and acute way: laced with humour, irony and insatiable curiosity. So many of his images are intensely etched in my memory; he’ll be greatly missed.‘He didn’t just take photographs – he built worlds’Hans Ulrich Obrist, curatorThere are so many dimensions to Martin Parr’s practice. He was not only one of the great photographers of our time but also a chronicler of the quotidian, a historian, a collector, editor, curator and importantly also an institution builder. He didn’t just take photographs – he built worlds. The radiance of his work will continue to be felt and appreciated for many generations to come.‘I was fortunate to call him a friend’Paul Smith, fashion designerI’m very sad to learn of the passing of Martin Parr, a joyful photographer and someone who I was fortunate to call a friend. It was an honour to know him and observe his brilliant wit and skill of the “caught moment”.‘He provoked laughter and discomfort at the same time’Michael Benson and Fariba Farshad, co-founders of Photo LondonIt is with deep sadness that we learned of the passing of Martin Parr, a photographer whose sharp wit, bright colour and unflinching eye reshaped the story of British photography. Few artists have held a mirror to a nation with such clarity and affection. His influence has been profound, and his loss will be felt throughout the global photography community.View image in fullscreenHumour and humanity … Chowpatty Beach, Mumbai, India, 2018.Photograph: Martin Parr/Magnum PhotosMartin’s connection with Photo London has been central to our history. He was our Master of Photography in 2023, presenting a remarkable exhibition of new work created across the British Isles. True to his lifelong fascination with the rituals and contradictions of everyday life, this presentation captured all that defined him as an artist. His generosity to the fair was longstanding. He was a frequent exhibitor, a regular visitor and an enduring champion of our mission to broaden the public understanding of photography.For more than 50 years, Martin chronicled Britain with a gaze that was humorous, empathic and deeply observant. From chapel communities and summer fetes to supermarket aisles and seaside towns, he revealed the idiosyncrasies that shape our shared experience. Photobooks such asThe Last ResortandThe Cost of Livingshifted the language of documentary photography, bringing colour, satire and anthropological precision into a field dominated by black-and-white reportage. His images could provoke laughter and discomfort at the same time, a duality he embraced with characteristic candour. As he once said: he made serious photographs, disguised as entertainment.View image in fullscreen‘Deeply observant’ … Autoportrait, New Ming Chun photo studio, Singapore, 2007.Photograph: Collection Martin Parr/Magnum PhotosMartin also transformed the wider photography ecosystem. His presidency at Magnum marked an important moment of renewal for the agency. His unwavering support for emerging artists helped new voices to flourish. The establishment of the Martin Parr Foundation in Bristol created a vital home for British and Irish photography, ensuring that future generations will have access to an extraordinary archive and a beacon for the study of visual culture.Above all, Martin believed in the importance of looking closely at the world around us. He understood the camera as a tool for curiosity. He understood the value of the ordinary. He understood that photography could hold humour and humanity in the same frame.A world without Martin’s gimlet eye observing each of its twists and eccentricities is a much-impoverished place. British photography has lost one of its great champions and we have lost a treasured friend whose tireless enthusiasm ensured that we never, ever, rested on our laurels.Explore more on these topicsPhotographyMartin ParrGrayson PerryDon McCullinHans Ulrich ObristfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sometimes the most interesting thing is the person saying the thing they did not mean anyone to notice. It was always thus withBrexit.Time was when a press conference was a relatively rare event. Called only after diplomatic summits or when there was an important piece of news to be announced. Now, though, the format has been so downgraded it is being used for when any politician needs some attention. When the feeling that no one is listening to them becomes unbearable.It was Nigel Farage who started the current trend, with his weekly “Monday Mornings with Nige” shows during the summer. But since then,Kemi Badenochhas been suffering from severe Fomo. If she switches on the news channel and finds someone other than her talking, she has an existential crisis. She is yet to work out a way to be watching herself on TV and appearing on it at the same time. That would be her nirvana. Inner peace.On Monday morning, Kemi called a press conference on her ideas for an inquiry into the grooming gangs. A few journalists turned up out of politeness, but no one paid much attention. Just 45 minutes of everyone’s life that no one would ever get back. You might have thought the Conservative leader would have learned her lesson from that. Bide her time until she had something worthwhile to say. A moment of hubris for a leader of the opposition whose party is polling in the high teens.Except Kemi doesn’t roll that way: her answer to any question is to give the country more Kemi. The reason that no one is listening to her is that people have just not had enough exposure to her. More is more. So on Tuesday, Kemi was at it again. Another central London location for another presser where she would be making another pointless speech whose contents would have been far better disseminated in an email press release that everyone could have deleted on arrival. It would have saved everyone a lot of time and effort.This time, though, Tory head office had gone out of their way to try to make Kemi feel good about herself. They had packed a posh central London room with braying Tory apparatchiks to give the impression of a sentient audience. It was almost the perfect Potemkin press conference. Something that looked on the ground as if it was the genuine article but was in fact a charade. Because Kemi was to say almost nothing that she hadn’t said dozens of times in the past month. She’s like a broken record.Her theme for this speech was welfare reform. Or Benefits Street and the Age of Diagnosis, as she so charmingly puts it. Kemi has a way with words. Her compassion is never knowingly oversold.Helen Whately made the introductions. She said that the job of shadow work and pensions secretary was one that no one wanted to do. But that she had begged Kemi to give it to her. Mainly because she knew she was unlikely to be offered anything else. You do wonder just how much Whately really is Team Kemi. As with the shadow chancellor, Mel Stride, she appears to be acting the part of being tougher than she really is. She certainly did nothing to bring down the welfare bill when she was in government.Then came Kemi. All warmth and charm. Prone to the most wondrous magical thinking. Because she wanted to express a hint of contrition. The Tories – not her, obviously – had made a few mistakes in the 14 years they had been in government. That was because being in government had been very difficult, necessitating some tough choices.But now that she was out of government, she had come to realise that being in government was actually incredibly easy. You just had to do whatever she said, because there was no chance of it happening any time soon. And by the time of the next election, everyone would have forgotten what she had said. Come to think of it, they would have forgotten by the end of the morning. It was the Unbearable Lightness of Being.First the caveat. There had been some huge unexpected and unwanted shocks. Brexit and the pandemic. Sorry? I thought you were the one who was insistent that Brexit had been a brilliant idea, and would bring us all untold economic benefits. And now you’re trying to casually distance yourself from it. As if you and the Tories had nothing to do with it. That was some cheek. At least apologise. Maybe there is some hope for a customs union after all. Let’s hope Labour was listening.The rest was just standard Kemi. Everyone on benefits was gaming the system, and doing anything to stay out of work. Even the two-thirds who were in work and claiming benefits couldn’t be trusted. People should just man – or woman – up and get on with their lives. Vans should go round housing estates with a loudspeaker blaring: “Get out of bed and go to work, you lazy fuck.” Couples who had more than two children and were out of work should be made to eat their own babies.There were no ifs and buts. Kemi lives in a binary world: those who agree with her and those who don’t. The latter category have been put on notice. There is no room for seeing diagnosis as a positive, a chance for damaged men and women to start fulfilling their potential. Or for the idea that the pandemic might have badly affected the mental health of countless people. No. They were all chancers. Grifting on benefits street. She can’t see the difference between genuine need and someone trying it on.By now, everyone was rather losing interest. Even Kemi. She quickly wrapped things up and the audience drifted back to Conservative HQ. It hadn’t been a bad way to waste a morning. Almost festive. The coffee had been free, at least, and it had got them out the office. Now they had to prepare for tomorrow’s press conference.Explore more on these topicsKemi BadenochThe politics sketchBrexitGrooming gangs inquiryWelfareConservativescommentShareReuse this content"

And if you’re sick, a steaming cup of whisky, honey, lemon, and water can sound like a lot more fun than crackers and broth.But what about the alcohol? Here’s what experts say about hot toddies and colds.Can I have a hot toddy when I’m sick?Overall, it’s not a great idea, experts say.Patients sometimes bring up hot toddies as a cold remedy, says Jesse Bracamonte, a family medicine physician at Mayo Clinic based in Phoenix, Arizona. Indeed, some of the ingredients can be helpful.“Hot fluids, honey and a little bit of lemon can be very therapeutic in combating a respiratory infection,” says.But there’s an important exception: “I would never recommend having alcohol with any illness,” he says.Is love addiction real – and what does it look like?Read moreWhile drinking can cause a relaxing effect, consuming alcohol while sick can also overly sedate you, particularly if you’re taking cold and cough medications such as Benadryl, Bracamonte says. Combining alcohol with medications that have sedative effects canincrease risksincluding falling and overdose, and change how you metabolize prescriptions – people over 65 need to be especially cautious because of their slower metabolism. (Even outside hot toddy season, it’s essential to chat with your doctor about potential alcohol-medication interactions.)Alcohol may also weaken the immune system and slow down healing, Bracamonte says. Furthermore, drinking can cause dehydration, worsening symptoms.“The last thing you want to do when you have a cold is get dehydrated,” says Joan Blake, a registered dietitian and clinical instructor at Boston University. “If you take in something that is going to dehydrate you, it’s sort of like filling a bucket with a hole in the bottom.”It is also likely that if you’re not feeling well, you’re not eating much. Drinking alcohol on an empty stomach can cause blood sugar levels to drop, says Blake. Low blood sugar can lead to dizziness. In particular, people who are diabetic or pre-diabetic need to monitor their blood sugar, Blake explains.What’s good about a hot toddy?If you take the booze out of the equation, a non-alcoholic hot toddy could help with a cold, says Bracamonte.Lemon contains vitamin C, which can support the immune system, says Blake. Someresearchsuggests consuming vitamin C may slightly shorten the duration of the common cold (though you would probably need to consume at least200mg; an orange hasabout 83mg).Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’Meanwhile,studiesshowthathoney can help reduce cough frequency and discomfort. “A little bit of honey for a cough goes a long way,” says Bracamonte. A small amount of sugar, like the amount in a dollop of honey, can provide some necessary energy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Hydration helps with illness, especiallyupper respiratory infectionsincluding colds, explains Bracamonte. Staying hydratedhelps your cellsmaintain a strong immune system, reduces the likelihood of headaches, and loosens mucus.What can you eat or drink to help with a cold?If you’re intrigued by the idea of the hot toddy, Blake recommends adding ginger because of its anti-inflammatory components and swapping in apple cider to replace the whisky.Is your relationship solid – or sinking? The bird theory thinks it knowsRead moreEven if you don’t have an appetite, it’s still important to consume a small amount of sugar, “so you can have some kind of fuel”, Blake explains. A Gatorade or its equivalent could be helpful.Bracamonte also recommends chamomile tea as a soothing beverage.As for food, a 2010studyfound that eating fruits and vegetables is associated with a 20% reduction in the number of days of moderate or severe common cold symptoms. Blake also recommends classic chicken noodle soup: it is hydrating and contains a healthy balance of nutrients.Ultimately, it’s important to stay hydrated and get plenty of rest, says Bracamonte. Colds usually last between three and seven days; if your illness lasts longer than that or if you’re having difficulty breathing, you should contact your healthcare provider for help.While sipping a hot toddy might sound like a bright reprieve from the monotony of feeling sick, it’s more useful to stick to the basics: sleep, eat healthy and keep those non-boozy liquids coming.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyCommon coldHealth & wellbeingAlcoholAlternative medicineHealthCocktailsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Conservatives and Reform UK have called for withdrawal from the convention altogether.But writing for the Guardian,the prime minister said that updating the interpretation of the convention was urgently requiredto confront the challenges posed by mass migration – and far-right forces that sought to divide mainstream opinion across Europe.“The best way of fighting against the forces of hate and division, is to show that mainstream, progressive politics can fix this problem,” he wrote in a joint article with the Danish leader, Mette Frederiksen.“Listening to legitimate concerns and acting on them is what our politics is about. That’s not empty populism, it’s democracy. We are determined to show that our societies can act with compassion while upholding law and order, and fairness.”The two leaders called on European allies to go further in tackling the shared challenge of migration by modernising the ECHR to reflect the challenges of the 21st century.“Europe has faced big tests before and we have overcome them by acting together. Now we must do so again. Otherwise, the forces that seek to divide us will grow stronger.“So our message is this: as responsible, progressive governments we will deliver the change that people are crying out for. We will control our borders to protect our democracies – and make our nations stronger than ever in the years to come.”View image in fullscreenStarmer’s government will be represented at the Strasbourg meeting by David Lammy (left).Photograph: Thomas Krych/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockThe UK has sought to emulateDenmark’s hardline asylum model. Last year, the number of people being granted asylum in the country was the lowest in 40 years, excluding 2020 which was during the Covid pandemic.The government, which will be represented at the Strasbourg meeting byDavid Lammy, the justice secretary, and Richard Hermer, the attorney general, is understood to be considering all options to update the implementation of the ECHR.The proposed political declaration resulting from the summit would carry significant political weight and, if it garnered enough signatories, could directly influence how the European court of human rights interprets and applies ECHR rights.The government has already said it will legislate to clarify how article 8, the right to a private life, is interpreted in the domestic courts in regard to immigration rules.Lammy is expected to argue on Wednesday that the ECHR could also be reinterpreted to limit the scope of rights under article 3, which prohibits torture and “degrading treatment”.This could, for example, include higher thresholds for prison conditions or access to healthcare abroad where it currently prevents extradition or deportation from the UK.The deputy prime minister will reassert the UK’s commitment to the ECHR, saying that pulling out would be a “fake solution” that would undermine every international agreement on national and border security.At the summit, he is expected to say: “We must strike a careful balance between individual rights and the public’s interest, otherwise we risk a loss of confidence in the convention, and in human rights themselves.“The definition of ‘family life’ can’t be stretched to prevent the removal of people with no right to remain in the country … The threshold of ‘inhuman and degrading treatment’ must be constrained to the most serious issues.“States must be able to take proportionate decisions on the removal of foreign criminals, so that we renew the convention’s democratic foundation.”The sweeping changes to the UK asylum system came against the backdrop of Nigel Farage’s Reform UK attracting support because of the failure of successive governments to stop unauthorised small boat crossings in the Channel and unease about the use of hotels to house asylum seekers.They include measures such as forcing people with refugee status to return to their home country if it becomes safe, making people who arrive illegally wait 20 years before they can apply for permanent settlement, and revoking the statutory legal duty to provide asylum-seeker support, including housing and weekly allowances.Ministers say the government will introduce new safe and legal routes to the UK as a way to reduce the number of dangerous journeys in small boats across the Channel, although these routes will be capped.Some Labour MPs, charities and legal experts have warned that if a country such as the UK waters down the application of article 3, then less scrupulous nations could follow suit, with horrific implications.Veronika Fikfak, a professor of international law at University College London, said a change to the anti-torture provisions within the ECHR “touches the very core” of the convention.“Prohibition of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment is an absolute right. It allows for no balancing. There is no margin of appreciation for states, nor any deference to them,” she said.Lammy will meet ministers from 45 other countries to discuss possible changes at the meeting. Nine member states, including Italy and Denmark, signed a letter in May calling for the scope of the ECHR to be limited.Explore more on these topicsHuman rightsKeir StarmerEuropeRefugeesImmigration and asylumDavid LammyThe far rightnewsShareReuse this content"

I personally have the will and readiness for this,” he added.Trump made the comments in a rambling interview with Politico published earlier on Tuesday. “They haven’t had an election in a long time,” said the US president. “You know, they talk about a democracy, but it gets to a point where it’s not a democracy any more.”Zelenskyy’s five-year term expired in May last year, but the Ukrainian constitution prohibits elections in wartime, and even his political opponents have said repeatedly that the security and political considerations do not allow for holding an election during wartime.“It would only cause harm,” said Serhiy Rakhmanin, an MP from the opposition Holos party. “He’s the commander-in-chief, and the country is in a position where we don’t have that luxury, whatever issues we might have with him. It would only help the enemy,” he added.Zelenskyy said the two key questions to solve would be the logistical one of how soldiers, the millions of displaced people, and those living under occupation would be able to vote, and secondly, how to hold elections legally, given martial law is in effect.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He also said Kyiv was ready for an energy ceasefire if Russia agrees.Over the weekend, Trump’s son Donald Jrsaid at a conference in Dohathat Zelenskyy was prolonging the war because he was worried he would otherwise lose power. He also suggested Trump might “walk away” from Ukraine if the war does not end soon. “It’s not correct. But it’s not exactly wrong,” said Trump, when asked about his son’s claim.The US has indicated that Ukraine should give up the Donbas region to achieve peace, a move which would be highly unpopular in Ukraine.

The government has spent £92bn on interest payments so far for this financial year, it said.Bond yield graphicThe higher cost of borrowing for the UK comes despite the fundamentals of its economy being stronger than countries with lower borrowing costs. The UK’s debt-to-GDP ratio is 101%, compared with 122% in the US and 237% in Japan, and the government is planning to halve the amount it borrows each year by the end of this parliament.The problem is that bond traders think the UK is not good at keeping to its fiscal policies, the IPPR said. The mini-budget in 2022 under the Liz Truss administration “showed how quickly a UK government could bypass the fiscal framework”, the thinktank said. It added that in the years leading up to this event, successive chancellors had “repeatedly changed, missed or redefined their own fiscal rules” or changed themselves, with seven different chancellors from 2016 up to the 2024 election. A “lack of trust in stated fiscal policy has set in, as actions have spoken louder than words,” it said.However, the autumn budget prompted the UK premium against the eurozone to almost halve. William Ellis, a senior economist at IPPR, said: “The premium on UK borrowing costs appears to be easing, showing that markets are responding to growing confidence in the government’s fiscal approach. Sticking to its fiscal plans could save the exchequer billions and free up fiscal space in the future.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The youth strategy could “put them back in the driving seat of their own lives”, Nandy added.The Youth Matters plan, backed by £500m, aims to give 500,000 more young people access to a trusted adult outside their home, boost resilience and teach skills including how to stay safe online.There will also be up to 250 new or refurbished youth clubs over the next four years, 50 hubs providing access to professional support – including in Birmingham, Nottingham and County Durham – and new support for youth workers.“There’s an urgency to this. The most connected and the most isolated generation in history, with a significant number of young people who don’t feel safe in their daily lives, in no small part because of what is happening online, and England is an outlier,” Nandy said.View image in fullscreenThe culture secretary meets young people at an event in Peckham, south London.Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PA“So although these are global trends when it comes to loneliness, wellbeing and healthy relationships, we are doing far worse than many comparable countries because we’ve put young people last for two decades.“It’s violent indifference to an entire generation of young people who’ve grown up with a new set of challenges that the adults who want to support them can’t navigate ourselves and a systematic stripping away of the systems that were there to support them.”The culture secretary, who launched the strategy at an event in Peckham, south London, said youngsters had been shaped by the Covid pandemic, the cost of living crisis, global uncertainty and an always-on digital world.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, she said most young people did not want an Australian-style social media ban.“The challenge with banning social media is enforcement. Are we really saying as a country that we’re going to start prosecuting under-18s for using social media? Instead, what they wanted was the help and support to both police and to navigate the online space in the same way as you would in the real world.”Giving more young people a place to go, access to a trusted adult – whether that was a youth worker, teacher or sports coach – and more enrichment activities for working-class children could all help them make meaningful real-life connections, she said.Local government spending on youth services fell by 73% between 2010-11 and 2022-23, with more than 1,000 youth centres closing and more than 4,500 youth worker roles lost.View image in fullscreenThe national youth strategy is backed by £500m in government funding.Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PA“At the root of all of this is self-worth … They matter. They haven’t felt that they matter for a very long time, and that, in turn, makes them very vulnerable, whether it’s to gangs exploiting them to run drugs across county lines or it’s these online influencers who are preying on them.”Nandy said: “There too many people in this country who feel that government is something that exists to stop them from living the lives they want to live, not enabling them to live the lives that they want to live. That’s very acute amongst young people.”But it would not change by lecturing them to go out to vote. “Absolutely not. Can we do it by genuinely empowering people to make that change in their own lives? … Yes, I think we can. That’s why this national youth strategy is important … because we put them back in the driving seat of their own lives to make the change that they need.”Explore more on these topicsYoung peopleLisa NandyLabournewsShareReuse this content"

I mean, good golly, what happens if they get into power?”The cease and desist letter from Monk called for the “immediate removal” of three videos published by Kimberley, including one where he calls Reform “the new nasty party” and “the new party of the school bully”.In the video, Kimberley also said there had been a string of allegedly “hateful comments” about disabled people, including from Monk. He also accused Reform councillors of supporting a Facebook group that encourages people to erectEnglandflags.Kimberley said he was “trying to get information out there” about the county council, adding that it was important to hold local politicians accountable.In his written response to Monk, Kimberley said he would not remove any content and would continue commenting on “matters of legitimate public interest”.“Your demand that I ‘cease making any public mention’ of your name or referring to you or Reform UK is breathtakingly authoritarian,” he wrote. “You are an elected public official who has chosen to align yourself with a political party. Both you and that party are entirely proper subjects for political commentary and criticism.”When contacted, Monk said in a statement: “As the matter is currently being investigated and legal action may be pursued, it would be inappropriate for me to comment at this time.”Explore more on these topicsReform UKLocal governmentWorcestershireEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

You suddenly become aware that actually it’s been a boundary around our history, and around contemporary art. But that boundary is dissolving.”Charlotte Hollinshead, Kalu’s studio manager and artistic facilitator, made a winner’s speech on her behalf. She said: “Nnena has faced an incredible amount of discrimination, which continued to this day, so hopefully this award helps to smash the prejudice away.”Kalu wore a rosette which read “Idol, Legend, Winner, Whatever”, which was something a participant in a workshop had said about the artist.Kalu’s drawings and sculptures, described by the Guardian art critic Eddy Frankel as “huge cocoons wrapped into massive, tight, twisting, ultra-colourful knots”, impressed the judging panel, who were torn in a year when nearly all the artists were tipped as potential winners.View image in fullscreenNnena Kalu’s drawings and sculptures have been described as ‘huge cocoons wrapped into massive, tight, twisting, ultra-colourful knots’.Photograph: PA Images/Alamy Live NewsTheTurner prize, regarded as one of the art world’s most prestigious awards, is presented to an artist born or working in Britain for an outstanding exhibition or presentation of their work over the previous year.The 2025 nominees were widely seen as artists who all seemed to speak to Britain’s contemporary times, where identity and the concept of belonging are in flux. The critical response to the work was typically passionate and divided.The Guardian’s Adrian Searle praised the show, but pickedKaluas the standout artist. Her work is constructed from adhesive tape, clingfilm, repurposed plastics, fabrics, cable ties and VHS tape which is bound up into different forms.Searle said Kalu, an autistic artist with learning disabilities and limited verbal communication, created work that was “irreducible” and reminiscent of the US artistJudith Scottand the German artistHanne Darboven.“There’s no fudging,” he wrote. “Kalu deserves to win this year’s Turner prize.” His comments proved prophetic but other critics felt similarly passionately about other artists.The Telegraph’s Alastair Sooke singled out the “violent” work of Mohammed Sami, an artist who began his career paintingofficial portraits of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad. He picked out his painting, The Hunter’s Return, writing that the “colossal, 19ft-wide vision of combat forces, in which green lasers slice through a thick orange dust storm”, was so unnerving that, “surely, the prize must go to him”.The Times’ Nancy Durrant also picked Sami as 2025’s best work. “Evocative, allusive and fantastically well executed, these are stunning works that reward lengthy contemplation,” she wrote.View image in fullscreenWork by Rene Matić, whose black dolls represented ‘contested ideas of nationhood and belonging’.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPAPeterborough’s Rene Matić was the second youngest-ever nominee, and their work featured an installation where the voices of Nina Simone and bell hooks drifted over the room.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The prize headed back out on the road after last year’s ceremony at Tate Britain, its spiritual home.At Cartwright Hall each of the nominees was given a separate room, with the work displayed across two floors of the building. The award was given out by Steven Frayne AKA Dynamo.Kalu was born in Glasgow in 1966 to Nigerian parents, but moved at a young age to Wandsworth in London. She first began practising art at the Hill House day centre in Tooting, south London in the late 1980s. She now has her studio at ActionSpace in Clapham, a charity that provides space and help to learning disabled artists.Her trajectory has been meteoric. In 2016, she showed alongside contemporary artists including Laure Prouvost in Belgium; then took part in Glasgow International two years later. Her first commercial gallery show was last year, and in 2025 her first major institutional exhibition opened at Norway’s Kunsthall Stavanger.Kalu made history by winning the award, with the disability charity Sense calling her nomination, “richly deserved and long overdue”.Farquharson added: “The drawings have this beautiful visual, subtle formal quality, while the sculptures look like vortexes or whirlpools and draw you in. They are these amazingly compelling things, which draw you in, give you joy and that keep you coming back.”Explore more on these topicsTurner prizeArtNeurodiversityBradfordAwards and prizesInstallationDisabilitynewsShareReuse this content"

He had changed his name by deed poll.He was instead, asa final report by Operation Kenovaeffectively revealed without officially doing so on Tuesday, for a long time Britain’s most valuable spy inside the IRA during the Troubles in Northern Ireland, once described by an army general as the “golden egg” of the intelligence services.More pertinently to the torment of those related to his victims, he was a sadistic murderer who had been in the pay of the British state.Who was Stakeknife? MI5 mole at heart of IRA – timelineRead moreIn his dual role, as a British agent and head of the IRA’s so-called “nutting squad”, an internal security unit dedicated to rooting out informants, Scappaticci would threaten to string up and skin his victims before offering to let them go free if they confessed.Then he would order, or indeed personally carry out, their execution. He would play taped confessions to the families left behind. And he would tell the British intelligence services all about it, before finally being assisted to leaveNorthern Irelandas his identity was being revealed.Operation Kenova reported on Tuesday, in a final report after nine years of investigation, thatMI5had been aware of pretty much everything.View image in fullscreenA relative of a victim holds a copy of the report during a press conference in Belfast on Tuesday.Photograph: Charles McQuillan/Getty ImagesThey had not only allowed it all to happen, but in the 1990s – before the valiant efforts in 2003 of Irish and UK newspapers to out the identity of “Agent Stakeknife”, after which Scappaticci fled to England – there had been discussion within theBritish armyabout a “farewell dinner” after some unwelcome speculation about his identity. A guest list was organised and a venue pinpointed.On Tuesday, the families of his victims further learned that, for all the talk of transparency and justice, the British security services had successfully argued within government, against the appeals of various senior police officers, that they should persist with the policy of neither confirming nor denying the identity of Stakeknife.The report did all it could. “The claims about this have been seen as authoritative and credible and are almost universally treated as true,” it said.Scappaticci grew up in the Markets area of south Belfast, an area known as Little Italy, and was a talented footballer, trialling with Nottingham Forest in 1962 as a 14-year-old but returning home after three weeks due to home sickness. He was an early volunteer for the nascent provisional IRA, and was known for having a short fuse.After being interned in the 1970s, when the British started locking up suspected IRA members without trial, he moved up the ranks, becoming first the head of the Belfast brigade, then number two and leader of the internal security unit charged with flushing out informers.Scappaticci was, it is said by almost all those who knew him, a monster in the role, seemingly taking pleasure in killing “touts”.View image in fullscreenA mural on the Falls Road in west Belfast with an IRA warning for informers, or ‘touts’.Photograph: Kaveh Kazemi/Getty ImagesOperation Kenova established that his cultivation and recruitment had begun in the late 1970s and he had been a British agent into the 1990s.According to Kenova, his motivation for wanting to become an agent appears “to have been linked either to a risk that he was facing criminal prosecution or a desire for financial gain”.They found that his “military source record document” listed a number of other reasons for his continuing to work for the security forces, including a wish for the armed conflict to end, a persistent dissatisfaction with the IRA hierarchy and a desire to protect his family.On first being approached by army agent handlers, Scappaticci was reported as saying that he had wanted to assist the security forces for some time but did not know how to go about making contact.Within the IRA, Scappaticci was known as a “bully” about whom “no one had a good word to say”. He was also long known to be a “porn fanatic” with a taste for the extreme.Despite the best efforts of British police in recent years, he only once saw the inside of a courtroom, let alone a prison cell. That was in December 2018, when he was described by the then magistrate Emma Arbuthnot as being in very poor health and living a lonely existence.Westminster magistrates court had heard that Scappaticci, wearing a grubby blue fleece and green tracksuit bottoms, had used a laptop seized by police earlier in the year to search for information on “cars, the British army, maps, combat, football and politics”.There had also been 13 searches for extreme pornography. Some of it had included animals.Scappaticci had told police officers in mitigation that he was depressed, a condition with which he had suffered for a number of years. He said he was not really interested in animals that way, and that he preferred women with big breasts. It was “not doing anyone any real harm”, he vainly claimed.The court sentenced Scappaticci, then 72, to a three-month suspended jail term. He left the court on London’s Marylebone Road a free man. “You have not been before the court for 50 years – and that’s good character in my book,” Arbuthnot had told him.Good character? Certainly he had been well compensated for his work over the years. Kenova reported that a number of financial incentives had been offered during his time as an agent, from the “equivalent of an average wage to lump sums of tens of thousands of pounds”.He was protected to the end. In an act peculiar only to the royal family until now, publication of his will was blocked.“Operation Kenova was unable to ascertain how much money the agent was paid in total,” the report published on Tuesday said. “However, it is well documented that when he was finally resettled in Great Britain he was accommodated in a detached property, with a car, and was able to enjoy a social life with people who had no idea of his past life. It is also known that he had limited contact with members of his family. There is no evidence that he participated in any paid employment after his move to Great Britain.”Explore more on these topicsNorthern IrelandIRAMI5British armyMilitaryUK security and counter-terrorismfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Alongside that insurmountable sadness comes the question of how to reconcile grief’s normally private, quiet bearing with the fact that your bereavement was a public event. Nobody would be blamed for staying out of sight, saying no to interviewers and documentary-makers, and holding the memories close. But in Our Girls: the Southport Families, we see how a loss shared can be miraculously powerful.Nine-year-old Alice da Silva Aguiar, seven-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe and six-year-old Bebe King were all murdered on 29 July 2024, when a man invaded a holiday dance class in Southport, Merseyside and attacked children at random. The programme does not linger on the horror, or speak the killer’s name: instead it begins by introducing us to the girls as their parents remember them. Alice “was magic, she was wonder … the best daughter we could ask for”; Elsie “was unforgettable … she taught us how to be a mum and dad”; Bebe “was pure joy: everything was in a dance, everything was in a song”.These tributes are deeply moving for being both familiar and unique: almost every parent would say similar about their dead child, but no children were exactly like these three, and it’s a privilege to know them a little through home movies and their parents’ words. Mr Bowman, Alice’s favourite teacher at Churchtown Primary School, joins in: “Sometimes, something clicks. You see a lightbulb in some children and you just get them. Alice got me, and I got Alice.”The first sign that the Southport parents’ reaction to their situation will be an extraordinary one comes when Alice’s mum and dad, Alexandra and Sergio Aguiar, visit the school, having requested to meet the staff. The speech they have written for headteacher Jinnie Payne to deliver – she just about manages to make it to the end without breaking down – contains this startling awareness of the feelings of others, when it would be so easy to see the loss of Alice as theirs alone: “Last year, our Alice was taken from us, her parents, but also from you …”Sergio and Mrs Payne both pledge to run the London Marathon, to raise money for a new school playground that will serve as a memorial to Alice – and to Bebe, also a Churchtown girl. They’re joined in the race by Elsie’s father David, who had planned to compete in the name of the hospice where his mother died, with Elsie cheering him on. “That didn’t happen,” he says. “I ended up running it for Elsie.”In a programme full of moments that provoke fountains of tears, the marathon is the emotional pinnacle. David reports exhaustion kicking in at 21 miles, before his self-doubt was banished by an onlooker shouting, “Come on, Elsie’s dad!” When we see Sergio stationary with hands on knees for a long moment before he straightens up and staggers on, we don’t need him to tell us afterwards that it was Alice he was asking for encouragement. In the background are thousands of amateur athletes, so many of them there because they’re trying to turn heartbreak into hope.Most of those people don’t have the resources and opportunities the Southport families have, gifted to them by the compassion and generosity of the public – it’s empowering to watch them take this opportunity so readily. While Alice’s parents ride the momentum of the playground project into the formation of Alice’s WonderDance, a charitable foundation offering kids the chance to try dancing, David and Jenni Stancombe establish Elsie’s Story, a grant-giving charity supporting community projects that bring joy to children. Bebe’s mum and dad, Lauren and Ben King, dedicate themselves to Bebe’s Hive, which provides spaces in which bereaved children can find solace in therapy and creativity.“We didn’t know each other before [but] it’s been crucial to our survival,” says Lauren King of the bond that’s formed between the six parents. Together, they successfully lobby the government for the money needed to revamp the space outside Southport town hall, making that the place where the local community can heal together.For us at home, affected as everyone was by the news of the Southport killings – in a way that’s wholly insignificant compared to the loss felt by the girls’ parents, but which is real nonetheless – this is where the film finds its moral. “It really shows how many amazing people there are,” says Elsie’s mum, Jenni, reflecting on how public support has enabled her to give her daughter a lasting, positive legacy. “The good will always outweigh the bad. We can showcase good every day.”Our Girls: the Southport Families aired on BBC One and is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

To post a picture of you and your new partner on Instagram – on the grid, mind you, not hiding behind the cowardice of a story – is to not only declare that you are in love, but also that you are confident enough in your future to share it with the world.As such, Katy Perry’s decision to go Instagram official withJustin Trudeauis a classic of the genre. Long dogged by rumours that they might be together, Perry this week debuted a sanctioned image of them both. They are cheek to cheek. They are smiling, albeit in that slightly strained hurry-up-and-take-it way you do when someone decides to shoot a whole reel of photos. Katy Perry is pulling the exact same face she did when she stared into the camera that time she sort of went into space, which is how you know that it is really serious. Good luck to the pair of them.Luckily, if you’d like to go Instagram official with your new squeeze, celebrities have given you a range of options. However, some are more successful than others …The embarrassed hideView image in fullscreenAriana, third from left, and Ethan, far right with the Wicked cast.Photograph: Don Arnold/WireImageLast year, headlines around the world screamed things such as: “Ariana Grande finally goes Instagram official with Ethan Slater with loved-up display”. The problem is that you wouldn’t know this unless you looked really really hard. Last November, Grande posted a carousel of pictures to her account with the caption: “Sydney, you have stolen our hearts”. The first picture was of her with Cynthia Erivo. The second picture was just of her from behind. The third one was of her from the front. The fourth one was of her and Erivo again. Number five, literally a bubble. I won’t describe all 19 photos she posted, but one – and only one – of them is of her and Ethan Slater. They are on a stage with four other people. This does not count. Try harder.The panicky deleteView image in fullscreenSelena posted and quickly deleted a video of her with The Weeknd.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesIn January 2017, singer and actorSelena Gomezwent to Italy with alternative R&B star The Weeknd. We know this because Gomez posted a short black and white video of The Weeknd to her Instagram, captioned with a heart eyes emoji. But after a couple of hours, she deleted it. Nobody knows why. Maybe she intended for the relationship to maintain some mystique, or maybe she was asked to take it down. Either way, the relationship didn’t last. The world learned of its demise that November when, in a thematically just manner, The Weeknd deleted every picture of Gomez from his Instagram.Doing it in costumeView image in fullscreenYou talkin’ to me? Channing and Zoe bizarrely chanelled Taxi Driver.Photograph: InstagramGoing Instagram official while in fancy dress is a bold move. It not only signals to the world that you are together, but also that you’re both comfortable enough in each other’s company to dress like a couple of silly geese. This is the approach thatChanning Tatumand Zoë Kravitz took in October 2021, when they posed together in their Halloween costumes.

Others wrote: “Well he moves on quick”, “OMG Elizabeth’s gone Cray Cray” and ”It just makes no sense”. The moral here is clear – it’s one thing to go Instagram official, but if you just surprise everyone out of the blue, expect them to have to endure a moment of adjustment.The retaliationView image in fullscreenGerard and Clara Chia Marti announce that they’re a couple.Photograph: Instagram/3gerardpiqueFor years,Shakiraand footballer Gerard Pique seemed like the perfect couple, able to weather busy careers and colossal tax evasion trials like they were nothing. But, when the couple broke up in 2022, after 11 years together, things suddenly looked a lot less rosy. First Shakira released a song about how much she doesn’t like Pique’s new girlfriend, including the lines “I’m worth two 22-year-olds,” and “You swapped a Ferrari for a Twingo”. Then, a couple of weeks later, Pique went Instagram official with the aforementioned girlfriend, Clara Chia Marti. Which is fun, because everyone wants to be used as a retaliatory device for their boyfriend’s ex, don’t they?The differing eyelinesView image in fullscreenPuppy love … Bella and Mark with a classic pose.Photograph: Instagram/bellathorneOne of the problems with the Perry/Trudeau shot is that they’re both looking directly into the camera, because they both want the viewers to see how happy they are. However, those experienced in going Instagram official will know that whatKaty Perryreally wanted was a photo of her looking at the camera and him looking at her. This pose has been done countless times, but the one of Bella Thorne and her boyfriend Mark Emms is textbook. She’s looking at us. He’s looking at her. He can’t believe his luck, and she knows it. She’s even tickling him under the chin, like you would a dog. I’d put money on Perry and Trudeau copying this pose exactly when they post their next shot.The parasocial overdriveView image in fullscreenWorldwide web … Tom and Zendaya make it official on Instagram.Photograph: Instagram/tomholland2013Tom Holland plays Spider-Man in the Spider-Man films.

So when they decided to tell the world that they were actually together in real life in 2021, they decided to do it with a photo ofTom Hollanddressed as Spider-Man. Also, the caption was dedicated to “my MJ”. The bad news is that deliberately conflating yourselves with the fictional characters you play in films is an extremely weird move that plays to the very worst instincts of all your already-overzealous fans. The good news is that, since you have never played Spider-Man in a series of successful movies, you are unlikely to copy this one.The goofy montageView image in fullscreenChris and Alba opted for a montage of pranks.Photograph: Instragram/chrisevansIn early 2023,Chris Evans– another Marvel star – chose to go Instagram official with his new partner Alba Baptista. However, he did this by posting a short film of the pair of them playing pranks on each other throughout the duration of the previous year. These pranks predominantly consisted of the couple surprising each other by screaming at them as they entered a room. If you’re charitable, you could say that this method shows the couple at their most unguarded. If you’re not, you could say that this is the sort of thing the worst couples post on TikTok because they’re desperate for engagement.The mid-kiss snapView image in fullscreenSealed with a kiss … the classic. Sadly for Lana and Clayton the smooching only lasted a few more months.Photograph: Instagram/claywatchAn absolute stone-cold classic. Forget the face-to-face straight-to-camera smile. If you really want to show the world that you are absolutely together with someone, then you need to take a picture of the pair of you kissing. In 2021 this is exactly what singer Lana Del Rey did with her new boyfriend, former Stereo Skyline musician Clayton Johnson. It’s a photo of them kissing, except Del Rey has held her phone up to capture the moment in a conveniently placed mirror. Forget that it probably took a painstaking amount of setup to get right, and that it did look a bit presumptuous a few months later when they split up. As a template for going Instagram Official this is hard to beat.The namecheckView image in fullscreenBy Royal approval … Taylor and Travis’s crowning moment.Photograph: Instagram/taylorswiftInevitably, however, Taylor Swift beat it. Because when she went Instagram official with her boyfriendTravis Kelcelast year, she did it in such an aggressively ostentatious way that it’s hard to know how to react. On one hand, the pair did it with a photo taken backstage at one of her concerts. On the other, they also decided to share the frame with Prince William and his two eldest children. Imagine doing that. Imagine roping in the two next kings of England and a princess to stand there so that they can be deliberately overshadowed by the knowledge that you’ve got a new boyfriend. It is, as the young people say, a hell of a flex. A couple of centuries ago it’s also the sort of behaviour that would get you decapitated, but times have changed.Explore more on these topicsRelationshipsKaty PerryJustin TrudeauCelebrityAriana GrandeSelena GomezThe WeekndfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Their identity of always taking the aggressive option, of relentlessly putting pressure on their opponents, isn’t holding up to scrutiny. So far in this series they haven’t had the strength needed to achieve it, and they haven’t had the skills either.I was confident that they could win the Ashes this time, mainly because I thought there was quality in the squad and that they had adapted their game to add intelligence and adaptability to their armoury. It’s becoming clear that neither of those beliefs were completely true. And meanwhile I’m seeing things at home that make me worry that this team aren’t just messing up this series, they’re messing up a whole generation of young cricketers.England dealt fresh Ashes blow with Mark Wood ruled out for rest of seriesRead moreIn their first innings at the Gabba Australia added 189 for the last four wickets, and how did they do it? They were ruthless, gutsy, determined and they had the big picture in mind. Beyond the brilliant Joe Root’swonderful, classy centuryEngland showed none of those qualities until thefourth day, when they were already facing near-certain defeat.At this point Ben Stokes and Will Jacks displayed the adaptability I had hoped to see more of, as the two faced 220 balls in a battling partnership of 96. Stokes has proven many times that he is a very adaptable cricketer, capable of batting in different styles at different moments, and here we saw that quality again. But he’s not seeing any of that adaptability in his players, who for three years have been bombarded with messaging about taking the aggressive option, pushing the game forward.Of course I don’t know what is said inside the dressing room, but there has not been much nuance in what they say to the media or how they play on the pitch. We need to see more of it when the game is there to be won. There are times when taking the game forward means scoring quickly, and times when it means showing grit, fight and determination when the game is on the line to make sure it goes your way.My worry is that there will be real, long-term implications from all this. I work with boys in county pathways and they are absolutely scrambled. Counties are bombarding young players with talk of power hitting, reverse sweeping, aggression. In the past couple of weeks I’ve spoken to three boys, all with different counties, and when I have asked about their batting all three told me they are hyper-aggressive and look to score off every ball. One thing we have seen, in this series and across Test history, is that on pitches that do a little bit, that have uneven bounce, and against bowlers of the highest skill, that isn’t going to be possible.The really amazing thing is that there is another approach, and England have the best in the world in their dressing room. But no one seems to be looking for the next Root, and England have certainly not looked to pick anyone else with anything like his skillset. They’re saying: we like what he does but we’ve got something better, more entertaining, more successful. And we’re seeing the limitations of that philosophy in every game.View image in fullscreenHarry Brook leaves the field after another disappointing dismissal, in the second innings at Brisbane.Photograph: Philip Brown/Getty ImagesThere are players in this team who have technical issues, which is another problem entirely, and others whose issues are with their mindset. Harry Brook is a wonderful player who will have a great career, but his dismissal in the first innings was astonishing in the context of the match situation, the changing light, the fact Stokes was in next, that Mitchell Starc was likely to come back quite quickly. England have zero chance of winning the Ashes while players are being so carefree.The bowling showed similar problems. I was so frustrated to see how fast Jofra Archer bowled at the start of Australia’s second innings – at that point it was irrelevant, as Steve Smith apparently told him. I thought he would have got a lot more out of that pitch, given his pace, height and accuracy, but if so far he hasn’t done what I expected of him he is one of several. Though Starc is of course a wonderful player, Australia’s seam attack in this game wasn’t incredible – but it was incredibly disciplined and very well led. When they had a bad spell at the start of England’s second innings they identified it quickly, had a chat at the next break and went back to basics.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In Brisbane barely 5% of England’s deliveries in Australia’s first innings would have hit the stumps. That’s on a pitch that was showing uneven bounce. To me that displays a lack of discipline, a lack of accuracy, and a lack of clarity in their plans. Meanwhile Michael Neser, a very English-style bowler – not express pace but very accurate –took six wickets in the match. There were just too many poor deliveries from a group of English bowlers who couldn’t exert any kind of control, and they went all over the park.Brendon McCullum suggested Englandhad probably trained too muchand spoke of the need for more variety in their practice schedule, which was a fascinating comment. I think perhaps he was referring to the limitations of training in nets, which they have been largely restricted to because of their lack of match practice. Now they’re off to Noosa on a golfing mini-break.This is a very talented group of players, but we’re seeing a mentality that after three years of consistent messaging has lost nuance. From what Stokes said after the match I think he has become aware of this, and it looked as if he is planning to have some very honest discussions with his players before they head to Adelaide. Perhaps their training has to change, but so does their attitude. And if the people in charge can’t make that happen over the next three Tests, there will be a strong argument for changing them too.Explore more on these topicsAshes 2025-26England cricket teamAustralia cricket teamThe AshesCricketAustralia sportcommentShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Ernesta Chirwa recalls the jarring moment the woman she presumed was her midwife said something unexpected. Caitlyn Collins was driving her to hospital after 6am, on 15 February 2022. “She said,” says Chirwa, who is 30 and lives in Cape Town, “Please don’t mention to the nurses that we were trying to have a home birth.”The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Chirwa was in too much pain to speak – she was in active labour. But she remembers feeling surprised. “Why,” Chirwa recalls, “is she asking us not to mention that we were trying to have a home birth?”This was the first pregnancy for Chirwa and her husband, Chifundo Bingala. Both are originally from Malawi, but moved to Cape Town,South Africa, for work: Chirwa found employment as a cleaner, and Bingala as a tailor. The couple met Collins through one of Bingala’s friends, a local shopkeeper who had seen her deliver a friend’s baby in a home birth, and vouched for her. The couple say they couldn’t afford Collins’s fee but she agreed to an exchange of clothing, made by Bingala, for her services.When Chirwa went past her due date, to 43 weeks, Collins told the couple via text that such a late-term birth “can be normal”. When Chirwa went into labour, Collins arrived at her house after midnight, turned off the lights and fell asleep. At about 2am, Chirwa and Bingala roused Collins, who briefly checked her before going back to sleep. Around 5am, they woke Collins up a second time. She checked Chirwa again, and saw a baby’s foot protruding from her vagina.Now, in a silence punctuated only by Chirwa’s groans, Collins drove the couple to Retreat Day hospital. It was the closest hospital to their house, in the township of Westlake. Butit specialised in low-risk care and wasn’t suited for more serious emergencies. And Chirwa was very much a serious emergency. Her baby was footling breech – one of the most difficult types of breech to deliver – with a prolapsed cord. And though Chirwa didn’t yet know it, she was carrying twins.View image in fullscreenCaitlyn Collins’s testimonial for the Radical Birth Keeper school.Photograph: YouTube/Free Birth SocietyChirwa and Bingala recall that Collins initially tried to drop Chirwa off at the gate. Bingala intervened and demanded Collins drive them to the front entrance. Chirwa, he pointed out, couldn’t walk. Collins pulled up by the entrance and dropped them off. And then she left.At Retreat, midwives found a heartbeat on the monitor. But Chirwa would have to transfer to Mowbray Maternity Hospital, which had doctors and could handle complex cases. Chirwa waited two agonising hours for the ambulance to arrive.Unbeknown to Chirwa, the woman she believed to be her midwife was a graduate from an online school that promoted an extreme set of beliefs, run by a business on another continent. The Free Birth Society (FBS) is a North Carolina-based business founded by ex-doula and social media influencer Emilee Saldaya.Saldaya and her business partner, Canadian ex-doula Yolande Norris-Clark, embrace a dogmatic view of freebirth, meaning giving birth without any medical assistance. They promote so-called “wild” pregnancies, in which women avoid ultrasound tests and other prenatal care, they downplay potentially serious birth complications and discourage women from attending medical appointments.In November,the Guardian published a report based on a year-long investigationwhich identified48 cases of late-term stillbirths or neonatal deaths or other forms of serious harminvolving mothers or birth attendants who appear to be linked to FBS.Collins would later deny Chirwa hired her as a midwife, insisting she had made her and her husband aware she did not provide medical careMost women find FBS through its popular podcast, which has been downloaded more than 5m times: in it, women share their empowering and uplifting freebirth stories. Others buy its instructional video course, The Complete Guide to Free Birth. Ernesta Chirwa was an unhappy exception: she unknowingly encountered FBS through Collins, the woman she thought was her midwife.Chirwa, who is Black, was reassured by the fact that, when she visited Collins’s “beautiful, fancy” home, she saw wealthy-looking white couples there, which made her feel she was in safe hands. Because it was her first pregnancy, Chirwa did not realise that the prenatal care that Collins provided – massaging her bump and listening to the baby’s heartbeat through a stethoscope – fell far short of what a licensed midwife would provide. “I just thought, like, that’s all that has to be done,” says Chirwa.View image in fullscreenEmilee Saldaya and Caitlyn Collins on a Free Birth Society podcast.Photograph: Free Birth Society/YouTubeCollins would later deny that Chirwa hired her as a midwife, insisting that she had always made her and her husband aware that she did not provide medical care, but “emotional support, birthing education and physical support in the form of massages”. Collins identified by a different name: a birth keeper. But, says Chirwa: “I have never heard of something like a birth keeper in my life.”A “radical birth keeper” is a term Saldaya coined, she says, to manoeuvre around the fact that, in many countries, practising midwifery without a licence is illegal. “To be crystal clear, a radical birth keeper is in practice an authentic midwife,” Saldaya told her students in 2025.To train these “authentic midwives”, since 2020, FBS has run online schools that are estimated to have generated in excess of $4m (£3m) in revenues. Among the most lucrative and long-running of these is the Radical Birth Keeper school, a three-month, $6,000 course, taught via Zoom. To date, more than 850 women, from 30 countries around the world, have graduated as radical birth keepers.Collins and her business partner founded a practice called Circle of Elephants. What services it provided is subject to disputeCollins is one of its better-known graduates among FBS faithful, and one of several who appear to have turned to FBS after becoming disenchanted with medical careers. Before she started calling herself a birth keeper, Collins was a trained midwife. She passed the North American Registry of Midwives exam, which meant that she could practise in the US as a certified professional midwife. But Collins, who is from Cape Town, was unable to practise legally as a midwife in SouthAfrica, as the South African Nursing Council (SANC), refused to recogniseUS-trained midwives.Collins and her business partner founded a practice called Circle of Elephants. Precisely what services it provided is subject to dispute. Documentation from the now-defunct practice, seen by the Guardian, states it was a “midwifery practice” that provided an evidence-based “midwifery model of care”. Collins’s lawyers have denied Circle of Elephants ever purported to offer midwifery services, describing it as a traditional birthing centre staffed by “birthing assistants”.View image in fullscreenErnesta Chirwa near her home in the Western Cape.Photograph: Chris de Beer-Procter/The GuardianIn March 2020 and June 2021, two stillbirths were linked to Circle of Elephants in an 18-month period. South Africa’s Mail & Guardian newspaper and investigative show Carte Blanche wouldlater reportthat a doctor at Mowbray hospital – the hospital to which Chirwa had eventually been transferred while in labour after a two-hour wait – reported Collins and her partner to the healthcare authorities. Officials from the Western Cape Department of Health and Wellness interviewed them in July 2021 to discuss their concerns and, four months later, in November that year, the department ordered them to stop practising until they were registered with SANC. (Chirwa, who was by then in her eighth month of pregnancy, says Collins did not inform her of this development.)It wasn’t just doctors and healthcare bosses who were concerned about how Collins and her business partner were operating. The Cape Town home birth community is close-knit, and Collins and her business partner were viewed as having a laissez faire approach. Local midwives arranged two meetings with Collins and her business partner to discuss their concerns, the first in July 2021, and the second in September that year.The meetings were peer reviews, meaning an opportunity to learn from what had happened, but Collins appeared to perceive them as an attack. According to minutes of the September meeting, she told the midwives in the room that she felt “fear, anger and sadness”.Collins told the midwives that she was navigating a world in which the systems were failing womenThey discussed the two stillbirths, and Collins and her colleague defended the care they had provided.Collins stood firm in her views. She told the midwives that she was navigating a world in which the systems were failing women. “Instead of taking things personally,” she said, “we should look at the fact that we are building anewway of doing things.”In an appearance on the FBS podcast in 2022, Collins talked about how low she felt before she discovered Saldaya’s organisation. She told Saldaya, its host, that in South Africa: “The midwives have no solidarity with one another. It’s like, it’s really sad.” But then she enrolled in the Radical Birth Keeper School.“Being part of the community of the Radical Birth Keeper School,” Collins said, “feels like I’ve circled back to the little girl that I was and like totally trust in the magic again of life and death, birth, life and death, [and] everything in between.”Ina 2021 video testimonial for the school, Collins, who is referred to in the FBS clip as a “midwife”, smiled as she explained that the Radical Birth Keeper school had taught her “intense yet really amazing light-bulb moments” in which she realised how she had been “affected by the industrial medical model and how this compromised my own health and wellbeing”.Now, said Collins on the FBS podcast, she was working to support women who “want to be radically responsible” for their own births. In this, she was also echoing FBS language. Saldaya and Norris-Clark teach that women should take “radical responsibility” for their lives by choosing free birth.It is a term that Saldaya, through the Radical Birth Keeper school and her enormously popular podcast, has exported to every continent on Earth. And now, through Collins, the term arrived in South Africa.Before the ambulance arrived to take her to Mowbray hospital, Chirwa watched on the monitor as her daughter Kweli’s heart stopped beating. “One of the nurses,” she says, “told the other nurse: ‘You know what? There’s no longer any heartbeat here. There’s nothing happening.’ And then out of the blue, [the nurses] all just scattered.”After she was transferred to Mowbray, staff informed her that she had been pregnant with twins, but that both of her children were now dead, her son Kwesi having died in utero a day or so before. Chirwa was the only mother on the ward without a living child in her arms. “I just felt so empty,” she says.On 16 February 2022, the day after Chirwa delivered her dead children, Collins posted on her Instagram account. “Midwifery means with women. It doesn’t mean with the system … let’s take back birth, sisters.”Chirwa and Bingala would later report Collins to Cape Town police, and launch a separate lawsuit against Collins for alleged negligence. In court filings, they alleged that Collins provided “shockingly poor” medical advice and care, failed to inform them that she was not a licensed midwife, and failed to disclose information about the stillbirths linked to her practice.An expert review for the purpose of civil litigation, based on the parent’s’ accounts and Chirwa’s medical records, was carried out on behalf of Chirwa and Bingala by local obstetrician Dr Linda Murray. She described the outcome as “a shocking case of misconduct and substandard care”.NHS directed pregnant women to controversial Free Birth Society via charityRead moreShe identified multiple alleged failings: the fact that Chirwa went to 43 weeks of pregnancy, not knowing she was carrying twins, despite the fact that experts typically recommend a planned birth for twins at between 36 and 38 weeks. The lack of prenatal care Collins provided: no recommendations for ultrasounds, no blood tests, no blood-pressure checks, no urine samples, and no measurement of her baby bump. The fact that, when Chirwa went into labour, her baby bump was so big that it was off the measuring charts.Angela Wakeford, a midwife who reviewed Chirwa’s medical notes, reached a similar conclusion. “Those twins,” she says, “should not have died.”Collins’s lawyers, in her defence, insisted that she had always presented herself as a birth keeper, not a midwife or any sort of medical provider – and claimed she had advised the couple to seek medical support. They denied Collins told Chirwa not to tell staff at Retreat hospital that she had been attempting a home birth, and said that when Collins dropped them off at the facility she told a person she presumed was an orderly that Chirwa needed immediate medical attention. Collins’s lawyers said there was no contractual agreement with Chirwa and Bingala, and described a skirt Bingala sewed for her as a gift rather than an exchange for services.View image in fullscreenErnesta Chirwa holds mementos gifted to her and her husband, Cifundo Bingala, after the loss of their twins.Photograph: Chris de Beer-Procter/The GuardianThey also sought to flip the script, arguing that it was Chirwa and Bingala – rather than Collins – who were at fault. It was their “negligent” failure to attend professional maternity services for checkups, Collins’s lawyers argued, that “contributed to the death[s] of their twin babies”.The legal action continues. Cape Town police did not respond to questions about whether an investigation was launched.After the twins died, Collins met Bingala twice. She brought oils and offered to massage Chirwa’s stomach, an offer Bingala declined. In a visit on 22 February 2022, which he recorded, Bingala challenged her about the care she had provided his wife. Collins insisted that she had never presented herself as a midwife.There was a back-and-forth about why, on the night Chirwa went into labour, Collins had fallen asleep. Collins talked about the physiology of birthing mammals, the need to keep the space safe and quiet, and said she was “holding the space” for them.Death of Irish mother in ‘free birth’ reveals how poor maternity care is pushing women towards extreme influencersRead moreOn the second visit, on 28 February 2022, which he also recorded, Collins continued to tell Bingala that she had never presented herself as a midwife. “I’m here to show you I care,” she said. “I’m here, I’m not trying to run away.” “I trusted you,” Bingala said. “I trusted you the first day we met in [my friend’s] shop; when [my friend] stood me in front [of you] and said: ‘This one is a midwife.’” Collins reiterated: she was not a midwife, but a birth keeper. Eventually, after nearly an hour of conversation, Collins acknowledged that there might have been a “misunderstanding in what my role was”.After civil proceedings were issued in the high court of South Africa in March 2024, Collins left South Africa for an overseas trip (she has since returned).During her time abroad, Collins visited Saldaya at home. The two women are close, and holidayed together in June this year in Mexico. Collins is now a senior figure in FBS, leading online calls within the closed membership, and helping to organise this year’s Matriarch Rising festival, held on Saldaya’s land. At the festival, Collins DJed tribal music under the DJ name DJ Kundi. In footage, Collins, dressed in black shorts and a black top, also led women in an “embodied dance ritual”.Neither Saldaya nor her business partner, Norris-Clark, responded to a request for comment about the Chirwa case. Neither has provided a substantive response to the Guardian’s investigation into FBS, although in one email Saldaya said: “Some of these allegations are false or defamatory.” On 22 November, the day the Guardian published its investigation into FBS, Saldayaposted a statement on Instagramcriticising “propaganda on mainstream news”.FBS appears to view Collins’s involvement in Chirwa’s tragic loss through the same lens. Asked about the case in 2023 on a call with radical birth keeper students, Norris-Clark was dismissive of the criticism. “Any mainstream press organisation, all of which are owned by the medical-industrial complex, will find whatever way they can to frame an independent birth keeper,” she said.The Birth Keepers, a multipart Guardian podcast series investigating the Free Birth Society, is released this week.

Jaspert, who was in his late 30s, had recently been appointed governor by Queen Elizabeth II, on the recommendation of the Foreign Office in London. The BVI is an overseas territory of Britain, with only partial independence, and the governor effectively acts as a backstop to the locally elected legislature. For Jaspert, a career civil servant, it would be his first hands-on experience of governing – and his first time in the British Virgin Islands. Any trepidation was outweighed by the prospect of moving to the Caribbean. “If you’re sitting in an office in London and someone says, ‘Go to Tortola,’ you look it up on a screen and think, ‘OK, I can do that,’” Jaspert told me.While Jaspert, his wife and two sons were settling into their new life, a tropical storm gathered over the Atlantic. At first, forecasters weren’t unduly alarmed, but in the first days of September, the storm transformed into something much worse. In the afternoon of 6 September, Hurricane Irma made landfall in Tortola, which is home to the majority of the BVI’s 30,000-strong population. Irma was one of the strongest hurricanes ever recorded in the Atlantic basin. It scalped buildings, blew out windows and removed entire floors from homes. Shipping containers smashed into the islanders’ fishing boats and the out-of-towners’ yachts.Jaspert rushed his family into the bathroom of the governor’s residence, an imposing white-stucco mansion lined by porticos which, only finished in 2003, was newer and sturdier than many islanders’ homes. (The original Government House structure, dating back to the late 19th century, was destroyed in a 1924 hurricane.) If the roof fell in, Jaspert reasoned that he could at least upend the bath tub to create an air pocket until help arrived. Ordinary islanders, many of whom live in squat bungalows or ageing low-rise apartment blocks, had few such options.The next day, as the gales died down and flood water continued to rise, islanders emerged to a territory in ruins: four in every five buildings in Tortola was either damaged or destroyed. The damage ran into the billions of dollars, larger than the territory’s entire GDP. Though the death toll was mercifully low – officially, only four people – around half the population were left homeless.Islanders, a tight-knit community, began the work of rebuilding their homes, but the official reconstruction effort ultimately fell to two men: Jaspert, only a fortnight into his governorship, and Dr Daniel Orlando Smith, the elected premier of the territory, a surgeon turned politician who had led the islands since 2011. Jaspert and Smith had limited information, no working electricity and barely any internet connectivity. Life-and-death decisions about water distribution, food provision and emergency shelter for homeless people had to be taken on the fly in the basement of the territory’s only hospital.The problems that had festered on the BVI long before either Jaspert or Smith took up their posts – corruption, nepotism, meagre accountability – were thrown into sharp relief now that islanders depended upon government for their basic necessities. The constitution, which attempts to neatly parcel power between locally elected politicians and a British governor, strained at the seams. “If you’re a governor who pushes and tries to clean things up or to take action, you very quickly get a wall of stuff coming back at you,” Jaspert told me.One point of contention was the reconstruction loans. Britain demanded that any loans be overseen by an independent body to prevent money being siphoned off by corrupt officials. Some elected ministers saw such demands as an attempt to install a kind of “alternative government” that undermined their authority. “What [the British] have done to us is a disgrace,” one politician declared at a public meeting in 2018.View image in fullscreenAugustus Jaspert, former governor of the British Virgin Islands.Photograph: UK governmentIn the stalemate of mutual mistrust, money failed to reach those who needed it most. Poor islanders had borne the brunt of the storm, and were the last to be helped in the recovery that followed. Seven years after the hurricane, in the heart of Road Town, the BVI’s capital, across the road from the government administration building, a residential apartment block still stands in ruins today.On 25 February 2019, Virgin Islanders headed to the polls. Angry with the lacklustre recovery, they swept Orlando Smith’s party from power and granted a landslide victory to the pro-independence Virgin Islands party, led by Andrew Fahie, a formidable politician who promised radical change. “We will take our Virgin Islands to heights never seen before economically, socially and morally,” Fahie promised in his first address to the House of Assembly.Jaspert didn’t see much cause for concern. He and Fahie had met regularly while Fahie led the opposition. Fahie’s anti-imperialist politics might make for friction, but after the devastation of Hurricane Irma, Jaspert was confident that whatever was in store couldn’t be worse than the almost two years the Islands had just survived. It was the second time Jaspert would be wandering into disaster. This one was entirely human-made.Andrew Fahie was a big fish in an exceedingly small pond. He was heavy-set, with a buzz cut and a closely-shaven goatee. At public events, he was charming and charismatic, a back-slapping man-of-the-people who spoke passionately about his Christian faith and unshakeable belief in the people of the Islands. He sought to spread a message of optimism about a future in which the Virgin Islands, after about 350 years of British rule, might one day complete their “journey” to self-determination.In a place as small and interconnected as the BVI, charm is essential. “Everyone knew Andrew,” one elderly islander told me in Road Town, though that wasn’t saying much. “Everyone knows everyone,” she added quickly. When I visited in early May, the Islands’ peak tourist months were over, and the humid air signalled the approach of hurricane season. Road Town, a warren of tired hotels, colourful tourist shops and offshore law firms, often felt eerily empty. On the marina, around which the town curves, hundreds of millions of dollars of yachts bobbed idly in the clear waters. Stripped of tourists, the capital felt more like a village: a place in which everyone can spot an outsider, and as I learned, nobody feels free to talk.The territory that Fahie came to lead in 2019 was very different from the territory he was born into in 1970. The son of a shopkeeper, Fahie wasn’t a member of the local elite, nor did he benefit much from the changes that swept through the islands during the 1980s, when local entrepreneurs and lawyers were developing the two industries on which the BVI now depends: tourism and, above all, financial services. Thanks to a coterie of local, British and US lawyers, the BVI became a global leader in selling anonymous shell companies to people looking to park assets in a tax-free location. (At present, there are more than 355,000 corporations registered in the BVI – more than 11 times the number of human residents.) A few locals grew wealthy, while billionaires from abroad, including Richard Branson, bought private islands. Ordinary families such as Fahie’s were largely left behind.As a young man, Fahie dedicated himself to public service: after obtaining a degree in education in Florida, he became a maths teacher, then an assistant principal of Tortola’s largest secondary school. In a small territory where, at most, 15,000 residents are “belongers” – the territory’s equivalent of citizens with the right to vote – familiarity is a potent form of political capital. His easy charm and deep roots in his community earned him a landslide victory when he decided to run for office in 1999. At the age of 28, Fahie was elected to the Legislative Council, the forerunner to today’s House of Assembly, the 15-member parliament of the islands, and took on the role of minister of education.View image in fullscreenFormer British Virgin Islands premier Andrew Fahie.Photograph: ReutersTwo stints in government allowed Fahie to establish his political brand, as a devout Christian from humble origins, here to represent the people. But it was on the opposition benches during the 2010s that he came into his own, fashioning himself as an anti-corruption crusader. Despite his anti-imperialist politics, Fahie demanded that the British launch corruption inquiries into his political rivals.In November 2016, Fahie became leader of the opposition. While he was sceptical about Britain’s role in the territory, British officials told me they had found Fahie affable, largely collegial, someone they felt they could work with. “The big flip was the election,” Jaspert told me.Emboldened by his victory in 2019, Fahie was determined that no one would stand in his way, least of all a British governor 10 years his junior. “This will not be business as usual, but rather business unusual, business unconventional,” Fahie told the house at the start of his tenure. Jaspert had no idea quite how unusual Fahie’s premiership would turn out to be.Fahie’s election parades had barely concluded when he issued a surprising request to Governor Jaspert and Mick Matthews, another Brit, who had served as commissioner of police since 2016. Fahie wanted a private security detail, provided by a firm of his choosing, and he wanted them to be armed.“Having private security officers running around with guns in this territory was my worst nightmare,” Matthews told me. A wiry man in his 60s with silver hair and a deep tan, Matthews had rarely felt in need of a firearm in four decades of policing, either in the UK or BVI. The islands – located between the world’s largest cocaine producer, Colombia, and one of the world’s largest cocaine consumers, the US – is a crossroads for drugs flowing north and American-made guns heading south, but its violent crime rate was, compared with its neighbours, relatively low. Matthews denied the request, but couldn’t shake the question of what it was – or who – that scared Fahie so much that he wanted armed guards.Behind closed doors, tensions between Fahie and Jaspert started to grow. Under the constitution, the locally elected government runs most domestic affairs – education, welfare, spending, public works – while the governor has control of national security, foreign affairs, the courts and public servants. But under Fahie’s administration, laws began to be produced at a moment’s notice. Minutes of meetings, never well kept, stopped being recorded altogether. “The basic functions of how a state works were being undermined,” Jaspert told me.Fahie had little time for the objections of the British. He believed he had a mandate to shake up the islands’ institutions, even if it meant pushing at the limits of the law. He started with the administrative bodies, usually run by locals, which help to administer the ports and airports. He fired the boards en masse. Among his new appointments was a man who had once served a prison sentence for misconduct in public office. When challenged on this by an official, Fahie brushed aside objections.A few months into Fahie’s tenure, as suspicions about Fahie’s disregard for checks and balances were mounting, Mick Matthews had a startling conversation with a local police officer. This wasn’t the first time there had been questions about Fahie’s integrity, the officer said. Fifteen years earlier, at the end of Fahie’s first stint in government, the BVI’s police force had opened a criminal investigation into him.Rumours that Fahie had previously been under investigation for money laundering had long swirled in the territory. In the run-up to his election in 2019, reporters had asked him about it. Fahie had denied the allegations, describing them as part of a witch-hunt. After his election, in late 2019, a public servant went searching for the police investigation files in Tortola. “We knew there had been a case,” the official told me, but, they discovered, “the file had disappeared”. It was not clear whether the file had been lost or deliberately removed. Whatever the explanation, Jaspert and Matthews were left with nothing more than rumours.In March 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic further strained Jaspert and Fahie’s fraying relationship. Fahie announced a lockdown, and Jaspert relayed an offer of assistance from a Royal Navy ship to secure the borders. (Matthews had intelligence that boats were still entering the territory, carrying people, weapons and drugs.) Fahie was incensed. The intervention of the British navy was, in his view, naked colonialism: what better way to undermine the authority of elected officials than shunting a warship into BVI waters?Instead, Fahie forced through his preferred solution: three floating barges, owned by a local man, equipped with radar to detect incoming boats. Given that most of the police’s fast boats were out of commission, in part because Fahie had blocked pleas to fund the repairs, Matthews didn’t see the point. But Fahie pressed on, spending $2m on deploying three barges, none of it signed off by cabinet in advance. Matthews began to wonder whether Fahie wanted to stop people and drugs coming into the territory, or simply know when it was happening.At the same time, worrying reports were coming in from ordinary islanders. Fahie was leasing some of his family’s land to Nyron Erickson, a drug dealer wanted for a slew of narcotics and weapons charges. Locals also claimed that Fahie’s election campaign had received generous donations from Bob Hodge, a cocaine kingpin who had dodged three attempts to extradite him to the US. (It is impossible to verify this claim because there is no obligation to declare political donations in the BVI. Hodge was killed in 2021.)View image in fullscreenWeapons and over two tonnes of cocaine seized in the British Virgin Islands in November 2020.Photograph: Mick Matthews/XIn September 2020, with concerns rising about organised crime infiltrating the territory, Jaspert lost patience. Without Fahie’s agreement, he declared that the navy ship would be returning to the BVI. Fahie was apoplectic. He wrote furious letters to Baroness Sugg, then minister for overseas territories in the Foreign Office, accusing Jaspert of “political sabotage”, “malicious actions … designed to … reinforce Britain’s colonial status quo in the BVI” and threatened to report Jaspert’s “act of aggression” to the UN.Fahie’s fury escalated to open threats. Matthews was witness to some of the blow ups. On more than one occasion, Fahie told Jaspert he was having him followed. He said it would be “safer” if Jaspert went home to London. At one meeting, he allegedly told Jaspert, “I will destroy you.” Matthews tried to keep out of political discord – it wasn’t his job to adjudicate between a premier and governor at war – but neutrality had become impossible. Shortly before Fahie’s letters to Baroness Sugg, “Fahie called me to his office and asked me to arrest Gus,” he told me. Matthews asked on what grounds he was expected to arrest the sitting governor. Fahie said Jaspert was bullying him.To Matthews and Jaspert, Fahie no longer seemed like a single-minded leader willing to break norms to get his way; he seemed like someone deliberately undermining the rule of law. Neither Matthews nor Jaspert would disclose any information about conversations they may have had with British authorities. But by the end of autumn 2020, the UK’s National Crime Agency had approached the US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), and learned the DEA had its own interest in the BVI. Neither Jaspert nor Matthews were apprised of the two agencies’ backchannel discussions. Both men thought they were effectively on their own, and were concerned about their safety. Fearing their offices had been bugged, they began to meet in remote locations.On the evening of 6 November 2020, a team of Virgin Islands police raided the property of a serving BVI police officer and uncovered 2.4 tonnes of cocaine with an estimated street value of $250m. “It was the biggest seizure of cocaine in [BVI] history, with corrupt police officers’ hands all over it,” said Matthews. In emergency meetings, Matthews informed the premier and the governor of the news. “Gus nearly fell off his bloody chair when I told him how much there was,” Matthews recalled, “But I can never forget telling Andrew Fahie that this is the biggest seizure in history, and he didn’t blink.”For Jaspert, it confirmed his decision, long brewing, to call for a commission of inquiry – an independent, judge-led inquiry into an overseas territory when the governor fears corruption or serious dishonesty in public office. “I am a very resilient person,” Jaspert told me, “but [by that point] I was very close to broken.” By 18 January, when Jaspert came to announce the inquiry, Fahie had blocked Jaspert’s use of the government’s communications department. Jaspert had to procure a selfie stick and record his announcement to post on Facebook. It was his last act as governor before leaving the Islands for good. “I had to film it myself,” Jaspert recalled. “That’s why it looks a little bit like a hostage video.”The announcement of the commission of inquiry sent tremors through the Virgin Islands. The last one Britain had called, in the Turks and Caicos Islands in 2008, had resulted in the territory being forced into direct rule from London for two years. Many islanders were torn: local politicians “were taking advantage”, one elderly islander told me. (Everyone who agreed to speak to me said the same.) Yet the threat of a takeover by the islands’ historical coloniser sat extremely uneasily with a population that is 79% African-Caribbean and yet has never had a Black governor. On the blogs and message boards where much of the Islands’ political infighting takes place, one commenter put it this way: “The colonialists will remain colonialists and slave masters like a leopard that will never change his spots.”Publicly, Fahie welcomed the commission as a chance to “clear the air”. In private, Fahie’s government geared up for a fight. Fahie’s government hired Withers, a global law firm, to represent “the government of the Virgin Islands”. The legal team was headed by Geoffrey Cox KC, who had been attorney general of the UK from July 2018 until February 2020, and was still Conservative MP for Torridge and West Devon.Cox’s involvement shocked some observers of the inquiry. Some noted that, as a former attorney general, there was a risk that he could end up using information accessed in public office in pursuit of private practice. To others, the spectacle of a serving British MP earning huge fees defending a client from another arm of government, the Foreign Office, seemed absurd. “I cannot see how this was not a conflict of interest,” said one participant. The fact that Cox had flown to BVI during a strict Covid lockdown in the UK did not help matters. For some islanders, the most egregious element was the fees charged by Withers: $6.5m from Virgin Island government funds. (Withers declined to comment for this article, and Cox did not respond to numerous approaches.)On 4 May 2021, the commission held the first of 55 hearings that took place over the following six months. Participants submitted statements, provided documentary evidence – albeit often late, and in “shambolic” form, according to the final report – and sat through cross-examination by the commission’s counsel, Bilal Rawat, a British barrister.Corruption, the inquiry heard, was nothing new in the BVI. The inquiry heard evidence of Fahie’s predecessors handing lucrative contracts to family members without adequate checks, spending $7m on a national airline that never launched, and obstructing auditors. In one case, a simple project – the extension of a school wall – was split into 79 contracts, delivered vastly over-budget, and left uncompleted. Sonia Webster, the BVI’s auditor general, whose reports exposed malfeasance long before the British called the inquiry, patiently explained the various ways she had been ignored and obstructed by local lawmakers. Her conscientiousness was not appreciated: she was pilloried by the attorney general for making “deplorable” comments. Victoreen Romney-Varlack, whose former job it was to maintain a register of politicians’ business interests, was being threatened with criminal investigation for telling Governor Jaspert that most of the legislature had failed to declare their interests. (Webster declined to speak for this article. Romney-Varlack did not respond to requests for comment.)View image in fullscreenA view of Marina Cay in the British Virgin Islands.Photograph: Anegada/Getty Images/iStockphotoFahie was at ease hearing his predecessors’ failures. But over the seven days in which he was questioned, he faltered. He struggled to explain why projects he oversaw had ballooned in cost and delivered no discernible results. Grants to religious institutions, an important part of his support base, were 662% over the recommended budget. Consultants charged extortionate fees for projects that never materialised. And Fahie’s cabinet, with Fahie present, had attempted to expedite the citizenship application of a convicted rapist who was then serving time in jail overseas – despite a residency requirement for applicants.Fahie tried, throughout, to maintain an air of calm, but on 12 October 2021, his sixth day of evidence, he became increasingly erratic. Visibly exhausted, he answered yes-or-no questions with rambling monologues on how unfairly he had been treated by the commission, former foreign secretary Dominic Raab, the media, the UK government and seemingly anyone else who came to mind. He suggested, more than once, that he was in danger. (He never specified from whom.)The day’s hearing was intended to discuss the Covid-19 stimulus package. But Fahie veered more and more dramatically off-script. Finally, the hearing reached its strange climax.Citing a report which suggested opaque and wasteful spending on Covid assistance grants, the commissioner asked a simple question: “Don’t you have some sympathy generally with the auditor general’s report?”Fahie’s response was instant: “Commissioner, who has sympathy for when this whole inquiry was launched on me? When my wife and my picture [appeared] in front of marijuana drugs and have the world thinking that the BVI has a premier that’s a drug lord and a drug cartel? Who has sympathy for me?”Fahie’s lawyer Niki Olympitis’s eyes darted across the room. A bemused commissioner raised a hand to speak. At no point had the commission suggested that Fahie was in any way involved in the drugs trade.“How was that the responsibility of the auditor general?” asked the commission’s barrister.“No, no,” Fahie began, before trying to change the subject. Fahie’s subsequent rambling about an alleged conspiracy between the auditor general and Dominic Raab did little to mask the strangeness of his eruption. In retrospect, the outburst came to seem more like a confession.On 16 October 2021, four days after Fahie’s outburst and a month before the commission of inquiry held its final hearing, a man by the name of Roberto Quintero appeared in Tortola. He set up a meeting with a group of men connected to the territory’s criminal underworld and explained to them that he needed to secure safe passage for shipments of cocaine through the Virgin Islands. The trio agreed to make introductions to Oleanvine Maynard, who ran the BVI ports authority.Five months later, in March 2022, Quintero met Maynard in a waterfront restaurant in St Thomas, the second-largest of the US Virgin Islands, an hour’s boat ride from Tortola. Quintero said he worked for the Sinaloa cartel, one of Mexico’s most violent gangs, and used coded language to avoid detection – he referred to cocaine as “number three” – but Maynard understood what he needed: a paper trail to ward off prying eyes. “You want it to be done legally, so nobody will snoop around,” she said. “That is where I can assist.”Maynard said that she needed buy-in from her superiors, including Fahie. “You see with my premier, he’s a little crook sometimes,” she confided, disregarding Quintero’s careful euphemisms. She said her son would reach out to Fahie and broker a meeting. In return, Quintero handed her a bag containing $10,000. “Give me your hand,” he said, “Welcome to the Sinaloa cartel.” Two days later, Maynard’s son spoke to Fahie and WhatsApped Quintero the good news: “Head coach wants to play with the team this season.”On 7 April 2022, as the commission of inquiry report was being prepared, Fahie and Quintero had their first face-to-face meeting in a luxurious house in the East End of Tortola. Quintero laid out the scheme in detail. Twice a month, cocaine refined in Colombian labs would be shipped to Tortola, concealed in 5kg buckets of waterproofing paint. Each shipment would contain three tonnes of cocaine. The cargo would then move to Puerto Rico, before being sold in Miami and New York for up to $38,000 per kilo. If all went well, Fahie’s cut would be about $8m. Quintero suggested that they could even arrange the seizure of a couple of low-quality shipments so Fahie could present himself as tough on drugs. All Quintero needed was 48 hours after arrival without any unwanted checks of the cargo.“You’re not touching anything,” Quintero said.“I’ll touch one thing,” Fahie replied. “The money.”View image in fullscreenSoper’s Hole in Tortola, BVI.Photograph: Hemis/AlamyAlmost three weeks later, Fahie and Quintero met in Miami to iron out the finer points of the operation. The two men talked loosely. Fahie boasted about his connection to a seasoned trafficker of drugs and weapons in the BVI who was “like a brother” to him. He confirmed he would be able to bribe a government official who could threaten their scheme. And he lamented past deals where partners had betrayed him; he reckoned he had missed out on about $7.5m over the previous two decades.When Quintero cautioned Fahie not to discuss anything over the phone, Fahie reassured him. He explained that when he’d handled illicit cash in the past, shrink-wrapped in plastic, he hadn’t just binned the wrappers, he had burned them, in case they could be traced. Quintero was impressed: “So this is not your first rodeo, right, I can tell,” he said. Fahie laughed: “No no no, not my first rodeo at all.”The following morning, on 28 April 2022, Quintero drove Fahie and one of his daughters to Miami’s Opa Locka airport. Fahie had a flight to catch, and it was a chance for Quintero to show Fahie the money. Upon arrival, Quintero led Fahie into a small plane containing the cash: $700,000, stacked in designer shopping bags. Half a million dollars of it was earmarked for Fahie, a bribe for his participation. Fahie inspected the money and, suitably convinced, left the plane. The deal was done.What Fahie did not know was that Quintero was not a Sinaloa trafficker. He was a confidential informant feeding every text message, every phone call and every conversation straight back to the DEA. As the premier exited the plane, agents placed him under arrest. Fahie’s protestations – “Why am I getting arrested? I don’t have any money or drugs” – fell on deaf ears. (Oleanvine Maynard and her son were arrested later that morning.)When the news of Fahie’s arrest broke, islanders “were really disappointed, really let down,” said one long-serving local police officer. “What stupidness that is.” Others simply didn’t believe it. One elderly islander told me she didn’t understand how Fahie could face jail time for a “prank”, which is how she referred to the DEA sting. Gus Jaspert, for his part, felt a kind of relief: “I felt vindicated that I was right to bring things to a head … that I was not mad.”As it happens, had Jaspert seen the police documents that went missing in Tortola – and which I managed to obtain during the course of my reporting – he may have had fewer doubts. They show that in 2002 and 2003, Fahie had been accused by BVI prosecutors of leading a money-laundering ring that moved tens of thousands of dollars into the US illegally. The documents allege that Fahie had been interrogated by police, and conspired to “lie to investigators about [his] financial dealings”. Ultimately, no charges were brought. Three sources linked to the original investigation told me that this was due to a lack of political will, gaps in the evidence and fear on the part of the participants to testify in open court. (In a close-knit territory, snitching is a particularly potent form of betrayal and comes with obvious risks.)Where local prosecutors failed, the DEA succeeded. Last year, in a Florida court, a jury unanimously found Andrew Fahie guilty of cocaine trafficking and money-laundering conspiracies. He was sentenced to 11 years in federal prison. (In response to a detailed list of questions, Fahie’s lawyer said our piece contained “erroneous observations” but declined to comment, citing his ongoing appeal.)Before Fahie’s arrest, the British government had been planning for an orderly rollout of the commission of inquiry, with invitations for BVI ministers to come to London to discuss its findings. The day after the arrest, those plans were scrapped and the damning 937-page report was published in full. “Almost everywhere, the principles of good governance, such as openness, transparency and even the rule of law, are ignored,” the commission stated. “There is a void where governance procedures, checks and balances should be.” It concluded that “the people of the BVI have been badly served in recent years. Very badly indeed.” The commission proposed that the islands’ constitution be suspended and the territory taken into direct rule from London.The reaction on the BVI was furious. Pro-independence islanders gathered at the governor’s residence to protest against what they saw as a colonial power grab. Ordinary Virgin Islanders did not need to be told by a British inquiry that their elected officials were taking advantage of them. They had lived it. Yet almost no islanders thought the best solution to their problems was direct rule by Whitehall civil servants.In truth, the UK government also had little interest in the expense and manpower that direct rule entailed. (Exact figures on the cost of taking the Turks and Caicos into direct rule are not publicly available, but Westminster extended a £160m loan guarantee in 2011.) A solution was found that half-suited everyone: a new coalition government was formed, headed by Fahie’s deputy, Natalio Wheatley. Islanders remained in control, and with a change in leader, Britain had an alibi for staying out.Blow up: how half a tonne of cocaine transformed the life of an islandRead moreThe Foreign Office told me that it defends its decision to call a commission of inquiry and cited its long history of support for the islands. The BVI government said it has “delivered the most robust governance reform in the history of the Virgin Islands” and welcomed the UK’s decision to drop its threat to take over. “We are progressing strongly, building a stronger, more resilient Virgin Islands that can chart a course of transformation and deliver progress for the territory and its people,” said a spokesperson.“There is still a fundamental belief here that there’s a British conspiracy to take over, boot the government out and run the country,” Mick Matthews told me, driving down the coast of Tortola as storm clouds gathered on a rainy May afternoon. “Andrew Fahie was using that as leverage, playing on people’s fears.” But for Matthews – who is one of the very few British officials to have stayed in the Islands after his employment concluded – the opposite is true. “If anything, there’s a conspiracy to have done bugger all.”On Tortola in early May, a year on from Fahie’s conviction, Virgin Islanders fell silent when I mentioned his name. Few were eager to return to the subject of his arrest or the commission of inquiry. (The government of the Virgin Islands, the governor and numerous public officials refused or ignored repeated requests for an interview.) “People here don’t always want to hear the truth,” said one elderly islander. The community is close and they have deep pride in the territory they have built from the ashes of slavery, she explained. It also makes open criticism seem like a kind of betrayal. (None of the islanders I spoke to were willing to be named.)Some in the Islands had seen tentative signs of improvement. A dizzying array of new laws and regulations are making their way through the legislature. Criminal investigations into the misuse of public funds recommended by the commission are now under way. And Britain has formally dropped its threat to take over. But the roots of the BVI’s problems persist: a tiny political scene struggling to shed allegations of nepotism, a creaking justice system, chronic underfunding of the police.The relationship between Road Town and London remains defined by mutual mistrust. Nobody I spoke to had any affection for the British, but nor did they think independence was viable until their own politicians could be trusted. Caught between a domestic elite concerned with their own enrichment, and a colonial power demanding economic and political reforms without promises to fund them, the Islands remain in postcolonial purgatory.The territory, historically insulated from some of the violence plaguing neighbouring Caribbean islands, no longer feels safe to many of the people who live there. One evening during my time in BVI, a source texted me with the news that Nyron Erickson, the 32-year-old drug trafficker to whom Andrew Fahie’s family had rented land, had been murdered in the West End of Tortola. An audio recording of the incident captured the staccato fire of a handgun, followed by the thrum of a submachine gun. “They emptied a whole clip,” said one resident. “It was an execution.”In Road Town, five miles east of the police cordons around Erickson’s body, the House of Assembly was closed for the weekend. Inside the house is a wooden board with portraits of the territory’s former leaders set in two neat rows. There are only six faces. Fahie’s portrait, with a glib half-smile, remains in place. Already, Fahie’s rehabilitation appears under way. In a recent spat with the current premier, a member of the opposition railed against the current administration’s botched infrastructure projects. “If Andrew Fahie were premier, he would fix roads, water and everything else that we need. I’ll stand on that,” the opposition member said. The current minister for works, Kye Rymer, responded: “The strange thing is, at one point, they wanted to take down [Fahie’s] picture, saying he shouldn’t be on this wall. But this man contributed to this territory and I’m happy to hear the endorsement.”Back in the West End, a short way from where Erickson was killed, a house midway up Zion Hill stands in ruins. Only the first two floors are built. Steel rods poke up through the breeze blocks. It looks like the beginning of something grand – a palatial home overlooking the narrow channel separating the British Virgin Islands from their American counterparts. It belongs to Andrew Fahie. Works ground to halt upon his arrest. They are unlikely to be completed any time soon.This article is a collaboration withthe Bureau of Investigative Journalism, and support was provided by a reporting grant fromthe Pulitzer CenterView image in fullscreenThe best stories take time.From politics to philosophy, personal stories to true crime, discover a selection of the Guardian’s finest longform journalism, in one beautiful edition.

Asylum for people genuinely fleeing persecution will always remain the mark of decent, compassionate countries. But controlling who comes here is an essential task of government and is what the public rightly demands.That’s why we are both taking practical action to fix the asylum system.Denmarkhas led the way here, with tough but fair reforms which have delivered results.Last year, the number of people being granted asylum in Denmark was thelowest in 40 years, excluding the Covid year of 2020.The UK has taken similar steps. After years of gimmicks and failed policies, we are going further than ever before with action at home – surging removals of those with no right to be here and making settlement reliant on integration and contribution, while pushing for coordinated international action too.The current asylum framework was created for another era. In a world with mass mobility, yesterday’s answers do not work. We will always protect those fleeing war and terror – but the world has changed andasylum systemsmust change with it.Today, millions are on the move not only because their lives are in danger, but because they want a better future. If we fail to take account of this, we would fail the needs of genuine refugees and the communities that for too long have been asked to absorb rapid change.For decades, citizens in our countries have demanded action. So we are acting – not to exploit these issues and stoke grievances as some do, but to find real solutions.The best way of fighting against the forces of hate and division is to show that mainstream, progressive politics can fix this problem.Listening to legitimate concerns and acting on them is what our politics is about. That’s not empty populism, it’s democracy. We are determined to show that our societies can act with compassion while upholding law and order, and fairness.We are making this case across Europe, and momentum for change is building. More countries are now pursuing similar approaches – ensuring that protection is available for those refugees who need it, while making it connected to clear expectations of integration and contribution.That’s what people want their governments to do – maintain control over who comes and who stays, and do it on our terms. We get it. And if you commit serious crimes, you lose the right to stay. That principle is not extreme – it is common sense.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Better news: the chancellor may have something to do with it. Better still: some economists think there’s more to come.Let’s not get carried away, though. The UK is still paying a painful premium on its borrowing costs, as the Institute for Public Policy Research thinktank illustrates. Since last year’s general election the yield on 10-year government gilts is up almost 70 basis points – or seven-tenths of 1% – compared with US Treasury bonds, and the increase versus the eurozone is almost 25 basis points. The gaps are wider for 30-year bonds and the consequences are real. IPPR calculates that if the premium could be reduced to zero, the Treasury would save as much as £7bn a year until 2029-30.A key point here is that the premium can’t be wholly explained by factors that are widely acknowledged and beyond the government’s control: the reduced appetite for gilts among mature UK defined-benefit pension funds, for example, andthe Bank of England’s steady sellingof the gilts it bought in the years after the great financial crisis.The reality behind the yield premium is that the UK isn’t getting much credit for having debt and deficit ratios that, while definitely not pretty, are less horrible than those of many other G7 countries. The explanation will relate to some combination of the market’s doubts over long-term inflation and the government’s willingness to stick to its fiscal plans.So the improvement in sentiment – if that is what is – in the last few months is significant if it continues. IPPR suggests there was a turning point atthe Labour conference in September, when Reeves said “there is nothing progressive, nothing Labour” in spending almost £1 in every £10 of public money on debt interest. She also made it clear that after U-turns on welfare spending she was in the business of rebuilding headroom against her fiscal rules.Bond yield graphic“The government’s strong recommitment to its fiscal plans does appear to be reducing costs more recently,” the IPPR report says, noting the fall of 20 basis points since the conference.It’s more of a struggle to detect a serious move sincelast month’s budget. IPPR sees “early/tentative signs” of further progress but 10-year gilt yields still stand almost exactly where they were on the day at 4.5%.On one hand, the market clearly likes the comfort blanket of £22bn of fiscal headroom and the (slightly) greater credibility on the ambition to halve the annual deficit over the life of the parliament. On the other, the back-loaded nature of Reeves’ tax rises creates worry about whether they will happen. Meanwhile, the Office for Budget Responsibility downgraded the outlook for growth, and the communications chaos in the run-up to the budget hardly boosted confidence.But there is a sketch of a possible positive narrative here for Reeves. Financial markets expect the Bank of England to cut interest rates three times by the end of next year as inflation in food prices and energy cools. One can already see banks scrapping a bit harder on mortgage rates. A further boost would come if gilts markets were less punishing of the UK and if the political risk premium were to reduce further. It would help, as IPPR suggests, if the Bank, as the biggest owner of gilts, was a less enthusiastic seller.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A slow burn of a steepening yield curve and weaker sterling could morph into a more serious confidence crisis.” It points to “no sign of a sustainable growth driver”, which is alsothe view in much of the business world.Timing matters if, as the Westminster watchers say, next May’s local elections are the next critical political moment. If the UK’s yield premium continues to fall towards the level the government inherited, Reeves has the gist of an “it’s working, be patient” narrative. But it does need to happen.Explore more on these topicsGovernment borrowingNils Pratley on financeBondsGiltsEconomicsRachel ReevescommentShareReuse this content"

If you ignore thegenocides in SudanandGaza,fighting in eastern Congo, continuedattacks on Ukraine, militaryairstrikes in Myanmar, near-dailystrikes on Lebanon,“extrajudicial killings”onVenezualan vessels, increasedpolitical violencein the US, along with variousother inconvenient issues, then I think we can all agree that Donald Trump has ushered in world peace.Trump awarded inaugural Fifa peace prize at World Cup draw in WashingtonRead moreGood luck convincing the nasty Norwegians on the Nobel committee of that, though. They’ve doledout peace prizesto many an alleged war criminal but have a weird grudge against Trump. Still, at least Fifa, an organisation renowned for itsimpeccable ethics, appreciates the president’s efforts. Last Friday,Trump was awardedthe inaugural Fifa peace prize in an over-the-top ceremony that would have made a lesser man, one burdened with a smidgen of self-awareness, feel like a prize idiot.Ridiculous as theFifapeace prize may be, the strategy was sound; if you want something from Trump, you need to flatter his ego. I wouldn’t be surprised if Fifa kickstarts a trend for organisations and corporations bestowing outlandish awards upon the president in an effort to get on his good side. To get the ball rolling I have a few suggestions.1. The Volkswagen Golf awardTrumpmay have German heritage– and hassparked numerous comparisonswith one particular German head of state – but he doesn’t have much love for the fatherland. He’s certainly not a fan of its auto industry: in a 2024 interview the former German chancellor Angela Merkel claimed Trump was “obsessed by the fact that, in his view,there were too many German cars in New York”. He has since done his best to boot them out;in July, Volkswagen saidTrump’s US import tariffs cost it more than £1bn in the first half of 2025. If Fifa can give out peace prizes, then the car industry can bestow sports awards. We all know Trump likes to brag about his golfing prowess – he is alwaysgoing on about his handicap. If Volkswagen came up with some sort of Trump Cup for golfing, it could be a good vehicle for tariff negotiations.2. The Big Cheesetrophy formaking AmericagrateagainIt’s not just Germany in Trump’s bad books; the president is not thrilled with France. Last monththe president told Fox News: “We’ve had a lot of problems with the French …” Time,peut-être, for France’s famous dairy industry to butter him up with an accolade that makes him feel like a grand fromage. The McDonald’s enthusiast is no gourmand, but has an insatiable appetite for adulation.3. The Humpty Dumptyprize foreggcellence in the AmericanlanguageThe Trump administration is now trying various tactics,from bullyingtobribery, to get US universities to Maga-fy themselves. Instead ofsigning dystopian “compacts”for education, I suggest colleges work together to get the president on-side by making him feel special. We all knowhe has a very high IQ, but his verbal dexterity ought to be acknowledged by the educational elite. This is a man whocoined the phrase “truthful hyperbole”andbrewed up words such as covfefe; a man with an“unpresidented”(sic) vocabulary. Whilesome sayhe rivals James Joyce in terms of output,I think the best literary reference might be Humpty Dumpty. Namely, thisquote from Lewis Carroll’s Through the Looking-Glass: “‘When I use a word,’ Humpty Dumpty said in rather a scornful tone, ‘it means just what I choose it to mean – neither more nor less.’”4. The Energizer Bunny trophy for battery conservationAt79, Trump is the oldest person ever inaugurated US president. And if you ignore the fact that he keeps beingcaught on camera dozing off, he is bursting with vim and vigour. Particularly when he’s sharing his thoughts on Truth Social. He keeps going, and going, and going … How does he keep this up? Well, Trump has said he believes the humanbody is like a batteryandhas a finite amount of energy: you can’t exercise too much or you waste it. He might not win any awards for environmental conservation, but Big Battery should find a way to empower him.5.The American Gas Associationaward forlighting thewayWhile Trump deserves a plethora of prizes, no earthly award really does him justice. He is marching the world into a new golden age; we know this because he keeps saying so. His word is like a lamp to our feet and a light to our path. Some may even say (there aremanysuchexamples!), a gaslight.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

This is not a new trend – but it is now being supercharged by generative AI tools that make it easier, quicker and cheaper than ever to perpetrate online violence against women in public life – from journalists to human rights defenders, politicians and activists.The objectives are clear: to help justify the rollback of gender equality and women’s reproductive rights; to chill women’s freedom of expression and their participation in democratic deliberation; to discredit truth-tellers; and to pave the way for the consolidation of authoritarian power.These are not the rantings of a “crazy cat lady” or a “fat, ugly whore”, although I’ve been called both. This analysis is rooted in hard – and frankly terrifying – data from new research I led, which hasjust been publishedby UN Women.For the report – Tipping Point: The chilling escalation of online violence against women in the public sphere – my team and I surveyed hundreds of women in journalism, human rights and activism across 119 countries, documenting their experiences with online violence and the real-world harms it triggers.What we found is a sharp, and potentially deadly, escalation in the incidence of online violence escalating to “real-world” harm. This is most acute for female journalists, where we see a dramatic acceleration in this trajectory.When we surveyed this groupin 2020, one-fifth of them reported offline attacks, abuse and harassment connected to the online violence they had experienced. But when we repeated the survey five years later, that alarming statistic had more than doubled – to 42%. These women have beenswatted, assaulted – and even abused in the company of their children.These threats are heightened by the mainstreaming of generative-AI tools that allow for the near-instant misrepresentation and discrediting of female journalists through the deployment of deepfakes and worse. We found that over 19% of female journalists had experienced what they believed to be AI-assisted online violence.The online-offline violence trajectory represents a vicious and self-perpetuating circle. Online harassment and threats beget offline attacks, and offline abuse, such as political actors targeting female journalists during public appearances, can trigger an escalation of online violence that, in turn, can exacerbate offline risks.This cycle of violence is even more dangerous when the abuse comes from powerfulpolitical figures. These abuses of power are part of a continuum of violence experienced by women in public life all over the world. I have studied dozens of emblematic cases of online violence against female journalists – from Mexico to India and South Africa, and from the UK and the US to the Philippines. My new boss – theNobel laureate Maria Ressa– has beenthreatened with being raped “to death”. But none was more chilling than that of the assassinated Maltese investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia,whose murderwaslinked to years of misogynistic online violencedirected at her prior to her death.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The humiliation is complete: even Labour Together – the outfit that quietly plotted Starmer’s leadership bid – is now sharpening its knives. It ispolling memberson who should replace him, indulging the comforting fantasy that swapping captains will somehow stop the ship from sinking.The Tory experience of regicide should offer a caution: do not depose a king unless you have already settled on a prince who understandswhythe kingdom is in crisis.

Because they convinced themselves that Johnson had failed for being insufficiently rightwing.In Starmer’s case, the Blairites – including Blair himself – whisper that asupposed leftward lurchis to blame. Starmer, they insist, was never a true believer in the Labour right. Combine that with his lack of vision and shortage of charisma, and the autopsy is complete. Their answer is the health secretary,Wes Streeting: a Blairite ultra who seems to have coveted the premiership since roughly the moment he learned to walk.Streeting has tried in recent months toburnish progressive credentialsonGazaandanti-racism, but don’t be fooled. A couple of years ago, he openly sketched out hisleadership bid strategy: “I’d tack left. You win the Labour leadership from the left, as I reminded Tony Blair from time to time.” His true instincts were laid bare in 2021, when he was reported to havetold the shadow cabinet: “Every day, we should drag a sacred cow of our party to the town market place and slaughter it until we are up to our knees in blood.” New Labour zealotry married to (alleged) charisma: the perfect antidote, they say, to the doomed Starmer project.His charm is loston the British public. Despite being Labour’s favoured media performer for years, his net approval rating sits at -21. As shadow health secretary during the NHS’s collapse under the Tories, he had the easiest gig in British politics – stand up for a beloved, ailing national institution – and stillhis ratings were negative. Admirers tout his backstory, from childhood poverty to Cabinet Office, but being the son of a toolmaker does not appear to have saved Starmer.The latter is now dismissed as wooden. It wasn’t always thus.Commentators once cooedthat “he looks the part”.Labour MPswho today might shudder at his name once boasted, upon his election, “for the first time in 10 years we’ve got a leader who looks like a prime minister”.After posing as a leftwing candidate to win the leadership of the Labour party in 2020, Starmer made a pact with the Labour right, effectively saying, I will do whatever you ask. Those same ideologues bragged that Starmer was merely their frontman – that he “thinks he’s driving the train” when they’d placed him at the front of a driverless DLR, as an anonymous member of his inner circle is reported to have said. He duly packed his operation with Blairite torchbearers. The current government is littered with New Labour retreads, such as Blair’s chief of staff Jonathan Powell, and former advisers Tim Allan and Liz Lloyd.NoLabourleader has ever enacted such a ruthless purge of the left. As for the “sacred cows” attributed to Streeting, the slaughterhouse has been busy indeed. Starmer has repeatedly attacked the welfare state – from winter fuel payments to disability benefits – though the latter was too extreme even for a supine parliamentary Labour party. Anti-migrant rhetoric has culminated with plans to introduce one of the harshest asylum systems in Europe. The international aid budget has been gutted. He genuflects before Donald Trump. And he has resurrected Blair’s great obsession: ID cards. By the sacred cow metric, Labour are up to their necks in blood. If bashing migrants and the welfare state were truly popular, this administration would be flying high. Instead, it is the least popular government in polling history.My defence of Starmer is a limited one, admittedly, but it is clear enough: this is not all his fault. Yes, he is responsible for surrendering to the very faction Streeting embodies. But Starmer’s central failing – a total absence of vision – is not uniquely his. It is the defining weakness of the Labour right, the faction to whom he outsourced his politics. Their worldview,which positions them as the credible managers of British capitalism against a supposedly juvenile left, effectively expired with the 2008 financial crash, which destroyed the strategy of pumping money into public services without challenging the Thatcherite economic model beneath. Starmer is simply a convenient scapegoat for a faction that offers no serious analysis of Britain’s predicament.There has been no “leftward lurch”. Belatedly ending the two-child benefit cap was welcome, but should have been instinctive for any Labour government. The budget was designed primarily to soothe the bond markets. If Labour has veered left, its voters have not noticed. The Greens, running on an explicitly leftwing platform, are surging. Polling suggests that far more 2024 Labour voters would switch to the Greens or the Liberal Democrats than Reform or the Tories. Blairites have long insisted that leftwing views were marginal and that progressive voters had nowhere else to go. They were wrong on both counts.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Anyone hoping Rayner will offer salvation should prepare for disappointment. Someone who moved from being a Jeremy Corbyn loyalist to one of the faces of Starmer’s government will inevitably face accusations of being a shapeshifter. For now, she certainly looks like someone without a clear, robust and coherent vision or the kind of support base needed to support a premiership that breaks from Britain’s failed economic model.Labour should make Streeting’s lifelong dream come true. No one can claim he is not a true Blairite believer. When he fails, no excuses will remain for Labour’s right. It is they, not Starmer, who have sunk the party.

I suggested the two things are not quite the same, given that obesity is a global epidemic and narcolepsy is fairly rare. He countered that the way the drug works might also have applications for insomnia; similar to the Post-it note having been invented bysomeone trying to create the world’s strongest glue.Anyway, in the course of this, I discovered the test for type 1 narcolepsy, which is that you’re put in a room with zero stimulation – nothing to read, no one to chat to, perfect silence, perfect temperature – and timed on how long it takes you to fall asleep. If it’s under eight minutes, you’re narcoleptic. But the average, for a person with no complaints in that area at all, is 22 minutes. I was completely incredulous. This is a grip on consciousness more or less the same as a house cat. Bored? Go to sleep. Even a dog will have a quick look for something to eat first.Obviously I’ve spread this troubling statistic all over town, and most people have follow-ups, such as: what kind of a room? What colour is the room? Is there a chair in it, and is it comfy? Never mind the chair, what kind of hoodlum can fall asleep without a bed?I also discovered cataplexy, which can involve falling asleep after strong emotions, not necessarily bad ones (laughing too hard is a trigger), and strongly recognised it. Sometimes I go to sleep on the tube just because I’m pleased the tube has arrived.In short, science has delivered a fresh wonder. It’s only because we find each other so interesting that any of us are awake at all.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsSleepOpinionHealth & wellbeingcommentShareReuse this content"

European leaders must learn to fight back.Tue 9 Dec 2025 13.49 ESTLast modified on Tue 9 Dec 2025 20.14 ESTShareSir Keir Starmer, Emmanuel Macron and Friedrich Merz have become adept at scrambling to deal with the latest bad news from Washington. Theirmeetingwith Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Downing Street on Monday was so hastily arranged that Mr Macron needed to be back in Paris by late afternoon to meet Croatia’s prime minister, while Mr Merz was due ontelevisionfor an end-of-year Q&A with the German public.But diplomatic improvisation alone cannot fully answer Donald Trump’s structural threat to European security. The US president and his emissaries are trying to bully Mr Zelenskyy into an unjust peace deal that suits American and Russian interests. In response, the summit helped ramp up support for the use of up to £100bn in frozen Russian assets as collateral for a “reparations loan” to Ukraine. European counter-proposals for a ceasefire will need to be given the kind of financial backing that provides Mr Zelenskyy with leverage at a critical moment.More broadly, though, an ominous lead-up to Christmas has underlined the limits to firefighting and turning the other cheek to Maga provocations. The extraordinarynational security strategypaper published last week by the White House did European leaders a service in this regard. Brimming with contempt for liberal democratic values, it confirmed the Trump administration’s desire to minimise security guarantees in place since the second world war, while simultaneously pressuring the EU into betraying the principles on which it was founded. This was a “for the record” version of the US vice-president JD Vance’s mocking Munichspeechlast February.Passagespredicting the “civilisational erasure” of Europe through migration and EU integration could have been written in the Kremlin, which dulynotedan overlap in worldviews. Ditto the hostile calls to cultivate “resistance” to Europe’s supposed trajectory, and support for “patriotic” nationalist parties. For good measure, Mr Trumpechoed“great replacement” conspiracy theory tropes this week in an interview that rammed home the same talking points in less coherent form.However tempting it may be to pretend otherwise, given the desire to persuade Mr Trump to do the right thing overUkraine, a US administration that acts in such a way cannot be viewed straightforwardly as an ally. The president and his America First ideologues see the EU as a drain on security resources best deployed elsewhere, an economic competitor to be dominated, and a cultural adversary to be undermined at every opportunity.The response must be a belated push towards greaterstrategic autonomyand unity in defence, and the promotion of European interests in the wider economy. That, in turn, will mean playing hardball with Washington in a way that the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, conspicuouslyfailedto do when negotiating a humiliatingly one-sided trade deal in the summer. A world where China and the US both wish to eat the EU’s economic lunch, and Russia harbours darker designs to the east, is no place for a romantic view of multilateralism.The White House national security strategy paper and the US president himself have laid it out in black and white: Mr Trump seeks a fragmented, weakened Europe that is reliant on US industry and tech, and will therefore meekly comply with its aggressive demands. Europeans deserve far better than a continent made fit for Elon Musk. Time to fight back.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But there are solutions if people get behind themTue 9 Dec 2025 13.49 ESTLast modified on Tue 9 Dec 2025 17.37 ESTShareAstudy suggesting thatas many as 168m light-up Christmas ornamentsand similar items could be thrown out in a single year, in the UK, is concerning if not surprising in light of longstanding challenges around recycling rates and waste reduction. Even if the actual figure is lower, there is no question that battery-powered and electrical toys, lights and gifts are proliferating as never before. Despite a great deal of commentary aimed at dialling down consumption over the festive season, especially surplus packaging and rubbish, strings of disposable lights and flashing figures have gained in popularity. Homes, front gardens and shopping streets grow sparklier by the year.Batteries and electrical devices present particular difficulties when it comes to disposal, because they cause fires. But they are just one part of a more general problem of excessive waste – and weak regulatory oversight. British plastic waste exports rose by 5% in 2024to nearly600,000 tonnes.A new report on plastics from the Pew Charitable Trusts warns that global production is expected to rise by 52% by 2040 – to680m tonnes– outstripping the capacity of waste management systems around the world.Some retailers in the UK and elsewhere have cut down on packaging. There is abooming online tradein secondhand clothes. But the biggest recent rows about waste in the UK have been about sewage, not consumer goods. An overhaul of water industry regulation is meant to sort this out, following areviewin the summer. There is still a high likelihood that the worst-performing company, Thames Water, couldcollapse into special administration.But Ofwat is not the only regulator to face criticism for its performance in relation to pollution and waste. The Environment Agency is under growing fire as the problem ofillegal rubbish dumpinghas moved from being a local issue in a handful of locations to a national one.In October, the House of Lords environment committee called for the government to urgently review its approach to this“critically under-prioritised” problem. An illegal dump at Hoad’s Wood in Kent is being cleaned up at a cost of £15m. But six similar sites in England are known to the Environment Agency. Campaigners believe that the situation is in danger of spiralling if enforcement efforts are not rapidly scaled up.Discarded strings of battery-powered fairy lights might seem insignificant in the context of vast heaps of toxic waste, or the3.6m hours of raw sewage spillsfor which the water industry in England was responsible last year. But environmental organisations are right to draw attention to the role of consumers as well as industry. The Environment Agency ought to have been empowered in the context of the climate crisis – not undermined and underfunded as it was under the Tories. But individuals can make a difference when it comes to waste, both in their decisions about what to buy, keep and get rid of – and in their political opinions and choices.Another report, published by the consultancy Hybrid Economics last month, said the UK couldend its reliance on plastic waste exports, and create 5,400 new jobs, if it invested in up to 15 new recycling facilities. The lights on buildings and trees are cheering in the run-up to holidays, but we shouldn’t ignore what happens when they are turned off.Explore more on these topicsWasteOpinionChristmasRetail industryPlasticsThames WaterEnvironment AgencyRecyclingeditorialsShareReuse this content"

But two further points deserve emphasis.First, most countries do not use juries. We are one of very few European nations that still do. During the imperial period we exported our system widely, yet even some former colonies have since abandoned it. The main countries retaining juries are the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. To insist that juries are essential to justice is, implicitly, to claim that the many modern democracies that do without them operate inadequate systems.Second – and more importantly – the jury system conflicts with a fundamental principle of justice: that important decisions must be accompanied by reasons. Parties are entitled to know why a decision has been reached, and appellate courts can only review a decision by examining whether its reasons are legally sound and supported by the evidence. Juries alone deliver the most serious outcomes in our system while giving no reasons at all. Their decisions may be correct – or entirely mistaken – but we have no way of knowing. As a result, criminal appeals become artificial exercises focused on the judge’s conduct or directions, not on the reasoning behind the verdict itself. Some say the age of the jury system is its justification. But we have abandoned most medieval practices for good reason.None of this means replacing juries should be done lightly. There are valid concerns about leaving such decisions to a single judge, even one who must give reasons. We should consider panels that include multiple judges, lawyers, specialists or trained lay members, as is already done in magistrates courts, tribunals and many countries without juries. Such models guard against individual bias and provide expertise in complex cases. We should not reject reform. We should refine it.Michael HarrisRetired judge, LondonAs somebody who has been called to jury service twice in the last 10 years, I want to challenge the somewhat rose-tinted view set out in your editorial (2 December).Out of a total of 20 days, I actually spent 3.5 days in court. The rest was spent either in the court waiting area or at home while cases were delayed due to late legal challenges, failure of witnesses to appear and, most memorably, a juror being ill one day. The next day, the judge decided to halt the trial because not all jury members were available for the delayed time period, so the case had to be started all over again, with a different jury, the following week.The only case I did see was regarding a punch-up in a pizza delivery shop over a delayed order. All dreadfully inefficient, both in terms of cost and time.Christian MoleChislehurst, LondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

But this is a bit like bears getting indignant about all the shit in the woods.It serves AI researchers right for the irresponsible innovations that they’ve unleashed on the world, without ever bothering to ask the rest of us whether we wanted it.But what about the rest of us? The problem is not restricted to AI research – their slop generators have flooded other disciplines that bear no blame for this revolution. As a peer reviewer for top ethics journals, I’ve had to point out that submissions are AI-generated slop. But many academic experts are not well-versed enough in slop to spot it so quickly. Nor, understandably, are they inclined to immerse themselves in the “genre” to get up to speed.This means that the process of weeding out the slop will be slower and clog up the process. AI allows the volume of rubbish to be scaled up to unmanageable levels so that traditional quality‑control mechanisms like peer review are overwhelmed.We are on the verge of academic virtues and standards falling away, the “signal” being drowned out by the “noise” across the board, at which point research may face a downward-spiralling bad imitation of itself, from which there is no obvious escape.Those who continue to look away from this problem must not later be allowed to get away with claiming that they weren’t warned about and couldn’t have foreseen the consequences of their neglect.Dr Craig ReevesSchool of law, Birkbeck, University of LondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Wes Streeting should not be on it, 7 December).

The Liverpool team then followed suit by inflicting Inter’s first European home defeat since September 2022. A brooding superstar with a bruised ego watched from afar while Liverpool fans serenaded Slot at San Siro.Salah might well have taken the decisive 88th-minute penalty had he not talked himself out of the trip to San Siro, another legend of the game that is showing its age. Instead it fell to Dominik Szoboszlai, the friend Salah had in effect argued should not be playing on the right ahead of him, to deliver a precious victory for Slot after Alessandro Bastoni had been penalised for pulling Florian Wirtz’s shirt in the box.Arne Slot full of praise for Liverpool efforts after gritty win against InterRead moreIt was a soft penalty and a hard slog of a game.Liverpool, and especially their head coach, will not care a jot after the trials of the past few days. Slot needed at the bare minimum a committed display from his team to counter allegations that Salah’s criticisms are shared by others in the dressing room. He got commitment and much more. The visitors produced a vastly improved defensive performance and worked tirelessly to stifle a dangerous Inter team that have reached two of the past three Champions League finals.A deserved point appeared to be Liverpool’s reward until the video assistant referee sent the German official Felix Zwayer to the pitchside monitor to review Bastoni’s infringement. Szoboszlai swept his spot‑kick high into Yann Sommer’s top corner and Inter’s 18-match unbeaten home run in Europe was over. The release for Liverpool was palpable.Salah had given Liverpool no option but to leave him out of the trip to Italy. Slot’s authority over the rest of the squad would have been seriously undermined had he travelled. The timing of the interview at Elland Road was bad enough with Slot, Salah and his teammates all struggling – and supposedly sticking together in adversity – but made worse by the limited options available to Liverpool in Milan. Slot was unable to fill his bench with Cody Gakpo, Federico Chiesa and Wataru Endo also absent. Without the source of 46 Champions League goals for Liverpool the team’s highest goalscorer in the competition on the night was Virgil van Dijk, with five.Liverpool’s bench may have been threadbare but Slot was able to field a £204m frontline partnership in Alexander Isak and Hugo Ekitiké. The summer signings started in front of a midfield diamond in which Szoboszlai, Curtis Jones and Alexis Mac Allister all had freedom to rotate. The result was better protection for the Liverpool defence and confusion in the Inter ranks as they took around 40 minutes to work out how to counter the visitors’ altered approach.The first notable act of the night, given the circumstances, was the sound of Slot’s name being chanted by the sizeable Liverpool support high up with the gods. Salah’s song did not get an airing all night.Inter’s uncertain start was not helped by losing the midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu to injury after 11 minutes. The central defender Francesco Acerbi followed him to the treatment room with an apparent hamstring problem 20 minutes later. The captain, Lautaro Martínez, also collected an early booking for a ridiculously late foul on Andy Robertson.View image in fullscreenAlessandro Bastoni commits the foul on Florian Wirtz of Liverpool to give away the vital penalty.Photograph: Giuseppe Cottini/Getty ImagesLiverpool were controlled, measured and exploiting space around Inter’s three-man central defence. Sommer saved from Jones and Ekitiké in the first half, the latter leading to a corner from Szoboszlai that almost gave Liverpool a merited lead. Ibrahima Konaté headed home from close range after Ekitiké had flicked on. A first look at a replay showed the ball looping off Ekitiké’s arm yet it took almost four minutes for the match officials to disallow the goal. Zwayer ruled that, although the ball may have been headed on to Ekitiké by Van Dijk, the striker’s arm was in an unnatural position.Almost inevitably, Inter improved and Martínez drew a fine save from Alisson with a bullet header from Bastoni’s cross. Cristian Chivu’s team were more composed after the restart but the contest remained evenly matched and, in truth, fairly uneventful. Bastoni swiped clear in front of his own goal after a flowing Liverpool move involving Ryan Gravenberch and Isak teed up Robertson for a dangerous cross from the left. When Nicolò Barella found Martínez in space 20 yards from the Liverpool goal, Van Dijk made an important block to deny the Argentina international.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Profile settings button at the top right, then select Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Slot introduced Wirtz for the quiet Isak and Conor Bradley for Joe Gomez. Bradley made a huge impact, almost creating an immediate breakthrough for Ekitiké with his first touch and forcing Sommer to save at his near post when released clear in the box by the France international. Bradley was also the driving force behind the passage of play that led to Liverpool’s late penalty.At the end of an unedifying storm, Slot could savour the reaction from those players who clearly remain behind him.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueInternazionaleLiverpoolmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Instead they supplied more evidence that they lack the resilience for aChampions Leaguetilt that may now have to be tackled the hard way. This damaging late defeat completed a grim week on the road and had implications for the longer-term picture. They are staring down the barrel of a February playoff that could stretch Enzo Maresca’s side, active almost year-round, to the very limit.Atalanta twice punished weak defending and, crucially, preyed on their opponents’ inability to overcome setbacks. It is a problem Chelsea cannot quite shrug off and, at this level, such recidivism comes at a cost. When Charles De Ketelaere, the game’s outstanding player, blasted in a deflected winner after being invited to take aim they could hardly claim not to have been warned.Szoboszlai steps up in place of Salah to sink Inter as Liverpool fans sing Slot’s nameRead moreThe tone of the occasion had shifted with Gianluca Scamacca’s 55th‑minute equaliser, until which pointChelseaappeared to have dulled the home threat. They were looking more likely to score another of their own when the hulking former West Ham striker somehow drifted away from their centre-backs to nod De Ketelaere’s cross past a horribly exposed Robert Sánchez. The keeper needed more help than that and it may not be unduly harsh to suggest that his manager could have provided it.It could be taken as read that Maresca would rotate so there were few eyebrows raised when he made five changes from the team that trudged forgettably through Saturdayat Bournemouth. But the half‑time substitution of Trevoh Chalobah, who was replaced by Wesley Fofana, was not straight from the textbook.Maresca explained that it was a planned move to manage Chalobah’s playing time, adding the defender was on a yellow card. He could not have foreseen that Fofana would last half an hour before succumbing to an eye injury but it highlighted the risk factor of tinkering.Fofana’s departure, caused by accidental contact from Scamacca that left him struggling for clear vision, meant Tosin Adarabioyo was next to have a go at restricting Atalanta.The hosts already scented blood and another reorganisation was hardly ideal. “It changed a little bit the plan of the game,” said Maresca, who had kept Estêvão Willian up his sleeve but had now filled his quota of changes. Chelsea were already listing. “After we conceded the goal for 1-1 we lost control of the game a little bit. I think we can avoid both goals, they’re quite easy goals.”View image in fullscreenGianluca Scamacca heads Atalanta’s equaliser past Robert Sánchez.Photograph: Alessandro Sabattini/Getty ImagesDe Ketelaere’s path to glory was certainly simplified by the extent to which Benoît Badiashile and Marc Cucurella backpedaled as he broke from midway inside Chelsea’s half and bore deep into their penalty area. One of them could have faced the Belgian down well before he got that far. Cucurella’s punishment was the snick that gave Sánchez, whose hand to the ball was not enough, little chance and left Chelsea nursing a single point from three away games in Europe.The frustration was that they had survived a stiff early examination and looked well placed to push on. Sánchez had denied Ademola Lookman and Josh Acheampong, on his first Champions League start, had earned acclaim from several teammates with a point-blank block from the same player.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The flag was initially raised when João Pedro neatly snicked in a low cross from Reece James, who had been sent to the left byline after a short-corner routine. But replays immediately made clear the decision would not survive a video assistant referee check and, within a minute, their advantage was confirmed. It was João Pedro’s first goal in this competition and a well-timed intervention given Liam Delap will spend around a month out with his shoulder injury.Fast-forward to the game’s final meaningful kick and João Pedro would be wincing, having failed to make clean contact with a glorious late volleyed chance that was aimed straight at Marco Carnesecchi. It was not as if Chelsea, for all their skittish defensive work, lacked opportunities to change the complexion. Before Scamacca escaped their clutches they had been pushing to open up an insurmountable lead, James drilling wide when given a decent sight and Jamie Gittens stinging Carnesecchi’s palms.They were made to regret not turning the screw. That emotion may be heightened if they are forced to accept a playoff spot and, more happily, beat Cardiff in the Carabao Cup quarter-final next week. Put together, those eventualities would add separate two-legged ties to their winter schedule and mean they face 21 games between now and the end of February.“We are aware, absolutely,” Maresca said of that particular spectre. “Probably with two wins you can be in the top eight.” They will need to come against Pafos and, fiendishly, at Napoli. For now, though, Chelsea must simply crave home comforts.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueAtalantaChelseamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

They did not have to extend themselves to see off a moderate challenge from Slavia Prague and although Thomas Frank was pleased to send supporters away happy for thesecond time in four dayshe will know not to get carried away given this triumph came against opponents who looked as if they would have been better off in the Europa League.Atalanta 2-1 Chelsea, Tottenham 3-0 Slavia Prague, and more: Champions League – liveRead moreSlavia,winless after the first six gamesof the league phase, were not up to much. The Czech champions offered little, conceding a bizarre own‑goal early on before giving away two soft penalties in the second half, although Frank is entitled to cling to signs of progress after a troubled start to life in N17. He will not mind that there were close to 15,000 empty seats at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Frank will prefer to dwell on his side securing only their sixth home win in all competitions this season, Xavi Simons boosting his confidence by scoring again and Spurs stepping up on the night they welcomed Son back for an emotional homecoming.However, it is perhaps indicative of the bloated nature of this competition’s new format that even Son returning for the first time since his move to LAFC last summer was not enough to fill the ground. The upper tiers were sparsely populated, which probably reflected a lack of excitement about the quality of the opposition, although there was still a huge ovation for the night’s special guest when he appeared on the pitch for his formal farewell before kick-off.It was Son, of course, who scored the first goal at this ground after Spurs moved home in 2019. The South Korean forward’s legs faded last season but he will be remembered as a legend here. A mural of him was unveiled on Tottenham High Road on Tuesday afternoon and his presence lifted the atmosphere, even if it must be pointed out that Son’s successors also did their bit to keep the mood positive.There was less than a minute on the clock when Wilson Odobert, who replaced Randal Kolo Muani on the left, flew past Tomas Holes and sent in a cross that Richarlison should have buried. Tottenham, moving the ball briskly, looked good.View image in fullscreenSlavia’s David Zima (next to No 17) headed the ball to give Tottenham the lead.Photograph: John Walton/PAFrank had to maintain momentum after his side’s win against Brentford and it helped that he did not tinker much. Archie Gray kept his place in midfield and Xavi Simons took his chance after continuing at No 10.Jindrich Stanek, the Slavia goalkeeper, was busy during the opening 15 minutes. However, the visitors carried a threat on the break. Lukas Provod tested Guglielmo Vicario from long range and Michal Sadilek missed a free header midway through the first half.There was still an edginess to Spurs. Micky van de Ven foolishly picked up a booking that rules him out of the game against Borussia Dortmund next month. Spurs are probably going to have to beat the German club if they are to finish in the top eight and avoid the complication of the playoff round but doing so will be harder with Van de Ven unavailable in central defence. “The minor negative,” Frank said. “It is what it is.”Not much else troubled Frank. Slavia trailed when Cristian Romero flicked on Pedro Porro’s corner in the 26th minute and David Zima’s failure to twist his neck enough led to the left-back sending a strange header into his own goal. “I was very happy we built on momentum from the Brentford game,” Frank said. “The team is gelling more and more.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Frank looked to preserve energy before the trip to Nottingham Forest on Sunday.

We have the Leuven game next week which is very important to get three points and then get us as high up the table as possible.“We should win today and we did. We had some moments in the box; we had about 15 shots and I think there were quite a few blocked shots and saves. They defended for their lives and they’ve made it hard for a lot of teams in the Champions League so far.”Arsenal’s inconsistent form in the Champions League this season – two wins and two defeats – had placed extra importance on this penultimate matchday. They will have been well aware of the threats posed by the visitors, who earned a point off Chelsea in their opener. While Corina Dekker’s side have only secured two points in the competition, they boast a developing group of young players who have been catching the eye.Quick GuideSkinner urges United to attack OL LyonnesShowThe Manchester United head coach, Marc Skinner, has hailed  OL Lyonnes as Europe's best team but urged his side to take the game to the eight-time European champions in Leigh on Wednesday.Skinner's team are a point behind the French club in the Women's Champions League table after winning three of their first four matches in their debut campaign at this stage of the competition, meaning they have  secured at least a knockout-phase playoff spot.Both sides hope to finish in the top four  to progress automatically to the quarter-finals, and Skinner said: \"We’re playing the best team in Europe. I know Barcelona are up there as well, but Lyon have the capacity to be the best team in Europe, so we’re going to need them [the fans], and what I want Lyon to feel tomorrow is the force that Manchester United are and can become.\"Lyon have the ability to create something from nothing in any moment of the game. We have to concentrate and be at our very best. If we defend for the whole game, Lyon will win.\"He added: \"We can’t just sit off them. We’ve got to be very respectful of that. We must attack. We’re at home and we look forward to trying to give ourselves that quality going forward too.”When  United re-formed their senior women's side in 2018, Lyon were  five-time winners of this competition, but Skinner does not want his players to be nostalgic by any thoughts of how far they have come to reach this point: \"If I wasn’t Man Utd manager I would be saying: ‘Wow, what a fantastic achievement.’ [But] there is no room for this romanticism. If you live in a nostalgic space, you lose ground.\"Skinner  confirmed his side would be without Elisabeth Terland because of a knock to her \"upper body\" on Sunday, but he expects the striker  to return for Sunday's league game against Tottenham Hotspur.Tom GarryWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The Gunners came into this game on the back of a confidence-boosting win against Liverpool in the Women’s Super League.

But I feel good now even if, 100%, this has been a very tough year for me both on and off the oche.”Rather than being miserable, the 36-year-old is amiable company – which seems remarkable as in 2025 he has been through a divorce after 17 years with his wife, Daphne, witnessed the devastating effect of cancer on his father, endured intense scrutiny in the Dutch media, and struggled to regain his once imperious form with the arrows.Van Gerwen holds the record for the longest run as world No 1, having retained the top spot for seven years from 1 January 2014 to 3 January 2021. Those 2,559 days of supremacy offer a stark contrast to his far more inconsistent play over the past five years.View image in fullscreenWorld No 1 Michael van Gerwen makes his entrance at the 2019 PDC World Championship at Alexandra Palace, on his way to his third World Championship title.Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The GuardianThe world championship begins on Thursday and, while he enters the tournament as the third seed, Van Gerwen’s painful year has diminished his game. He nods emphatically when I ask if his recent personal trauma has changed him. “A lot,” he says before pausing. “Maybe it’s better to say it has not changed me as a person – but it has changed my way of thinking.“It has made me understand what’s most important in life. It has to be family. Of course I love darts but I love my kids much more. Before, when I didn’t have kids, it was easier.Dartswas always my number one. Then, when I had kids, darts was not my number one any more. You have to try to balance things a little better.”It’s a familiar challenge for a sporting icon to retain the same drive once their focus is diluted by children. Phil Taylor held the previous record as the longest-running world No 1, but the lengthiest of his eight stints at the summit was more than 500 days shorter than Van Gerwen’s epic reign. But Taylor,who won 16 world titlescompared to Van Gerwen’s current tally of three, once told me he never allowed family responsibilities to blunt his desire at the oche.“I spoke with Phil about it and he fell out [with his family] sometimes because he always put darts as No 1,” Van Gerwen says. “I think if you now ask Phil the question: ‘Would you do it differently?’he might say: ‘Yes.’”Van Gerwen’s children, Zoë and Mike, are eight and five. Remembering his daughter’s birth in 2017, he says: “My priorities changed 100%, straight away. I think it should. It would be weird if that wasn’t the situation.”Did that essential humanity come at the expense of his darts? Van Gerwen smiles sadly. “A little bit, yes.But my daughter was born in 2017 andI still became world champion in 2019. That was then and, now that they’re older, they want a bit more attention. So when I’m home I have the kids. Before that I could go practise whenever I liked and now I have to work around the kids to practise. That’s different.”It will be seven years in January since Van Gerwen’s last world championship triumph –a 7-3 cruise in that 2019 finalagainst Michael Smith. The biggest gap between world title wins in the PDC era of professional darts is the five years separating John Part’s victories in 2003 and 2008. What would Van Gerwen have thought in 2019 if someone told him he would not win another world championship for at least seven years? “I wouldn’t believe that. But also corona[virus] didn’t help. It’s small factors because the line between winning and losing is so thin. I’ve still played three finals [in six years] so that’s not too bad. It’s a great achievement. But I’m not a happy runner-up. I want to win, as simple as that.”View image in fullscreenMichael van Gerwen celebrates winning the 2017 PDC World Championship at Alexandra Palace.Photograph: Bryn Lennon/Getty ImagesHis son was born in April 2020, just weeks after the world slipped into lockdown, but how else did Covid undermine his game? Van Gerwen spreads his arms to accentuate how widely the impact was felt. “Everyone who was playing well at that time, where are they now? They can’t win a raffle any more. That’s why I love to play in front of crowds. It gives me energy, it gives me joy and it keeps your engine going. Without crowds it was disgusting.”Van Gerwen listens quietly when I read aloud his reaction after he lost 6-3 against Gary Anderson in the semi-finals of the 2015 world championship: “People don’t understand how painful it is. We all hate losing. If you don’t mind losing you can’t be a great sportsman. I’m not a good actor. I’m sick when I lose.” As he absorbs the familiar truth of his words, he exclaims “100%”, eyes bulging.Does losing a darts match hurt him as much now as it did then? “Yes. A little bit more.” Van Gerwen grimaces. “The last few years I’m a little bit more used to it.” He laughs. “Nah, nah, nah. I say keep being positive. Otherwise, if you’re thinking in a bad way it doesn’t bring anything. I always think: ‘Don’t worry, my time will come again.’”Does he recover from defeat more quickly in these comparatively lean days, having won only one major tournament, this year’s World Series, since 2023? “Yes, it’s quicker. I’m good but always a little bit angry at the beginning and then I’ll be fine again.”Van Gerwen, with brooding emphasis, says: “ If you don’t know how to lose, you never can be a great winner. Simple as that.”Has he learned new lessons about darts over the past few years? “Of course. You learn how to deal with losing, and how your brain’s reacting towards losing, because we all know I had a fantastic patch. But I don’t really listen to what other people say. I always follow my own gut feeling. I made some stupid mistakes but you learn from it. If you keep being taught by other people you’re like one of them: a muppet. I don’t want to be a muppet. I’m Michael.”He seemed like the real Michael during one of his lowest points, at the world championship in 2024. After averaging a poor 93.4 in anabject quarter-final defeat by Scott Williams, he shed tears and spoke of how hard it was to be away from his children every Christmas. “It was not only that,” he says now, “but also the moment when I found out my dad was sick.”Van Gerwen shakes his head when asked about his father’s cancer. “Not too good. He is sick. They amputated his nose one-and-a-half years ago and two months ago they cut away all his lymphs. They cut them everywhere so he can’t taste any more, he can’t swallow any more. He has tubes so it’s not going too good. His quality of life is bad – but he still tells me off when I don’t do well. He’ll be watching me in the worlds.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSport in FocusFree weekly newsletterOur picture editors select their favourite sporting images from the past week, from the spectacular to the powerful, and with a little bit of fun thrown inEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He was always a strong man and now …”Van Gerwen also talks about his divorce in May. “We were 17 years together, nearly 11 years married. You need to give yourself time to let it go. Sometimes you get thrown back to reality and then you need to try to move out of it again. I can do it.”Does playing darts help? “Yes, sometimes it really helps me to put my focus on something else. But sometimes it also annoys me.”View image in fullscreenMichael van Gerwen throws against Chris Dobey in the Premier League in April 2025.Photograph: Matt McNulty/Getty ImagesVan Gerwen brightens. “But me and my ex are on good terms so that’s really important for the kids. We’re always going to be connected because we have kids together.The kids were with me the last six days. I brought them to their mum yesterday and now I’m [back in the UK] I’ve got four days for myself and then next week I pick them up for two days again. I’m a darts player and I’m a father, but I need me time as well.”His fame in the Netherlands means “everything I do at the moment is on social media, I’m not even talking with a woman in a pub and the newspapers will ring me to say: ‘Is there more? Is she a girlfriend?’ Am I not allowed to talk to women any more? People take pictures and it’s like everything I do is in the loop. Here [in the UK] I can be normal, but not in Holland. I think it will stay that way until I have a new partner but I decide what I’m doing. I’m not a puppet”.Is he open to the idea of a new relationship? “Yes, if one comes on the path, why not? I’m a single man now and we’ll see what comes.”Our attention returns to the darts and Luke Littler,the new world No 1, who crushed Van Gerwen in thelast world championship final. That loss meant Van Gerwen had lost his past three world finals, in 2020, 2023 and 2025. The brilliant Littler is still only 18 and, as the Dutchman remarks wryly, “he lives with his mum and everything is easy for him. He doesn’t have a family [of his own]. He has no responsibilities. Everything’s fine. But when you start to face real life then things are changing. You have to deal with new things in life then. It’s not going to be smooth for the rest of his life.”View image in fullscreenMichael van Gerwen at Ashton Gate in Bristol.Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The GuardianThe teenager is already subject to scrutiny as he helps elevate the sport to an even greater pitch of popularity. “Darts is in a really good place at the moment,” Van Gerwen says. “Social media is bigger than ever. The television coverage is good. So [Littler] does really well for himself and can play himself into financial independence in the next few years. He also did well for darts so far.”But the demands on Littler will intensify in the coming years. “Yeah,” he says. “I want to see when he has kids. How he’s going to deal with that.”Who is more difficult for Van Gerwen to beat – Littler or the world No 2, Luke Humphries? An eight-second pause unfolds as he weighs up his answer: “Littler. But there’s not much in it.”Van Gerwen leans forward when I ask him, if after such a taxing year, his gut instinct still tells him he can win these world championships. “No one has to tell me,” he says, intently. “I tell myself I’m going to win.”Explore more on these topicsMichael van GerwenPDC World ChampionshipsDartsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

In the 50th minute he nodded home from just inside the box from Marcus Rashford’s cross and, in the 53rd minute, the French defender jumped high in a crowded box to head the winner from a Lamine Yamal cross.“They have made it difficult for us. They sat very deep, had a lot of players on the back, which makes it tough, Lamine Yamal had two or three players on him all the time,” Pedri told Movistar Plus. “We made some adjustments at half-time, put more players up front and it worked out, we felt better and found the goals.

Only Ealing Trailfinders and ­Doncaster Knights have applied formally to be promoted to the Prem, withWorcesterWarriors understood to have missed the deadline.A Rugby Football Union spokesperson suggested on Tuesday that the absence of Worcester’s name reflects the reality that the club is still “getting back on its feet” after its financial collapse in September 2022 with debts of more than £25m. But with Ealing unable to satisfy the Prem minimum ­standards for the past two seasons, and with ­Doncaster off the pace in 10th place, it raises fresh questions about the ­­raison d’être of the ­scheduled new end‑of‑season Champ playoffs, unveiled this year amid much fanfare.The Breakdown | Pirates hope lure of Cornish Camelot will tempt franchise bargain huntersRead moreOriginally it had been intended that the playoff winner should qualify for a merit-based, two-leg showdown with the Prem’s bottom side, but other scenarios have since emerged. One suggestion was that the Champ runners-up should be ­promoted in the event of the ­champions being ineligible. With ­Worcester out of that race this season and ­Ealing still ­awaiting the result of their ­application, that mooted ­loophole is set to be academic.It further complicates the endless debate around the future of the elite English club game. Following Red Bull’s takeover of the bottom-placed ­Newcastle the Prem owners are now firmly against relegation –described by the Prem’s head of growth, Rob Calder, as a “Victorian” concept. The formal removal of relegation for the next five years, however, still has to be ratified formally by the Rugby Football Union Council, potentially in February.Prem Rugby remains intent on ­creating a closed franchise league along the lines of cricket’s Indian ­Premier League, which would centralise commercial operations and, crucially, remove the threat of relegation. There are doubts, though, whether a move to 11 or 12 Prem clubs will be logistically practicable in the busy period building up to the 2027 Rugby World Cup.Well-placed sources say there is still a desire, even so, to expand the Prem to 12 teams by 2030. “We’re all agreed on the need for expansion of the top 10,” one league insider said.The immediate stumbling block is Ealing’s suitability as a Prem side while they remain based at their ­Vallis Way ground. “In the ­current state of affairs they can’t go up because they’re not prepared to ground share [elsewhere],” the same official said. “Either they decide to do that and meet the minimum ­standards, or they don’t and it’s the ­second team in the league who goes up.”That conclusion is fiercely disputed by Ealing, who said their ground can now potentially hold 6,000 spectators and is technically eligible to host Premier League football. “There cannot be a circumstance in which, if Ealing finish top, we would not be allowed into the Prem,” said Simon Halliday, the former Championship chair who is an adviser to Ealing.“That is still our position, otherwise we wouldn’t have applied. If the RFU are serious about going from 10 to 12, the only way they’re going to do it is by bringing Ealing in and then bringing one more in. If they say no and say we’re going to stay at 10, you can’t take [expansion talk] seriously.”The west London club also insist that, as things stand, their multisport business model is more sustainable than that of many other Prem clubs. “It’s about the whole game and the message it gives to other aspirants,” Halliday said. “You could argue we have the perfect business model. We don’t have our ground sitting fallow for two weeks. We don’t have an appalling deficit. Others do, which is why they’ve struggled so much and lose millions.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The existing Prem owners would love Wasps or London Irish – or both – to be reborn professionally after their financial collapses but that could be years down the track, if ever.Cornish Piratesmay conceivably be another future candidate, given the RFU’s desire for a wider geographical spread of top clubs across the country.Interestingly, it is understood that the RFU has been approached about the possibility of a top team potentially being based in Birmingham in future as part of the new multipurpose Birmingham City stadium project. The city’s existing top club, Birmingham Moseley, sit third from bottom in National League One, the third tier of the English men’s game.Saracens, meanwhile, have confirmed the England forward George Martin will be joining them from Leicester before next season.Explore more on these topicsChamp RugbyWorcesterRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

Guardian Australia has received several reports of thoseunder 16 passing the facial age assurance tests, but the government has flagged it is not expecting the ban will be perfect from day one.All listed platforms apart from X had confirmed by Tuesday they would comply with the ban.The eSafety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, said it had recently had a conversation with X about how it would comply, but the company had not communicated its policy to users.Bluesky, an X alternative, announced on Tuesday it would also ban under-16s, despite eSafety assessing the platform as “low risk” due to its small user base of 50,000 in Australia.Children had spent the past few weeks undertaking age assurance checks, swapping phone numbers and preparing for their accounts to be deactivated.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThe Australian chief executive and co-founder of the age assurance service k-ID, Kieran Donovan, said his service had conducted hundreds of thousands of age checks in the past few weeks. The k-ID service was being used by Snapchat among others.Parents of children affected by the ban shared a spectrum of views on the policy. One parent told the Guardian their 15-year-old daughter was “very distressed” because “all her 14 to 15-year-old friends have been age verified as 18 by Snapchat”. Since she had been identified as under 16, they feared “her friends will keep using Snapchat to talk and organise social events and she will be left out”.3:15Are Australian kids breaking the law if they sneak onto social media? – videoAnother parent said the ban had forced him to teach his child how to break the law. “I’ve shown her how VPNs work and other methods on bypassing age restrictions,” he said. “I’ve had to set her up with her own adult YouTube account and have assisted her in bypassing TikTok’s age-estimation and will keep doing so each time it asks.”Others said the ban “can’t come quickly enough”. One parent said their daughter was “completely addicted” to social media and the ban “provides us with a support framework to keep her off these platforms”.The Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said inan opinion piece on Sunday: “From the beginning, we’ve acknowledged this process won’t be 100% perfect. But the message this law sends will be 100% clear … Australia sets the legal drinking age at 18 because our society recognises the ­benefits to the individual and the community of such an ­approach.“The fact that teenagers occasionally find a way to have a drink doesn’t diminish the value of having a clear, ­national standard.”3:33Ezra is a teen quadriplegic. He says Australia’s social media ban will make him lonelier – videoPolling has consistently shown thattwo-thirds of voters supportraising the minimum age for social media to 16. The opposition, including leader Sussan Ley, have recentlyvoiced alarm about the ban, despite waving the legislation through parliament and the former Liberal leader Peter Dutton championing it.The ban has garnered worldwide attention, with several nations indicating they will adopt a ban of their own, including Malaysia, Denmark and Norway. The European Union passed a resolution to adopt similar restrictions, while a spokesperson for the British government told Reuters it was “closely monitoring Australia’s approach to age restrictions”.Inman Grant told the Guardian that from Thursday, she would be sending notices to the platforms covered by the ban to find out how the implementation was progressing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If they were not, it could take that platform to court to seek fines.There would be an independent evaluation of the ban conducted by an academic advisory group examining the short-term, medium-term and longer-term impacts of the ban.“It will look at the benefits over time, but also the unintended consequences,” Inman Grant said.How is Australia’s social media ban affecting you and your family?Read more“Everything from are they sleeping? Are they interacting or are they actually getting out on the sports fields? Are they reading books? Are they taking less medication like antidepressants? Are their Naplan scores improving over time?” Inman Grant said.Potential unintended consequences to be investigated included whether children were moving on to “darker areas of the internet”, learning how to bypass the bans through VPNs, or moving on to other platforms, she said.Teens on Snapchat affected by the ban had been publicly sharing their mobile numbers in their profiles ahead of their accounts being shut down.A spokesperson for Snapchat said the platform understood under-16s were disappointed by the ban but “would strongly encourage any teens using Snapchat not to publicly share their personal contact information”.Inman Grant said she had sent notices to 15 companies not initially included in the ban, asking them to self-assess whether they should be.Yope and Lemon8, which shot up the app store rankings as teens looked for alternatives, were among those contacted.Explore more on these topicsSocial media banSocial mediaAustralian politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Discipline through fear is not preparing young people for life as confident, independent adults,” Wood said in the report, commissioned by Hackney’s independent safeguarding children partnership.Wood added: “[MVPA’s] leadership has come to believe harsh discipline is not just a means but the defining characteristic of success – the method has become the mission.“Rather than responding with curiosity, leadership dismisses concerns as vexatious or ideologically motivated. Practices like shouting have become so routine they are no longer recognised as harmful. Governors have not asked: Success for whom? At what cost?”Wood said his evaluation of the school’s data found that ethnic groups and children with special needs were “disproportionately impacted” by sanctions. Those included “desking”, where pupils are placed at desks in corridors as a punishment for minor infractions. “This is isolating, shaming, and educationally unproductive,” Wood said.Jim Gamble, Hackney’sindependent safeguarding children commissioner, said there were wider lessons for other schools as well as for Ofsted and the DfE.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Families need to be reassured that the culture described in the review can actually change, and if the senior leadership team and governors can’t do that then they should be replaced.”MVPA is part of the Mossbourne Federation multi-academy trust, which grew out of the original Mossbourne Community Academy founded in 2004. The first Mossbourne success under its first headteacher, Sir Michael Wilshaw, saw the academies model copied by subsequent governments.Wood said he faced persistent challenges from the academy and the federation, which insisted that communications be conducted through its solicitors, and prolonged delays in obtaining data.Mossbourne Federation also conducted its own review, carried out by Anne Whyte KC. A spokesperson for the federation’s members trust said: “While the [Wood] report acknowledges the strong outcomes the schools achieve for pupils alongside high levels of support from parents and staff, it raises a number of issues which echo those detailed in the Anne Whyte KC review, published last month.”Explore more on these topicsAcademiesPupil behaviourSpecial educational needsSchoolsHackneyLondonTeachingShareReuse this content"

Sovereignty resides in the people, exclusively in the Honduran people.”She also referred to Hernández’s release: “Conservatives in Washington have decided to ally themselves with drug trafficking and organised crime.”After a lengthy investigation that had key developments under Trump’s first administration,Hernández was convicted in the USlast year. He governed Honduras from 2014 to 2022, and Manhattan prosecutors alleged that, under his government, the country served as a crucial transit point for cocaine entering the US from South American countries including Colombia and Venezuela.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features, opinion and photography, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The electoral council has until 30 December to announce the official result.Explore more on these topicsHondurasAmericasDonald TrumpUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

On questioning, he said he drank an average of eight energy drinks a day.The case, reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports, also prompted doctors to call for tighter regulation of sales and advertising of energy drinks.On admission to hospital, the patient’s blood pressure was 254/150mmHg, which doctors said was extremely high. He was given drugs to lower his blood pressure.But once back home, his blood pressure rose again and remained persistently high, despite the ramping up of his drug treatment.On further investigation, doctors discovered the extent of his use of energy drinks, totalling 1,200mg of caffeine a day. The recommended maximum intake is 400mg.He was asked to give up his daily habit, after which his blood pressure returned to normal. Blood pressure lowering drugs were no longer needed.“It was therefore thought to be likely that the patient’s consumption of highly potent energy drinks was, at least in part, a contributive factor to his secondary hypertension (high blood pressure) and in turn his stroke,”the doctors wrote in BMJ Case Reports.However, he did not fully recover. Speaking anonymously, he said: “I obviously wasn’t aware of the dangers drinking energy drinks were causing to myself. [I] have been left with numbness [in my] left-hand side hand and fingers, foot and toes even after eight years.”The doctors said: “There is regular publicity about health effects of alcohol and smoking, but little about the increasingly prevalent modifiable lifestyle trend of energy drink (ED) consumption.”They added: “As our case and discussion illustrate, it is possible that both acute and chronic intake of EDs may increase CVD (cardiovascular disease) and stroke risk, and importantly, this may be reversible.“While the current evidence is not conclusive, given the accumulating literature, the high morbidity and mortality associated with stroke and CVD and the well-documented adverse health effects of high-sugar drinks, we propose that increased regulation of ED sales and advertising campaigns (which are often targeted at younger ages) could be beneficial to the future cerebrovascular and cardiovascular health of our society.“Additionally, healthcare professionals should consider specific questioning related to ED consumption in young patients presenting with stroke or unexplained hypertension.”Explore more on these topicsHealthStrokeHeart diseaseFood & drink industrynewsShareReuse this content"

At nearby Princetown there was 7.9cm.The December average total for Princetownis about 20cm. In Treherbert in south Wales, 8.4cm fell. Gusts of 83mph were recorded in Capel Curig and Aberdaron in north Wales.The UK Met Office’s amber weather warnings – the second most severe – remained in place for north-west Scotland andNorthern Irelandinto Tuesday night.

A driver was pulled from her submerged car after it was swept about 40 metres downstream from a flooded ford near Ringwood in Hampshire. As she attempted to reverse out, the surging water dragged her Ford Focus down the stream. A member of the public helped get the woman out of the car.Four people were also helped from cars in Thornford, Dorset, after a number of vehicles became stuck on a flooded road, and there were several more rescues from vehicles in Cornwall.Firefighters in Devon rescued two people from the roof of their car after it became stranded in flood water in the village of Teigngrace on the River Teign near Newton Abbot. Both people were reported as safe and well.There were long delays on some motorways, including on the Severn crossings between south-westEnglandand south Wales. Problems were compounded by concerns lighting columns on the Prince of Wales Bridge could collapse, meaning only one lane was open in each direction.Great Western Railway said flooding significantly affected its services on Tuesday. Trains between London and south-west England andWaleswere cancelled, delayed or diverted.

Without better interconnection these payments, which consumers cover via their energy bills, are expected to reach more than £12bn a year by the end of the decade.Under Ofgem’s plans, National Grid and SSE will be allowed to begin early investment on two Eastern Green Link subsea power cables to transport offshore windfarm electricity to the south by 2034.They will also be allowed earlier investment for the 75-mile (120km) GWNC electricity link between Grimsby in Lincolnshire and Walpole in Norfolk to help transport the energy to consumers from 2033.Ofgem says bringing forward the superhighway projects will mean consumers are between £3bn and £6bn better off compared with the later delivery date, in large part because it will reduce the almost £2bn paid each year to generators to cut their output when the grid is overloaded.Fast-tracking the projects is expected to bring forward higher costs on consumer energy bills to pay for the work, however, days after the regulator gave the green light for companies tospend £28bn on Great Britain’s gas and electricity grids.An Ofgem spokesperson was not able to say what the direct impact would be on energy bills, or when it would take effect.The regulator’s decision is also expected to put the energy industry on a collision course with disgruntled local communities that have opposed the grid projects over concerns about the expected disruption of the building work and the long-termindustrialisation of the countryside.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Through intelligent use of early investment and setting realistic but ambitious timescales, we are helping shield consumers from unnecessary costs.”She said fast-tracking the projects would put them in a prime position to compete in the global race for the supply chains needed to upgrade grids as all major economies turn away from fossil fuels to power their economic growth.The European Commission is poised to unveil a €1.2tn (£1.05tn) plan to upgrade the EU’s electricity grids later this week,according to Euronews, including eight key projects designed to strengthen the bloc’s energy security.

The challenge he had accepted at the age of 23 was how to solve the problem of 450 elephants confined in a space too small to support them.For five years, having built a camp in an area renowned for its tree-climbing lions, he lived among Manyara’s elephants, first teaching himself to recognise them as individuals in order to make the first systematic study of their behaviour in the wild.He was utterly fearless, a quality that stood him in good stead, as his work was not without risks. Often he was forced to climb trees to avoid being killed by angry elephants, such as the formidable matriarch he called Boadicea, and on three occasions his Land Rover was skewered by their tusks. But eventually they came to accept him, while remaining truly wild.It was also during his sojourn in Manyara that Oria Rocco came to visit him from her family’s farm on the shores of Lake Naivasha inKenya. Oria not only fell in love with Manyara and its elephants – she stayed and married the dashing young scientist in 1971 and they had two daughters, Saba and Dudu. The story of their early years together, Among the Elephants (1975), which became a bestseller, was illustrated by Oria’s superb photographs – including a picture of her introducing Saba as a babe in arms to a wild cow elephant and its calf.Having become the first scientist to study the elephants’ social interactions, Iain came to believe that understanding their seasonal migratory movements was the key to their conservation. But the growing menace of ivory poaching soon caused him to devote the rest of his life to staunching the flow of tusks that was bleeding Africa dry.View image in fullscreenDouglas-Hamilton, founder of Save the Elephants, at the Kenya Wildlife Training School in 2011, as confiscated ivory is burnt.Photograph: Sayyid Azim/APAlthough elephant poaching had been endemic in Africa, the price of ivory had remained stable until 1969, but then suddenly took off as tusks became a commodity, to be stored and traded like gold. This proved disastrous for Africa’s great elephant herds, and Kenya became the first country to feel the full effect of the ivory price hike as the shifta – Somali poachers armed with semi-automatic weapons – swept down into Tsavo national park, the country’s biggest elephant stronghold.I first met Iain in the late 1970s and it was at his insistence that I went to Tsavo in 1988 to report for the Sunday Times on what became known as the ivory wars. By then, the poaching scourge had already spread far beyond Kenya, reaching into every corner of the elephants’ range and reducing their numbers from 1.3m to 600,000 in a decade.“Make no mistake,” he declared. “What we are witnessing is the greatest animal tragedy of this century.”To prove his point he had begun carrying out pan-African aerial surveys that revealed the extent of the crisis for the first time. In 1980 he was made honorary chief warden in Uganda, where he introduced air and ground patrols against Sudanese poachers who sometimes shot at his plane, and in 1988 he was awarded the Order of the Golden Ark by Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands for alerting the world to the sheer scale of the elephant killing. He was appointed CBE in 2015.It emerged that 90% of all ivory stocks had been obtained illegally, and in July 1989, the Kenyan presidentDaniel arap Moipubliclytorcheda 12-tonne pyre of tusks worth $6m. So powerful was the case put forward by Iain and his fellow conservationists that Cites (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) was compelled to ban the international trade in ivory in 1990. The full story is told in Battle for the Elephants (1992), written by Iain and Oria.View image in fullscreenDouglas-Hamilton fits a GPS collar on to an elephant in Meru national park, 1998.Photograph: Jean-Marc Bouju/APAlthough the ban did not put a complete end to poaching, it bought Africa’s dwindling elephant herds a precious reprieve, a time in which their numbers might increase again, and to this end in 1993 Iain moved to Samburu national park in northern Kenya and foundedSave the Elephants, a conservation charity working to secure a future for the species by enabling them to coexist alongside local communities. There he pioneered techniques of tracking collared elephants by satellite, an invaluable tool to increase their protection and avoid possible conflicts with people.Born in Donhead St Andrew, Wiltshire, Iain was the son of Lord David Douglas-Hamilton, who had commanded a Spitfire squadron during the second world war and was killed in a crash in 1944, andPrunella Stack, the head of the Women’s League for Health and Beauty, a fitness organisation founded by her mother in the 1930s. He was educated at Gordonstoun school in Scotland and Oriel College, Oxford, where he gained a BSc in biology and a DPhil in zoology before realising his childhood dream of moving to Kenya.In 2008 Iain almost came to grief at Samburu when he was charged by a cow elephant that then tried to impale him as he lay on the ground. Somehow he emerged unscathed, with little damage except for a broken pair of spectacles. In the event it was not elephants that ended his life but a swarm of bees, which attacked him while he was walking back to his home at Naivasha. He was flown to Cape Town for treatment but never recovered.He is survived by Oria, Saba and Dudu, and six grandchildren, Bundi, Selkie, Mayan, Luna, Cosimo and Luca.Iain Douglas-Hamilton, zoologist and conservationist, born 16 August 1942; died 8 December 2025Explore more on these topicsZoologyConservationAnimalsKenyaAfricaBiologyobituariesShareReuse this content"

Picked up by satellites, the access road – though modest now – will soon extend 2km to connect with the Tor Ulu Ala pit, an expansion site of Indonesia’s Martabe mine. The road will help to unlock valuable deposits of gold, worth billions of dollars in today’s booming market. But such wealth could come at a steep cost to wildlife and biodiversity: the extinction of the world’s rarest ape, the Tapanuli orangutan.This is absolutely the wrong place to be digging for goldAmanda Hurowitz, Mighty EarthThe network of access roads planned for this swath of tropical rainforest will cut through habitat critical to the survival of the orangutans, scientists say. The Tapanuli (Pongo tapanuliensis), unique to Indonesia, was only discovered by scientists to be a separate species in 2017 – distinct from the Sumatran and Bornean apes. Today, there are fewer than 800 Tapanulis left in an area that covers as little as2.5%of their historical range. All are found in Sumatra’s fragile Batang Toru ecosystem, bordered on its south-west flank by the Martabe mine, which began operations in 2012.“This is absolutely the wrong place to be digging for gold,” says Amanda Hurowitz, who coordinates the forest commodities team at Mighty Earth, a conservation nonprofit monitoring developments at the open-pit mine. “And for what? So mountains of gold bullion bars can sit in the vaults of the world’s richest countries.”View image in fullscreenMartabe goldmine in the Batang Toru rainforest, the only known habitat of the Tapanuli orangutan, on Sumatra island.Photograph: Nanang Sujana/AFP/Getty ImagesDozens of orangutan nests lie in the vicinity of the mine’s planned expansion, according to Mighty Earth. In late September, construction began on new access roads through the forest around Martabe mine, according to PT Agincourt Resources, a subsidiary of the British multinational Jardine Matheson, which operates the mine. One of the new roads running through secondary forest has already come within 70 metres of a cluster of orangutan nests, Mighty Earth says.For Jardine Matheson, which acquired the mine in 2018, expansion is critical to their bottom line. In 2020, the company said it would open up a new pit and build the supporting infrastructure to reach at least 460,000 additional ounces of gold hidden within Tor Ulu Ala. Gold mining is intensifying across the world as companies race to capitalise on near-record prices. At today’s rate of more than $4,000 (£3,000) an ounce, Tor Ulu Ala could generate nearly $2bn.‘They’re a lot like us’: saving the tiny punk monkeys facing extinctionRead more“While we understand the concerns of some critics, without the mine, which is now the income for approximately 3,500 employees – 70% of which are locals that rely on the mine operation – the alternative will be worse,” says Ruli Tanio, the vice-president director of PT Agincourt. “Being responsible miners, we can provide some opportunity for the orangutan in terms of funding.”But many scientists disagree, saying the expansion of the mine could push the critically endangered Tapanuli orangutans to extinction in a few generations. Even removing just 1% of the population a year would ultimately end in extinction, they say, as orangutans only reproduce every six to nine years.“It doesn’t take much – especially if you start killing orangutan females – for the population to go extinct,” says the biological anthropologist Erik Meijaard, director of the scientific consultancy Borneo Futures and one of the first experts to describe the species.View image in fullscreenA dominant male Tapanuli orangutan in Batang Toru forest. The animals only reproduce every six to nine years.Photograph: Maxime Aliaga/NPLConcerns about Jardine Matheson’s decision to move ahead with expanding the mine – without an agreed plan in place to reduce impacts to the Tapanulis – have spread beyond the scientific community. Last year,Norway’s $1.6tn sovereign wealth fund sold its holdings in three Jardines firms, citing concerns about the company being responsible for “severe environmental damage”.Tapanulis, with their frizzy, cinnamon hair and wide faces, are not only the rarest orangutan, but represent the oldest lineage of all orangutan species – descendants of the first ancestral orangutans that arrived in Sumatra from mainland Asia more than 3m years ago.In Batang Toru, the final holdouts of the species dwell in just three populations – the west block, east block and Sibual-buali reserve – spread across a patch of mountainous forest roughly the size of Rio de Janeiro. (Earlier this year, scientists confirmed they had found a small, isolated cluster of Tapanulis living in apeat swampabout 32km (20 miles) outside Batang Toru.)“We assume [the Tapanuli] was really widespread a couple of hundred years ago,” says Meijaard. But unsustainable hunting and fragmenting of the forest drove the last of the species to seek refuge in the higher elevations of Batang Toru.Even before the proposed mine expansion, the Tapanuli was threatened by development. AChinese-owned hydroelectricproject is being built on the Batang Toru River, which flows north-south along the eastern side of the ecosystem. The dam would affect an area that contains the highest density of Tapanuli orangutans – about 42 individuals – according to one2019 assessmentin the journal of the Society for Conservation Biology.View image in fullscreenLand cleared ahead of the building of a hydroelectric dam in the Batang Toru rainforest, August 2018.Photograph: Nanang Sujana/AFP/Getty ImagesThe expansion of the Martabe mine represents another blow, squeezing the apes from another side. “The Tapanuli orangutan really cannot afford any losses,” Meijaard says.The Martabe mine was established in 2008, near the western block of Batang Toru where an estimated 533 Tapanulis are thought to live. The mine’s footprint spans about 650 hectares (1,600 acres), with 2hectaresfalling within the Batang Toru ecosystem’s “key biodiversity area”, as designated by conservation NGOs in the Alliance for Zero Extinction.The notion the mine can kill an orangutan directly has proven to be quite falseRuli Tanio, PT AgincourtPT Agincourt says it will expand the mine by about 250 hectares (617 acres) by the end of Martabe’s operational lifespan in 2034, building not only the new pit and access roads, but a large tailings-management facility. This growth includes clearing another 48 hectares of mostly primary forest in the key biodiversity area. But the company says it is also setting aside a 2,000-hectare conservation zone within its concession, as well as creating another “offset” protected area about 40km from the mine site.“Without the [mining] revenue from this small area, it will be very hard to carry out the conservation work and the restoration work that is planned,” says Christopher Broadbent, a UK-based sustainability consultant to PT Agincourt. “If the mine were to walk away, the unintended consequences would be almost certainly disastrous for the orangutan.”PT Agincourt estimates its mine’s expansion will directly or indirectly affect between six and 12 orangutans. Tanio says: “Throughout our 13 years of operation, there have been no cases of fatality of orangutan directly from the mining activities.“The notion the mine can kill an orangutan directly has proven to be quite false.”But studies show that even indirect effects can take a toll. Female orangutans are particularly sensitive to habitat loss, as they tendnot to movewhen they lose parts of their home range, leaving them at risk of starvation. PT Agincourt says land clearing will proceed slowly, allowing time for the orangutans to move out of the way.View image in fullscreenThe mine expansion will involve clearing an additional 48 hectares of mostly primary forest in the key biodiversity area by 2034.Photograph: SOCP/Andrew Walmsley/EPA“We don’t know enough to be able to say that every orangutan that moves will find some new forest to call home,” says Phil Aikman, a campaign director at Mighty Earth. Some studies suggest that pushing orangutan groups closer together will lead to social tensions and conflicts. “The big concern here is that mitigation may or may not work.”For the past five years, environmental advocates as well as the International Union forConservationof Nature (IUCN), have pushed to delay new construction until a mutually agreed plan is in place to protect the Tapanuli. For a time, Jardine Matheson voluntarily agreed to a moratorium on construction, engaging with the IUCN’s Avoid, Reduce, Restore and Conserve (ARRC) taskforce, which advises companies on how to avoid ape habitats and reduce impacts. But that agreement expired in December 2022.You can plant 10,000 hectares of forest … You can push them fast or push them slow. But you’re still pushing them into competition with other orangutansThe primatologist Genevieve Campbell, who leads the taskforce, says Jardine Matheson had made it impossible to proceed as they were unable to share raw data, including orangutan survey data within the mining permit. Jardines says the Indonesian government prevented the company from sharing that information.But that relationship has improved in recent weeks. In November, PT Agincourt Resources signed a new conditional memorandum of understanding with the ARRC taskforce, allowing their scientists to provide independent input on the mine’s development plans and mitigation strategy.PT Agincourt told the Guardian it would temporarily pause road construction for three weeks to allow the IUCN to complete its review. The planned protection zones, as well as a new orangutan research centre funded by the mine mean the “Tapanuli will be better off with the mine”, Tanio says.View image in fullscreenA female Tapanuli orangutan with twins in Batang Toru forest. Females are particularly sensitive to habitat loss.Photograph: Courtesy of SOCPCampbell disagrees that the mine’s overall impact will be positive for the Tapanuli. “You cannot say that any great ape species is better with mining than without.”For Meijaard, little can truly compensate for the mine’s effects on the orangutans.“You can plant 10,000 hectares of forest with lots of fruiting trees … so the orangutans potentially have somewhere to go. You can push them fast or you can push them slow. But you’re still pushing them into competition with other orangutans in an area that is, ecologically, quite restrained for the species.”“If we really want to protect the species, we have to aim for zero losses,” he says.Find moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverageExplore more on these topicsIndonesiaThe age of extinctionMiningAsia PacificAnimalsMammalsWildlifeConservationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And we really, really need to get back to that now.”Asked if he meant people who had “got a cold, they’re snuffling, they are coughing” should wear a mask in the office, Elkeles added: “I think that would be very sensible to all their colleagues, or probably their colleagues would say: ‘Please go home.’“But we have really got to worry about the fact that this is a very nasty strain of flu. It spreads very easily. It’s warm and wet out there and people need to be sensible.”Downing Street said wearing a mask to prevent the spread of respiratory illness was “something people can consider”.A No 10 spokesperson said: “There is longstanding guidance in place for people on a range of measures they can consider taking to help limit the spread of winter bugs if they have flu-like symptoms.“This is neither new nor an instruction but simply something people can consider when trying to limit the spread of winter respiratory illnesses.“The best defence against flu is the vaccine, which is why we’re ramping up our vaccination efforts this winter with almost 17m flu jabs already delivered, which is 350,000 more than this time last year.”The UKHealthSecurity Agency wrote in a blog last week that “masks continue to be a useful tool in limiting the spread of respiratory viruses in some situations”.However, the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, rejected the idea, adding she was “still slightly traumatised by all the mask-wearing that we had to do during Covid”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the truth is, many people are contagious before they realise that they’re even ill. So I’m not sure that it would work.”The number of people in hospital with flu in England is at a record level for this time of year.

Quite simply, our sickness benefit system was not designed to handle the age of diagnosis which we now live in.”Badenoch indicated that the Conservatives would significantly scale back which conditions entitled people to help. “We are going to review which conditions the states treats as disabilities when it comes to benefits,” she said.“All of us will have physical and mental challenges at some point in our lives, but in an age in which one in four people now self-report as disabled, it’s clear that we are now going to have to draw a line on what health issues the state can support.”She said the changes would be needed to help the UK better absorb what she called “shocks” to the economy – using Brexit as an example of this alongside Covid and the financial crisis.Badenoch suggested a move away from measuring poverty in relative terms (those receiving less than 60% of the median income).“That is not a measure of poverty at all,” she said. “It is a bad measure, because in a booming economy, as incomes rise, more people can be classed as being in poverty, even though their real income is rising.“We need something better. I long said that Britain is at risk of becoming a welfare state with an economy attached.”In the speech and subsequent media Q&A, Badenoch repeatedly framed the rise in benefit spending as in part a product of choice and abuse of the system, saying many people were turning down work “because they think that those jobs are beneath them”.But she rejected the idea that language about an age of diagnosis and what she again called a “budget for benefits street” could stigmatise people and appear nasty. “I think that politicians should be careful with language all the time, but I don’t think there’s anything wrong in what I said,” she replied.“We spend a lot of time trying so hard not to upset people, or say anything that might ruffle any feathers, that we end up creating a system that is unworkable. I won’t apologise for the language I use. I’m actually very careful with my language, but I use language that’s going to cut through.”Explore more on these topicsBenefitsWelfareKemi BadenochConservativesAttention deficit hyperactivity disorderMental healthEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

But until now there was no high-quality evidence on its prevalence.The study, by the Royal College of Emergency Medicine’s (RCEM) trainee emergency research network (Tern), analysed five snapshots taken from 165 A&E departments in March this year.It found 17.7% of patients were receiving care in escalation areas, classed as anywhere not routinely used for care unless capacity in emergency departments is breached.This included corridors, waiting rooms, doubled-up cubicles, offices, cupboards and ambulances waiting outside to offload for more than 15 minutes.Writing in the medical journalEmergency Medicine, the researchers said: “National guidance states escalation area use is not acceptable; this research demonstrates it is routine.” It also posed “a significant patient safety issue”, they added.Dr Ian Higginson, the president of the RCEM, said the study “reinforces that the shameful practice of corridor care is endemic in emergency departments in the UK”.He added: “The stark picture this paper paints reflects the stories we hear from our members nationwide – the volume of which are growing as we head into winter. Just this week, one member told us of a patient having to wait two days for a bed in their department.“It’s important to note that these patients may be elderly, vulnerable, have mental health issues, or be children. They have been failed by successive governments.”In October,the Guardian reportedhow almost 150,000 people aged 90 and over in England were forced to wait longer than 12 hours in A&E every year, with some experiencing “truly shocking” waits of several days stuck in corridors.Older people were also being left in their own excrement and wet beds for hours, denied pain relief and forced to watch and hear other patients die next to them because they end up waiting so long for care.Higginson said it was “worrying” that the snapshots for the new study were taken in March and not at the height of winter, which “shows that corridor care is an issue all year round”.“We are very concerned about the harm associated with long waits in emergency departments and how it puts patients’ lives at risk – for every 72 patients who wait between eight and 12 hours before admission, there is one excess death,” he added. “This should not be happening in a wealthy country.”Higginson also said it was “abundantly clear” that the crisis had not been given the priority it deserved by the government. “It can’t be blamed on hiccups or flu,” he added. “We fear this winter we will see gridlock.”Last week the health secretary, Wes Streeting, promised to end corridor care in hospitals by the next general election “if not sooner”.The Department ofHealthand Social Care said corridor care was unacceptable, undignified and had no place in the NHS.“That is why we will be publishing corridor waiting figures for the first time, so we can take the steps needed to eradicate it from our health service,” a spokesperson said. “Sunlight is the best disinfectant.”It would “take time” to “turn around the shocking situation we inherited”, but there were already some “green shoots of recovery,” the spokesperson added.Explore more on these topicsHospitalsNHSHealthHealth policynewsShareReuse this content"

The Conservative party and Reform UK have both called for withdrawal from the convention altogether.But ministers have come under growing pressure from human rights campaigners,Labourpeers and some backbenchers to resist making changes, saying it would open the door to countries abandoning some of the world’s most vulnerable people.Rights groups warn against UK plans to weaken torture protections in ECHRRead moreThe letter, addressed to the prime minister, says: “We are writing to you as people who care deeply about this country, its global influence and the values that define us as a country.“The European convention on human rights (ECHR) and the UN convention against torture are at the heart of [Britain’s] legacy. They have saved lives, delivered justice and shown the world that Britain leads not by fear, but by principle. Any attempt at undermining their universal protections is an affront to us all and a threat to the security of each and every one of us.”The letteradds: “In accordance with hundreds of years of proud global leadership Britain must remain steadfast in upholding and championing our shared right to live a life free from torture, without exception. This means resisting any attempts to roll back vital protections and demanding accountability for perpetrators without fear or favour. We are looking to you to choose a future in which our country continues to stand tall for dignity, justice, humanity and hope.”The letter claims that changes in interpretation of article 3 on torture will prompt other authoritarian countries to take more drastic and damaging action.“This moment is bigger than politics. It is about what kind of nation we want to be and what kind of world we want to live in. Will Britain remain a beacon of human rights and the rule of law, or signal to authoritarian states across the globe that these cardinal principles can be abandoned?” it says.Veronika Fikfak, a professor of international law at University College London,wrote thata change to article 3 “touches the very core” of the convention. “Prohibition of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment is an absolute right. It allows for no balancing. There is no margin of appreciation for states, nor any deference to them.”Other signatories include the impressionist Rory Bremner, the actor Brian Cox, the fashion designer Bella Freud and the former Tory attorney general Dominic Grieve. Others who have signed the letter include the novelists Victoria Hislop and Alan Hollinghurst; the comedians Ben Elton, Nish Kumar, Miles Jupp and Alexei Sayle; the journalist John McCarthy; and the actors David Morrissey, Juliet Stevenson, Harriet Walter and Samuel West.The letter was sent to Downing Street on Tuesday, the day before International Human Rights Day.

That is significantly less than the peak of 14,000 children in August, but much more than the child malnutrition rate during the previous ceasefire in February and March of this year.“It’s still a shockingly high number,” Ingram said,briefing journalists by videofrom Gaza.In October, about 8,300 pregnant and breastfeeding women were also hospitalised for acute malnutrition.“This pattern is a grave warning and it will likely result in low birthweight babies being born in the Gaza Strip for months to come,” Ingram added.“This is not over. Generations of families, including those being born now into this ceasefire, have been forever altered by what was inflicted upon them.”Unicef and other UN agencies say that aid deliveries crossing into Gaza have increased since the height of the war, but are still completely inadequate in relation to the humanitarian needs.An average of 140 aid trucks a day have crossed so far in December, in convoys organised by the UN and the International Organisation for Migration. That is well below the target of 600 trucks a day set as part of the ceasefire.Those figures do not include bilateral aid donations and commercial shipments, which have increased more sharply than UN-coordinated deliveries under the ceasefire. They have brought down market prices for many commodities, but they remain beyond the reach of the overwhelming majority of people in Gaza who have had no income for more than two years and who have depleted their savings.Since the ceasefire, aid has been coordinated through a multinational hub called the Civil-Military Coordination Centre led by the US and Israel and involving representatives of other countries supporting the ceasefire. However,diplomats and aid officials saythat the Israeli army still has the final say in what is allowed in to Gaza.The UN reportedthat out of eight humanitarian convoys coordinated with Israeli authorities on Sunday, only four had been facilitated.Explore more on these topicsGazaMalnutritionUnited NationsHumanitarian responseMiddle East and north AfricaPalestineIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

The previous night, feminist campaigners had disrupted his show with shouts of: “Abittan, rapist!”Before Sunday’s performance, Macron asked him how he was feeling. When he said he was feeling scared, she referred to the protesters as “sales connes”(dirty or stupid bitches) and adding that if they reappeared, “we’ll toss them out”.Her office said in a statement that she had been trying to calm his nerves: “As the video shows, Mrs Macron’s only intention was to reassure an artist who, in his dressing room before going on stage, had just told her: ‘I’m scared’ because his show had been disrupted the previous evening.“In no way is she attacking a cause. She does, however, disapprove of the radical methods used to prevent an artist from performing on stage, as was the case on Saturday night.”The feminist campaign group Nous Toutes (“All of Us”) said its activists had disrupted Abittan’s show to protest against what it described as “the culture of impunity” around sexual violence in France.Magistrates terminated the investigation of the 2021 rape allegation against Abittan in 2024 due to lack of evidence, a decision confirmed on appeal in January this year, according to French media.In a statement on Instagram, Nous Toutes said: “We denounce venues that roll out a red carpet for men accused of rape, normalising sexist and sexual violence. It is a public insult to the victims. Victims, we believe you. Rapists, we do not forgive you!”Politicians on the left criticised the use of a sexist slur and some said Brigitte Macron should apologise. The former Socialist president François Hollande told RTL radio: “There’s a problem of vulgarity.” The Green leader, Marine Tondelier, said the comments were “extremely serious” and should not have been made by a first lady.Several celebrities voiced support for the feminist campaigners by adopting the insult for themselves with the hashtag #salesconnes. The actor and director Judith Godrèche, aleading voice in France’s #MeToo movementwho has filed complaints against two film directors for sexually assaulting her when she was a teenager, posted on social media: “Me too – I’m also asalle conne(dirty, stupid bitch) and I support all the others.”The singer and actor Camélia Jordana posted a picture of herself with #saleconne across her forehead.The Green senator Mélanie Vogel posted on social media: “And a very good day to all the stupid bitches of our country,” while the secretary general of the moderate CFDT trade union, Marylise Léon, said the comments were “inappropriate and crude”.On the French far right, however, the National Rally lawmaker Jean-Philippe Tanguy said Brigitte Macron’s comments had been made in private. “If each of us were filmed backstage saying things with friends, I think there would be plenty to comment on,” he told the broadcaster BFMTV. “All of this is very hypocritical.”Explore more on these topicsBrigitte MacronParisProtestFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

No detainees are being beaten or abused,” said the DHS assistant secretary, Tricia McLaughlin, in a written statement.The letter relies on sworn testimony from over 45 detainees, some of them describing how masked agents told them to “jump” the barrier, or wall, on theUS-Mexico borderto cross from the US into Mexico, under threat of imprisonment if they did not.According to the letter, ICE officers have been taking some non-Mexican nationals, specifically asylum seekers from Cuba and Guatemala, shackling them and transporting them an hour west from El Paso to the desert border crossing at Santa Teresa, New Mexico.Once at the border, detainees gave accounts to advocates of being met by masked officers, who allegedly ordered them to climb the border wall and cross into Mexico, bypassing all legal deportation proceedings and third-country agreements.“The masked people sometimes beat on people to get them to jump the wall even if they don’t want to,” said “Eduardo”, a Cuban detainee ordered to be deported and cited under the pseudonym in the letter. He alleged that officers told him if he did not cross to Mexico, he would be charged with federal crimes and sent to a prison in “Africa or El Salvador”.McLaughlin warned that unauthorized border crossers face potential removal to various nations, not just their home countries.“If you break our laws and come to our country illegally, you could end up in any number of third countries,” she said. “Our message is clear: criminals are not welcome in the United States. These third-country agreements, which ensure due process under the US constitution, are essential to the safety of our homeland and the American people.”The letter wasfirst reportedby the Washington Post on Monday, with the newspaper saying it had “independently obtained internal ICE records verifying that the four Cubans resisted removal on or around the dates they said the events took place” while adding that the Post “could not verify other details about the allegations, because the detainees had little means to document their experiences”.It also cited lack of media access to the camp at the huge army base in El Paso.McLaughlin also gave a statement to the Post that denied any mistreatment or deprivation of constitutional rights and said that detainees get proper meals, medical treatment and showers, and also access to lawyers and family.The letter from the advocacy groups, however, cites claims of “excessive force” inside the Camp East Montana facility, where guards allegedly utilize sexual violence to enforce discipline.“Isaac”, a Cuban national who adopted a pseudonym for the purposes of the letter, stated in a sworn declaration, according to the coalition, that after refusing to sign a voluntary deportation form, guards at the camp slammed his head against a wall several times, before an officer “grabbed and crushed my testicles between their fingers, which was very painful and humiliating”, according to the letter.In another incident, a teenager identified as “Samuel” described how one officer “grabbed my testicles and firmly crushed them”, while another “forced his fingers deep into my ears”, before he was reportedly beaten unconscious by guards for turning off an overhead light in his housing unit, the letter says.“Samuel” suffered broken teeth and testicular trauma requiring hospitalization, according to the letter, which also asserts that he was later billed for the ambulance ride required to treat the injuries allegedly inflicted by the guards.The letter also says the facility fails to meet basic human needs. The soft-sided tents, which house 72 people per unit, reportedly have failing plumbing.Detainees have described occasions where sewage backs up from toilets and showers, flooding sleeping quarters and dining areas with water contaminated by feces and urine. And, in some instances, they are allegedly forced to use their own clothing to mop up the waste due to a lack of cleaning supplies, the letter said.Medical neglect was also described as constituting “deliberate indifference”. The letter details cases of diabetics being denied insulin for days, causing them to faint, and patients with high blood pressure being ignored until they suffer visible medical episodes. Food rations are described as “fist-sized” and often spoiled, leading to rapid weight loss among detainees.McLaughlin said in response to the Guardian’s request for comment that detainees receive full access to legal counsel, hygiene facilities and dietitian-certified meals. She added that ICE provides comprehensive medical attention that exceeds what many migrants have previously experienced.“No lawbreakers in the history of human civilization have been treated better than illegal aliens in the United States. Get a grip,” she said.When later asked for further comment on each allegation mentioned in this article and related questions on government policy, DHS responded: “No.”However, Eunice Hyunhye Cho, senior counsel at the ACLU National Prison Project, said that her organization and others have received numerous complaints regarding the failure to provide adequate care to migrants detained at Fort Bliss.She said the lack of external oversight, combined with the detention facility’s allegedly cutting the detainees’ access to the outside world, has led to the accusations detailed in the letter.“Placing thousands of people in tent camps in the middle of the desert, in a military base, without adequate staffing was a recipe for humanitarian disaster,” Cho said. “Although shocking, but not surprising, this nightmare has come true.”Local leaders and migrant-rights advocates have previously condemned the vulnerability of detainees in tent-like conditions and raised concerns about potential human rights violations.Texas congresswoman Veronica Escobar, whose district covers El Paso, has demanded immediate transparency from the DHS, describing having been told of “dangerous and inhumane” conditions at the detention facility and describing it as a “public health hazard” that is deteriorating.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Trump administrationTexasUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The conflict had already displaced at least 1.2 million people before the latest upsurge in fighting.The state department said late on Monday that the US was deeply concerned by the violence. “Rwanda, which continues to provide support to M23, must prevent further escalation,” a spokesperson said.Explore more on these topicsDemocratic Republic of the CongoAfricaRwandaUS foreign policyTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Levies on energy bills will now be paid out of general taxation, which the Treasury said could reduce bills by an average of £150 a year from next April.The Bank’s early assessment, which matches theprediction published by the Office for Budget Responsibilityalongside Reeves’s statement, said the bulk of the reduction was down to the energy bills measures and the chancellor freezing fuel duty for motorists.Threadneedle Street is widely expected to cut interest rates at its policy meeting on Thursday next week. Financial markets are anticipating a cut in borrowing costs to 3.75%, down from 4% and the sixth reduction since a recent peak of 5.25% in the middle of last year.Lombardelli, a member of the Bank’s rate-setting monetary policy committee (MPC), said the central bank would take into account Reeves’s budget measures, although cautioned that longer-term inflation prospects would be important to take into account.Although Reeves’s measures will have a short-term impact on bringing down headline inflation, other government policy measures could push up the rate in future. Business leaders have said higher employment costs from a rising living wage andstrengthened package of workers’ rightscould force them to push up prices.“This is new information the committee will consider,” Lombardelli said of the budget. “[We need to consider] how much are you affected by one-off, one-year short-term impact of inflation.”She said views would differ on the MPC as to where the balance lay, but suggested a short-term headline rate cut could help stifle future inflationary pressures by influencing how businesses and consumers pushed for wage increases and set prices.“People’s experience of inflation changes how they may respond,” she said. “Energy is a really strong example of that. These are very visible cost reductions in that space.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said technology had helped create everything from baby and birthday cards to corporate greetings linked to a particular business.“It is still being managed by our in-house team. We make sure a person will look at it and it is relevant and exciting for customers. We don’t want to fill our site with generic design. We are treading carefully.”The strong sales helped lift the company, which also operates Greetz elsewhere in Europe and sells vouchers for experiences such as spa days and cinema trips, back into the black with a pre-tax profit of £26.6m for the half year compared with a £33.3m loss a year before.About half of purchases involve shoppers using AI-led features to help add a creative spin to their messages, whether that is a sticker, photo or personalised handwriting, up from only about 2% two years ago.Recent developments in the technology allow a shopper to automatically adapt a broad range of designs to fit certain requirements, such as targeting a particular age or relative.The company said its new AI chat system already resolves about a third of all queries and said: “Customers consistently rate these interactions far more highly than human-handled ones.”Raithatha said the company was “not looking at this as a threat or reduction in jobs” but it could step up productivity by suggesting 50 or more designs that a person could edit, adapt or curate rather than designing just one or two cards in a day.“We still need that creativity,” said the CEO, who is stepping down at the end of this month and will be replaced by Catherine Faiers, the chief operating officer of the secondhand car marketplace AutoTrader.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They talk humanity, hate – and why Trump is a ‘very limited’ manStuart HeritageTue 9 Dec 2025 07.57 ESTLast modified on Tue 9 Dec 2025 08.23 ESTShareIn October 1962, the world came closer to destruction than at any other point in modern times. After a US surveillance plane discovered that Soviet nuclear missile sites were being built in Cuba, less than 100 miles from the US mainland, PresidentJohn F Kennedyresponded by ordering the US Navy’s Sixth Fleet to impose a naval blockade around the island. Almost two weeks of impossible tension followed.The threat was clear. If Kennedy, or his Soviet counterpart,Nikita Khrushchev, fired on their enemy, a chain reaction of global nuclear strikes and counterstrikes would have followed, plunging humanity into all-out ruination.The Cuban missile crisis has been covered endlessly, in books and films and television programmes. But for its third season, the BBC World Service podcast The Bomb has brought a completely new element to the story. It is jointly hosted by Max Kennedy and Nina Khrushcheva, relatives of the men who, for 13 days, held the fate of the world in their hands.“What was the Soviet side thinking? What was the American side thinking?” asks Khrushcheva, Khrushchev’s great-granddaughter and a professor of international affairs at the New School in New York City. For her, the beauty of the show is its attempt to objectively ask: “How can people hate each other and go against each other?”“It was not lost on me how spectacular it is that humans can be friends or have the potential to be complete enemies,” adds Kennedy, son of Robert Kennedy, nephew of JFK and now an author and lawyer. “We see this over and over when countries have gone to war, and it just illustrates how unbelievably stupid it is to fight.”What’s remarkable about the Cuban missile crisis is that, because it unfolded so publicly, people around the world could watch almost in real time as it edged towards catastrophe. Even so, the threat of destruction came closer than anybody realised. “Virtually everyone in the White House wanted an airstrike and an invasion,” says Kennedy. “If we had struck the Cubans with the Sixth Fleet, there is no question the Russians on the ground would have launched a tactical nuclear weapon at the US Sixth Fleet, and that would have destroyed our aircraft carriers and sunk our largest and most important fleet. And we would have responded with massive retaliation that would have ended all life on Earth.”View image in fullscreenMax Kennedy and Nina Khrushcheva.Photograph: PRThe fact it didn’t is a testament to Kennedy and Khrushchev, who managed to keep their heads and calmly negotiate when everyone around them was pushing for action. As a result, Khrushchev removed the missiles from Cuba and Kennedy (although not reported at the time) removed his from Turkey. The relief was palpable, as was the sense of hope. During our interview, Kennedy and Khrushcheva theorise that the crisis would have forged a deeper relationship between the US and Russia, had Kennedy not been killed the following year and Khrushchev not been removed from office the year after that.Still, for those 13 days in October, the tension was felt by everyone. My father, who at the time was a 12-year-old boy on a farm four and a half thousand miles away from Cuba, vividly remembers lying in bed worried that world war three could break out at any moment. The Bomb’s co-hosts were born shortly after the crisis, and Khrushcheva learned about it through the Soviet education system, which painted a slightly different picture of events.“You said your father remembers it, and it was a scary day,” she says. “But in the Soviet Union, people really didn’t know that much about it, because it was a crisis, and in the Soviet Union we were told that things are always wonderful and sunny.”Inside Khrushchev’s family, though, it was different. “They told me what a great moment it was, because it was eyeball to eyeball. They were able to resolve it, and didn’t start the war, which was a wonderful thing,” she continues. In the years to come, though, that perspective would not be shared by everybody. “For a long time in Russian politics, it was considered a defeat for Khrushchev, because he didn’t blow up the United States.”The Bomb is so balanced and well produced that Khrushcheva jokes it almost made her forget she already knew the ending. This is, in part, due to the participation of historians Serhii Plokhy and Michael Dobbs. But, really, the most momentous thing is the participation of the hosts themselves. Even within living memory, it would be unthinkable that descendants of the leaders of America and the Soviet Union would appear together publicly. That Max Kennedy and Nina Khrushcheva can do that, and be so warm with each other, has to be a sign of hope.View image in fullscreen‘It was considered a defeat’ …  Khrushchev in 1962.Photograph: Keystone-France/Gamma-Keystone/Getty Images“Max and I are not the first,” smiles Khrushcheva. “After 1991, when the Soviet Union ended, my uncle Sergey Khrushchev’s son moved to the United States to become a Khrushchev scholar, and he became great friends with Dwight Eisenhower’s children.”“But we had never met before the podcast,” adds Kennedy. “Which is unfortunate because we got along really well and now we’re friends, which is really great. Finally, after nearly 60 years of almost destroying the world, our families have become friends, so I think the world is safer, a little bit.”Or is it? Part of the reason The Bomb feels so necessary is because we once again find ourselves living through dark times. The Doomsday Clock is closer to midnight than ever before, in part because world leaders don’t seem to be able to grasp the lessons of the past.“I don’t have confidence in the leaders of America and Russia,” says Kennedy flatly. “Chairman Khrushchev organised the political defence of Stalingrad. He saw first-hand, very close up, the horrors of war. President Kennedy [who fought in the second world war] lost two members of his crew. He saw death close up. That service to country, I think, makes a huge difference. Putin has threatened over and over to use nuclear weapons. And Trump has no experience with service whatsoever. So I have real concern about our future, left in the hands of these two very limited men.”This removal from the realities of war is something that also gives Khrushcheva pause. “There was much more physical reality at the time of the crisis,” she says. “Both Kennedy and Kkrushchev knew what war was. And so for both of them, taking the step that would bring us to world war three was unimaginable. That’s why it ended so quickly, because both of them were afraid that somebody, not them potentially, would make a mistake.“But now half of our reality is not physical. I mean, the American president is a reality TV show man. And because the military offence is going reasonably well for him right now, we’ve seen Putin three times in his military outfit. When the war was not going so well, he really was not associating himself with it that much. But now look at him. All of this is for show.”“It’s worth mentioning that when Nina speaks about Putin, I worry that when she goes back to Russia, something could happen to her, because there’s such a real threat of reprisal,” adds Kennedy hesitantly, before considering his own situation – and the potential legal repercussions from a US administrationthat forced the suspension of Jimmy Kimmelafter he criticised its response to the killing of Charlie Kirk. “I’ve always felt entirely safe in the United States, but now we have a president who seeks reprisal after his political enemies. This is very worrisome.”It’s also worth mentioning that Kennedy isn’t denouncing Trump’s administration in an abstract sense. His brother is Robert F Kennedy Jr, who serves as Trump’s controversial secretary of health. Max last year wrote an op-ed for the Los Angeles Times denouncing his brother, and his criticism of Trump carries a little extra sting. This becomes even more apparent when I ask what today’s leaders can learn from the Cuban missile crisis.View image in fullscreen‘He tried to put himself in Khrushchev’s shoes’ … John F Kennedy.Photograph: Ray Fisher/Getty Images“One is the importance of leaders who really seek every avenue to peace before going to war, which you don’t see happening right now in Venezuela,” he replies. “The other thing is, when you’re negotiating, the very important thing that President Kennedy did was try to put himself in Khrushchev’s shoes. The military-industrial complex was pressuring President Kennedy, so he knew it must have also been pressuring Khrushchev. They were both trying to figure out what the other person needed in order to settle this crisis. And in the end, I think President Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev developed an understanding of each other. There were times in the crisis where it was really just those two men that stood between all of these other forces and the destruction of the human race.”“Leadership responsibility is something that we are missing,” nods Khrushcheva. “The crisis was a great example of how, when you get close to war, you actually turn away from war. War is something that should not happen under any circumstances. It’s really a lesson on leadership. And I wonder if the leaders today would be willing to learn it.”The Bomb is on BBC Sounds nowExplore more on these topicsPodcastsJohn F KennedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Nuzzi, worried Donald Trump will catch on and start spreading rumours, convenes an emergency meeting with the Politician to strategise. RFK Jr – who has denied having an affair with Nuzzi – doesn’t see the big deal.So, she agonises “Did he take me seriously?”and reflects that she had “little cause to consider the question before now.”But once the question did cross Nuzzi’s mind, it imprinted itself on to her psyche. American Canto is part-memoir, part-political analysis. But it is, above all else, a plea by Nuzzi to be taken seriously; as a writer, thinker, person. This is not easy in the best of circumstances when, like Nuzzi, you’re a young and conventionally attractive woman. And, of course, it is even more difficult when, like Nuzzi, you’re a female journalist who made headlines for allegedly engaging in an inappropriate relationship with a famous subject. (Or, considering theaccusationsrecently level by Nuzzi’s former fiance, Ryan Lizza,subjects.)Nuzzi’s looks: the doors they might open, the preconceptions they engender – as well as the misogynistic system they operate within – are a recurring motif in American Canto, albeit one that is frustratingly underexplored. During her first meeting with Trump, she recounts, he looks her up and down and proclaims: “Very young and very beautiful.” Later on, her reporting irritates the president and he publicly insults Nuzzi, calling her “shaky and unattractive.” She is thrown by this, writing how strange she felt it “that the president of the United States had called me both beautiful and unattractive”.Then, at an exclusive DC party, Nuzzi stands in the kitchen with New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd, a woman namechecked perhaps because the US does take her seriously, and is accosted by an unidentified female movie star who grabs Nuzzi’s face. “‘Olivia, the secret to life is to be rapeable,’ she told me. ‘You are rapeable.’” She leaves that jarring anecdote to hang there, unexamined.It goes on and on: a series of overwritten non sequiturs whose purpose, it would appear, are to demonstrate that Nuzzi is a serious personWhen, in September 2024, Nuzzi’s alleged affair with the Politician is revealed, the star reporter, a person it’s hard to imagine as naive, seems shocked at how it plays out. “The Politician had orchestrated a narrative in which I was not just reduced to my sexuality but into a hyper-sexualized honeypot,” she writes. Most upsetting, Nuzzi says, are blind quotes suggesting she had used her “appearance as a tool for manipulation while performing my work. Of the lies told about me, this was among the hardest to take.”Nuzzi is right to be angry about the double standards applied to her; the way she was raked over the coals while a far older, far more powerful man coasted away from the scandal into a plum cabinet position. But American Canto would have been a better book if Nuzzi had interrogated her own behaviour. Instead, she glosses over it. “The Politician had been, briefly, my subject,” she admits. But, she argues, “[h]e had not been my source”. She seems to see no impropriety on her part; she’s just angry her privacy was violated.Nuzzi is angry, too, at entreaties to dish the dirt that the public (and, one imagines, her publisher) so desperately want. “I thought of that phrase,Tell all,often … Tell what, exactly? Tell why, exactly?” she fumes. Well, one reason, I suppose, might be to sell some books. Tell-alls, the ones that actuallytell, tend to sell.There is not much telling in American Canto, however; or not of anything anyone wants to hear about, anyway. For the first 116 pages, Nuzzi, who, after losing her job at New York magazine has self-exiled to California, barely mentions the Politician. Instead, she writes about Madeleine Ruthven, a screenwriter in the silent era, “hauled before Congress in the McCarthy hearings”, and then, in the next paragraph, about the North American tectonic plate triumphing over the Farallon tectonic plate “one hundred million years ago, give or take”. On the next page a quote from Nietzsche. Then an extract from an interview with Trump. And it goes on and on like this: a series of overwritten American Non Sequiturs whose purpose, it would appear, are to demonstrate that Nuzzi is a serious person with serious thoughts on the state of the United States and “consensus reality” (she is very fond of this phrase) who should be taken seriously.The alleged affair, when it finally comes up, is crept around. We learn little of interest about RFK Jr, a man who, as secretary of health and human services, is systematically destroying decades of medical progress. We are told instead that: “He desired. He desired desiring. He desired being desired. He desired desire itself.” She overintellectualises what is ultimately a sordid episode. For example, the Politician asks Nuzzi for advice, she says: “I approached his dilemma Socratically.”While American Canto may suggest otherwise, Nuzzi is not a bad writer. She can paint a vivid scene, pull you into a place. And the places she’s been are important, some of the world’s greatest centres of power. Buried among all the pretension, unnecessary filler and insufferable prose, there are the bones of an excellent book. Perhaps one day, if Nuzzi stops taking herself quite so seriously, we might get to read it.American Canto by Olivia Nuzzi is published by Avid Reader Press / Simon & Schuster (£20).

Most will tell you: shared canine custody arrangements prevent exes from moving on. It’s a logistical headache. It causes fights. It’s annoying for all involved (and then some). And apparently, in a revelation worthy of a straight-to-streaming movie, it makes dogs depressed.Oh. What. Fun. review – Michelle Pfeiffer leads Amazon’s underbaked Christmas turkeyRead moreNot to minimize the mental health of dogs – I’ve listened to my mother boast about our family chihuahua’s “EQ” enough to know that man’s best friend has the capacity for great emotional sensitivity. (And the ability to convey it on command – for a truly outstanding performance of doggie depression, please see Bing the bereft great dane in 2024’sThe Friend.) I have no doubt that a dog like Merv, a wired-hair terrier sort played by Gus the Dog in Merv’s eponymous Amazon movie, would struggle to adjust from life in a single family unit to split homes. Whether or not the ill-advised dog-sharing arrangement can sustain a whole Christmas romcom, however, is a dubious proposition.To be fair, Merv, written by Dane Clark and Linsey Stewart and directed by British playwright Jessica Swale, does not pretend to be bigger or better than it is. This is a tech company-cum-studio holiday release – it is not that deep. You know the plot will be simple and straightforward – forced to confront the fact that their respective post-split depressions are outmatched only by Merv’s, exes Russ (Charlie Cox, thankfully allowed to still be British) and Anne (Zooey Deschanel) take a cheer-up trip to a dog resort, where they will presumably stumble into realizing that they’re better off together. The side characters – here played by Chris Redd, Jasmine Mathews, Wynn Everett and Ellyn Jameson – will be eccentric, underused, overtuned, or all of the above. The visual quality will be that of an Amazon brand bestseller, the wintry atmosphere obviously contrived. (In this case, the fake snow clumps around verdant trees, as North Carolina in June stands in for Boston in December.)Whether or not these known quantities cohere into something enjoyable, then, depends on the quality of the performances, and one’s appetite for comfort food. On the second count, Merv selects a key target audience – the type to scroll Instagram Reels for dog videos, and please know I say that with an algorithm that is 70% chihuahua videos – and delivers with a plethora of dog montages. The selling point is dog, and though that unfortunately entails some awkward edits between dog line (of sorts) and human response, Merv delivers on dog beach, dog party, dog walk, dog depression and, ultimately, doggie joy.The same cannot be said for the human side of the project, which veers uneasily between relationship study, winking zaniness, basic romcom and slapstick, not really nailing any of them. That’s no fault of Cox, who is admirably game here, willing to go for the silly and cringe necessary to fully participate at the resort for dogs. There’s an inherent self-deprecation to the performance that is winsome, supplying more than his share of the charm and the chemistry for this obviously perfect-for-each-other couple on the rocks. Deschanel, as she does, brings a certainmillennial quirkinessto the proceedings, which either is your speed or isn’t. Her Anna is a touch too dry and aloof for my taste, particularly when matched with Cox’s sad-sack sincerity. (For what it’s worth – though not given much to do besides “be depressed”, Gus the Dog flops on the floor and whines convincingly – he’s no Messi in Anatomy of a Fall, but still a very good boy.)Merv tries to imbue Anna and Russ’s relationship with enough weight to carry through scenes without the title dog present – a shame, as he is by far the cutest part of this cute-aiming pic – and, as expected, meets the bare minimum. There is a reason why the two broke up, one which would feel more grounded and adult if provided a little more time to sink in and a little less blunt explanation. As it is, Merv is slight and sweet and entirely to expectations. Making a movie about co-parenting a dog is not a bad idea – though I wouldn’t say it’s a great one, either.Merv is available on Amazon Prime on 10 DecemberExplore more on these topicsFilmComedy filmsZooey DeschanelDogsAnimalsRomance filmsChristmasreviewsShareReuse this content"

The FX half-hour comedy about a group of recent college graduates in New York begins, naturally, on the subway; what seems like an over-studied portrait of early adulthood intimacy – tangled limbs, in-group references, aggressively relaxed banter – quickly devolves into a standoff between a creepy subway masturbator and the group’s instigator, Issa (Amita Rao), trying to out-masturbate him to make a wildly off point about feminism. “Is this the world you want?!?” she shouts at him, hand vigorously in pants.Adults review – Friends for the TikTok generation sitcom is a try-hard misfireRead moreThe moment is intentionally off-putting, perhaps too much so – I’m as ripe as anyone for surprise, but found the try-hardness of this shock memorably irksome. Yet it’s also unintentionally revealing: this, it implicitly screams, is a show toget young people’s attention. A similar anxiety courses through the opening ofI Love LA, HBO’s west-coast rejoinder to Adults that is similarly pitched as a zeitgeist-y take on the thrilling chaos of young adulthood. We meet Maia, played by creator and co-writerRachel Sennott, mid-sex with her boyfriend, heedlessly determined to come before going to work, even if it means ignoring an earthquake.Both scenes contain many of the hallmarks of TV about the wilderness that is one’s 20s – intense relationships, staggering narcissism, blinkered optimism, intoxicating messiness – though watching them, and many of the scenes that followed, I was reminded less of the turbulence of that age than of the television industry at large. TV is desperate to connect with young people, who increasingly opt for YouTube or social media for their screen time. Perhaps that’s why the industry seems especially bullish on I Love LA, in a way that’s incongruous with a show that still feels like a work in progress. Before it even aired, Variety declared the series a “generational text” and put Sennott, a former internet comedy “It girl” turned nascent screen star, on its cover; HBO has already announced a second-season renewal, calling it “among the fastest-growing” of its original comedies, averaging 2 million viewers – substantial for prestige cable, though by no means generationally defining.View image in fullscreenA still from Adults.Photograph: Rafy/FXAll of this belies a strange phenomenon in Hollywood: youth still dominates the culture, but not on television. Gen Z, generally defined as those born between 1997 and 2010, are thesecond largest generational demographicin the US behind millennials, and critical to the future of television. And yet the market for any series, let alone a great one, about being young and single and hanging with your friends is virtually wide open. Past generations had broad network sitcoms like Living Single, New Girl, Happy Endings, How I Met Your Mother and The Big Bang Theory; prestige creator-star HBO entries like Lena Dunham’s Girls and Issa Rae’s Insecure; and cult hits like Comedy Central’s Broad City, TBS’s Search Party and Freeform’s The Bold Type. Gen Z has duds likeGeneration, a one-and-done HBO teen show attempt in 2021, or the latest round of small network attempts to speak to those in their 20s – I Love LA, Adults and Overcompensating, internet comedian Benito Skinner’s college-set series for Prime Video, all of which have been renewed for second seasons on modest buzz.What once used to be a staple entree of the television buffet – TV that reflects young people’s realities, anxieties, fantasies and hijinks – is now a small subsection, neither drawing the eye nor tasting right. The closest one could get to a definitional gen Z hit is Euphoria, the overwrought HBO soap about high schoolers that reads as a millennial fever dream of all the ways the internet can ruin adolescence, though it did christen a distinctive sexualized aesthetic, popularize someimitably outlandish fashionand launch several movie-star careers. It has also been off the air for five years, with its long-awaited third season, including a time jump to post-college life, delayed until spring 2026.I Love LA review – Rachel Sennott’s HBO comedy finds itself but takes its timeRead moreIn the meantime, the Friends for gen Z seems to be, well, Friends itself. According to viewership data fromNielsen, when gen Z does pick a show to watch, they tend to go back in time – 65% of the shows watched by 16 to 34 year olds are so-called library series, including NBC’s archetypical twentysomething hangout sitcom (10.63bn minutes watched in 2024), fellow coming-of-age series Gilmore Girls (11.6bn) and medical soap Grey’s Anatomy (17.37bn).Nearly halfof gen Z prefers YouTube or social video platforms like TikTok over traditional TV or paid streaming, aharbingerof what Vox’s Rebecca Jennings termed theMrBeastification of entertainment.A very online segment of the cohort have taken torewatching Girls, close-reading the series as a rich archival text of cringe millennial striving.But for reflections of their own experience, much of the same cohort turn to social media – to see their peers post about their dating experiences or gag-worthy stories online, to watch influencersriffon fun and flirty nights out with friends or, in the case of thelong-running TikTok seriesby comedians Kyle Chase and Veronika Slowikowska, to tune into the latest lore-filled chapter of roommate situationship that may or may not be real. (SNL, also looking to attract young viewers, smartly tapped Slowikowska for its current season.)Hollywood is attempting to meet an audience increasingly acclimated to bite-size content where they are, paying firms to chop their series into micro-chapters for social media; Hollywood trade The Anklerreportedthat a producer on Adults paid the firm $15,000 to blast out 2,500 videos from the series on social media as experimental marketing. (The scheme reportedly netted 40m views across TikTok, Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts.) Studios such as Fox Entertainment and Miramax are investing millions in vertical video companies, part of a “microdrama”gold rushthat attempts to capture fractured youth attention spans with compact narratives told in two-minute “episodes” that slot easily on to social media.Under the influence: Beast Games and the YouTube-ification of televisionRead moreBut once you reach an audience, you still need to connect with them, and TV, no matter how TikTok-able the episode, is in a tough bind: there is no way that television, even with accelerated production and release schedules relative to film, could ever hope to keep up with the warp-speed trends and nimbleness of social media, or model the speed, hyper-referentiality, and distinctly un-prestige aesthetic of internet comedy. It isnotoriously difficultfor film and television to capture the seamless presence of the internet in our lives or our sprawling online selves, let alone the creator economy, in a way that doesn’t feel distracting, deadening, or cheap. As Jeff Astrof, a 59-year-old alum of the Friends writers’ room, put it toThe Ankler, if the iconic NBC series “took place now, Chandler would go on his phone the entire episode”.But they must try, in order to have a semblance of accuracy to the generation they’re portraying. I Love LA and Adults both attempt to build internet life into the fabric of its characters’ social groups – the former focuses on Maia’s career managing her influencer best friend Talullah, the latter features side plots such as air-tagging a roommate’s crush. The results are expectedly mixed. In I Love LA, the satire of influencers is too toothless, Talullah’s actual work as an influencer too vague; Adults fares better, but still handles the tribulations of online dating and location sharing with what feel like oven mitts.I should say that, like many aimless twentysomethings, both of these series show promise; the second halves of both freshmen seasons are significantly better than their firsts. But watching them mostly left me nostalgic for the gut-twisting insights of Girls, or the resonant friendship fights in Insecure, or the well-worn coziness of Friends – shows that feel connected to some hazy, common experience of growing up and figuring it out. Perhaps traditional television, transitioning from dominant cultural art form to niche medium, will too.Explore more on these topicsUS televisionTV comedyComedyTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

First released in the US in 2015, it’s an ultra-low-budget debut from first-time director Charles Poekel, set almost entirely on a 24-hour pop-upChristmastree stall. Poekel’s style is far too authentic-indie and unaffected to get slushy or sentimental about Christmas; through his lens Christmas tree lights blink like police lights. But in its own low-key way, he pitches his film just right for a little squeeze of festive warmth.Kentucker Audley stars as Noel (it took someone in the film to joke about his name before I twigged). Noel is back for his fifth year selling Christmas trees in Brooklyn, standing outside in the freezing cold and sleeping in a not-much-warmer caravan parked next to the trees. A few customers ask about the girl working with him last year. But this year Noel is alone, broken-hearted and working the night shift. There’s a documentary feel to a lot of the scenes, customers asking pointless random questions. One woman wants the same Christmas tree as the Obamas (this is 2014). Noel looks frozen to the bone physically and emotionally; he’s weary and disillusioned, though Audley’s subtle performance makes it clear that he wasn’t always like this.In truth, not much happens. Noel rescues a woman, Lydia (Hannah Gross), who has passed out drunk on a bench. She pops up again later in some genuinely moving scenes as Noel drives around New York, delivering trees – and these moments could spark a little flicker of good cheer in the grinchiest of hearts. Poekel hasn’t made a feature since this which is a shame – you can’t beat it for naturalness and ease, and it’s shot on gorgeously textured 16mm film.Christmas, Again is in UK cinemas from 12 December and on digital platforms in the US.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsChristmasreviewsShareReuse this content"

But his music is quite different: a slippery layer cake of samples, multitudinous keys and lo-fi pop production, with Brown singing of a world where “the ebb and flow isn’t ebbing right”, be it in love or civic life. There is still room for an instant-classic R&B ballad though, in Tossed Away.Ben Beaumont-Thomas49Rochelle Jordan – Through the WallEverything isjust soon the British Canadian producer’s sixth album: expensively plush deep house suggesting club lights low, gleaming mirrors, potent looks igniting across the dancefloor. As much as the cold beat and ballroom flow of Ladida or the slapping “body, body, body” incantations of On 2 Something suggest a steadfast commitment to abandon, Jordan maintains impeccable poise and control throughout, whether in diva mode on Words 2 Say, breaking hearts on Bite the Bait, standing up for her needs on Doing It Too (“I’m not too much / You just give too little”) or patiently waiting for a frustrated lover to see the light on Ladida. Commanding, wise and committed to atmospheric excellence, party hosts don’t come better.Laura Snapes48Jerskin Fendrix– Once Upon a Time … in ShropshireView image in fullscreenHarebrained prog cabaret … Jerskin Fendrix.Photograph: Tim GuttJerskin Fendrix’s high-profile scores for the last three Yorgos Lanthimos films can’t really help prime you for the Midlands composer’s eccentrically beautiful second album, which pairs pristine musical theatre with the harebrained prog cabaret of Faith No More and (particularly) the under-sung Morphine. At first, Once Upon a Time … casts the rural bliss of growing up in 00s Shropshire in a golden light, a haven of getting ratted on Baileys and listening to Kanye on a farm, then having a lovely hungover group breakfast in someone’s kitchen. But the unexpected deaths he has experienced in recent years intrude to spoil paradise, eliciting feverish, absurdist expressions of grief – Jerskin Fendrix Freestyle is a bravura wig-out – and fathomless devastation from his camp, craggy voice. It demands a full theatrical production.LS47Clipping– Dead Channel SkyClipping frontman Daveed Diggs is best known for being in the original cast of Hamilton, and for all that this album is filled with noisy industrial rap, you can easily imagine it being successfully adapted for the Broadway stage. Dead Channel Sky is set in a cyberpunk dystopia not dissimilar to the scorched-sun “real world” of the Matrix, humming with janky tech and populated with fascists and freaky hedonists. Producers William Hutson and Jonathan Snipes render it in acid squiggles and revving breakbeats, while Diggs delivers his mutoid poetry like a prophet jacked up on some amphetamine he’s synthesised in a backstreet lab.BBTTell us your favourite albums of 2025Read more46The Tubs – Cotton CrownIn different hands,the Tubs’ second album might be a crushing listen, and understandably so. In 2014, frontman Owen Williams’ mother, the songwriter and author Charlotte Greig,died by suicide. Grief, as these songs detail, made him a rubbish boyfriend. But Cotton Crown is often funny and ardent, and especially self-aware about how new love might feel like a life raft to a depressed mind ill-equipped to reciprocate: “Know it’s all in my brain / Caught in the middle of loving you and being insane,” Williams sings on Fair Enough. His striking voice, somewhere between Richard Thompson and Bob Mould, bolts through the band’s joyful jangle-pop. Clear students of the form, they’re virtuosos with zero patience for perfection, their riffs hurtling and plundering like seagulls going at a spilled catch as they vigorously rough you up with profundity.LS45Smerz – Big City LifeView image in fullscreenAn album of stilted beauty … Smerz.Photograph: Alva Le FebvreCatharina Stoltenberg and Henriette Motzfeldt feel like the pop girlies of the incredibly prolific and off-kilterCopenhagen Rhythmic Music Conservatory scene, making music that’s more outward-facing and arch than some of their insular and traditional (and equally great) classmates. Their second album lurches between throwing yourself at life – “you’re a girl in the city and you shouldn’t think twice”, they chant in deadpan harmony on Roll the Dice – and actually thinking twice quite a lot in existential spirals about purpose and desire. The dissonance between confidence and anxiety comes through in the album’s stilted beauty: one minute, their whorls of prepared piano carry you along like clouds amid perfectly turned pop-R&B and balladry; then they stab and stutter, like cracks in the pavement destined to trap your heels. In 2023, K-pop’s brightest hopes NewJeans hired them as co-writers: more pop bearing their imprint can only be a good thing.LS44Sabrina Carpenter – Man’s Best FriendReleased almost exactly a year after her superstar-minting breakthrough Short n’ Sweet, and using a palette of soft rock, 80s pop, light disco and yearning country melodies, Carpenter added rich colour to one of pop’s most distinctive self-portraits. Her blatant sexuality is offset by an ironising sense of camp and a deep streak of cynicism, as she wonders whether to wrap her little finger round a series of hot but useless men. But whether dialling her exes while hopped up on “go-go juice” or being toxic for the sport of it (“you think that I’m gonna fuck with your head / well, you’re absolutely right”), Carpenter knows she’s part of the problem. Her fake helplessness at her own worst impulses is just one part of a formidable screwball comedy arsenal – she’s a Rosalind Russell for the dating app era.BBT43Jennifer Walton – DaughtersView image in fullscreenBolt from the blue … Jennifer Walton.Photograph: Liam CosfordThis Sunderland producer’s previous work included one EP of power electronics, one of antic club tracks, collabs with Aya and 96 Back as Microplastics, gigging with Kero Kero Bonito and a smattering of other credits. So her staggering, fully formed songwriterly debut was a total bolt from the blue. A swarming orchestral epic with shades of Julia Holter and Phil Elverum, it addressed her grief for her late father in serenely surrealist images – hitting a deer with a car in the middle of the night – and the painfully mundane realism of sitting in hospital corridors together. The standout Miss America combined both to stunning effect, a numbed incantation of everything Walton had seen on the US trip where she learned of her father’s diagnosis, the familiar now remade horribly mythic.LS42Erika de Casier– LifetimeErika de Casier’s fourth album updates the Y2K R&B template that fought for body-to-body sensuality in the face of rising digital creep. The old-school dial tones that pierce Lifetime’s rapt, liquid atmosphere work both as Janet homage and ironic sigh at how good those forebears had it when emotional warfare could only be conducted via pager: “Took a screenshot so / I could look at your pretty face all the time now / Without a sign that I’m online,” de Casier sings on earworm Delusional, a low-slung anthem for contemporary dating anxiety. “Hit midnight / Not even a text to hold me warm,” she rues on The Chase. That’s one of the most inviting things about Lifetime: its seductively cool surfaces conceal de Casier frantically kicking her feet below the surface, just like the rest of us.LS41Danny Brown – StardustThe Detroit rapper’s first post-rehab record totally disprovedhis fearsthat sobriety makes artists boring. On Stardust, Brown is still hard-wired with cartoonish verve, coupled with a genuinely touching sense of gratitude: “Sleeping real good at night ’cos I’m proud of myself,” he raps on Book of Daniel. While you probably wouldn’t describe someone who ponders “going bonkers and knocking out your chompers” as a wise elder, his hunger for life, opportunity and unmediated sensation blares through in how evidently gagged he is to centre younger producers from the digicore and hyperpop undergrounds: his unruly kids 8485, Jane Remover, Underscores, Frost Children and more make Stardust trip with glitch, rave, squealing riffs and overdriven noise. The rare record that makes you want to riot and shed a smiling single tear emoji.LS40-3140YHWH Nailgun – 45 PoundsView image in fullscreenChews you up … YHWH Nailgun.Photograph: Steve GullickIn 21 minutes, the New York band’s debut chews you up and spits you out the other side in a tentacular whirr of rototoms, guitars that shriek and whine like neglected machinery, erratic tempos and frontman Zack Borzone’s choked-out vocals. The way the record lurches and reels brings to mind the classic horror film scene in which a human undergoes a violent, magnificent transformation into some sort of beast: much like Gilla Band’s Most Normal, 45 Pounds is a font of mutant rock pleasures.LS39Sudan Archives – The BPMThe title refers to the beats per minute of dance music, but for an album that is so totally alive, it surely also refers to a pounding heart. Sudan Archives (AKA Angeleno producer-singer-songwriter-violinist Brittney Parks) announces that “life’s a game and I got VR goggles” as she revels in the epicurean joys of sex, dancing, travel and music itself with an almost superhuman appetite: “The rest are cowards / They choose to eat and we devour.” It’s all done with breezy good humour but there’s something inspiring, even quietly political about this mindful rejection of the straight life. Her backings – full of pop-R&B and ethereal electro – also dart away from obvious mainstream paths.BBT38Ethel Cain – Willoughby Tucker, I’ll Always Love YouView image in fullscreenRomantic slowcore … Ethel Cain.Photograph: Dollie KyarnIt’s easy to see why US singer-songwriter Cain has become so adored. This album further sketches out the kind of storytelling universe that attracts footnote-writing fandoms: it’s a prequel to the events of her debut album Preacher’s Daughter, deepening the tale of Ethel and a cast of young peers as they fumble towards connection and understanding. Her moody, romantic slowcore is also perfect music for listening to on headphones as you walk around boring suburban streets wishing you could leave for bigger things. It’s also great for road trips: songs between five and 15 minutes that seem to make a long, slow blur of the pell-mell world outside.BBT37Olivia Dean – The Art of LovingThe British breakthrough of the year, as Dean – already doing decent business with her pleasant but rather neat debut Messy – reached a completely new level of songcraft. Bossa nova, folk and soul (classic and neo) are warmed together with beautiful production, evaporating any sense of pastiche to make a sound that’s both easy on the ear but distinctly Dean’s. Every song has a superb top line, Dean stretching them into loose jazzy shapes (Let Alone the One You Love, Lady Lady) or tightening them into brisk pop (Man I Need, Something Inbetween). But it’s the lyrics that make these songs so red-blooded: every stage of love, from the first flutter of flirtation to the adrenal shock of rejection, is made so true to life.BBT36Anna von Hausswolff – IconoclastsView image in fullscreenSense of awe … Anna von Hausswolff.Photograph: Philip SvenssonAnna von Hausswolff is no stranger to a monumental statement: her primary instrument is the pipe organ,a towering edifice of tin and arsenicthat offers her an ever-renewing sense of awe. But the Swedish composer’s sixth album goes bigger than ever, grappling with mortality, transcendence and evil in a series of stormy epics that also lash a little pop structure to her prow. “Oh, I’m breaking up with language / Oh, in search of something bigger than this,” she screams on Stardust, an exhilarating co-pilot on the path to absolution.LS35Bon Iver – Sable, FableIf, as Justin Vernon recently suggested, this is the last ever Bon Iver album, it’s a beautiful redemption arc: a loving send-up of his anxious, myopic sad-sack self blossoms into a radiant appreciation of possibility, sensuality, risk. Everything Is Peaceful Love has one of the year’s best refrains: “Damn if I’m not climbing up a tree right now!”, giddy with thrill and absolutely no idea of what to do when you get up there other than enjoy the view. And while there are gorgeously passionate songs here, it’s the ones about gracefully letting go of an unviable love that really underscore the admirable humility in Vernon’s bowing out.LS34Snocaps – SnocapsKatie Crutchfield’s full-throated transformation into country doyenne on her last couple of albums as Waxahatchee almost makes it easy to forget her indie-rock origins. Fourteen years since she and twin sister Allison wound down their teen band PS Eliot, the DIY stalwarts got back together – with a little help from MJ Lenderman and producer Brad Cook – and went back to brass tacks for their surprise album as Snocaps. What a treat it was: full of punchy indignation – “I could never just …coast!” they exclaim on Coast – crunchy ruminations and sing-songy contemplations of what it means to depend on and grow alongside one another. You’d follow them anywhere.LS33Amaarae – Black StarView image in fullscreenIrrepressible … Amaarae.Photograph: Salomé Gomis-TreziseWe all need an Amaarae in our lives: the person who, when you weakly protest that you’re a bit tired to go out, will soon have you holding a bottle of decanted rum in the back of an Uber, while alongside you she looks quizzically at a series of resealable plastic bags. “Ketamine, coke and molly,” she chants on Starkilla; “I spiked this drink so please open your mouth,” she tells her lover on Fineshyt. And this club-ready album from the irrepressible Ghanaian-American pop star ends up being a sensual body high, as she chases sex and glamour into the ends of the night.BBT32Perfume Genius – GloryWith typical grace and humour Mike Hadreas sends up his self-defeating tendencies on his seventh album, and wonders how old you have to be to escape those lifelong patterns: like the contradiction of struggling to face the world while also fantasising about violence and romanticising “all the poems I’ll get out” of it. It feels apt that Glory starts with the western twang of It’s a Mirror, suggesting a fixed, brawny masculine archetype – then breaks it down over the course of the record, a gothic, celestial voyage into the interior, and the latest addition to a uniquely beautiful American songbook.LS31Horsegirl – Phonetics On and OnView image in fullscreenFinely tuned … Horsegirl.Photograph: Ruby FayeSpindly rock à la the Velvets and the Raincoats is as spartan in its constituent parts as it is high on reward, and Chicago trio Horsegirl demonstrated the inexhaustible pleasures of this 60-year-old form on their second album. With production from Cate Le Bon, they wove magic from just a few thrumming guitar and bass notes and Nora Cheng’s nonchalant, near-spoken vocals, as well as a knack for melodic hooks as finely turned as intricate woodwork: the bittersweet, skipping chorus of Information Content is an all-timer.LS30-21 coming soonCome back tomorrow for the next 10 albums in the countdown!

As she reached for the overhead locker the basket overturned, spilling the contents on her neighbour. He turned out to be the chief executive of Hermès, the French luxury goods company, and immediately offered to make her a bag with internal pockets and a secure closure. Birkin sketched what she wanted on a sick bag and “The Birkin” was born: a slouchy trapezoid in finest leather complete with its own little padlock. These days a Birkin bag starts at around £10,000 while the original, made for Birkin herself, was auctioned this summer for £7.4m.It is a tale that gets endlessly repeated thanks to its neat compression of the main beats of the Jane Birkin story. First, there’s the insouciance, the fact that the Anglo-French singer and actor never seemed to go after anything; rather, it came to her. Then there’s her lack of mortification at having her whole life upended on a strange man’s lap, nappies and all. Finally, there’s her refusal to feel overawed by her bounty. Birkin famously did not treat her Hermès bag with especial reverence, enthusiastically festooning it with charms, beads, stickers and ribbons. The trend for personalising your handbag with bits of tat was ubiquitous this summer, part of a wider revival of the Birkin aesthetic, comprising flared mid-wash jeans, peasanty cheesecloth blouses and ballet flats. You couldn’t avoid it if you tried.Gainsbourg was a famous soap-dodgerAll of which is to say that Marisa Meltzer’s biography of Birkin doesn’t really break new ground. Meltzer, a journalist who has previously written books on the founder of Weight Watchers and the millennial cosmetics company Glossier, has not persuaded any of Birkin’s friends or family to talk. (It says much for the affection and loyalty in which Birkin is held that, two years after her death at the age of 76, her inner circle remains tight-lipped.) So instead, Meltzer has trawled through the thousands of profiles and interviews published since 1969, the year when Birkin broke through with Je T’aime … Moi Non Plus, the orgasmic pop song that made her “world famous in three minutes” according to one Swiss magazine. In addition, she draws on Birkin’s published diaries that cover the period 1957 to 2013.The result is a brisk account of how the future star walked out of her Isle of Wight boarding school at 16, discovered that her tall, thin, androgynous look was just right for the 1960s and started getting small acting parts. By the age of 21 she had appeared naked in Antonioni’sBlow-Up, been seduced by the film composer John Barry, got pregnant and split up.It is when Birkin made it to Paris in 1967 that her story properly began. She auditioned for a part in a film starring a man she thought was called “Serge Bourguignon”, fell in love and moved to Paris to be with him. Serge “Bourguignon” Gainsbourg sounds ghastly, not least because of his need, despite already being 40, toépater le bourgeoisat every opportunity. This tendency reached its climax when Je T’aime … Moi Non Plus was condemned by the papacy and banned by the BBC. Naturally, he was thrilled.Birkin’s 12 years with Gainsbourg sound like a piece of deranged performance art. People got used to seeing them in drunken fights at Brasserie Lipp, and Gainsbourg took to carrying a gun which he swore he would use on anyone who made eyes at her. Birkin in turn registered her despair by jumping into the Seine before thinking better of it and scrambling out dripping wet (she was annoyed that her Yves Saint Laurent blouse permanently shrank). It is a relief for the reader, let alone Birkin, when she finally manages to wriggle free and set up home with film director Jacques Doillon, who is no less controlling, but at least takes showers (Gainsbourg was a famous soap-dodger).Jane Birkin’s original Hermès handbag sells for record €8.6m at Paris auctionRead moreMeltzer shows herself to be careless with details and ignorant of the wider cultural background. She describes Roman Polanski as “Polish-born”, despite Paris being his birthplace, and suggests that the city is home to several “cathedrals”. More forgivable, perhaps, is her insistence that Jane Birkin was a major creative force in music and theatre in the late 20th century.She really wasn’t, which is why Birkin’s continuing appeal to both women and men remains so intriguing. Although she was still scheduling concerts at the time of her death, audiences weren’t flocking to hear Birkin sing so much as soak up her essence. And it is the precise nature of that essence that resists parsing. She was romantic yet raunchy, British yet French, an idealised woman yet a self-described “garçonne”. Jane Birkin contained multitudes, and until we have an account that dives deeper than this one, she will remain tantalisingly elusive.It Girl: The Life and Legacy of Jane Birkin by Marisa Meltzer is published by Atria (£20).

In PD Ouspensky’s 1915 novel Strange Life of Ivan Osokin, the feckless Osokin is given the chance to live his life over again, only to find himself making all the same mistakes. Like Groundhog Day’s insufferable Phil Connors, Osokin can change nothing without changing himself.Solvej Balle’s much-lauded series On the Calculation of Volume takes a very different approach. She first began working on the idea decades ago, several years before Groundhog Day was released. The film, she says, “helped me with research by trying out some of the roads I did not want to take”. The books, five so far with two more planned, have proved a literary sensation in her native Denmark, with the first three volumes together scooping the 2022 Nordic Council Literature prize, the highest literary honour in Scandinavia. This is the third to be published in English this year; the first wasshortlisted for the 2025 International Booker prize.Balle’s protagonist, Tara Selter, is an antiquarian book dealer from a small town in France who, on a buying trip to Paris, finds herself trapped in 18 November. For everyone else, as morning comes and the day resets, it is 18 November for the first time. They perform the same actions in the same order, unaware of any repetition. Only Tara remembers the November 18ths that have gone before. She counts the days and tries to grasp the bafflingly inconsistent rules of her new reality. Some possessions she acquires stay with her when the day repeats itself, while others return to wherever they came from. She herself can travel: she is trapped in time but not in space. She can interact with people, too, changing the events of their day. The problem is that, as 18 November loops round again, they remember nothing.Balle spins a profound meditation on love, loneliness, human consumption and everyday lifeIn Volume I, Tara returns home from Paris to her partner, Thomas. She tries to enlist his help but the ordeal of explaining anew every morning exhausts her and she moves into the spare room, haunting his day invisibly, like a ghost. In Volume II, hungry for seasons, she traverses Europe, north to south, seeking the ordinary shape of a year in a single repeated day. It is only at the start of Volume III that she finally detects a break in the pattern. “I have met someone who remembers,” she announces, giddy with grateful incredulity.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

For 1,143 days, Tara’s journals have been her “sole witness, [her] confidant”. Now she has Henry; not a friend exactly but a fellow traveller. Before long they meet another couple who share their predicament. The four find themselves suddenly defined by one another, and the different ways they have chosen to respond to their situation. Which is most reasonable, most ethical, mostcorrect? They struggle to agree. Should they use their foreknowledge to prevent the accidents and disasters that repeatedly occur on 18 November? Or should they – could they – change the systems that make accidents inevitable? Is it enough to pay meticulous attention, to try to understand what repetition reveals about the world? How should they structure their shared lives now that they are four?Volume III is more digressive than its predecessors, more freighted with history and philosophy. It is also looser, opening its sealed spaces to more air and light. For all her sensitivity and fierce intelligence, Balle’s Tara is a disconcertingly disembodied creation: indifferent to food and, after Thomas, untroubled by sexual appetite, she never once in three volumes alludes to her period, surely for a woman in her 30s a definitive marker of time. She is also dispiritingly disinclined to make jokes.But as her focus widens, Balle introduces some welcome flashes of humour while sustaining the compulsively hypnotic effect of the first two books. And they are compulsive, there can be no doubt about that. Three volumes in, Balle’s piercing attentiveness and her forensic curiosity continue to render 18 November endlessly interesting. From a continuously looping span of 24 ordinary hours, she spins a profound meditation on love and loneliness, on grief and hope and longing, on the rapacity of human consumption and the ordinary, unthinking mundanity of everyday life, on how we understand the past and anticipate the future. Her sinuous sentences wrap themselves around us, her readers, binding us over and over to 18 November, drawing us deeper and deeper into its ungraspable possibilities. By this third volume, the day no longer belongs exclusively to Tara. It belongs to her three companions – and to us.Five of the best translated fiction of 2025Read moreIn Groundhog Day and indeed in Strange Life of Ivan Osokin, the story draws its propulsive momentum from the protagonist’s search for an escape. Somewhere, within them or without, is a key that will unlock time and set them free. Tara Selter no longer believes in freedom. She knows she will never escape. But what she learns from her November 18ths, and what other people teach her, adds up to its own lifetime.On the Calculation of Volume III by Solvej Balle, translated by Sophia Hersi Smith and Jennifer Russell, is published by Faber (£12.99).

The idea that cynics are somehow more astute is the first of many notions demolished in this succinct, uplifting book.Cynics perform less well in cognitive tests and “have a harder time spotting liars than non-cynics”. They are wrong more often than optimists, and the damage to their wellbeing, and to society, is higher than that incurred by their hopeful counterparts. Like an autoimmune disease, what starts out as a misguided defensive reaction ends up causing self-harm. (Zaki is careful early on to distinguish between “big-c” Cynics of the ancient philosophical tradition, and the cynicism “most of us know today” – which can be summarised as a lack of faith in our fellow humans.)Cynicism is bad for us on several levels. Cynics are sicker, more depressed, drink more and die younger than their less cynical counterparts. On a societal level, “study after study finds that cynical beliefs eat away at relationships, communities, economies, and society itself”. Conversely, people who live in high-trust communities are longer-lived, healthier and happier – benefits Zaki translates into the equivalent of a 40% pay rise. And yet, over a 50-year period, cynicism has risen dramatically. The proportion of Americans agreeing that “most people can be trusted” fell by 20% between 1972 and 2018. Zaki’s data focuses on the US, but his findings can certainly be applied more widely.Farrah Jarral£9.89 (RRP £10.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseTerrorismHarrowing account of the Paris attacks trialV13Emmanuel CarrèreV13Emmanuel CarrèreHarrowing account of the Paris attacks trialIn the early evening of 12 November 2015, three cars left Charleroi in Belgium, arriving a few hours later at a rented house in the northern suburbs of Paris. The occupants of the cars – or “the death convoy”, as they called it – were Islamic State terrorists who, the following night, rampaged through the French capital. Three attacked the Stade de France, where a football friendly between France and Germany was being played. Arriving late, they were denied entry to the stadium and blew themselves up outside.At the same time, another group opened fire on cafes and bars in the city centre. Two members fled, while another walked into a restaurant and detonated his suicide vest. Meanwhile, the remaining trio entered the Bataclan theatre, where a crowd of 1,500 were attending a gig by the US rock band Eagles of Death Metal. The attack and subsequent siege lasted two and a half hours and ended with all three terrorists dead. Across the city, 130 people had been murdered and hundreds more injured.Five years later, in the autumn of 2020, on the eve of publishing his new book, Yoga, and reeling from a difficult few years – mental illness, divorce, legal battles – Emmanuel Carrère was hunting for a subject. The author, who wrote fiction before branching into true crime, unconventional biographies and a string of extraordinary, deeply exposing memoirs, making him one of France’s most highly regarded writers, contacted an editor at the news magazine Le Nouvel Obs putting himself forward for work – “You know the kind of stuff I’m comfortable with: less opinion pieces than fieldwork, maybe a criminal case.”What the editors of Le Nouvel Obs eventually decided on wasn’t just any criminal case, but the largest in French history: the trial of those accused of involvement in the Paris terror attacks of 13 November 2015 (Friday, or vendredi, 13: V13). Carrère’s task was to show up, observe and file a weekly piece, and this book (translated from French by John Lambert) is the result. The challenge posed by a trial as inherently dramatic as V13 isn’t how to render it interesting, but how to traverse its morass of detail and sometimes contradictory defence testimony. The skill with which he does so is extraordinary.Chris Power£9.89 (RRP £10.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseBiographyLessons in chemistryThe Elements of Marie CurieDava SobelThe Elements of Marie CurieDava SobelLessons in chemistryTo write a biography of a figure as well known as Marie Curie and still offer something fresh or surprising is no easy undertaking. The double Nobel prizewinner is, as author Dava Sobel acknowledges, the only female scientist most people can name.To help shed new light on such an iconic figure, Sobel, a bestselling writer of science histories, has interwoven her account of Curie’s life and scientific discoveries with those of dozens of female scientists who passed through her lab in Paris.Alongside all the firsts – Curie was the first woman to win a Nobel prize and remains the only person to win Nobel prizes in two different scientific fields – she was also a devoted mother and carer for ageing relatives. She experienced the grief of miscarriage, and then in 1906 the earth-shattering loss of her beloved husband, Pierre, in a carriage accident. A few years later, she had an affair with the married physicist Paul Langevin that became a public scandal and virtually forced her into hiding. She lived through the first world war, when she led efforts to bring X-ray units closer to the battlefield to treat wounded soldiers, and drove one such voiture radiologique herself. She lectured far and wide and befriended many great scientists of her time, including Albert Einstein. There is, in other words, much to cover before you even consider the women whose paths briefly crossed with Curie’s until their work or life took them in other directions.Sobel does an excellent job of helping the reader to understand the historical importance and context of Curie’s work, but her interior life remains largely mysterious. I found myself itching to consult other sources – her collected letters to her daughters, her mourning journal, the biography written by one of her daughters, Ève – in order to fill in the gaps.Sophie McBain£9.89 (RRP £10.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseMemoirBlur reunitedOver the RainbowAlex JamesOver the RainbowAlex JamesBlur reunitedIn 2023, Blur played the biggest shows in their history over two weekend nights at Wembley Stadium. For Damon Albarn, Graham Coxon, Alex James and Dave Rowntree, it was a signal moment in an objectively great band’s history.Over the Rainbow is less the story of a rock band reconvening for one final(ish) weekend of triumph than a 180-page insight into the joyfully chaotic life of Blur’s food-obsessed bassist. James has written two other memoirs: the first, Bit of a Blur, told the raucous story of 90s excess, the second, All Cheeses Great and Small: A Life Less Blurry, the less-raucous tale of swapping life in London for a rambling farm in the Cotswolds. Over the Rainbow is a mixture of these two strands: the story of trying to balance the demands of running a farm, and the festival that takes place there, with a return to stadium rock’s frontline.He is an underrated musician, but don’t expect tracts on the merits of the Fender Precision bass: his passions are of the edible sort. There’s probably more in Over the Rainbow on the merits of broth, crisps, cheese on toast and cider. And there’s less than you might expect on the relationships between the members of the band.That’s a shame because, as interesting as the story of the English sparkling wine James has sourced for his festival is, it wouldn’t hurt to have a bit more on the mechanics of the reunion. There are some touching moments in To the End, when relations between James and Albarn tentatively thaw over a pint near Albarn’s home studio in south Devon. Here, the only hint at complex dynamics comes at a show in Mexico City, during which Albarn won’t even make eye contact with his bass player. James is crestfallen until he discovers that the singer is actually just trying hard to fend off a bout of food poisoning.James is an entertaining narrator. You might not learn much about rock’n’roll while reading Over the Rainbow, but you’ll probably have a fine old time while doing so.Will Dean£9.34 (RRP £10.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseMysteryA corpse at ChristmasEveryone This Christmas Has a SecretBenjamin StevensonEveryone This Christmas Has a SecretBenjamin StevensonA corpse at ChristmasBenjamin Stevenson is unashamedly tapping into the demand for festive mysteries with his latest novel, Everyone This Christmas Has a Secret. His series character Ernest Cunningham – not a detective, just a regular guy who keeps solving murders – starts by thanking the “literary god [who] had the foresight to drop a corpse at my feet at Christmas time”, and then reminds “the cynics out there” that even the likes of Agatha Christie and Arthur Conan Doyle “aren’t immune to a little yuletide cash grab”. Duly warned, there’s lots to enjoy: Ernest is called to Katoomba, a small town in Australia’s Blue Mountains, by his ex-wife Erin, who has been arrested for the murder of her new partner, Lyle. Only problem is, he’s got to keep it secret from his fiancee, Juliette, who won’t be delighted to learn he’s at Erin’s beck and call. Once Ernest is up in Katoomba, attending a magic show (it does make sense in the context of this particular murder), you guessed it: more bodies start to stack up. This is light and fun, if you don’t mind the archly knowing air of it all; the sort of thing to pop in the stocking of your fellow mystery fan on Christmas Day. Which I’m sure is exactly what Stevenson intended.Alison Flood£8.99 (RRP £9.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseMemoirFamily burn book dishes on DonaldWho Could Ever Love YouMary TrumpWho Could Ever Love YouMary TrumpFamily burn book dishes on DonaldOnce again, Mary Trump strafes her family, with her third book in four years. Who Could Ever Love You presents the Trump name as both cocoon and nightmare. Dysfunction reigns. Think of it as a burn book. All get singed.At times, Trump wishes Trump was not her surname. But she won’t abandon the legacy. She has delivered two bestsellers – Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World’s Most Dangerous Man and The Reckoning: America’s Trauma and Finding a Way to Heal. Her third book also follows All in the Family: The Trumps and How We Got This Way, a memoir by Fred C Trump III, Mary’s older brother, now estranged.Their home life sounds brutal – Linda Clapp, their mother, straight out of Mommy Dearest. Mary portrays her as cruelly oblivious. She repeatedly refused to bring young Mary to the hospital during late-night asthma attacks. Instead, she plunked Mary into her own bed.Mary’s father, Fred Trump Jr, neglected his kids. When he was around, he wasn’t present. He hit the bottle, divorced Clapp and died young. Mary loved him anyway. But his own father, Fred Trump Sr, repeatedly trampled his son, despising him for who he was and what he wasn’t. The elder Trump came to disinherit Fred Jr and his “issue”, at the urging of his surviving children, the next oldest boy, Donald Trump, among them. Think The Apprentice or Family Feud, crossed with Lord of the Flies.Predictably, Mary dishes on Uncle Donald. Her animus runs long and deep, back to grade school days. He bullied her, equating cruelty with attention. Little has changed.Mary writes: “It didn’t take me long to realize that Donald couldn’t do much more than throw a baseball, which he did, as hard as he could at his nieces and nephews, who were all under ten.”Trump pitched hard and wild, she writes, rarely meeting the strike zone. On the rare occasions when he connected with her mitt, her eight-year-old hand shuddered.The epilogue is more upbeat. Mary describes a winter evening in New York. “The lights of the city – my city – shone behind me. There is no way to know if a chance for redemption or even forgiveness exists anymore, but in that moment, I felt the world opening up again.”Lloyd Green£15.29 (RRP £16.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseHistoryDebunking misogynist myths of ancient RomeUnfortunately, She Was a NymphomaniacJoan SmithUnfortunately, She Was a NymphomaniacJoan SmithDebunking misogynist myths of ancient RomeJoan Smith is braver than I am. A classicist, as well as a feminist campaigner, she describes pulling up a male guide in Rome’s Palazzo Massimo on his description of one of the women of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. “It’s in the sources,” he protested, to which Smith replied, possibly with an eye-roll, that she was familiar with them. His belittling phrase provides the title for her book.There was a chapter on ancient Rome in her 1989 classic, Misogynies, but the impetus for a full-blown study came from the British Museum’s Nero exhibition in 2021, which aimed “to question the traditional narrative of the ruthless tyrant, revealing a different Nero, a popular leader”. This revisionism, Smith proposes, is rarely if ever extended to the wives, sisters, daughters and mothers of the emperors, perennially depicted as shrews, scheming bitches or lust-crazed she-wolves. Accordingly, she sets out to tell alternative stories of 23 Roman noblewomen.Smith takes aim at modern historians (not all of them male) who unthinkingly repeat ancient slanders, and rereads the sources with an eye to misogynist tropes. Her most stirring and contentious strategy is to relate the misdeeds of the Roman emperors to contemporary crimes, to indicate just how little has changed. Thus the fate of Claudius’s much younger wife Messalina, her name for centuries a byword for lust, is linked to the scandal of grooming gangs. Nero’s alleged sexual interest in his mother, Agrippina, leads Smith to observe that “mother-son incest” is a common internet search, and his matricide brings to mind the Sandy Hook killer’s first victim. Nero’s habit of throttling his wife, Octavia, meanwhile, is a sinister echo of the “rough sex” murder defence. “You don’t have to be a Roman emperor to get away with terrifying women,” Smith drily observes.Daisy Dunn’s recent The Missing Thread, which aimed to restore women’s place in a traditionally male-centred account of the ancient world, is considerably more measured in its pages on imperial Rome. Where Smith’s Claudius is indifferent to his wife Messalina’s murder, to Dunn he’s “in denial”. Dunn has Julia the Elder dying “probably of starvation”; Smith makes no such caveat. Sources can be read in vastly different ways. Still, on this impassioned reading, the “nymphomaniac” slur can confidently be put to bed.Suzi Feay£9.89 (RRP £10.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseConservationHidden gemsMyself and Other AnimalsGerald DurrellMyself and Other AnimalsGerald DurrellHidden gems“Gerald Durrell was magic” chirrups David Attenborough across the cover of this collection by the beloved naturalist and author who died in 1995. Chosen by Durrell’s widow to mark his centenary, it includes magazine pieces, radio talks, letters, introductions to other people’s books and a selection from the vast archive of his unpublished writing. What binds the pieces is the signature magic of which Attenborough, whose own career parallels and counterpoints Durrell’s, speaks. It might best be described as the gift of finding wonder everywhere.Durrell’s most famous book remains My Family and Other Animals (1956) and for those who can’t get enough of it, there’s a chance here to revisit the strawberry-pink villa, with its garden of sun-drunk wildlife and the ebullient Spiro, taxi-driver turned major-domo who watches over the Durrells fondly, “as though we were slightly weak-minded children”. Theo is here too, the polymathic scientist who presents Gerry with his first pocket microscope so that the boy-naturalist may peer with even more concentrated wonder into the exquisite silk-lined burrows of the trapdoor spiders that are dotted all over his new island home.In his conservation and writing work, Durrell made a point of concentrating on “the little brown jobs”, those unglamorous species whom no one would miss until it was far too late. Creatures like the cleaner fish of the Great Barrier Reef, which scurries around hoovering parasites from larger fish before “standing back to admire their handiwork rather like hairdressers admiring the creation of a new hairstyle”. Or what about the big Madagascar hissing cockroach, “a beast the size of a small tangerine, with a formidable array of spikes and spines on his chocolate brown body and legs”, which, when captured, purrs loudly. The list of these underrated creatures unspools delightfully. There is the hairy frog, the booming squirrel, the umbrellabird, the paradoxical frog and the (frankly irresistible) fairy penguin, which brays like a donkey. Truly, there is magic here.Kathryn Hughes£10.79 (RRP £11.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreClose"

The originalTony Hawk’s Pro Skatertitles were anarchic, arcade fun while the recent return of EA’s belovedSkate franchiseoffered competent yet jarringly corporate realism. Skate Story, which is mostly the work of solo developer Sam Eng, offers a more impressionistic interpretation while capturing something of the sport’s essential spirit. It transposes the boarding action to a demonic underworld where the aesthetic is less fire and brimstone than glittering, 2010s-era vaporwave. It is also the most emotionally real a skateboarding game has ever felt.The premise is ingenious: you are a demon made out of “pain and glass”. Skate to the moon and swallow it, says the devil, and you shall be freed. So that is exactly what you do. You learn to ollie first, a “delicate, precise trick” according to the artfully written in-game text. Then come the pop shuvit, kickflip, heelflip and more.View image in fullscreenCaptures the spirit of skateboarding … Skate Story.Photograph: Devolver DigitalThe controls are easy: one button to ollie. If you’re holding down a shoulder button at the same time, you perform a more involved trick. Beyond the ravishing visuals, what’s most striking is the exquisite fluidity, the delicious “gamefeel”, of the actual skateboarding: the way the knees of this glittering demon bend just the right amount after landing a trick; the way you can see their foot stretching out across the top end of the board in order to apply just the right force that will cause it to flip.The vaporwave aesthetic is not Skate Story’s only bold design choice. You will fall many times on the ghoulish asphalt and when you do the action cuts to first-person, causing you to see the world tumbling for what feels like a tormenting eternity. Along the way, you meet a bizarre cast of characters: a mystical rabbit, a pigeon trying to type a screenplay, and a ghost hanging out in a launderette.View image in fullscreenReal emotions … Skate Story.Photograph: Devolver DigitalThe game’s action can be divided into two types: narrow, linear tunnels that you hurtle through at breakneck speed, and wide-open sandbox levels. The former are furious, momentum-filled thrill rides that demand utmost precision; the latter, set in nightmarish, nocturnal visions of New York, feature many offbeat objectives, such as chasing spooky laundry. In these levels, there is ample room to enjoy the deceptively deep skating mechanics.Gradually, a melancholy surfaces in this crystalline universe. Of course, the skateboarder wants to be free of the underworld, but they also seem enraptured by the idea of devouring these moons. As you thread together tricks with manuals and grinds, scoring ever-larger combos, all as a brilliantly downbeat electro soundtrack chimes away, questions arise. Why is this skateboarder so hungry? Why do they seek pain? In some ways, we’re reminded of the physical risks of skateboarding in real life.These questions – and the sadness buried within their answers – distinguish Skate Story from its traditionally zany video game counterparts. Rather, Eng’s gently emotive work is more in touch with the likes of acclaimed documentaryMinding the Gapand Jonah Hill’s movieMid90s.The result is a skateboarding game of rare poetry. There is the poetry of the skating itself, the miraculous interplay of body and board rendered with aplomb. There is the actual poetry that accompanies the end of each level. Finally, there are the tender emotions that refract through, and seem amplified by every bailed kickflip in this surreal, shimmering take on hell.Skate Story is out now, £17.99Explore more on these topicsGamesNintendo Switch 2PlayStation 5PCreviewsShareReuse this content"

Me neither. But an incongruous dinosaur sidekick is just one of the wonderfully silly additions to this take on the fairytale, along with a daft classroom routine, some capering ghouls and a regiment of toy soldiers come to life.Now in the fifth year of its current formula, helmed by panto veteran Paul Hendy as writer-producer, the YorkTheatreRoyal’s festive offering feels solidly bedded in. It’s reliably crowd-pleasing and family-friendly, with a string of familiar set pieces to delight those who come back year after year. We know there will be the slop scene, the ghost bench, the pun-packed comedy routine, the pre-interval spectacle. Part of the joy is in waiting for these moments and wondering what new twist will be put on them.View image in fullscreenWicked … Jocasta Almgill as Carabosse.Photograph: Pamela RaithThe secret ingredient is Theatre Royal favourite Robin Simpson as the dame – in this case, Princess Aurora’s thrice-widowed protector Nurse Nellie. While some of the show’s jokes about things going wrong feel rather too rehearsed, there’s always an unpredictable twinkle in Simpson’s eye and he’s at his best when riffing on genuine slip-ups. This year’s usual bit of audience interaction with a male spectator who catches the dame’s eye lands with a particularly brilliant gag, leaving cast as well as audience gasping for breath between laughs.There’s strong supporting work from returning Tommy Carmichael in the Buttons-style role of Jangles, as well as an entertaining double act from CBeebies’ Jennie Dale and seasoned musical theatre performer Jocasta Almgill as the good and bad fairies respectively. But what’s slightly lost in this offering – aside from a cursory sprinkling of easy cracks at Hull and Nigel Farage – is the distinctive local and topical flavour of pantomime at its best.At York Theatre Royal until 4 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsPanto seasonTheatreComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)reviewsShareReuse this content"

Tristan und Isolde, Tchaikovsky’s First Piano Concerto and Beethoven’s Ninth were all once declared beyond reach. But whenBarbara Hannigan– the fearless, seemingly limitless soprano with more than 100 world premieres to her name – admits that a work came close,reducing her to “a state of panic”over a multi-year study period, you believe her.Inspired by Finland’s national epic the Kalevala,John Zorn’s Jumalattaretis less a song-cycle than a musical seance, summoning a series of spirits and goddesses in sound. The singer morphs from persona to persona in yelps and keening cries, guttural moans and shouts, sometimes anchored, sometimes released by the piano (here Bertrand Chamayou) – an ever-present sorcerer’s assistant.On the page it sounds like a novelty, a circus-act for high-wire soloists, but in Hannigan’s delivery it was strange musical magic: lyrical, primal, ravishingly beautiful. Zorn’s 2012 score gathers up armfuls of musical history – folksongs and rock grooves, plainchant and jazz’s scat singing – before shattering them into glittering sonic fragments. The close conspiracy between Chamayou’s percussive piano and Hannigan’s freewheeling vocals made for exhilarating listening; you marvelled at sounds not feats, even if the latter were monumental.What do you programme alongside this kind of musical singularity? Messiaen’s 1938 Chants de Terre et de Ciel – the second of only three large-scale works by the composer for voice and piano – shares the spiritual ecstasy of the Zorn, answering its eternal feminine with the sternly masculine God of Catholicism. It’s home-territory for both Chamayou, whose piano seems to speak with French vowels, and Hannigan, who caressed Messiaen’s texts with almost indecent intimacy, rolling them around in her mouth, letting them move through her gently swaying body.Together they took the capacity crowd (who else could sell out this repertoire on a Saturday night, or hold them so rapt?) into their confidence, exposing the intimacy rather than the musical extremity of a cycle that celebrates the birth of the composer’s son. Hannigan’s uncanny ability to reinvent not just her sound but her physicality persisted here – now playful, chattering innocence for Danse du Bébé-Pilule, now infinitely tender in love-song Bail avec Mi. The long silence after the pealing finale Résurrection said more than the standing ovation that followed. Applause is for a performance; this was something closer to a confession.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

Tarantino said he would have moved Paul Thomas Anderson’s 2007 drama higher than No 5 had a different actor played preacher Eli Sunday.“There Will Be Blood would stand a good chance at being No 1 or 2 if it didn’t have a big, giant flaw in it … and the flaw is Paul Dano,” said Tarantino.“Obviously, it’s supposed to be a two-hander, but it’s also drastically obvious that it’s not a two-hander. [Dano] is weak sauce, man. He is the weak sister. Austin Butler would have been wonderful in that role. He’s just such a weak, weak, uninteresting guy.

It’s a sequence depicting the desire to overcome the forces that seek to limit and constrain which lay at the heart of the director Henrik Malyan’s new wave critique.Or, as Malyan says in an unearthed interview that forms part of Stepanyan’s archival exploration: “It is about the fake and real concept of love … and without trying to sound pathetic, our film is about freedom.”View image in fullscreenTamara Stepanyan in a still from Khagher, a 1990 Soviet short film by Edgar Baghdasaryan, that features in My Armenian Phantoms.Photograph: Courtesy: Armenian Film SocietyFreedom, and what that entails for both the landlocked republic of Armenia and its large diaspora, has come into sharper focus against this decade’s backdrop of war, displacement and conflicts over sovereignty and identity.It is estimated that there are around three times more ethnic Armenians living outside the country than within it – a factor that has given rise to the idea of “stateless power” linked to a region that is increasingly the site ofgeopolitical tensionsbetween the US, Russia and Iran.Sossie Kasbarian, a senior lecturer in politics at the University of Stirling, says: “The diaspora can act as a complement to the nation state, and as a dynamic site of (trans)national identity and culture.“The experience of being Armenian in the republic, and being Armenian in the post-genocide western diaspora are two distinct historical experiences, and their cultural production will reflect that.”One such reflection is My Armenian Phantoms – an audiovisual journey through the works produced by her country’s lost pantheon of cinematic pioneers, prompted by the passing of the director’s father, the actor Vigen Stepanyan, in 2021. Through the nostalgic collage of personal archives and Soviet-era film, Tamara reflects on the state of a national cinema “organically linked to a political, social and cultural universe that has now disappeared”.View image in fullscreenJoy and exile … Monsieur Aznavour.Photograph: Courtesy: Armenian Film SocietyThe documentary, which is Armenia’s entry for the best international feature category at the Oscars in March, had its UK premiere during the Armenian film festival inLondonlast week.Returning for a second year, the festival – which ran from 4 to 7 December at the ICA – opened with the biopic, Monsieur Aznavour, featuring a performance by Tahar Rahim cast in the leading role as the iconic French Armenian singer-songwriter Charles Aznavour.View image in fullscreenNew wave …  Kira Adibekov and Tatevik Ayvazyan.Photograph: Garo BerberianAlso premiering was Eric Nazarian’s Die Like a Man, set in working-class Los Angeles and shot in a fortnight using a cast of mostly untrained actors – many of whom were Angelenos affected by the carceral state. The film serves as an example of what Kasbarian describes as “Armenian communities [being] part of the fabric of each of their societies and [sharing] all their concerns”.This year, the four-day event secured BFI funding for the first time and is fast establishing itself among the UK’s Armenian community. Concentrated in London and Manchester, they form part of a global diaspora that shares the scarring memories of repression, displacement and genocide.Tatevik Ayvazyan, one of the festival’s organisers and a member of the Armenian Film Society, says that “for a small, fragmented community, it was heartening and very rewarding to see how much the festival resonated and how well we did in the first year”.Regarding the history of migration that has shaped the diaspora in Britain, Ayvazyan says: “The Armenian community in the UK came in waves. The first, most significant wave to Manchester [were] escaping the Hamidian massacres, which were the precursor tothe Armenian genocide.“They came from Cyprus, from Iran after the revolution, from Iraq after the war, from the Soviet Union after the break-up. There is a horrific amount of baggage, from genocide, from displacement.“Somebody would come to me and ask: ‘Can we have more comedies?’”In the opening scene of Monsieur Aznavour, a young Charles watches, claps and participates in a community gathering. There’s music and dance, but interspersed with the images of joy are glimpses of footage – reminders of what led to their exile in interwar France – showing the starvation and deportations that took place duringthe genocide that killed more than a million people between 1915 and 1922.Ayvazyan adds: “We want to have intelligent, awareness-raising art about the tragedies we have faced … [but there is also] the importance of talking about and engaging with other cultures, because stories of displacement, war and identity are not unique to us. Every war and genocide happening in the world resonates with us.”View image in fullscreenAzerbaijan’s president Ilham Aliyev, Donald Trump and the Armenian prime minister Nikol Pashinyan sign a joint declaration for a ‘Trump route’ in the Caucasus region.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesRecently, Armenia has been in a state of flux. Two years after apopular uprising in 2018ousted the old guard of Armenian politics, the country was plunged intowar with neighbouring Azerbaijanover the disputed area of Nagorno-Karabakh.Stemming from an unresolved conflict of post-Soviet borders and territories, the Armenian-majority region held a degree of autonomy within Azerbaijan as the Republic of Artsakh, until Baku sought to end its de facto independence militarily, with Turkish support.By 2023, amajor offensiveand subsequent acts of ethnic cleansing forced thousands of Armenians to flee the region for Armenia in yet another cycle of tragedy and disorientation. Hemmed in by major regional powers, there are signs that the country is pivoting further to the west in an attempt to break out of its constrained position.View image in fullscreenResonant … the Armenian film festival in London last year.Photograph: Armenian Film SocietyKira Adibekov, who worked alongside Ayvazyan to organise the film festival and is involved with a project called Tumo that provides free creative education to teenagers, says: “It is clear that Russia traded the Republic of Artsakh for a deal with Turkey and Azerbaijan.”Earlier this year, Armenia’s parliament passed a bill to begin the process of joining the EU, and in August, Donald Trump turned his attention to the region with a US-brokered peace treaty signed by Yerevan and Baku, including provisions for a “Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity” (Tripp).Although viewed as a “vague proposal”, Adibekov says that the prospect of Tripp has “brought some calm” in the region with the hope of regional communications that initiatives like the Tumo project may benefit from.Reflecting on contemporary Armenia, which will mark the 35th anniversary since its independence from the former USSR next year, Ayvazyan says “Under the shiny facade of relations with the EU, the country still needs to recover from the war and learn how to function after years of Soviet and oligarchic rule.”Explore more on these topicsFilmArmeniaEuropeLondonShareReuse this content"

It would focus on ideas and the kind of books that would enable her to combine her editorial, publishing and business experience with making a living. This meant looking out for and thinking up projects to which she could contribute, and which accorded with her political views. The agency was to have fewer authors than most – a dozen rather than several dozen – so she could give them the attention they needed.She launched her firm, Faith Evans Associates, in shared premises in Dryden Street, Covent Garden. Around this time, she was a juror in a trial in which I was the defending barrister at Knightsbridge crown court. She thought I was a good communicator as a defender of the underdog, and that if I could just translate that on to the page, then I could write.Initially I said no, but then we met by chance on Euston station when I was boiling with rage over a case that showed so clearly that the law was male – the product of male perceptions and experience – and so often failed to provide justice for women. This time I said yes: Faith took Eve Was Framed to Carmen Callil, then at Chatto & Windus, who published it with great elan in 1993.The actor Harriet Walter and the feminist historian Sheila Rowbotham are among those encouraged by Faith to add a new string to our bows. She became not only our agent but also a great friend.Other projects to come out of Dryden Street were Stolen Years (1990), the autobiography of Paul Hill, one of the Guildford Four, written with Ronan Bennett; Prisoner in Baghdad (1992) by Daphne (Dee) Parish, written with Pat Lancaster; and The Enemy Within (1994), Seumas Milne’s account of the 1984-85 miners’ strike.View image in fullscreenEvans in Ireland in 2007; a project close to her heart was Roger Mugford’s Dog Training the Mugford Way (1992)Further moves were made,in 1994 to new offices in Clerkenwell and finally, in 1998, to the upper floors in her home in Crouch End, north London. Her list included Melissa Benn, Eleanor Bron,Cleo LaineandLorna Sage, whose magnificent memoir of life on the Welsh borders, Bad Blood (2000), won the Whitbread prize for biography. Fourth Estate celebrated its 20th anniversary with a new edition.Born in Nantwich, Cheshire, but brought up in Oswestry, Shropshire, Faith was the daughter of Monica Sage (unrelated to Lorna), a dance and gym teacher, and Edgar Evans, a dentist. Her parents were interested in the arts, and Faith was involved in dance, amateur dramatics and music.From Oswestry girls’ high school she went in 1960 to Reading University, where she studied French. She also developed her interest in theatre, acting in productions of Sartre and Pirandello, often alongside the man who was to become her lifelong partner, John Stokes, later professor of modern British literature at King’s College London.On graduating in 1964, Faith went to work for the publisher John Murray in central London. After a year she moved on to become an assistant toEd Victor, a glamorous figure in the publishing house of Weidenfeld & Nicolson, then the liveliest publisher in London. There Faith learned how to make books from scratch.George Weidenfeld’s trick was to think up a big idea – Faith’s first assignment was Great Interiors – then get the in-house team to write a sample text, research illustrations, mock up a design and then persuade a famous author to come on board. The result was an irresistible package that would go to the Frankfurt book fair, and worldwide distribution would follow.Later at W&N she worked for Tony Godwin, previously of the radical retailer Better Books. He had a phenomenal instinct for spotting and shaping a book, whether literary or popular, and took a punt on Faith, getting her to edit translations ofFrançoise Sagan’s novels and the later works of Simone de Beauvoir. He also introduced her to members of the African National Congress exiled from South Africa, including Ruth First and her husband, Joe Slovo. Faith encouraged Ruth to write a biography of the South African writer Olive Schreiner (1980). Ruth became a friend, as did the anti-apartheid activist Ros de Lanerolle, who went on to run the Women’s Press.In 1972 Faith moved to André Deutsch, where, working withDiana Athilland Piers Burnett, she helped look after a diverse list that includedVS Naipaul,John Updike, Molly Keane, Jean Rhys, Timothy Mo andMarilyn French. The networking and mutual support organisation Women in Publishing came out of meetings in 1979-80, with Faith, Gail Rebuck and Helen Fraser among its founders. Dedicated imprints such as Virago and Women’s Press were making waves with books on women’s experience of the world, but mainstream houses were still dominated by men, and this was reflected in many of the publishing choices and the judgments brought to bear on writers.Efforts to alter the internal cultures of publishing caused frictions in many workplaces, and Faith left Deutsch in 1981. For the next five years she was a freelance, reviewing for the Observer and working part time with Liz Calder at Jonathan Cape, where they published the UK edition of Gloria Steinem’s Outrageous Acts and Everyday Rebellions.Faith also translated works by the Belgian writer Madeleine Bourdouxhe, bringing out their understated clarity of vision. The short story collection A Nail, A Rose (1989) and La Femme de Gilles (1992) were among her first successes as an agent. I was fortunate that Eve Was Framed was another project close to her heart in those early days, as was Roger Mugford’s Dog Training the Mugford Way (1992). Once she entered semi-retirement, she still had a considerable backlist to maintain.She is survived by John and her brother, Sam.Faith Evans, editor, translator and literary agent, born 15 June 1942; died 30 October 2025Explore more on these topicsPublishingobituariesShareReuse this content"

Mangling nominees’ names may be traditional – but it’s still embarrassingYesterday’s Golden Globes announcement was a masterclass in mispronunciation that threatens to undo every effort to internationalise awards. Why can’t producers just make their presenters practise?Stuart HeritageTue 9 Dec 2025 06.30 ESTLast modified on Tue 9 Dec 2025 06.32 ESTShareThe day after an awards show announces its nominations, the focus typically falls on the nominees. However, yesterday’s Golden Globe nominations were a little different, because all anyone can talk about is how badly the actor Marlon Wayans mangled everyone’s name.If you didn’t see it, it was a masterclass in getting it wrong. Watching Wayans announce the Golden Globe nominations was like living through one of those anxiety dreams where you’re asked to fly a jumbo jet and realise that you don’t know what any of the controls do. If you did see it, then I’m sure your toes will uncurl eventually.I won’t list every mistake – I wrote them all down and they filled a page – but it was a firework display of ostentatious mispronunciation. In Wayans’s mouth, Ludwig Göransson became “Ludwig G Ronson”. Hannah Einbinder became “Hannah Eye Bender”. Joel Edgerton became “Joel Edd Gerton”. Nouvelle Vague was pronounced to rhyme with “plague”. He accidentally called Sarah Silverman’s comedy special Postmortem “Postpartum”. He had two cracks at Renate Reinsve and got both equally wrong.Some presenters might be able front their way through something like this, but not Wayans. Every time a foreign-sounding name appeared on the Teleprompter, the fear in his voice was palpable. When he had to read the Korean names behind the KPop Demon Hunters song Golden, he was so nervous that he somehow put a question mark after all of them. He said the name Joachim Trier like he was reading the bottom line of a Snellen chart. He visibly slumped in defeat before even attempting Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas.View image in fullscreenNailed it … Marlon Wayans at the Golden Globe nominations.Photograph: Jim Ruymen/UPI/ShutterstockUnhelpfully, his co-presenter Skye P Marshall was everything he was not. During her half of the nominations, she was polished and slick, slamming through all her names like they were old friends. No wonder Wayans walked off the stage dabbing his brow.Now, to the casual observer, this probably just looked like a tough day at the office. But imagine being one of the nominees whose name Wayans mangled. Imagine having your big moment undermined by someone who was supposed to say your name properly, but just ended up making a noise like a house key in a waste disposal unit. It can’t be a great feeling, knowing that you have made it in Hollywood while not quite making it enough for anyone to learn your actual name.Which isn’t to say that this is an easy job. It isn’t, at all, especially now that awards shows have finally opened themselves up to the glorious possibilities of world cinema. Having to pronounce a long list of unfamiliar names can be daunting. Many of us would struggle with it. And many people before Marlon Wayans have done so.Most notably, there was Tiffany Haddish. After the success of her role in Girls Trip, it felt for a moment as if she could do it all. And then her hot streak ended, as she crashed, as a co-presenter with Andy Serkis, into the immovable wall of the 2018 Oscar nominations.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She messed up Luca Guadagnino so badly that she looked offstage for help. But then she had to say the name Daniel Kaluuya. First she called him “Daniel Koolyé”. Then, after her co-presenter Andy Serkis coached her on the proper pronunciation, she got it wrong again. She called him “Daniel Kahlua”. She called him “Daniel Kallelujah”. “He knows his name,” she muttered at the end, broken and humiliated.The point is that presenters shouldn’t sound as if they are being ambushed by these names. They shouldn’t swan in unprepared and attempt to coast on their charisma, however great it might be, because that approach clearly doesn’t work. These are names that need to be rehearsed and rehearsed; drilled into them by the award organisers. And it can be done. Skye P Marshall is living proof of that. They should bring her back every year.There is, of course, an exception. Don’t forget, this is the 10th anniversary of the funniest thing that has ever happened on planet Earth, which is Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences president Cheryl Boone Isaacs mispronouncing the name of lauded cinematographer Dick Pope as “Dick Poop”. Until the day I die, nothing will ever be funnier than Dick Poop. So perhaps that’s the new rule. Presenters should work hard to get the name of every nominee correct, unless they can somehow make them sound like a defecating penis, in which case God bless them.Explore more on these topicsFilmGolden GlobesAwards and prizesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It might be because wearing a full set of pyjamas seems a little twee, but choose well and a proper two-piece will not only look stylish but feel like a treat, too. If you’re not clued up on PJ brands, though,how do you know where to find your next pair?The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.That’s where I come in – I’m a menswear writer and stylist, and I’m also a big pyjama stan who has trieda lotof sets over the years – so I know a thing or two about the best men’s sleepwear.They’re not just for sleeping, either – a great pair of PJs can be worn around the house as much as in bed. So, if you want to upgrade your own loungewear or someone else’s (25 December is on the way, after all), here are the best pyjamas you can buy, as well as a few tips on how to choose the right pair.The best men’s pyjamasBest high-street pyjamasM&S Autograph striped pyjama shirt£30 at M&SStriped pyjama bottoms£30 at M&SMarks & Spencer is known for its impressive selection of men’s PJs, but my No 1 choice is this Autograph striped lyocell – a fibre derived from certified renewable wood sources – shirt-and-trousers combo. As with most of Autograph’s menswear, the quality punches far above the price point, from the smooth satiny fabric to the contrast-stripe pocket and classic curved pyjama collar. For something more reasonably priced, I also like thismosaic print set(£35) from the mainline collection.Arketflannel pyjama shirt£65 at ArketFlannel pyjama trousers£55 at ArketThis Arket pyjama set has lots of subtle design details that lean into the brand’s Scandi roots. The relaxed fit is both laid back and well-tailored, the collar is expertly cut, and the set is made from a slubby flannel – my personal preference for winter PJs because it has the cosiest finish. The neutral check only adds to the vibe.H&M lyocell pyjamaset£54.99 at H&MThis two-piece by H&M is made using smooth and breathable lyocell. The fit is perfectly relaxed, and the bottoms have a comfy drawstring waist. I also like the stylish, understated brown stripe.Zaracheckedpyjamaset£49.99 at ZaraIf you don’t love the formality of a pyjama shirt, a long-sleeved T-shirt is a great alternative. Zara’s midweight stretchy modal-blend top with checked poplin trousers keeps things coordinated with a steely blue colour palette.Best responsibly made pyjamasPangaialightweightpyjamaset£145 at PangaiaResponsible fashion brand Pangaia’s approach to fabrics includes an alternative to goose down made from wildflowers, and a fabric similar to cotton that repurposes food waste.These PJs are made with an organic cotton that’s been treated with the brand’s plant-based peppermint oil formula, to keep clothes fresher for longer, reducing the need to wash as often. I’ve had mine for years, and they can be worn for at least four nights on the trot before they feel as if they need a wash.Sustainability aside, these areexactlythe kind of pyjamas you’d want to wear in bed. They’re lightweight, soft to the touch and have a little stretch, too – which is exactly why mine are in regular rotation. And they’re finished off with the brand’s signature chest script. At £145, they’re a fairly sizable investment, but I think the quality and the sustainable details make them worth it.Sirpluscotton-wool pyjamas£195 at SirplusSirplus makes clothes using (you guessed it) surplus fabrics. What began as a single stall on London’s Portobello Road selling boxer shorts is now five stores across the capital, selling everything from tailoring to denim.Some items are made with new fabrics, but a third is still crafted from surplus – including these pyjamas, made from a blue checked cotton wool that was otherwise destined for landfill. The fabric is pleasingly soft and slubby, but it’s the little premium details – mother-of-pearl buttons, a curved hemline – that feel reallyluxurious. As a set, it’s pricey (£195), but these are top-tier quality.Chelsea Peerschequerboardpyjamaset£42 at Chelsea PeersFor something by a nightwear expert at an accessible price, try Chelsea Peers.A great option if you want pyjamas with personality – in this case, a chest pocket with contrast piping and a little champagne-holding elephant peeking over the top. The brand is also a B Corp organisation for its commitment to responsibility, from using sustainable materials to creating good working conditions for its employees and improving its overall impact on the environment.Best pyjamas by independent brandsDavid Gandy Wellwearpremiumpyjamaset£105 at David Gandy WellwearThis simple navy top and trouser set has subtle details that elevate it, such as the henley neckline and tonal embroidery on the waistband. The silky cotton modal fabric’s even been given an aloe vera anti-inflammatory treatment that apparently nourishes your skin as you sleep. Though I couldn’t tell whether my skin actuallyfelt nourished after waking up, this is one of the softest sets I’ve ever come across, so it’s definitely a safe bet for sensitive skin – even after going through the washing machine a few times.Joseph Turner brushed cottonpyjamas£156 at Joseph TurnerThis independent designer from North Yorkshire is known for making good-quality menswear classics. The cosy brushed cotton of these pyjamas is perfect for winter because the fabric’s fuzzier finish traps air pockets next to your body for extra insulation – and it’s Better Cotton Initiative-certified, meaning it’s traceable to farm level. But what reallymakes them stand out is the happy, colourful stripe. The kind of PJs you could imagine Derek Jacobi’s Alan Buttershaw in Last Tango in Halifax wearing – classic but with a cute, friendly twist.Seasalt Cornwallflannelpyjamaset£69.95 at Seasalt CornwallSeasalt Cornwall has been around since 1981 – when original owner Don Chadwick opened a shop in Penzance selling workwear to farmers, fishers and artists – but it’s really upped its menswear game in the past few years, from a collab with Community Clothing to its growing range of great knitwear and outerwear.The collections are full of cosy pieces you’d expect to wear on a wintry trip to the UK coastline. This pair comes in flannel, so it’s a real winter warmer, with checks that come in four colourways to suit your style.Desmond & Dempsey402longpyjamaset£100 at Desmond & DempseyDesmond & Dempsey is ideal if you like prints, whether you prefer a tropical jungle pattern or something even punchier like this Helios graphic. The sun-inspired pattern would work in summer, but the red-and-white colourway is equally good for the festive season. The fabric is a comfy stretch cotton blend.Best luxury pyjamasTeklapoplinshirt£190 at TeklaPoplinshorts£120 at TeklaTekla makes my favourite pyjamas. They look great and feel even better – the Scandi brand only uses high-grade fabrics, and the sets are constructed with French seams, which remove uncomfortable loose threads. The classic silhouettes come in a selection of block colours and stripes, and my top pick is this brown and white set. The entire range is designed to be unisex, and the shorts are great for anyone who tends to overheat.Derek Roseclassicfitpyjamas£260 at Derek RoseDerek Rose designs lots of menswear staples, but its speciality is sleepwear. Whether it’s the pure silk collection or the brand’s silky Lingfield cotton, every set by the London-based designer looks and feels luxurious. This pair in a lustrous navy tonal stripe are the perfect Christmas PJs.Paul Smithcottonpyjamaset£290 at Paul SmithFrom the ultra-smooth Italian cotton to the contrast piping, the patch pockets and the brand’s trademark colourful print, this Paul Smith pair hits the perfect sweet spot between luxury, comfort and design. They’d make a great gift, too, if you’re feeling generous.CDLPpyjamaT-shirt£105 at CDLPPyjama trousers£130 at CDLPCDLP is a Swedish label known for its menswear staples in luxurious fabrics.The T-shirt’s blend of lyocell and responsibly sourced pima cotton makes it feel lustrous but still airy. And the soft trousers are made from a certified organic cotton poplin, meaning the fibres are grown without synthetic pesticides or herbicides and using methods that promote soil health.They’re not actually sold as a set, so you could always buy the trousers with a T-shirt two-pack – there are some good options inwhite and navy.What you need to knowWhy should I wear pyjamas?Good pyjamas are designed to regulate your body temperature while also keeping your sheets free from sweat and natural body oils, with a fabric and fit that keeps you comfy in bed.But like the home equivalent of your favourite shirt for a fancy night out, a solid pair of PJs can also make you feel like the best version of yourself while chilling out.What type of pyjamas should I buy?For warmer weather – or if you run hot – you’ll want a lightweight breathable fabric such as modal, tencel or linen, whereas a fuzzy brushed cotton or flannel would be better suited to winter. For me, a cotton poplin is the best all-rounder – it balances the natural breathability of cotton with the crispness of a tight weave for a fabric that’s both soft on your skin and structured enough for a sharp, tailored finish. It’s strong enough to withstand frequent washing, too.I’d always suggest a relaxed cut because you don’t want your clothes to be clingy when you’re chilling at home. And, as always, menswear looks better when it’s not skin tight.There are many different options for pyjama tops (shirts, vests, T-shirts), but personally, I think you can’t go wrong with the classic PJ shirt – there’s a reason it’s been a nightwear staple since about 1870. But if you’re buying pyjamas exclusively for sleeping, a comfy T-shirt might be preferable.For more, read thebest electric blankets and heated throwsPeter Bevan is a stylist and fashion journalist covering menswear, womenswear and beautyExplore more on these topicsMen's fashionThe FilterMenSleepfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I was told in October that I am owed £2,200 and that it could take 33 weeks to receive the payment.I don’t feel inclined to lend the government money with no expected interest.JM,OxfordshireIn 33 weeks you could circumnavigate the world or gestate a baby but in the parallel universe ofHMRC, that’s how long it takes to press the keys for a bank transfer.In May, HMRC was criticised for takingmore than four monthsto process some tax and NI refunds that used to take nearer four weeks. At the time, HMRC said it was recruiting more staff to cope with the backlog, which pales in comparison with the timescale you’ve been quoted.Since it is surely the calculation of your dues that is the complex bit, you would think the actual refund would be straightforward.And so it proves to be when HMRC knows the media are looking. Your money arrived within seven days of my contact, and HMRC,notorious for its aversion to telephones, even managed to give you a call to apologise.Is 33 weeks the new normal? I asked. “We’ve seen increased demand on our national insurance services, but we’re recruiting hundreds of extra staff to reduce delays,” a spokesperson responded.We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

Every street is alive with sparkling fairy lights and soft candlelight. There are thousands of tiny wooden figurines, train sets and toy animals displayed in shop windows, wooden pyramids taller than doorframes and colourful nutcracker characters. Forget elves in the north pole, this is the real Santa’s workshop. For hundreds of years, here in the village of Seiffen, wood turners and carvers have created classic wooden Christmas toys and sold them around the world.map showing SeiffenNear the border of the Czech Republic, Seiffen may be well known in the German-speaking world as the “home of Christmas”, but so far it has been largely missed by English-speaking seasonal tourists. Tucked away in the Ore Mountains, about an hour and a half south of Dresden, it is not the easiest place to get to by public transport – the nearest train station is in Olbernhau, nearly 7 miles (11km) away. Buses are available, but we opt for a hire car and make our way into the hills, arriving the day after the first snowfall of the year. The roads are cleared quickly, but snow clings to the branches of the spruce trees. We half expect to see the Gruffalo’s child, but only spot a rust-coloured fox making its way through a fresh field of snow.The surrounding forests we drive through are key to Seiffen’s survival. (The only reason we are here is a tipoff from a friendly German forester who said it was a must-see.) The Ore Mountains – Erzgebirge in German – were classified as a Unesco world heritage site in 2019 due to their rich history of mining. For 800 years, the area was shaped by intensive silver and tin mining (and later uranium).Every street is alive with sparkling fairy lights and there are thousands of tiny wooden  toys displayed in shop windowsSeiffen was built in the 1300s just below the mountain ridge and is surrounded by forests of spruce, pine and beech. Mining and forestry go hand in hand. Timber was essential for making pit props to hold up the roofs of mines, and for tool-making. So when the supply of tin dried up and the miners were forced to find an alternative way to make a living, they sourced the timber on their doorstep, modified their machinery and first made wooden bowls and spoons, before turning to what would make them famous – toys. One craftsman took his toys to a nearby Christmas market and came back with pockets full of coins, and the rest, as they say, is history. Families in every corner of the village began making small animals and figurines in their homes, with everyone pitching in to help carve and paint them.It is difficult to know where to start in a town full of twinkly lights and warm, inviting shops, but a trip to the toy museum (Erzgebirgisches Spielzeugmuseum, €9) makes sense. Open since 1936, it tells the story of Seiffen’s toy-making traditions. The short video is recommended as it is the only information supplied in English. Despite the language barrier, the 5,000 exhibits – ranging from nutcrackers to train sets, Noah’s arks to minuscule matchbook carvings (including the “smallest kitchen in the world”) – will, if you are into that kind of thing, keep you amazed for hours. There are even traditional wooden toys that little (or big) kids can play with. To this day, Seiffen continues its toy-making tradition and even played host to the European Toy Maker festival earlier this year.View image in fullscreenA traditional handcrafted wooden nutcracker.Photograph: Dpa Picture Alliance/AlamyTo experience the toy-making in action, we head to theSeiffener Volkskunstworkshop for the toy-decorating session we have booked. We walk through the shop, the tiny figurines and moving candle wheels stealing our attention, then past the viewing gallery of wood-turners and toy-painters. The way they turn the wood here is something special. In the 1800s, craftsmen created a method called hoop-turning, in which a specifically designed lathe turns a piece of wood into a thick ring shape with notches and grooves. When they slice it, the shape of the animal or toy is revealed. This enabled the mass production of figurines, contributing to the economic success of Seiffen throughout the 19th century. Currently, only a few people in the world still use this technique.For our decorations, I choose a Christmassy-looking toadstool to paint, my partner a characterful duck, plus we take home a forest house to build with the children. Our little decorations are made with wood from local birch, beech, maple and linden trees. We sit alongside the professional toy painters, who are painting nutcrackers and snowmen, a slow mindful feeling settling over us.View image in fullscreenSeiffen turned to wooden toy-making when the tin mines dried up.Photograph: AlamyOne decoration I am particularly drawn to is the candle arch, orschwibbogen. These beautifully crafted objects depict the history of the village, sometimes with the local church above and mining figures at work below. Heritage is important in Seiffen, and when the advent season starts each year, there is a miners’ parade, with costumes that would have been worn 400 years ago.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Some toymakers focus on nutcrackers, some on angels, some onRäuchermänner, incense-burning figures. The more modern artisans’ shops, such asWendt & Kühn, are fascinating to look around, with smartly decorated interiors, although the toys’ price tags reflect this. In fact, you could spend hundreds of euros in even the most down-to-earth places, with some pyramids costing more than €2,000.After a lunch of delicious leek soup called Heidi (€7.80) atHotel Seiffener Hof, we walk to the church, an unusual octagonal shape, which is depicted in so many of the archways and decorations they sell here, and listen a while as the organ is played.As the Christmas season sets in the sun drops early, so we try a shot ofheisseholunderbeere, hot elderberry served with vodka and a dollop of whipped cream on top, to warm us up. Then we take two cups of redglühweinon a walk up the hill and on to the historic miners’ trail. The snow is untrodden up here and it crunches underfoot as we make our way to the Binge, once the opencast mine used to extract tin, now an amphitheatre for the community. The wooden benches arranged in a semi-circle are white, and the only sound we hear today is the dripping of the melting snow.We climb further up the steps on to the hill made of the waste material left over from the mining years. Now there are birch trees thriving, and we look down over the valley as the lights of the houses click on.Before the temperature drops further, we enjoyrostbratwurst(grilled sausage) from a street seller and another mulled wine outside the centralHotel Erbgericht Buntes Haus. It is properly cold now. The shops are shutting and the paths are freezing, so we begin to walk back up the hill to our hotel, stopping every few minutes to look at the lights below. We are welcomed into thePanorama Berghotel Wettiner Höhe(rooms from €79), where we settle in for the night, well and truly ready for the Christmas season ahead.Explore more on these topicsGermany holidaysChristmas and New Year holidaysEurope holidaysToysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

You want to put on a good centrepiece but you’re not feeling the nut loaf vibes. What to do?Festive catering for vegetarians is far easier in the northern hemisphere, where you can whack on a big chunk of pumpkin or stuff some peppers, and let them bake away while you roast the chestnuts and mull the wine.But in Australia, things can get schvitzy around this time of year. After the ham has been glazed and the pav baked, you’ll be forgiven for wanting to stay well away from any oven, stove or other kitchen heat source.So if you’re looking for a festive dish to make ahead of time, one that requires very little actual “cooking” and will have even the staunchest carnivores reaching for a slice, say hello to my vegeterrine!Think of this as an antipasti apartment high-rise, where instead of spreading store-bought antipasti on a platter like a suburban sprawl, you stack the ingredients in a terrine dish (or loaf tin), cemented with creamy, dreamy jarred-artichoke dip that sets and binds the layers overnight in the fridge. On the big day simply slice and serve your sensational savoury stack, complete with its own Christmassy colour scheme.View image in fullscreenGetting the hang of it: line the grilled zucchinis along the base and sides of the tin.Photograph: Eugene Hyland/The GuardianView image in fullscreenRed and green, the terrine has a Christmassy colour scheme.Photograph: Eugene Hyland/The GuardianHead to your local continental grocer or independent supermarket to find the best quality roasted veg in the deli section, ideally in olive oil. If you can’t find grilled zucchini there, you can grill your own. Heat a barbecue or griddle plate until smoking. Using a mandoline, slice five to six medium zucchini lengthways into long, 3mm-thin strips. Pop on the barbecue (no oil needed) until tiger stripes form on the underside, then flip and allow to shrivel and soften so they’re still pliable, without drying out. Leave to cool before using. Of course, you’re welcome to roast your own eggplant and capsicum slices too, if you’d prefer.View image in fullscreenHey presto, pesto: use a food processor to whiz the basil, pine nuts, cheese, garlic and olive oil.Photograph: Eugene Hyland/The GuardianA note on the pesto: check your cheese. There’s nothing worse for vegetarians than digging into a dish they thought was “safe” only to discover it contains parmigiano reggiano, which is traditionally made with an animal rennet. Look for parmesan-style cheeses with a non-animal rennet. To make this fully plant-based, swap the cheese for a tablespoon of nutritional yeast, and the cream cheese for cashew cheese or another vegan substitute.Alice Zaslavsky’s kataifi pie with feta, tomatoes and warm oregano honey – recipeRead moreThis dish also wins points as a terrif traveller. Leave the terrine in its tin, pack the pesto in one container, lemon wedges in another, and the chopped cherry tomatoes and picked basil leaves in another, and bring along your serving platter. At your destination, release your terrine and dress before serving. Then you – and your fellow dining companions – can veg out.Antipasti vegeterrine – recipeThe terrine can be made up to two days ahead, but make the pesto on the day for best results.Serves6 to 8For the artichoke cream250g cream cheese, softened170g jarmarinated artichoke hearts, drained1 lemon, zested and juiced1 garlic clove, peeledPinch of salt and freshly ground pepperFor the terrineApproximately 30 grilled zucchini strips(if you can’t find them, see above to grill your own)5 large (or 8 medium) pieces of store-bought roasted eggplant700g store-bought roasted red capsicum halves80g semi sun-dried tomatoes, drained and finely chopped (½ cup)For the basil pesto½ bunch basil, with some leaves reserved for garnish2 tbsp toasted pine nuts20g hard cheese, such as pecorino or “parmesan-style”, finely grated (¼ cup)1-2 garlic cloves, peeled60ml extra-virgin olive oil(¼ cup)To serve250g cherry tomatoes, halved (if available, choose a punnet of mixed-colour tomatoes)Fresh basil leaves and lemon wedges, to serveLine a 20cm x 10cm loaf or terrine tin with baking paper or cling wrap, ensuring it covers the base and drapes over the sides of the tin, with enough overhang to make a lid later.To make the artichoke cream, in a food processor blitz the cream cheese, artichokes, lemon zest and juice, garlic, salt and freshly ground pepper until smooth and creamy. Adjust seasoning to taste.To assemble the terrine, layer the zucchini slices on the base to cover, then drape more slices along the sides to form an overhang.Spread a thin layer of artichoke cream over the zucchini slices to help stick the slices together. Add a layer of roasted red capsicum (it doesn’t need to hang over the side), followed by another thin schmear of artichoke cream. Repeat with half the eggplant slices (you may need to trim the slices to help them fit), and another thin layer of cream.Scatter sundried tomatoes across the middle, and then follow with capsicum, cream, eggplant and a final layer of cream.Fold the overhanging zucchini into the tin to encase the layers. Cover with the overhanging baking paper or cling wrap and refrigerate for at least 24 hours.On the day of serving, make the pesto. In a food processor, whiz the basil, pine nuts, cheese and garlic. With the motor running, slowly add the olive oil until smooth. Season with salt and pepper to taste. (You can do this in a mortar and pestle too, if you need some calming clobbering.)To serve, remove the tin from the fridge and open up the overhanging baking paper. Place a large serving platter upside down, on top of the terrine tin. Carefully invert the platter and tin in one go, so the terrine is on top. Remove the tin, letting the terrine fall away from the mould, and remove the baking paper.Liberally spoon the pesto over the terrine. Alternatively, use a sharp knife to cut the terrine into thick slices, and spoon the pesto around the slices.Garnish with cherry tomato halves, basil leaves and a flick of extra-virgin olive oil. Finish with salt flakes and freshly ground pepper, and serve with lemon wedges.Explore more on these topicsAustralian food and drinkYou've got thisChristmas food and drinkVegetarian food and drinkVegetablesFoodAustralian lifestylerecipesShareReuse this content"

However, there are also a few American ones that I hold on to staunchly: one is the pronunciation of “aluminum”, and another is the importance and beauty of a soft cookie. In both of these easy but delicious bakes to share, I use spice and heat to balance the usual sweetness with which the season can often overload us.Black pepper soft gingerbread cookiesPrep5 minChill1 hrCook50 min, plus coolingMakes10-12520g plain flour, plus extra for dusting8g cocoa powder8g ground ginger3g ground cloves5g ground cinnamon3g aleppo pepper4g coarsely ground black pepper7g table salt3gbicarbonate of soda225g soft unsalted butter175g caster sugar1 large egg(60g)77g treacle77g pomegranate molasses40g golden syrupFor the icing120g icing sugar30g waterWhisk the first nine ingredients in a bowl and set aside. Either in the bowl of a stand mixer or using a handheld mixer, beat the butter for a few minutes until light and creamy. Scrape down the bowl, add the sugar and mix for four minutes more, until properly whipped. Add the egg and mix in well, continuously scraping down the sides of the bowl to ensure everything is well combined. Add the treacle, molasses and golden syrup, and mix again.Add the dry mix, combining until a dough forms. Shape the dough into a rectangle, then wrap in clingfilm and refrigerate for an hour.Take the dough out of the fridge and let it sit for five to 10 minutes. Lightly dust the dough with flour, then roll it out so it’s roughly a third of an inch/1cm thick. Use cookie cutters to stamp out whatever shapes you fancy – gingerbread people, say, or you could even use a patterned roller. Re-roll any scraps and cut out some more.Transfer the cookies to a baking tray lined with baking paper, keeping them spaced at least 5cm apart. Bake at 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 for 11-13 minutes, until the edges are firm, and the cookies slightly darken, but still seem a little soft. Leave to sit for 10 minutes.Meanwhile, whisk the icing sugar and water to make a glaze. While the cookies are still warm, brush them with the glaze, then leave to set. The cookies will keep in an airtight container for a week.Ginger and pumpkin loaf with spiced lemon icingView image in fullscreenPrep5 minCook1 hr 10 minMakes1 x30cm loaf cake, to serve 7-10425g pumpkin puree375g soft dark brown sugar2 tsp vanilla extract275g vegetable oil250g eggs350g plain flour1 tbsp ground ginger1 tsp ground cinnamon1 tsp ground cardamom½ tsp mixed spice10gbicarbonate of soda8g baking powder10g table saltFor the spiced lemon icing250g icing sugar1 tsp ground cinnamon¼tsp ground turmericJuice of 1 lemonIn a medium bowl, whisk the pumpkin puree, brown sugar, vanilla and oil. Add the eggs and mix again until emulsified.In a second bowl, whisk the flour, spices, bicarb, baking powder and salt. Fold the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, being careful not to over-mix, because that will result in a tougher sponge – the batter doesn’t have to be totally smooth, but you don’t want any clumps of flour. Transfer to a 30cm loaf tin.Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4. Bake the loaf for 50-55 minutes, until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean; start checking from the 50-minute mark. Leave the loaf to coolcompletely in its tin before turning out.To make the spiced lemon icing, whisk the icing sugar, spices and just enough lemon juice to make a thick icing. Once the cake is cool, slather on the icing and leave to set. This will keep for five days once iced, or seven days uniced and wrapped.Adriann Ramirez is head of pastry atFinks, which has just opened Finks at Clissold House, London N16Explore more on these topicsChristmas food and drinkChristmas food giftsFoodChristmasCakeBakingDessertrecipesShareReuse this content"

Leaves fade and growth slows as plants struggle to photosynthesise.The hackGrow lights offer a clever fix, topping up what nature can’t provide. But with prices ranging from £15 to £100, are they really worth it?The methodPosition a full-spectrum LED about 20-30cm above your plants. Set a timer: in a bright spot, three to four hours a day can be enough, while a windowless corner may need six to eight hours. Watch for signs of stress: bleached leaves mean too much light; stretching means too little.The testA clip-on LED revived my tired philodendron in a north-facing hallway within weeks, producing healthy, evenly spaced leaves.The verdictGrow lights genuinely help plants maintain healthy growth in winter by restoring a natural balance of light when days are at their darkest.

They woke in a panic, to the sound of gunfire and tanks.The bullets announced the arrival of the Israeli military into the remote southern Syrian province of Quneitra on 9 December 2024. In the place of Assad militias who used to patrol the roads, bulky armoured personnel carriers filled with Israeli soldiers rumbled down the potholed streets, stopping to assure residents that they were there for their protection.“When the Assad regime fell, we didn’t even get to celebrate – it fell over there while they entered from here,” said 52-year-old Ibrahim, working at a falafel shop in al-Qahtaniya, close to the Israeli border.View image in fullscreenIsraeli troops in Syria on 16 December 2024.Photograph: Atef Safadi/EPAThe hard-fought freedom that reigns in the rest ofSyriaafter 14 years of war is nowhere to be found here.A year after Israeli forces entered southern Syria, crossing into a UN buffer zone and in some cases beyond, its occupation remains and the frequency of the Israeli military raids on towns is increasing. An Israeli incursion in the town of Beit Jinn at the end of November left at least 13 Syrians dead, including two children.Residents say they have traded the tyranny of Assad for a military occupation. Checkpoints are now operated by Israelis, not Assad officers. Night-time raids and phone searches continue.Israel says it sent troops to southern Syria as the Assad regime fell to protect the security of its borders, and that it will not allow the new Syrian government to deploy its forces there. Syria’s new authorities are in little position to resist. Israeli airstrikes and raids result in complaints at the UN security council in New York and little else.Israeli soldiers have confiscated all weapons in the area, at first demanding people hand them in, and then raiding homes to search for hidden arms. Arrests of anyone suspected of affiliation with Iranian militias or Hezbollah are frequent. Interrogation usually lasts only a few hours, but some families say their male family members have been detained for months, their whereabouts unknown.Ibrahim was one of the first to suffer under the Israeli occupation. His house, along with 14 others, was bulldozed to make way for an Israeli military base – one of six built across southern Syria over the last year.“I asked them: ‘Why did you destroy the houses? We never lifted a stone against you, we welcomed you thinking you were coming as a protection force in peace,’” Ibrahim said. “The soldier told me, ‘Bashar al-Assad destroyed all of Syria. You’re upset that we destroyed a few houses?’”View image in fullscreenA funeral ceremony for five members of the same family killed in an Israeli military raid in Beit Jinn.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images“I told him, ‘When Bashar al-Assad destroyed things, it was during war. But you entered claiming peace,” he said. He paused each time a car drove by, wary of an Israeli military patrol seeing him talking to reporters. His 13-year-old son chimed in, puffing up his chest to say he was not scared of the Israelis, but he struggled to get the words out through a stammer that his father said he developed after Israeli forces entered their town.Syria’s government has made multiple appeals to the international community to curb the Israeli occupation, a violation of a 1974 UN security council resolution establishing the buffer zone between Syrian forces and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.Syria mapThe new government in Damascus is well aware that its newly formed army would stand little chance against the US-equipped Israeli military. Hundreds of Israeli airstrikes in the first days after the fall of the Assad regime destroyed almost the entire Syrian air force and much of its arms depots.Syria has engaged in direct negotiations with Israel under US mediation, seeking a non-aggression pact and for a withdrawal of Israeli forces in accordance with the 1974 agreement. Negotiations have borne little fruit so far.View image in fullscreenIsraeli tanks in southern Syria near the Quneitra crossing on 10 December 2024.Photograph: Matias Delacroix/APThe Syrian government has little presence in the Israeli-occupied area, and it is Israeli soldiers, not the Syrian state, that rules over the area’s people.If municipal services are required – such as electricity or water repairs – Israelis must be informed 24 hours in advance to allow the entry of trucks. Residents must also receive a permit from Israel before hosting a wedding or other gatherings, and people say drones often accompany them as they plough their fields.Israeli soldiers have meanwhile conducted a survey to find out people’s needs in the area and have gone door to door handing out boxes of aid, sorely needed after years of war and economic sanctions.Israeli military officers appointed Yassin al-Hamad, a 57-year-old local official, to coordinate his town’s affairs with them. He recounted how Israeli forces admonished him after a truck came to the town to repair electric poles without his knowledge.“If something happens – even a small thing – a vehicle comes to your house. Any issue becomes something. You can’t leave the house freely,” Hamad said. He added that he and others had started to learn some Hebrew phrases – good morning, how are you? – to greet Israeli soldiers at checkpoints.Israeli officers have told residents their presence is solely meant to prevent armed groups from operating on the border, but increasing military activity has left them wondering how long life under occupation will continue.People are wary of returning to Quneitra, unsure if Israel will allow them to stay. Roads are cut off by mounds of dirt heaped by Israeli bulldozers and fresh tank prints line the streets. The fury of construction that has consumed the rest of Syria as the country tries to move on from more than a decade of war has not arrived.Instead, it is only Israeli bulldozers that dig, steadily re-enforcing their new military bases.“If I had even just a room in Damascus, I wouldn’t stay here for another minute. We’re living in terror,” said Ibrahim.Explore more on these topicsSyriaFall of Assad: one year onIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaBashar al-AssadfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She was only the12th woman in Africa to qualify in the field– four more have joined her since.Even now, with 100 operations under her belt, the reality of working in a role in which she confronts misogyny and discrimination daily has not dented Kanyepi’s love of the surgical theatre.In South Africa, where she trained as a heart surgeon, she had been among other women medics , but when she returned home toZimbabwe, she joined a tiny group of just four other cardiothoracic surgeons in the country, all of whom were male.“I was first treated with scepticism,” she says. “Misogyny was not always said outright, but people had doubts. Everything was about proving myself again.”I had to [do] double the amount of work as my male colleagues to prove that I know what I am doingKudzai Kanyepi, cardiothoracic surgeonKanyepi grew up in Zimbabwe’s capital, Harare, and says she was lucky that her mother was able to send her to some of the city’s best schools. But it was a fluke that led her to turn to medicine.At the National University of Science and Technology in Bulawayo, she enrolled to study electronic engineering. But that class was full and the university could only accommodate her in medical classes. Her interest was ignited, and before long Kanyepi had transferred to the University of Zimbabwe to study for the degree her mother had always secretly believed she was destined for: medicine.In 2017 she moved to SouthAfricato train as a heart surgeon at Inkosi Albert Luthuli central hospital in Durban. “I remember the day I walked into the hospital. That was when my life changed,” she says.View image in fullscreenKanyepi says she has had to work twice as hard as male colleagues to prove herself.Photograph: Dr Kudzai KanyepiAfrica has a history of pioneering heart surgery. It was in Cape Town that Christiaan Barnard performed theworld’s first human-to-human heart transplantin 1967. But despite cardiovascular disease beingthe leading cause of death globally, responsible for 19.8 million deaths in 2022 – 80% of which occur in low- and middle-income countries, including in Africa –cardiothoracic surgeryis high cost and unavailable in many countries, and there are continent-wide shortages of skilled surgeons and doctors.Dr Rajhmun Madansein, the head of cardiothoracic surgery at Inkosi, who trained Kanyepi, had also taught Lindiwe Sidali, South Africa’s first African female cardiothoracic surgeon. Sidali, who qualified in 2018, became an inspiration and mentor for Kanyepi. “Whenever we needed to be put straight, Lindiwe was the big sister,” she says.Kanyepi had just become a mother when she began her surgical training, having arrived in Durban nine months pregnant. “It was difficult to balance training and motherhood,” she says. “But I had extremely strong family support – my mother. This allowed me to continue to pursue heart surgery.“I had to do as much as men when I was training. When I came back, I had to [do] double the amount of work as my male colleagues to prove that I know what I am doing.”Even so, she adds: “In the private practice, there are people who simply do not refer [patients] to me because I am a woman. And they do not think the calibre of training I received is the same. There is this misconception that women have it easier.”Kanyepi says this is the downside of being a pioneer in her field in Zimbabwe. “When people talk about the first female, they think it is all glamour, glory and excitement. But there is always the other side. You have to navigate being the only one,” she says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features, opinion and photography, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But I believe I can do a lot with a limited system,” says Kanyepi, who works at Harare’s government-run Parirenyatwa hospital, which wasvisited by Emmerson Mnangagwa, Zimbabwe’s president, in June after a growing outcry at the state of the country’s deteriorated health system.Kanyepi is now mentoring other trainees and wants to establish a foundation to support girls from disadvantaged communities to study medicine.“My passion is to eventually start a foundation to help young girls who want to be cardiothoracic surgeons and children who want to access cardiac surgery,” she says.“Performing a heart surgery is inspiring because to perform heart surgery, you have to stop the heart. The machines take over. After surgery, the heart starts to beat again.

The conflict had already displaced at least 1.2 million people before the latest upsurge in fighting.The state department said late on Monday that the US was deeply concerned by the violence. “Rwanda, which continues to provide support to M23, must prevent further escalation,” a spokesperson said.Explore more on these topicsDemocratic Republic of the CongoAfricaRwandaUS foreign policyTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

One of the mercenariestold the Guardian and La Silla Vacía in Octoberthat he had trained children in Sudan and fought in the siege of the city ofEl Fasher. He said training the children was “awful and crazy” but added that “unfortunately that’s how war is”.Among those targeted was Álvaro Andrés Quijano Becerra, a dual Colombian-Italian national and retired Colombian military officer based in the United Arab Emirates. The treasury accused him of playing a central role in recruiting and deploying former Colombian soldiers to Sudan. His wife, Claudia Viviana Oliveros Forero, was also sanctioned.Also on the sanctions list was Mateo Andrés Duque Botero, a dual Colombian-Spanish citizen who the treasury said managed a business accused ofhandling funds and payrollfor the network that hired the Colombian fighters. “In 2024 and 2025, US-based firms associated with Duque engaged in numerous wire transfers, totalling millions of US dollars,” the treasury statement said.Colombian national Mónica Muñoz Ucros was the fourth individual to be sanctioned, with the company she managed accused of carrying out wire transfers linked to Duque and his businesses.“The United States again calls on external actors to cease providing financial and military support to the belligerents,” the treasury said in a statement.Elizabeth Dickinson, senior analyst at the International Crisis Group, described the sanctions as a “very significant” milestone, saying that “calling out those who are doing the contracting is the right way to go”.She added that Colombia also recently passed a law ratifying the International Convention Against the Recruitment and Use of Mercenaries, aiming to curb decades of Colombian involvement in foreign conflicts and transform national security policy.Sean McFate, an expert on mercenaries, urged more caution, saying that “sanctions are necessary but insufficient for dealing with rampant mercenarism”.“It’s an illicit economy and based out of Dubai, which is relatively sanction-proof,” he said. The UAE has been widely accused of arming the RSF, an accusation it has denied. “Expect more Colombian mercenaries,” McFate warned.Explore more on these topicsSudanAfricaWar crimesConflict and armsTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

He directed the authorities in the member countries to act “to neutralise any aircraft that would violate the confederal space” in future.On Monday, Nigerian authorities said the aircraft had been en route to Portugal for a ferry mission before “a technical concern which necessitated a precautionary landing”.“[The] crew is safe and have received cordial treatment from the host authorities,” said Ehimen Ejodame, the Nigerian air force spokesperson who signed the statement. “Plans are ongoing to resume the mission as scheduled.”The incident unfolded less than 24 hours after Nigeria took part in an intervention inBenin, Burkina Faso’s south-eastern neighbour, after a group of soldiers seized control of the national television station in Cotonou and announced the ousting of the president, Patrice Talon.Authorities in Benin later said they had foiled the coup attempt and restored order, preventing what would have been the eighth successful coup in westAfricain five years.A statement from the Nigerian government said its airstrikes –targeting a military base in Cotonou where some of the coup planners were reportedly holed up – happened at the behest of Talon and were in compliance with the protocols of the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas). Ivorian aircraft were also seen hovering over Beninese airspace during the crisis, pointing to a coordinated response by countries aligned with the regional bloc.The states that make up the AES broke away from Ecowas, headquartered in Nigeria, after Ecowas threatened military intervention in Niger in 2023 to reinstate the democratically elected president, Mohamed Bazoum, after he was ousted in a coup. The AES states accuse Ecowas of breaching territorial integrity and being a puppet of the west and have also drawn closer to Russia.Explore more on these topicsNigeriaAfricaBurkina FasoBeninnewsShareReuse this content"

Sovereignty resides in the people, exclusively in the Honduran people.”She also referred to Hernández’s release: “Conservatives in Washington have decided to ally themselves with drug trafficking and organised crime.”After a lengthy investigation that had key developments under Trump’s first administration,Hernández was convicted in the USlast year. He governed Honduras from 2014 to 2022, and Manhattan prosecutors alleged that, under his government, the country served as a crucial transit point for cocaine entering the US from South American countries including Colombia and Venezuela.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features, opinion and photography, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The electoral council has until 30 December to announce the official result.Explore more on these topicsHondurasAmericasDonald TrumpUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

The press conference, traditionally held by the Nobel laureate on the eve of the award ceremony, had been expected to be the 58-year-old’s first public appearance in 11 months.It was postponed hours before it was due to start, however, and a few hours later it was cancelled.A spokesperson for the Nobel institute said: “The press conference is cancelled for today and we have no further information about how and when she is coming.”Asked whether it might be rescheduled for Wednesday, they said: “I don’t think so, you never know … We are also in the dark.”The institute said in a statement: “María Corina Machado has herself stated in interviews how challenging the journey to Oslo,Norwaywill be. We therefore cannot at this point provide any further information about when and how she will arrive for the Nobel peace prize ceremony.”Machado’s team did not respond to a request for comment.Machado’s family had arrived in the Norwegian capital for Wednesday’s ceremony, but journalists accredited to attend the event received messages marked “urgent” from the committee’s head of media and communication an hour and a half before the scheduled time of access.Machado wasannounced as the winnerof this year’s peace prize in October for her dogged struggle to rescue Venezuela from its fate as a “brutal, authoritarian state”.A conservative often described as Venezuela’s Iron Lady, she dedicated the prize in a post on X to “the suffering people ofVenezuelaand to President Trump for his decisive support of our cause!”The US president has ordered a major naval buildup off Venezuela’s Caribbean coast and threatened land strikes against suspected Venezuelan drug traffickers after a more than three-month military campaign against alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and Pacific.Machado’s mother, Corina Parisca de Machado, arrived at Oslo airport on Monday. The 84-year-old has not seen her daughter in a year.“Every day I pray the rosary, I ask God the Father, the Virgin, both together, that we may have María Corina tomorrow,” she told Agence France-Presse. “And if we don’t have her tomorrow, it is because that is God’s will.”After the postponement of the press conference, she told the Norwegian broadcaster NRK that she was very emotional. “I am doing well, but there are a lot of emotions now,” she said.Machado’s two sons and her daughter, Ana Corina Sosa, who reportedly arrived at the Grand Hotel in Oslo on Monday night, were also due to attend.“When we see each other, I’m sure there will be tears and joy and hugs,” SosatoldNRK earlier this month. “I miss hugging her. I miss smelling her and seeing her in person. We’re going to make the most of the time we have with each other.”Machado’s location is not publicly known but some reports say she has made it to Europe and there are suggestions that she may have received help from the US to be smuggled out of Venezuela via Puerto Rico.Venezuela’s attorney general, Tarek William Saab, said last month that Machado had been accused of “acts of conspiracy, incitement of hatred, terrorism” and would be considered a “fugitive” if she travelled to Norway to accept the prize.“By being outside Venezuela and having numerous criminal investigations, she is considered a fugitive,” Saab told AFP.Maduro refused to accept he lost to Machado’s ally Edmundo González in a presidential election in July 2024 and launched a political crackdown that forced González into exile and Machado underground.Not since 2012, when the EU was awarded the peace prize, have so many heads of state planned to attend the ceremony. Among those expected to attend are the presidents of Argentina, Panama, Ecuador and Paraguay.The Norwegian Nobel Instituteshared a videoof the moment its director, Kristian Berg Harpviken, woke Machado with the news by phone that she had been awarded the peace prize. “Oh my God!” she said. “I have no words … But I hope you understand that … I am just one person, I certainly don’t deserve this.”Explore more on these topicsNobel peace prizeVenezuelaAmericasNorwaynewsShareReuse this content"

The agreement also stipulates that the United States mustannually allocate 1.5m acre-feet of waterfrom the Colorado River to Mexico.The water from the Rio Grande is used to support agriculture in Texas and other US border states.Trump unveils $12bn aid package for US farmers amid tariff falloutRead moreIn a post on Truth Social on Monday, the president said thatMexico“owes” the US 800,000 acre-feet of water due to violations of the treaty over the past five years.He demanded Mexico release 200,000 acre-feet of water before 31 December, and more “soon after”.The lack of water was hurting crops and livestock in Texas, Trump said.“As of now, Mexico is not responding, and it is very unfair to our U.S. Farmers who deserve this much needed water,” Trump added. “That is why I have authorized documentation to impose a 5% Tariff on Mexico if this water isn’t released, IMMEDIATELY.”A spokesperson for Mexico’s economy ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.In April, the US agriculture secretary, Brooke Rollins, said that Mexico had agreed to increase its water shipments to Texas to help make up a shortfall under the 1944 treaty.Mexico has argued that it is under drought conditions that have strained the country’s water resources. While climate crisis-induced drought plays a large role in the Rio Grande’s depletion, overconsumption and mismanagement have also contributed to its current state. A recentWorld Wildlife Studyfound that 52% of the water consumed from the Rio Grande is unsustainable, meaning that it is contributing to overall depletion of reservoirs, aquifers and the river itself.The study also found that water shortages have led to the loss of 18% of farmland in the river’s headwaters in Colorado, 36% along the Rio Grande in New Mexico, and 49% in the Pecos River tributary in New Mexico and Texas.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In May 2024, 10 US lawmakers from bipartisan congressional districtsurged Congress to withhold money from Mexico until it delivered the water. The group wrote that in addition to jeopardising crops, “the lack of reliable water delivery affects municipalities and threatens the quality of life for many American citizens living along our border”.Texas’s agricultural industry has seen significant consequences from lack of water, including theclosure of the state’s last sugar processing mill.Trump’s threat to Mexico followsthe unveiling of a $12bn economic assistance packageon Monday for farmers negatively affected by the tariff-induced trade wars.“This relief will provide much-needed certainty to farmers as they get this year’s harvest to market and look ahead to next year’s crops, and it’ll help them continue their efforts to lower food prices for American families,” Trump said during a roundtable discussion of American agriculture.About $11bn of the $12bn relief package will come from the agriculture department’s Farmer Bridge Assistance (FBA) program. The money will go to producers of corn, cotton, sorghum, soybeans, rice, wheat and other row crops,according to the USDA’s announcement, and is expected to be released in February 2026. The remaining $1bn will be reserved for producers not covered by the FBA program, including specialty crops and sugar, but the USDA said that the timeline for those payments was still under development.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsTrump administrationUS politicsMexicoAmericasTariffsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

President Xi responded positively!”Trump said the Department of Commerce was finalising the details and that he was planning to make the same offer to other chip companies, including Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Intel. Nvidia’s H200 chips are the company’s second most powerful, and far more advanced than the H20, which was originally designed as a lower-powered model for the Chinese market that would not breach restrictions, but which the US banned anyway in April.The president said the US would receive 25% of the proceeds, more than the15% previously agreed towith Nvidia in an earlier deal to lift restrictions. This deal follows similar unorthodox plans for the federal government to take a financial cut from private business dealings. In August, Trump said the US wouldreceive a 10% stakein the tech company Intel. Some lawmakers havequestioned the legalityof such arrangements.According to the Hill, the Democratic senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Andy Kim of New Jerseysent lettersto the commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, last week outlining their concerns over selling these chips to China and saying it risked powering the country’s “surveillance, censorship and military applications”.They wrote: “I urge you to stop ignoring the input of bipartisan members of Congress and your own experts in order to cut deals that trade away America’s national security.”On social media, Warren called for Huang to appear before Congress to testify under oath.Huang has worked closely with Trump since the inauguration and has made several trips to the White House. The CEO attended the president’s AI summit in July, met Trump as recently as last week and was even a guest at the White House dinner for the Saudi crown price, Mohammed bin Salman. Huang haspledged to invest $500bn in AI infrastructurein the US over the next four years.Huang has visitedChinaseveral times, meeting officials and Chinese tech executives, as US bans were variously lifted and reintroduced. Earlier this year, China imposed its own controls on the imports of Nvidia chips, with top tech firms reportedly instructed to cancel orders, citing national security concerns and confidence in China’s domestic chip development.In October, Huang said Nvidia has gone from having 95% of the Chinese market to having none, and called the bans a “strategic mistake”.Selling chips to China, the world’s second largest economy, could now mean a windfall worth billions of dollars for Nvidia, which is already valued at $4.5tn.An Nvidia spokesperson said: “We applaud President Trump’s decision.” He said offering the H200 chips “to approved commercial customers, vetted by the Department of Commerce, strikes a thoughtful balance that is great for America”.The Nvidia spokesperson and Trump said the move would support US jobs and manufacturing.In his Truth Social post, Trump condemned the Biden administration’s policies, which imposed strict export controls on powerful chips. The Biden administration had said withholding such technology from China bolstered US competition, protected national security and hampered AI development in China.“That Era is OVER!” Trump wrote. “My Administration will always put America FIRST.”On Tuesday afternoon, China’s foreign ministry said it had noted the reports. “China has always adhered to the principle that China and the United States can achieve mutual benefit and win-win results through cooperation,” the spokesperson said. A final decision from Beijing is still in the works, according to areport from the Financial Times. The newspaper said regulators may still opt to limit access to H200 chips in China so that the country can continue to focus on its own technology.Ma Jihua, a telecom industry analyst, told the state media outlet the Global Times that years of US curbs on AI exports had “provided a rare chance of China’s domestic chip industry to grow and catch up”.Explore more on these topicsNvidiaTechnology sectorTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsChinaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

If the fighting is to end, [Cambodia] must do what Thailand has set,” he said.On Tuesday the conflict spread further, with the Thai navy announcing it was taking action to expel Cambodian forces who it said were encroaching on Thai territory in Trat province.The Thai military said Cambodia was using rocket launchers, bomb-dropping drones and artillery on Thai positions, and that artillery shells had fallen on two civilian homes in Sa Kaeo province. No casualties were reported.Cambodia accused Thailand of firing into civilian areas and said “renewed aggression” by Thailand had “destroyed infrastructure, damaged temples, cultural property, human heritage and disrupted essential public services”.View image in fullscreenA police officer stands as residents evacuate following clashes along the Cambodia-Thailand border in Siem Reap province.Photograph: Tang Chhin Sothy/AFP/Getty ImagesMore than 125,000 people in Thailand are staying in temporary evacuation shelters across Ubon Ratchathani, Sisaket, Surin and Buri Ram provinces, according to the Thai military. In Cambodia, more than 21,000 people have been evacuated across Preah Vihear, Oddar Meanchey, Banteay Meanchey provinces.The dispute between Thailand and Cambodia dates back more than a century to when France, which occupied Cambodia until 1953, first mapped the land border. Conflict over the border, which stretches across more than 500 miles (800km), has erupted repeatedly over the years.Clashes along Thailand-Cambodia border graphicTensions rose in May and escalated into a five-day conflict in July when at least 48 people were killed and 300,000 displaced, before Trump brokered a ceasefire.The ceasefire deal has appeared precarious, with both sides repeatedly accusing each other of violations. Last month, Thailand said it wassuspending the ceasefire deal,accusing Cambodia of laying fresh landmines along the border, including one mine that it said had wounded a Thai soldier.A Cambodian civilian was later killed and three wounded, according to the Cambodian prime minister, after each side accused the other of opening fire.Explore more on these topicsThailandCambodiaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

He remains in detention while his high court case is heard.The government’s counsel said the Nauru deal was lawful and that TCXM was not afforded procedural fairness because it related to foreign affairs matters – namely, Australia’s dealings with Nauru.Lawyers for TCXM are seeking an injunction on his deportation to Nauru, which, if granted, could have broader implications for the government’s multi-billion-dollar deal.TCXM was one of more than 350 non-citizens released from indefinite detention in 2023 after thehigh court ruled in favour of a stateless Rohingya manknown as NZYQ.The chief justice, Stephen Gaegler, in 2023 said the man’s indefinite detention was unlawful because there was “no real prospect of his removal from Australia becoming practicable in the reasonably foreseeable future”.TCXM arrived in Australia in 1990 and was granted a protection visa five years later. In 1999, he was convicted of murdering his wife and sentenced to 22 years in prison.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The record trade surplus comes even as exports to the US have plummeted, a reflection of the bruisingUS-China trade warthat, despite arecent cooling, has dampened the flow of goods between the world’s two largest economies.From GDP to trade, how well equipped is China’s economy for Trump 2.0? | Amy HawkinsRead moreExports to the US plummeted by nearly a third in November. Speaking on Tuesday, Chinese premier Li Qiang said the “mutually destructive consequences of tariffs have become increasingly evident”.The fall in exports to the US has led to concerns that China is flooding other parts of the world – especially south-east Asia and Europe – with cheap goods that threaten local industry.View image in fullscreenChinese-made vehicles wait to be loaded on to ships for export in Shanghai.Photograph: Costfoto/NurPhoto/ShutterstockBut experts believe that many of the goods bound for south-east Asia ultimately end up in the US, via a practice known as trans-shipment where products are sent via a third country to avoid tariffs. That is because the demand in the US for cheap products has not gone away, and few countries can replicate China’s mammoth ability to produce consumer goods at scale at low prices.In the first eight months of this year, the US imported $23.1bn in goods from Indonesia, an increase of nearly a third on the same period in 2024. Experts believe this rise is largely down to Chinese goods being redirected via Indonesia.There have also been increases in imports from Malaysia and the Philippines.The statistics suggest that the huge tariffs placed by the US and China on each other’s goods has dented bilateral trade but done little to change the overall flow of goods in the global economy.And as China becomes dominant in the production of hi-tech goods such as electric vehicles and batteries, it is unlikely to lose its place as the world’s factory for the products that are vital to global development. While overall Chinese exports grew by 5.4% this year, certain products – such assemiconductors– saw even larger increases, with a 24.7% jump in exports, according toChatham House.Exports to the EUrose sharply in November, by 14.8%, compared with 0.9% in October.French president Emmanuel Macron said in an interview published over the weekend that on arecent trip to Chinahe had threatened China’s leader, Xi Jinping, with tariffs if there was no action taken to reduce the trade deficit with the EU.Economists at Morgan Stanley expect China to increase its share of global exports from 15% to 16.5% by 2030.Zichun Huang, China economist at CapitalEconomics, agreed, telling Reuters: “We expect China’s exports will remain resilient, with the country continuing to gain global market share next year.”The data also reveal the extent to which China’s economy is still dependent on exports, despite efforts in Beijing to rebalance the economy at home and boost domestic demand.Xi chaired a meeting of the Chinese Communist party’s ruling politburo on Monday. According to a readout in state media, the cadres discussed the need to “continuously expand domestic demand” and to make consumption the “main driver” of the economy.Boosting consumer spending is expected to be a top economic priority in 2026. But policymakers have a big hill to climb. Chinese households are keen on saving money, a trend exacerbated by the pandemic and real estate crash in China that wiped out many people’s savings. Chinese consumption as a share of GDP is about 50%, compared to about 80% in the US.Explore more on these topicsChinaTariffsTrump tariffsGlobal economyInternational tradeEconomicsAsia PacificanalysisShareReuse this content"

She said she had never disputed that Higgins had been raped.Bruce Lehrmann was charged with raping Higgins and pleaded not guilty, but a criminal trial on those allegations was abandoned after juror misconduct. He was not trialled again because of concerns about Higgins’ welfare.The federal court has found on the civil burden of proof – the balance of probability – that Lehrmann raped Higgins. A recent appeal against that decision, in a defamation action brought by Bruce Lehrmann against Network Ten and journalist Lisa Wilkinson, was dismissed, and Lehrmann’s lawyer has flagged a possible high court appeal.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailReynolds successfully sued Higgins over a series of social media posts the former defence minister believed damaged her reputation. In August the Western Australia supreme court awarded her damages of $315,000 plus $26,109 interest after finding some of the posts were defamatory. Higgins was also ordered to pay most of her legal costs in the case, estimated at over $1m.In October Reynolds launched bankruptcy proceedings against Higgins in an effort to recover the money.Asked whether she had any qualms about continuing to pursue a rape victim in part of her quest for justice, Reynolds told the ABC on Tuesday she had “never, ever disputed the rape allegation” but said “the history of this is incredibly important”.“Because seven years ago, there was one allegation of rape after two staff had entered my office unauthorised after hours,” she said. “There was an allegation of rape. It was very clear to me and my chief of staff then that was a criminal matter that needed to be dealt with by the AFP. And they did.“It was also very clear to me that that allegation required proper welfare support to Ms Higgins at the time. We sought the advice, all of the correct advice. We followed it ….we did everything right. But it’s taken five years, almost, to get the truth told by the judges. And to make the truth binding.”Reynolds is also suing the commonwealth over Higgins’ $2.4m settlement, signed off by then-attorney general Mark Dreyfus. Reynolds alleged in court documents that Dreyfus committed “misfeasance of public office” by denying her an opportunity to defend herself against allegations she mishandled the incident.Reynolds told the ABC that case could not be settled with an apology.“Justice is not cheap. Because I was forced to take action to defend my reputation … we can’t undo all of the damage that’s been done over five years. But it has been hellishly expensive for me to seek justice through the civil courts.“I have no regrets in doing it, because it has flushed out a lot of the truth. And certainly the truth about the allegations that were fabricated. But it has cost me a great deal.“We have two mortgages on our house. We’ve got millions of dollars of debt. I don’t regret it. If I lose everything, it will have been worth it.”Reynolds also railed against Labor, Liberal colleagues, and the media for their part in the scandal.She appeared to blame colleagues who wanted her job of defence minister for contributing to the story, said Labor refused to accept court findings about how the matter was handled, and she accused Lisa Wilkinson of exploiting a rape victim by putting them on national television as part of what Reynolds alleged was a “clearly curated, fabricated, political scandal” involving other reporters.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But for me, five years ago almost to the day, my life was completely destroyed. My reputation, my career and my health.“No one can undo that. But I’m still fighting for the truth and for justice for myself and for others.”Of Lehrmann, Reynolds said: “Well, I absolutely unreservedly condemn Bruce Lehrmann, because I clearly had identified before that rape that he was unsuited to working in my office and any ministerial office.“So, please don’t misunderstand that. I think that is very clear.“And his own behaviour, as I said, has demonstrated his character.”When asked about Higgins and whether she had sympathy for her as a rape victim, Reynolds responded that she and her former chief of staff Fiona Brown had been found to have done “everything right” by Higgins in two separate judgments.“So of course I had great sympathy …[but] that first day these allegations [that there had been a cover-up] came out – I was absolutely mortified about what [Higgins] had said, because it did not accord with my recollection.“So my initial reactions were – how could I have missed this? How could Fiona have missed this? But I knew her allegations were not true, but she appeared to believe them.

It is one of the Liberals’ most marginal electorates, with a gap of only 1.2%, and the fate of such outer suburban seats will be vital to the Coalition at the November 2026 election.Victorian Liberal party ousts Brad Battin to install Jess Wilson as first female leaderRead moreIt can be revealed that nearly six months before his preselection, Hutchinson and his wife won a supreme court injunction against a bid to remove them from Hutchinson Legal, which is run “as a form of Christian ministry”, according to documents provided by the court to Guardian Australia.That case triggered a counterclaim from current and former partners, who say the Hutchinsons should be terminated from the firmbecause of alleged breaches of the partnership agreement, including by “engaging in another profession”.They have accused him of several incidents of bullying – including allegedly threatening and detaining one of his lawyers – along with using the firm, its staff and a defamation case for political activities.In court documents – filed before his preselection – it is claimed his conduct caused six people to leave the practice. One of those was a female lawyer who it is alleged made a complaint against Hutchinson, and has allegedly been off work for several months because of a workplace injury. In court documents Hutchinson denies the claims.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailHutchinson is also accused of loudly striking an office window to get the lawyer’s attention, rudely gesturing, and then using offensive and crass language towards her in October last year. Hutchinson says the pair had an interaction but otherwise denies the claim.According to the counterclaim, during a meeting with the lawyer in January, Hutchinson questioned her about a complaint she made about the firm’s workload and his “availability”.At that meeting, he allegedly “intimidated and threatened” her, deprived her of her liberty and “freedom to move”, and caused her to become fearful and distressed, according to court documents, which do not provide any further detail.Hutchinson denies this, saying only that the pair met and discussed the complaint.In court documents, Hutchinson agrees that an internal complaint about that meeting was subsequently filed by the lawyer – who left work in March after filing a WorkCover application – but denies its accuracy or that there was a legitimate basis for it.‘Political activity’ deniedThe counterclaim against Hutchinson makes accusations about his involvement with theLiberal party, with nine alleged examples since 2013 outlined. These are described as “engaging in another profession”, in breach of the partnership agreement.He is also accused of starting a defamation case in 2021 that was related to his political activity, but Hutchinson denies this.Hutchinson is alleged to have carried on “the political activity” by using the practice to meet people, using his work email, and using his personal assistant and other staff. He is also alleged to have been absent during work hours to “carry on the political activity”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He also denies any of the firm’s resources were used in this way.Hutchinson and Con Nottas, the firm’s managing partner who is also one of the partners involved in the legal dispute, were both contacted for comment.According to an order made by Justice Richard Attiwill last month, mediation in the matter must be completed by 20 March 2026, ahead of a directions hearing on 27 March.Guardian Australia understands the Liberal party was aware of the case prior to Hutchinson’s preselection, although a spokesperson declined to confirm this.“We cannot comment on matters before the court,” the party spokesperson said.The current MP for Croydon, David Hodgett, is retiring. Hutchinson was formally endorsed by the party in late November.Before his preselection, theLiberal party executive extended the preselection periodto allow more candidates to come forward in four seats.Croydon was considered “winnable” by Labor, with some party members encouraged by the results in the overlapping federal seat of Deakin, which they unexpectedly won in May.Explore more on these topicsVictorian politicsLiberal partyVictorianewsShareReuse this content"

The government has spent £92bn on interest payments so far for this financial year, it said.Bond yield graphicThe higher cost of borrowing for the UK comes despite the fundamentals of its economy being stronger than countries with lower borrowing costs. The UK’s debt-to-GDP ratio is 101%, compared with 122% in the US and 237% in Japan, and the government is planning to halve the amount it borrows each year by the end of this parliament.The problem is that bond traders think the UK is not good at keeping to its fiscal policies, the IPPR said. The mini-budget in 2022 under the Liz Truss administration “showed how quickly a UK government could bypass the fiscal framework”, the thinktank said. It added that in the years leading up to this event, successive chancellors had “repeatedly changed, missed or redefined their own fiscal rules” or changed themselves, with seven different chancellors from 2016 up to the 2024 election. A “lack of trust in stated fiscal policy has set in, as actions have spoken louder than words,” it said.However, the autumn budget prompted the UK premium against the eurozone to almost halve. William Ellis, a senior economist at IPPR, said: “The premium on UK borrowing costs appears to be easing, showing that markets are responding to growing confidence in the government’s fiscal approach. Sticking to its fiscal plans could save the exchequer billions and free up fiscal space in the future.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I personally have the will and readiness for this,” he added.Trump made the comments in a rambling interview with Politico published earlier on Tuesday. “They haven’t had an election in a long time,” said the US president. “You know, they talk about a democracy, but it gets to a point where it’s not a democracy any more.”Zelenskyy’s five-year term expired in May last year, but the Ukrainian constitution prohibits elections in wartime, and even his political opponents have said repeatedly that the security and political considerations do not allow for holding an election during wartime.“It would only cause harm,” said Serhiy Rakhmanin, an MP from the opposition Holos party. “He’s the commander-in-chief, and the country is in a position where we don’t have that luxury, whatever issues we might have with him. It would only help the enemy,” he added.Zelenskyy said the two key questions to solve would be the logistical one of how soldiers, the millions of displaced people, and those living under occupation would be able to vote, and secondly, how to hold elections legally, given martial law is in effect.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He also said Kyiv was ready for an energy ceasefire if Russia agrees.Over the weekend, Trump’s son Donald Jrsaid at a conference in Dohathat Zelenskyy was prolonging the war because he was worried he would otherwise lose power. He also suggested Trump might “walk away” from Ukraine if the war does not end soon. “It’s not correct. But it’s not exactly wrong,” said Trump, when asked about his son’s claim.The US has indicated that Ukraine should give up the Donbas region to achieve peace, a move which would be highly unpopular in Ukraine. There is also no sign that Russia is ready to agree to a deal, even one which would appear to be beneficial to Moscow.Explore more on these topicsUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyDonald TrumpUS foreign policyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The Conservatives and Reform UK have called for withdrawal from the convention altogether.But writing for the Guardian,the prime minister said that updating the interpretation of the convention was urgently requiredto confront the challenges posed by mass migration – and far-right forces that sought to divide mainstream opinion across Europe.“The best way of fighting against the forces of hate and division, is to show that mainstream, progressive politics can fix this problem,” he wrote in a joint article with the Danish leader, Mette Frederiksen.“Listening to legitimate concerns and acting on them is what our politics is about. That’s not empty populism, it’s democracy. We are determined to show that our societies can act with compassion while upholding law and order, and fairness.”The two leaders called on European allies to go further in tackling the shared challenge of migration by modernising the ECHR to reflect the challenges of the 21st century.“Europe has faced big tests before and we have overcome them by acting together. Now we must do so again. Otherwise, the forces that seek to divide us will grow stronger.“So our message is this: as responsible, progressive governments we will deliver the change that people are crying out for. We will control our borders to protect our democracies – and make our nations stronger than ever in the years to come.”View image in fullscreenStarmer’s government will be represented at the Strasbourg meeting by David Lammy (left).Photograph: Thomas Krych/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockThe UK has sought to emulateDenmark’s hardline asylum model. Last year, the number of people being granted asylum in the country was the lowest in 40 years, excluding 2020 which was during the Covid pandemic.The government, which will be represented at the Strasbourg meeting byDavid Lammy, the justice secretary, and Richard Hermer, the attorney general, is understood to be considering all options to update the implementation of the ECHR.The proposed political declaration resulting from the summit would carry significant political weight and, if it garnered enough signatories, could directly influence how the European court of human rights interprets and applies ECHR rights.The government has already said it will legislate to clarify how article 8, the right to a private life, is interpreted in the domestic courts in regard to immigration rules.Lammy is expected to argue on Wednesday that the ECHR could also be reinterpreted to limit the scope of rights under article 3, which prohibits torture and “degrading treatment”.This could, for example, include higher thresholds for prison conditions or access to healthcare abroad where it currently prevents extradition or deportation from the UK.The deputy prime minister will reassert the UK’s commitment to the ECHR, saying that pulling out would be a “fake solution” that would undermine every international agreement on national and border security.At the summit, he is expected to say: “We must strike a careful balance between individual rights and the public’s interest, otherwise we risk a loss of confidence in the convention, and in human rights themselves.“The definition of ‘family life’ can’t be stretched to prevent the removal of people with no right to remain in the country … The threshold of ‘inhuman and degrading treatment’ must be constrained to the most serious issues.“States must be able to take proportionate decisions on the removal of foreign criminals, so that we renew the convention’s democratic foundation.”The sweeping changes to the UK asylum system came against the backdrop of Nigel Farage’s Reform UK attracting support because of the failure of successive governments to stop unauthorised small boat crossings in the Channel and unease about the use of hotels to house asylum seekers.They include measures such as forcing people with refugee status to return to their home country if it becomes safe, making people who arrive illegally wait 20 years before they can apply for permanent settlement, and revoking the statutory legal duty to provide asylum-seeker support, including housing and weekly allowances.Ministers say the government will introduce new safe and legal routes to the UK as a way to reduce the number of dangerous journeys in small boats across the Channel, although these routes will be capped.Some Labour MPs, charities and legal experts have warned that if a country such as the UK waters down the application of article 3, then less scrupulous nations could follow suit, with horrific implications.Veronika Fikfak, a professor of international law at University College London, said a change to the anti-torture provisions within the ECHR “touches the very core” of the convention.“Prohibition of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment is an absolute right. It allows for no balancing. There is no margin of appreciation for states, nor any deference to them,” she said.Lammy will meet ministers from 45 other countries to discuss possible changes at the meeting. Nine member states, including Italy and Denmark, signed a letter in May calling for the scope of the ECHR to be limited.Explore more on these topicsHuman rightsKeir StarmerEuropeRefugeesImmigration and asylumDavid LammyThe far rightnewsShareReuse this content"

The previous night, feminist campaigners had disrupted his show with shouts of: “Abittan, rapist!”Before Sunday’s performance, Macron asked him how he was feeling. When he said he was feeling scared, she referred to the protesters as “sales connes”(dirty or stupid bitches) and adding that if they reappeared, “we’ll toss them out”.Her office said in a statement that she had been trying to calm his nerves: “As the video shows, Mrs Macron’s only intention was to reassure an artist who, in his dressing room before going on stage, had just told her: ‘I’m scared’ because his show had been disrupted the previous evening.“In no way is she attacking a cause. She does, however, disapprove of the radical methods used to prevent an artist from performing on stage, as was the case on Saturday night.”The feminist campaign group Nous Toutes (“All of Us”) said its activists had disrupted Abittan’s show to protest against what it described as “the culture of impunity” around sexual violence in France.Magistrates terminated the investigation of the 2021 rape allegation against Abittan in 2024 due to lack of evidence, a decision confirmed on appeal in January this year, according to French media.In a statement on Instagram, Nous Toutes said: “We denounce venues that roll out a red carpet for men accused of rape, normalising sexist and sexual violence. It is a public insult to the victims. Victims, we believe you. Rapists, we do not forgive you!”Politicians on the left criticised the use of a sexist slur and some said Brigitte Macron should apologise. The former Socialist president François Hollande told RTL radio: “There’s a problem of vulgarity.” The Green leader, Marine Tondelier, said the comments were “extremely serious” and should not have been made by a first lady.Several celebrities voiced support for the feminist campaigners by adopting the insult for themselves with the hashtag #salesconnes. The actor and director Judith Godrèche, aleading voice in France’s #MeToo movementwho has filed complaints against two film directors for sexually assaulting her when she was a teenager, posted on social media: “Me too – I’m also asalle conne(dirty, stupid bitch) and I support all the others.”The singer and actor Camélia Jordana posted a picture of herself with #saleconne across her forehead.The Green senator Mélanie Vogel posted on social media: “And a very good day to all the stupid bitches of our country,” while the secretary general of the moderate CFDT trade union, Marylise Léon, said the comments were “inappropriate and crude”.On the French far right, however, the National Rally lawmaker Jean-Philippe Tanguy said Brigitte Macron’s comments had been made in private. “If each of us were filmed backstage saying things with friends, I think there would be plenty to comment on,” he told the broadcaster BFMTV. “All of this is very hypocritical.”Explore more on these topicsBrigitte MacronParisProtestFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The MoD said it would not be commenting further on Tuesday.The prime minister expressed his “deepest sympathy and condolences”. Keir Starmer said on X: “My deepest sympathy and condolences to the family of the member of our armed forces who sadly lost their life today. Their service and sacrifice will never be forgotten.”A Ukrainian memorial produced by the Kyiv war museum has counted that 40 Britons have died defending Ukraine, a higher number than previously thought. None are known to have been serving in the British military at the time of their death.Starmer has said the UK would be willing to deploy “boots on the ground and planes in the air” as part of a multinational peacekeeping mission in the event of a durable cessation of hostilities in Ukraine, but there is little immediate sign of Russia agreeing to a ceasefire.In a post on X, the defence secretary, John Healey, said: “Devastated by the death of a UK service person in Ukraine. My thoughts are with their family, friends and colleagues as they grieve for a loved one. Our hearts go out to them.”The shadow defence secretary, James Cartlidge, said: “I am deeply saddened to hear the tragic news that a member of the UK armed forces died this morning in Ukraine.

That is significantly less than the peak of 14,000 children in August, but much more than the child malnutrition rate during the previous ceasefire in February and March of this year.“It’s still a shockingly high number,” Ingram said,briefing journalists by videofrom Gaza.In October, about 8,300 pregnant and breastfeeding women were also hospitalised for acute malnutrition.“This pattern is a grave warning and it will likely result in low birthweight babies being born in the Gaza Strip for months to come,” Ingram added.“This is not over. Generations of families, including those being born now into this ceasefire, have been forever altered by what was inflicted upon them.”Unicef and other UN agencies say that aid deliveries crossing into Gaza have increased since the height of the war, but are still completely inadequate in relation to the humanitarian needs.An average of 140 aid trucks a day have crossed so far in December, in convoys organised by the UN and the International Organisation for Migration. That is well below the target of 600 trucks a day set as part of the ceasefire.Those figures do not include bilateral aid donations and commercial shipments, which have increased more sharply than UN-coordinated deliveries under the ceasefire. They have brought down market prices for many commodities, but they remain beyond the reach of the overwhelming majority of people in Gaza who have had no income for more than two years and who have depleted their savings.Since the ceasefire, aid has been coordinated through a multinational hub called the Civil-Military Coordination Centre led by the US and Israel and involving representatives of other countries supporting the ceasefire. However,diplomats and aid officials saythat the Israeli army still has the final say in what is allowed in to Gaza.The UN reportedthat out of eight humanitarian convoys coordinated with Israeli authorities on Sunday, only four had been facilitated.Explore more on these topicsGazaMalnutritionUnited NationsHumanitarian responseMiddle East and north AfricaPalestineIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

On questioning, he said he drank an average of eight energy drinks a day.The case, reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports, also prompted doctors to call for tighter regulation of sales and advertising of energy drinks.On admission to hospital, the patient’s blood pressure was 254/150mmHg, which doctors said was extremely high. He was given drugs to lower his blood pressure.But once back home, his blood pressure rose again and remained persistently high, despite the ramping up of his drug treatment.On further investigation, doctors discovered the extent of his use of energy drinks, totalling 1,200mg of caffeine a day. The recommended maximum intake is 400mg.He was asked to give up his daily habit, after which his blood pressure returned to normal. Blood pressure lowering drugs were no longer needed.“It was therefore thought to be likely that the patient’s consumption of highly potent energy drinks was, at least in part, a contributive factor to his secondary hypertension (high blood pressure) and in turn his stroke,”the doctors wrote in BMJ Case Reports.However, he did not fully recover. Speaking anonymously, he said: “I obviously wasn’t aware of the dangers drinking energy drinks were causing to myself. [I] have been left with numbness [in my] left-hand side hand and fingers, foot and toes even after eight years.”The doctors said: “There is regular publicity about health effects of alcohol and smoking, but little about the increasingly prevalent modifiable lifestyle trend of energy drink (ED) consumption.”They added: “As our case and discussion illustrate, it is possible that both acute and chronic intake of EDs may increase CVD (cardiovascular disease) and stroke risk, and importantly, this may be reversible.“While the current evidence is not conclusive, given the accumulating literature, the high morbidity and mortality associated with stroke and CVD and the well-documented adverse health effects of high-sugar drinks, we propose that increased regulation of ED sales and advertising campaigns (which are often targeted at younger ages) could be beneficial to the future cerebrovascular and cardiovascular health of our society.“Additionally, healthcare professionals should consider specific questioning related to ED consumption in young patients presenting with stroke or unexplained hypertension.”Explore more on these topicsHealthStrokeHeart diseaseFood & drink industrynewsShareReuse this content"

But until now there was no high-quality evidence on its prevalence.The study, by the Royal College of Emergency Medicine’s (RCEM) trainee emergency research network (Tern), analysed five snapshots taken from 165 A&E departments in March this year.It found 17.7% of patients were receiving care in escalation areas, classed as anywhere not routinely used for care unless capacity in emergency departments is breached.This included corridors, waiting rooms, doubled-up cubicles, offices, cupboards and ambulances waiting outside to offload for more than 15 minutes.Writing in the medical journalEmergency Medicine, the researchers said: “National guidance states escalation area use is not acceptable; this research demonstrates it is routine.” It also posed “a significant patient safety issue”, they added.Dr Ian Higginson, the president of the RCEM, said the study “reinforces that the shameful practice of corridor care is endemic in emergency departments in the UK”.He added: “The stark picture this paper paints reflects the stories we hear from our members nationwide – the volume of which are growing as we head into winter. Just this week, one member told us of a patient having to wait two days for a bed in their department.“It’s important to note that these patients may be elderly, vulnerable, have mental health issues, or be children. They have been failed by successive governments.”In October,the Guardian reportedhow almost 150,000 people aged 90 and over in England were forced to wait longer than 12 hours in A&E every year, with some experiencing “truly shocking” waits of several days stuck in corridors.Older people were also being left in their own excrement and wet beds for hours, denied pain relief and forced to watch and hear other patients die next to them because they end up waiting so long for care.Higginson said it was “worrying” that the snapshots for the new study were taken in March and not at the height of winter, which “shows that corridor care is an issue all year round”.“We are very concerned about the harm associated with long waits in emergency departments and how it puts patients’ lives at risk – for every 72 patients who wait between eight and 12 hours before admission, there is one excess death,” he added. “This should not be happening in a wealthy country.”Higginson also said it was “abundantly clear” that the crisis had not been given the priority it deserved by the government. “It can’t be blamed on hiccups or flu,” he added. “We fear this winter we will see gridlock.”Last week the health secretary, Wes Streeting, promised to end corridor care in hospitals by the next general election “if not sooner”.The Department ofHealthand Social Care said corridor care was unacceptable, undignified and had no place in the NHS.“That is why we will be publishing corridor waiting figures for the first time, so we can take the steps needed to eradicate it from our health service,” a spokesperson said. “Sunlight is the best disinfectant.”It would “take time” to “turn around the shocking situation we inherited”, but there were already some “green shoots of recovery,” the spokesperson added.Explore more on these topicsHospitalsNHSHealthHealth policynewsShareReuse this content"

Better news: the chancellor may have something to do with it. Better still: some economists think there’s more to come.Let’s not get carried away, though. The UK is still paying a painful premium on its borrowing costs, as the Institute for Public Policy Research thinktank illustrates. Since last year’s general election the yield on 10-year government gilts is up almost 70 basis points – or seven-tenths of 1% – compared with US Treasury bonds, and the increase versus the eurozone is almost 25 basis points. The gaps are wider for 30-year bonds and the consequences are real. IPPR calculates that if the premium could be reduced to zero, the Treasury would save as much as £7bn a year until 2029-30.A key point here is that the premium can’t be wholly explained by factors that are widely acknowledged and beyond the government’s control: the reduced appetite for gilts among mature UK defined-benefit pension funds, for example, andthe Bank of England’s steady sellingof the gilts it bought in the years after the great financial crisis.The reality behind the yield premium is that the UK isn’t getting much credit for having debt and deficit ratios that, while definitely not pretty, are less horrible than those of many other G7 countries. The explanation will relate to some combination of the market’s doubts over long-term inflation and the government’s willingness to stick to its fiscal plans.So the improvement in sentiment – if that is what is – in the last few months is significant if it continues. IPPR suggests there was a turning point atthe Labour conference in September, when Reeves said “there is nothing progressive, nothing Labour” in spending almost £1 in every £10 of public money on debt interest. She also made it clear that after U-turns on welfare spending she was in the business of rebuilding headroom against her fiscal rules.Bond yield graphic“The government’s strong recommitment to its fiscal plans does appear to be reducing costs more recently,” the IPPR report says, noting the fall of 20 basis points since the conference.It’s more of a struggle to detect a serious move sincelast month’s budget. IPPR sees “early/tentative signs” of further progress but 10-year gilt yields still stand almost exactly where they were on the day at 4.5%.On one hand, the market clearly likes the comfort blanket of £22bn of fiscal headroom and the (slightly) greater credibility on the ambition to halve the annual deficit over the life of the parliament. On the other, the back-loaded nature of Reeves’ tax rises creates worry about whether they will happen. Meanwhile, the Office for Budget Responsibility downgraded the outlook for growth, and the communications chaos in the run-up to the budget hardly boosted confidence.But there is a sketch of a possible positive narrative here for Reeves. Financial markets expect the Bank of England to cut interest rates three times by the end of next year as inflation in food prices and energy cools. One can already see banks scrapping a bit harder on mortgage rates. A further boost would come if gilts markets were less punishing of the UK and if the political risk premium were to reduce further. It would help, as IPPR suggests, if the Bank, as the biggest owner of gilts, was a less enthusiastic seller.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A slow burn of a steepening yield curve and weaker sterling could morph into a more serious confidence crisis.” It points to “no sign of a sustainable growth driver”, which is alsothe view in much of the business world.Timing matters if, as the Westminster watchers say, next May’s local elections are the next critical political moment. If the UK’s yield premium continues to fall towards the level the government inherited, Reeves has the gist of an “it’s working, be patient” narrative. But it does need to happen.Explore more on these topicsGovernment borrowingNils Pratley on financeBondsGiltsEconomicsRachel ReevescommentShareReuse this content"

CNBCreported in Junethat Google was using YouTube videos to train its Gemini andVeo3 models. Google said it used a subset of videos for training purposes.In September, YouTube said: “We use content uploaded to YouTube to improve the product experience for creators and viewers across YouTube and Google, including through machine learning and AI applications.”The EU’s competition chief, Teresa Ribera, said: “AI is bringing remarkable innovation and many benefits for people and businesses acrossEurope, but this progress cannot come at the expense of the principles at the heart of our societies.”A spokesperson for Google said: “This complaint risks stifling innovation in a market that is more competitive than ever. Europeans deserve to benefit from the latest technologies and we will continue to work closely with the news and creative industries as they transition to the AI era.”The EU’s investigation is the latest in a series of challenges to US big tech companies in recent years.In September, EU regulatorsissued a fine of almost €3bn (£2.6bn) against Google, claiming that it favoured its own digital advertising services over rivals.

President Xi responded positively!”Trump said the Department of Commerce was finalising the details and that he was planning to make the same offer to other chip companies, including Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Intel. Nvidia’s H200 chips are the company’s second most powerful, and far more advanced than the H20, which was originally designed as a lower-powered model for the Chinese market that would not breach restrictions, but which the US banned anyway in April.The president said the US would receive 25% of the proceeds, more than the15% previously agreed towith Nvidia in an earlier deal to lift restrictions. This deal follows similar unorthodox plans for the federal government to take a financial cut from private business dealings. In August, Trump said the US wouldreceive a 10% stakein the tech company Intel. Some lawmakers havequestioned the legalityof such arrangements.According to the Hill, the Democratic senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Andy Kim of New Jerseysent lettersto the commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, last week outlining their concerns over selling these chips to China and saying it risked powering the country’s “surveillance, censorship and military applications”.They wrote: “I urge you to stop ignoring the input of bipartisan members of Congress and your own experts in order to cut deals that trade away America’s national security.”On social media, Warren called for Huang to appear before Congress to testify under oath.Huang has worked closely with Trump since the inauguration and has made several trips to the White House. The CEO attended the president’s AI summit in July, met Trump as recently as last week and was even a guest at the White House dinner for the Saudi crown price, Mohammed bin Salman. Huang haspledged to invest $500bn in AI infrastructurein the US over the next four years.Huang has visitedChinaseveral times, meeting officials and Chinese tech executives, as US bans were variously lifted and reintroduced. Earlier this year, China imposed its own controls on the imports of Nvidia chips, with top tech firms reportedly instructed to cancel orders, citing national security concerns and confidence in China’s domestic chip development.In October, Huang said Nvidia has gone from having 95% of the Chinese market to having none, and called the bans a “strategic mistake”.Selling chips to China, the world’s second largest economy, could now mean a windfall worth billions of dollars for Nvidia, which is already valued at $4.5tn.An Nvidia spokesperson said: “We applaud President Trump’s decision.” He said offering the H200 chips “to approved commercial customers, vetted by the Department of Commerce, strikes a thoughtful balance that is great for America”.The Nvidia spokesperson and Trump said the move would support US jobs and manufacturing.In his Truth Social post, Trump condemned the Biden administration’s policies, which imposed strict export controls on powerful chips. The Biden administration had said withholding such technology from China bolstered US competition, protected national security and hampered AI development in China.“That Era is OVER!” Trump wrote. “My Administration will always put America FIRST.”On Tuesday afternoon, China’s foreign ministry said it had noted the reports. “China has always adhered to the principle that China and the United States can achieve mutual benefit and win-win results through cooperation,” the spokesperson said. A final decision from Beijing is still in the works, according to areport from the Financial Times. The newspaper said regulators may still opt to limit access to H200 chips in China so that the country can continue to focus on its own technology.Ma Jihua, a telecom industry analyst, told the state media outlet the Global Times that years of US curbs on AI exports had “provided a rare chance of China’s domestic chip industry to grow and catch up”.Explore more on these topicsNvidiaTechnology sectorTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsChinaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

They will also look at producing vans together.“We know we’re in a fight for our lives in our industry,” Jim Farley told journalists in Paris. “There is no better example than here in Europe.”The rapid rise of Chinese electric carmakers has put enormous pressure on European and US rivals, who have been slower to develop battery-powered vehicles. Manufacturers such asBYD and Chery have gained market shareby producing well-reviewed electric cars at much lower costs than western manufacturers.Producing smaller electric vehicles cheaply has been particularly tricky for European carmakers, who have tended to focus their efforts on larger cars that have space for a bigger battery.The two cars announced on Tuesday will be based on Renault’s Ampere electric car blueprint but will be designed by Ford and carry the US brand. Renault had previouslyplanned to sell shares of its Ampere unitas a separate company dedicated to electric car technology, but it abandoned that plan last year as investor interest waned.The companies said Renault’s plant at Douai in northern France would produce the vehicles. Theplant makes the Renault 5, an electric car that has won plaudits for its design and relatively low cost.Ford has struggled in Europe in recent years.Farley announced 4,000 job cutslast year, including 800 in the UK, and cut back planned production of the new electric Explorer and Capri models, citing the “weak economic situation and lower-than-expected demand for electric cars”.Farley also criticised European electric car sales targets this week, writing in theFinancial Timesthat the continent’s carmakers faced “the world’s most aggressive carbon mandates” at the same time as “a flood of state-subsidised EV imports from China”.Renault’s chief executive, François Provost, said: “In the long term, combining our strengths withFordwill make us more innovative and more responsive in a fast-changing European automotive market.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The agreement also stipulates that the United States mustannually allocate 1.5m acre-feet of waterfrom the Colorado River to Mexico.The water from the Rio Grande is used to support agriculture in Texas and other US border states.Trump unveils $12bn aid package for US farmers amid tariff falloutRead moreIn a post on Truth Social on Monday, the president said thatMexico“owes” the US 800,000 acre-feet of water due to violations of the treaty over the past five years.He demanded Mexico release 200,000 acre-feet of water before 31 December, and more “soon after”.The lack of water was hurting crops and livestock in Texas, Trump said.“As of now, Mexico is not responding, and it is very unfair to our U.S. Farmers who deserve this much needed water,” Trump added. “That is why I have authorized documentation to impose a 5% Tariff on Mexico if this water isn’t released, IMMEDIATELY.”A spokesperson for Mexico’s economy ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.In April, the US agriculture secretary, Brooke Rollins, said that Mexico had agreed to increase its water shipments to Texas to help make up a shortfall under the 1944 treaty.Mexico has argued that it is under drought conditions that have strained the country’s water resources. While climate crisis-induced drought plays a large role in the Rio Grande’s depletion, overconsumption and mismanagement have also contributed to its current state. A recentWorld Wildlife Studyfound that 52% of the water consumed from the Rio Grande is unsustainable, meaning that it is contributing to overall depletion of reservoirs, aquifers and the river itself.The study also found that water shortages have led to the loss of 18% of farmland in the river’s headwaters in Colorado, 36% along the Rio Grande in New Mexico, and 49% in the Pecos River tributary in New Mexico and Texas.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In May 2024, 10 US lawmakers from bipartisan congressional districtsurged Congress to withhold money from Mexico until it delivered the water. The group wrote that in addition to jeopardising crops, “the lack of reliable water delivery affects municipalities and threatens the quality of life for many American citizens living along our border”.Texas’s agricultural industry has seen significant consequences from lack of water, including theclosure of the state’s last sugar processing mill.Trump’s threat to Mexico followsthe unveiling of a $12bn economic assistance packageon Monday for farmers negatively affected by the tariff-induced trade wars.“This relief will provide much-needed certainty to farmers as they get this year’s harvest to market and look ahead to next year’s crops, and it’ll help them continue their efforts to lower food prices for American families,” Trump said during a roundtable discussion of American agriculture.About $11bn of the $12bn relief package will come from the agriculture department’s Farmer Bridge Assistance (FBA) program. The money will go to producers of corn, cotton, sorghum, soybeans, rice, wheat and other row crops,according to the USDA’s announcement, and is expected to be released in February 2026. The remaining $1bn will be reserved for producers not covered by the FBA program, including specialty crops and sugar, but the USDA said that the timeline for those payments was still under development.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsTrump administrationUS politicsMexicoAmericasTariffsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

The Liverpool team then followed suit by inflicting Inter’s first European home defeat since September 2022. A brooding superstar with a bruised ego watched from afar while Liverpool fans serenaded Slot at San Siro.Salah might well have taken the decisive 88th-minute penalty had he not talked himself out of the trip to San Siro, another legend of the game that is showing its age. Instead it fell to Dominik Szoboszlai, the friend Salah had in effect argued should not be playing on the right ahead of him, to deliver a precious victory for Slot after Alessandro Bastoni had been penalised for pulling Florian Wirtz’s shirt in the box.Arne Slot full of praise for Liverpool efforts after gritty win against InterRead moreIt was a soft penalty and a hard slog of a game.Liverpool, and especially their head coach, will not care a jot after the trials of the past few days. Slot needed at the bare minimum a committed display from his team to counter allegations that Salah’s criticisms are shared by others in the dressing room. He got commitment and much more. The visitors produced a vastly improved defensive performance and worked tirelessly to stifle a dangerous Inter team that have reached two of the past three Champions League finals.A deserved point appeared to be Liverpool’s reward until the video assistant referee sent the German official Felix Zwayer to the pitchside monitor to review Bastoni’s infringement. Szoboszlai swept his spot‑kick high into Yann Sommer’s top corner and Inter’s 18-match unbeaten home run in Europe was over. The release for Liverpool was palpable.Salah had given Liverpool no option but to leave him out of the trip to Italy. Slot’s authority over the rest of the squad would have been seriously undermined had he travelled. The timing of the interview at Elland Road was bad enough with Slot, Salah and his teammates all struggling – and supposedly sticking together in adversity – but made worse by the limited options available to Liverpool in Milan. Slot was unable to fill his bench with Cody Gakpo, Federico Chiesa and Wataru Endo also absent. Without the source of 46 Champions League goals for Liverpool the team’s highest goalscorer in the competition on the night was Virgil van Dijk, with five.Liverpool’s bench may have been threadbare but Slot was able to field a £204m frontline partnership in Alexander Isak and Hugo Ekitiké. The summer signings started in front of a midfield diamond in which Szoboszlai, Curtis Jones and Alexis Mac Allister all had freedom to rotate. The result was better protection for the Liverpool defence and confusion in the Inter ranks as they took around 40 minutes to work out how to counter the visitors’ altered approach.The first notable act of the night, given the circumstances, was the sound of Slot’s name being chanted by the sizeable Liverpool support high up with the gods. Salah’s song did not get an airing all night.Inter’s uncertain start was not helped by losing the midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu to injury after 11 minutes. The central defender Francesco Acerbi followed him to the treatment room with an apparent hamstring problem 20 minutes later. The captain, Lautaro Martínez, also collected an early booking for a ridiculously late foul on Andy Robertson.View image in fullscreenAlessandro Bastoni commits the foul on Florian Wirtz of Liverpool to give away the vital penalty.Photograph: Giuseppe Cottini/Getty ImagesLiverpool were controlled, measured and exploiting space around Inter’s three-man central defence. Sommer saved from Jones and Ekitiké in the first half, the latter leading to a corner from Szoboszlai that almost gave Liverpool a merited lead. Ibrahima Konaté headed home from close range after Ekitiké had flicked on. A first look at a replay showed the ball looping off Ekitiké’s arm yet it took almost four minutes for the match officials to disallow the goal. Zwayer ruled that, although the ball may have been headed on to Ekitiké by Van Dijk, the striker’s arm was in an unnatural position.Almost inevitably, Inter improved and Martínez drew a fine save from Alisson with a bullet header from Bastoni’s cross. Cristian Chivu’s team were more composed after the restart but the contest remained evenly matched and, in truth, fairly uneventful. Bastoni swiped clear in front of his own goal after a flowing Liverpool move involving Ryan Gravenberch and Isak teed up Robertson for a dangerous cross from the left. When Nicolò Barella found Martínez in space 20 yards from the Liverpool goal, Van Dijk made an important block to deny the Argentina international.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Profile settings button at the top right, then select Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Slot introduced Wirtz for the quiet Isak and Conor Bradley for Joe Gomez. Bradley made a huge impact, almost creating an immediate breakthrough for Ekitiké with his first touch and forcing Sommer to save at his near post when released clear in the box by the France international. Bradley was also the driving force behind the passage of play that led to Liverpool’s late penalty.At the end of an unedifying storm, Slot could savour the reaction from those players who clearly remain behind him.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueInternazionaleLiverpoolmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The deal would keep the National League home run leader in Philadelphia after a prolific 2025 season.Schwarber, 32, drew interest from several clubs, including the Mets, Red Sox, Orioles and Pirates, ESPN reported. Philadelphia moved late to retain him after falling in the division series to the Los Angeles Dodgers.The designated hitter hit 56 home runs and drove in 132 runs last season, finishing second in MVP voting. He has hit at least 38 home runs in each of his four years with the Phillies.Schwarber is also regarded as a key clubhouse figure and has produced consistently in the postseason, with 14 home runs in 38 playoff games for Philadelphia.The Phillies made re-signing Schwarber an offseason priority as they look to remain contenders in the National League. His agreement could help spur movement in a free-agent market that has been slow to develop.Elsewhere, three-time All-Star reliever Edwin Díaz agreed to a three-year, $69m contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers, multiple media outlets reported.The reported move allowed the defending World Series champion Dodgers to reel in the top closer on the free agent market.Díaz, 31, opted out of the remaining two years and $38m of his five- year contract he signed with the New York Mets in 2022. The Mets tendered a $22.025m qualifying offer which the right-hander declined last month.Given that Díaz reportedly signed with a new team, New York will receive a compensatory draft pick after the fourth round.New York signed right-hander Devin Williams to a three-year, $51m deal on 1 December as insurance with Díaz.One of the Mets’ most popular players, Díaz finished 6-3 with 28 saves and a 1.63 ERA in 62 relief appearances during the 2025 season.Díaz is 28-36 with a 2.82 ERA and 253 saves in 520 games (no starts) with the Seattle Mariners (2016-18) and Mets (2019-22, 2024-25).Explore more on these topicsPhiladelphia PhilliesUS sportsMLBBaseballShareReuse this content"

Police had revealed Monday that a “person of interest” was in custody but didn’t name them. It was not immediately clear if Green has an attorney. He also faces additional charges of assault and criminal possession of a weapon, police said.Boyd was shot in the abdomen just after 2am on 16 November in midtown Manhattan. Boyd, his friend and two other Jets’ players, Irvin Charles and Jamien Sherwood, had left a club and were approached by a group of men who made fun of their clothing, police told reporters at a news briefing.New York Jets player Kris Boyd in critical condition after being shot in abdomenRead moreA fight eventually broke out between the men and Boyd was shot, police said. Boyd and his friends were not armed.Boyd was hospitalized after the shooting but a few weeks later visited the Jets’ facility, surprising teammates and attending a special teams meeting.Boyd, a 29-year-old cornerback who plays mainly on special teams, was a seventh-round selection by the Minnesota Vikings in the 2019 draft after his college career at Texas. He also played for the Houston Texans and Arizona Cardinals before joining the Jets in March. He had not played for the Jets this season prior to the shooting due to a shoulder injury.During his time at Texas, Boyd said that struggles during his childhood – he lost his father and the grandmother who helped raise him – had given him a positive outlook on life.“I appreciate all the little things,”Boyd said. “Everyone always asks me why I’ve got a smile on my face. It’s because I’m not supposed to be here.”The Jets have endured a difficult season off the field. In October one of the most popular players in their history, Nick Mangold, died at the age of 41while seeking a kidney transplant. In November, Dallas Cowboys defensive end Marshawn Kneelanddied at the age of 24.Explore more on these topicsNew York JetsNFLUS sportsNew YorknewsShareReuse this content"

The bout will headline a Dazn card at Little Caesars Arena, the home of the NBA’s Pistons and NHL’s Red Wings where Shields attracteda near-sellout crowd for her most recent fightlast July.Terence Crawford dethroned over $300k fee, handing Britain’s Sheeraz title shotRead moreShields (17-0, 3 KO) and Crews-Dezurn (10-2, 2 KO) first met nearly a decade ago when theymade their professional debuts against each otheron the undercard ofAndre Ward’s victory over Sergey Kovalevin 2016. Shields won a four-round unanimous decision that night in Las Vegas, a moment she still sees as formative. “I had just come off winning two Olympic gold medals, fresh out of the amateurs, and finding an opponent was tough,” she said in a press release announcing the fight. “Franchon stepped in. I’ve grown a lot since that first victory, but me and Franchon have unfinished business that needs to be settled.”The Michigan-born star and double Olympic champion returns to action for the first time since reuniting with Salita Promotions and adding Wynn Records as a co-promotional partner. She said fighting again in her home state carries its own pressure. “Selling out Little Caesars Arena was a dream, and my fans made that come true,” she said. “Fighting in Michigan motivates me, and it also puts pressure on me because I never want to fail them.”Crews-Dezurn, who went on to become an undisputed champion at super-middleweight in 2022 before losing it to Britain’s Savannah Marshall, will move up to heavyweight for the rematch. She said the meeting comes at the right moment for both fighters. “I’ve been waiting and working a long time for this moment,” she said. “This time as established champions with great legacies. I’m daring to be even greater by going up in weight, strutting into hell so I can create my heaven.”Shields, who said she is fully healthy after what she described as injury-affected performances in recent outings, said she plans to close the rivalry decisively. “I won a unanimous decision the first time, but come February 22, I don’t have those same plans. I plan on putting Franchon Crews on her back and leaving with the KO. Franchon is elite, but I am super elite.”Promoter Dmitriy Salita said the rematch represents both fighters’ growth since their shared debut on the Ward v Kovalev card. “Nearly a decade ago, Claressa and Franchon stepped into the ring as two Olympians making their professional debuts,” he said. “Since then, both have risen to become world champions and global forces in women’s boxing.”View image in fullscreenClaressa Shields and Papoose attend the Ebony Power 100 Gala at the Beverly Hilton in November in Beverly Hills, California.Photograph: Kevin Winter/Getty ImagesShields’ return comes months after she chose to remain with the promoter who guided her from her debut onward, finalizinga minimum-guaranteed $8m multi-fight agreementwith Salita Promotions in partnership with Wynn Records. The deal followed a brief spell in which Shields explored free agency after her title defense against Lani Daniels in July.She ultimately opted to stay, saying the new arrangement offered the scale and visibility she has long pushed for in women’s boxing and aligned with her broader ambitions outside the ring.The partnership with Wynn Records – a music-focused imprint that counts several artists on its roster and marks Shields as its first athlete – is designed to blend boxing with cultural and entertainment projects. Salita called Shields “one of the defining athletes of her generation” when the pact was announced and said the collaboration aims to create opportunities that traditional promotional models do not.Shields, who had fielded interest from multiple suitors and even pursued a high-profile, unsuccessful-to-date overture to lure Laila Ali out of retirement, said the new deal reflects her intent to continue reshaping the economics and expectations surrounding women’s boxing.Explore more on these topicsClaressa ShieldsBoxingUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Since his retirementhe has coached high school football. This season he led St Michael Catholic Cardinals in his native Alabama to the Class 4A state semi-finals.The once formidable Kansas City Chiefs look old, tired and out of ideasRead moreDaniel Jones, who was enjoying a resurgence in his first season with the Colts, suffered a season-ending torn achilles in Sunday’s 36-19 loss at Jacksonville. Backup Riley Leonard, who replaced Jones, is dealing with a knee injury, although the 2025 sixth-round draft pick is expected to make the start at Seattle on Sunday. Former first-round pick Anthony Richardson suffered a broken orbital bone in October and has not been medically cleared to return. Veteran Brett Rypien is on the Colts’ practice squad.“Things happen, wacky stuff has happened in this league, your depth gets tested, your resolve gets tested as you get thrown into some adversity as a unit, as a coaching staff, as a position group,” Colts offensive coordinator Jim Bob Cooter said on Tuesday, declining to take specific questions about Rivers. “We’ve been through some fire out there, but our coaching staff’s excited to draw a plan up and teach it.”The Colts looked set for the postseason when they topped the AFC South with an 8-2 record, but have since lost three games in a row and are just outside the final playoff place in the AFC.The Colts’ remaining schedule is tough as they face four teams who look set for the postseason: the Seahawks, 49ers, Jaguars and Texans. However, ESPN reports that the team believe Rivers would give them a chance at making the postseason.After playing 16 seasons with the San Diego/Los Angeles Chargers, Rivers completed his career with the Colts in 2020. He threw for more than 4,000 yards for the 12th time in 13 seasons, tossing 24 touchdowns and 11 interceptions as the Colts made the playoffs before narrowly losing to the Buffalo Bills in the wildcard round.Rivers ranks seventh inNFLhistory for passing yards (63,440) and sixth in touchdown passes (421).Explore more on these topicsIndianapolis ColtsNFLUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

One play later, Hurts threw deep to Jahan Dotson in double-coverage only to have Jefferson keep his feet in bounds on the game-ending play.Hurts threw four interceptions and the Eagles committed five turnovers. The defending Super Bowl champions lost their season-worst third in a row and fell to 8-5.Dicker’s 46-yard field goal with 12 seconds left sent the game to overtime tied 19-19 after Jake Elliott’s 44-yarder minutes earlier had put the Eagles ahead 19-16. Dicker was perfect on all five of his field goals.Elliott had four field goals of his own at SoFi Stadium, where the Eagles’ green-and-white jerseys were a significant presence in the crowd.Saquon Barkley gave the Eagles their first lead with a 52-yard touchdown to start the fourth quarter that made it 16-13. He finished the game with 122 yards on 20 carries.Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert was 12 of 26 for 138 yards, one touchdown and one interception while playing with a surgically repaired non-throwing left hand. He also ran for 66 yards on 10 carries. Hurts was 21 of 40 for 240 yards and four interceptions.Hurts’s extraordinary sequence of events came with 8:30 left in the second quarter. He was intercepted by Chargers defensive tackle Da’Shawn Hand at the Los Angeles 17. Eagles running back Will Shipley quickly chased down Hand and forced a fumble. The ball squirted forward and back into the hands of ... Hurts. But as quickly as he could grab the ball, Hurts had it punched out by Chargers defensive tackle Jamaree Caldwell. After the ball rolled another 10 yards in Los Angeles’ favor, Chargers linebacker Troy Dye recovered the ball, bringing the chaotic play to an end. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, Hurts is the first player in NFL history to turn the ball over twice on one play.Jalen Hurts threw an INT, recovered the fumble, and then fumbled again.😭😭😭pic.twitter.com/t54X4lslfI— Dov Kleiman (@NFL_DovKleiman)December 9, 2025“Not the way we drew it up,” Herbert said of his team’s close victory. “But the battle in these guys is so much fun and I’m so honored to be part of this team, they never quit.”According to Next Gen Stats, the win means the Chargers, second in the AFC West, have a 76% chance of making the playoffs. The Eagles still lead the NFC East ahead of the Cowboys (6-6-1) and have a 93% chance of reaching the postseason, according to Next Gen, mainly thanks to their weak remaining schedule which includes two games against the 3-10 Commanders and one against the 2-11 Raiders.

At 38, Messi is not the oldest MVP inMLShistory – that distinction also goes to Preki, who was the oldest MVP in the history of North American professional sports when he won the award at age 40 in 2003.There wasa case to be madeagainst Messi getting the MVP award in 2024 in an injury-hit season in which he played in just 55% of Miami’s games – the lowest share of a team’s games played by an MVP winner in the history of North American professional sports. However, there were no such questions in 2025. Messi put together the best attacking season in MLS history, serving as the focal point of Miami’s star-studded lineup. The MVP awards regular season performance, but it’s worth noting that Messi and Miami competed on five fronts in 2025, setting an MLS record for games played in a calendar year with 58.Though Vela still owns the regular season goal contributions record, Messi smashed Vela’s record for goal contributions across the regular season and playoffs, with 61 compared to Vela’s 52. He was especially effective in the playoffs, in which he scored six goals with seven assists in Miami’s six-game run to the MLS Cup, in which he was named MVP after a two-assist performance. This was all a continuation of his dominance down the home stretch of the regular season, scoring 10 goals with nine assists in Miami’s last eight games.The other finalists for the MVP award announced by MLS were LAFC’s Denis Bouanga, Dan Diego FC’s Anders Dreyer, FC Cincinnati midfielder Evander, and Nashville SC striker Sam Surridge. In another season, any of those candidates might have had a solid case to win the award. But amid Messi’s dominance, the choice was clear.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Infantino even presented Trump with the inaugural Fifa peace prize at the World Cup draw in Washington DC last Friday.Infantino’s lickspittle World Cup draw promises a tournament autocrats will loveRead moreFairSquare, a group which seeks to promote greater accountability in sport, has written a letter of complaint to Fifa’s ethics committee alleging comments made by Infantino about Trump – and the process followed to award him the peace prize – were in breach ofFifarules. In October, Infantino used his Instagram account to say Trump “definitely deserves” the Nobel Peace Prize.After a video about Trump was played at the draw before he received the Fifa peace prize, Infantino remarked: “This is what we want from a leader … you definitely deserve the first Fifa peace prize for your action for what you have obtained in your way but you obtained it in an incredible way and you can always count, Mr President, on my support.”Infantino said in a November interview at the American Business Forum in Miami that “we should all support what [Trump] is doing [in the US] because I think it’s looking pretty good”.FairSquare’s letter, first reported by the Athletic and seen by PA Media, also referenced an Instagram post from Infantino on 20 January, the day of Trump’s inauguration. “Together we will make not only America great again, but also the entire world,” Infantino said at the conclusion of a video message.FairSquare also called on the Fifa ethics committee to investigate how Trump came to be awarded the Fifa peace prize. “The award of a prize of this nature to a sitting political leader is in and of itself a clear breach of Fifa’s duty of neutrality,” the FairSquare letter stated.FairSquare said that based on Fifa’s own statutes, the decision to introduce such a prize should have been taken by the Fifa Council. “The Fifa president does not have the authority to unilaterally dictate the organisation’s mission, strategic direction, policies and values,” the letter stated.Nicholas McGeehan, FairSquare’s programme director, said: “This complaint is about a lot more than Infantino’s support for President Donald Trump’s political agenda.“More broadly this is about how Fifa’s absurd governance structure has allowed Gianni Infantino to openly flout the organisation’s rules and act in ways that are both dangerous and directly contrary to the interests of the world’s most popular sport.”Fifa has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsFootball politicsFifaWorld CupWorld Cup 2026Gianni InfantinoDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Instead they supplied more evidence that they lack the resilience for aChampions Leaguetilt that may now have to be tackled the hard way. This damaging late defeat completed a grim week on the road and had implications for the longer-term picture. They are staring down the barrel of a February playoff that could stretch Enzo Maresca’s side, active almost year-round, to the very limit.Atalanta twice punished weak defending and, crucially, preyed on their opponents’ inability to overcome setbacks. It is a problem Chelsea cannot quite shrug off and, at this level, such recidivism comes at a cost. When Charles De Ketelaere, the game’s outstanding player, blasted in a deflected winner after being invited to take aim they could hardly claim not to have been warned.Szoboszlai steps up in place of Salah to sink Inter as Liverpool fans sing Slot’s nameRead moreThe tone of the occasion had shifted with Gianluca Scamacca’s 55th‑minute equaliser, until which pointChelseaappeared to have dulled the home threat. They were looking more likely to score another of their own when the hulking former West Ham striker somehow drifted away from their centre-backs to nod De Ketelaere’s cross past a horribly exposed Robert Sánchez. The keeper needed more help than that and it may not be unduly harsh to suggest that his manager could have provided it.It could be taken as read that Maresca would rotate so there were few eyebrows raised when he made five changes from the team that trudged forgettably through Saturdayat Bournemouth. But the half‑time substitution of Trevoh Chalobah, who was replaced by Wesley Fofana, was not straight from the textbook.Maresca explained that it was a planned move to manage Chalobah’s playing time, adding the defender was on a yellow card. He could not have foreseen that Fofana would last half an hour before succumbing to an eye injury but it highlighted the risk factor of tinkering.Fofana’s departure, caused by accidental contact from Scamacca that left him struggling for clear vision, meant Tosin Adarabioyo was next to have a go at restricting Atalanta.The hosts already scented blood and another reorganisation was hardly ideal. “It changed a little bit the plan of the game,” said Maresca, who had kept Estêvão Willian up his sleeve but had now filled his quota of changes. Chelsea were already listing. “After we conceded the goal for 1-1 we lost control of the game a little bit. I think we can avoid both goals, they’re quite easy goals.”View image in fullscreenGianluca Scamacca heads Atalanta’s equaliser past Robert Sánchez.Photograph: Alessandro Sabattini/Getty ImagesDe Ketelaere’s path to glory was certainly simplified by the extent to which Benoît Badiashile and Marc Cucurella backpedaled as he broke from midway inside Chelsea’s half and bore deep into their penalty area. One of them could have faced the Belgian down well before he got that far. Cucurella’s punishment was the snick that gave Sánchez, whose hand to the ball was not enough, little chance and left Chelsea nursing a single point from three away games in Europe.The frustration was that they had survived a stiff early examination and looked well placed to push on. Sánchez had denied Ademola Lookman and Josh Acheampong, on his first Champions League start, had earned acclaim from several teammates with a point-blank block from the same player.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The flag was initially raised when João Pedro neatly snicked in a low cross from Reece James, who had been sent to the left byline after a short-corner routine. But replays immediately made clear the decision would not survive a video assistant referee check and, within a minute, their advantage was confirmed. It was João Pedro’s first goal in this competition and a well-timed intervention given Liam Delap will spend around a month out with his shoulder injury.Fast-forward to the game’s final meaningful kick and João Pedro would be wincing, having failed to make clean contact with a glorious late volleyed chance that was aimed straight at Marco Carnesecchi. It was not as if Chelsea, for all their skittish defensive work, lacked opportunities to change the complexion. Before Scamacca escaped their clutches they had been pushing to open up an insurmountable lead, James drilling wide when given a decent sight and Jamie Gittens stinging Carnesecchi’s palms.They were made to regret not turning the screw. That emotion may be heightened if they are forced to accept a playoff spot and, more happily, beat Cardiff in the Carabao Cup quarter-final next week. Put together, those eventualities would add separate two-legged ties to their winter schedule and mean they face 21 games between now and the end of February.“We are aware, absolutely,” Maresca said of that particular spectre. “Probably with two wins you can be in the top eight.” They will need to come against Pafos and, fiendishly, at Napoli. For now, though, Chelsea must simply crave home comforts.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueAtalantaChelseamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

They did not have to extend themselves to see off a moderate challenge from Slavia Prague and although Thomas Frank was pleased to send supporters away happy for thesecond time in four dayshe will know not to get carried away given this triumph came against opponents who looked as if they would have been better off in the Europa League.Atalanta 2-1 Chelsea, Tottenham 3-0 Slavia Prague, and more: Champions League – liveRead moreSlavia,winless after the first six gamesof the league phase, were not up to much. The Czech champions offered little, conceding a bizarre own‑goal early on before giving away two soft penalties in the second half, although Frank is entitled to cling to signs of progress after a troubled start to life in N17. He will not mind that there were close to 15,000 empty seats at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Frank will prefer to dwell on his side securing only their sixth home win in all competitions this season, Xavi Simons boosting his confidence by scoring again and Spurs stepping up on the night they welcomed Son back for an emotional homecoming.However, it is perhaps indicative of the bloated nature of this competition’s new format that even Son returning for the first time since his move to LAFC last summer was not enough to fill the ground. The upper tiers were sparsely populated, which probably reflected a lack of excitement about the quality of the opposition, although there was still a huge ovation for the night’s special guest when he appeared on the pitch for his formal farewell before kick-off.It was Son, of course, who scored the first goal at this ground after Spurs moved home in 2019. The South Korean forward’s legs faded last season but he will be remembered as a legend here. A mural of him was unveiled on Tottenham High Road on Tuesday afternoon and his presence lifted the atmosphere, even if it must be pointed out that Son’s successors also did their bit to keep the mood positive.There was less than a minute on the clock when Wilson Odobert, who replaced Randal Kolo Muani on the left, flew past Tomas Holes and sent in a cross that Richarlison should have buried. Tottenham, moving the ball briskly, looked good.View image in fullscreenSlavia’s David Zima (next to No 17) headed the ball to give Tottenham the lead.Photograph: John Walton/PAFrank had to maintain momentum after his side’s win against Brentford and it helped that he did not tinker much. Archie Gray kept his place in midfield and Xavi Simons took his chance after continuing at No 10.Jindrich Stanek, the Slavia goalkeeper, was busy during the opening 15 minutes. However, the visitors carried a threat on the break. Lukas Provod tested Guglielmo Vicario from long range and Michal Sadilek missed a free header midway through the first half.There was still an edginess to Spurs. Micky van de Ven foolishly picked up a booking that rules him out of the game against Borussia Dortmund next month. Spurs are probably going to have to beat the German club if they are to finish in the top eight and avoid the complication of the playoff round but doing so will be harder with Van de Ven unavailable in central defence. “The minor negative,” Frank said. “It is what it is.”Not much else troubled Frank. Slavia trailed when Cristian Romero flicked on Pedro Porro’s corner in the 26th minute and David Zima’s failure to twist his neck enough led to the left-back sending a strange header into his own goal. “I was very happy we built on momentum from the Brentford game,” Frank said. “The team is gelling more and more.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Frank looked to preserve energy before the trip to Nottingham Forest on Sunday. He replaced Gray with Pape Sarr and brought Kudus off for Mathys Tel, who has been added to the Champions League squad as a replacement for the injured Dominic Solanke.Eager to impress, Tel soon came close to scoring.

In the 50th minute he nodded home from just inside the box from Marcus Rashford’s cross and, in the 53rd minute, the French defender jumped high in a crowded box to head the winner from a Lamine Yamal cross.“They have made it difficult for us. They sat very deep, had a lot of players on the back, which makes it tough, Lamine Yamal had two or three players on him all the time,” Pedri told Movistar Plus. “We made some adjustments at half-time, put more players up front and it worked out, we felt better and found the goals.

We have the Leuven game next week which is very important to get three points and then get us as high up the table as possible.“We should win today and we did. We had some moments in the box; we had about 15 shots and I think there were quite a few blocked shots and saves. They defended for their lives and they’ve made it hard for a lot of teams in the Champions League so far.”Arsenal’s inconsistent form in the Champions League this season – two wins and two defeats – had placed extra importance on this penultimate matchday. They will have been well aware of the threats posed by the visitors, who earned a point off Chelsea in their opener. While Corina Dekker’s side have only secured two points in the competition, they boast a developing group of young players who have been catching the eye.Quick GuideSkinner urges United to attack OL LyonnesShowThe Manchester United head coach, Marc Skinner, has hailed  OL Lyonnes as Europe's best team but urged his side to take the game to the eight-time European champions in Leigh on Wednesday.Skinner's team are a point behind the French club in the Women's Champions League table after winning three of their first four matches in their debut campaign at this stage of the competition, meaning they have  secured at least a knockout-phase playoff spot.Both sides hope to finish in the top four  to progress automatically to the quarter-finals, and Skinner said: \"We’re playing the best team in Europe. I know Barcelona are up there as well, but Lyon have the capacity to be the best team in Europe, so we’re going to need them [the fans], and what I want Lyon to feel tomorrow is the force that Manchester United are and can become.\"Lyon have the ability to create something from nothing in any moment of the game. We have to concentrate and be at our very best. If we defend for the whole game, Lyon will win.\"He added: \"We can’t just sit off them. We’ve got to be very respectful of that. We must attack. We’re at home and we look forward to trying to give ourselves that quality going forward too.”When  United re-formed their senior women's side in 2018, Lyon were  five-time winners of this competition, but Skinner does not want his players to be nostalgic by any thoughts of how far they have come to reach this point: \"If I wasn’t Man Utd manager I would be saying: ‘Wow, what a fantastic achievement.’ [But] there is no room for this romanticism. If you live in a nostalgic space, you lose ground.\"Skinner  confirmed his side would be without Elisabeth Terland because of a knock to her \"upper body\" on Sunday, but he expects the striker  to return for Sunday's league game against Tottenham Hotspur.Tom GarryWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The Gunners came into this game on the back of a confidence-boosting win against Liverpool in the Women’s Super League.

As ever, there was an intense focus on Guardiola, the former Barcelona player and manager, when he arrived to preview the match although the bigger story here is the future of the Madrid manager, Xabi Alonso.Alonso has presided over a disastrous run of two wins in seven matches in all competitions, which has resulted in a 12-point swing with Barcelona in La Liga; Madrid’s rivals are now four points clear at the top. Alonso desperately needs a result against City; a defeat could have grave consequences for him.Guardiola sought to turn the focus inwards. He stressed that his side was in a transitional phase, which began with the £185m outlay on signings last January and continued into the summer. It was a time, he suggested, for some of his new players to grow.“We have lost important players … De Bruyne, Gundo, Walker; Stones and Rodri are not here,” the City manager said. “Many players are new and they have to experience it on these stages – and know that for the next time, I have done it and can do it again. It’s always a good place to come to prove yourself.”The City captain, Bernardo Silva, was asked whether the game could serve as a barometer of the team’s progress. “Maybe, yes,” he replied. “It is just one more game but it’s definitely a very good test in this environment. It’s a very different [City] team because the club made the decision to change a lot of players and give a new dynamic. It’s a team full of potential and energy.”This will be the 11th Champions League meeting of these teams in seven seasons. The previous 10 encounters were all two-legged ties in the knockout rounds, Madrid progressing three times; City two. The Alonso storyline provided the greatest drama and Guardiola said he had sympathy for his one-time Bayern Munich player, telling a packed press conference at the Bernabeu that he “loved” him.At one point, Guardiola said Alonso “should pee with his own” – in other words, take control of his own destiny. Guardiola said: “Barcelona and Madrid are the toughest clubs to be a manager … the pressure and environment. If I’d done last season [with City] here, I would’ve been sacked. Of course, Xabi is capable of doing what is required.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He added: “It depends on what power the hierarchy want to give. If they want to give it to the manager, the manager has the power. If they give it to the players, the players have it.”Despite the overall situation, Alonso’s team do have four wins out of five in the Champions League. City are keen to bounce back from the 2-0 home defeat against Bayer Leverkusen in their previous game in the competition when Guardiola made 10 changes to his lineup and felt that many of the replacements lacked the confidence to express themselves.Explore more on these topicsManchester CityReal MadridPep GuardiolaChampions LeaguenewsShareReuse this content"

But obviously the fact that you are missing players, you are loading other players more, there’s a consequence to that and it’s a really dangerous circle that one.Some of the players have played over 150 games in two seasons so it starts to get overloaded. And you start to ask them again and again and again to do that, at some point they will break down. But it’s a test for the team and so far we have reacted very, very well to that.”Arsenal spent more than £250m on new signings in the summer but Arteta insisted he is hopeful that they will not have to go into the market again in January.“At the moment we’re just focusing on bringing the players back and hopefully it will be a matter of weeks,” he said. “We know how important those weeks are going to be because we’re going to come into the period where a lot of things start to get defined in that period, and hopefully we’re going to have those players back.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Most footballers would simply have walked on by but the 6ft 6in Newcastle forward is a little different from the rest and he duly stopped and tucked them all back into position beneath a long desk.Out on the pitch Woltemade’s highly-technical approach is nothing if not similarly neat and he has returned to his home country on a Champions League mission. Namely to show his compatriots that Eddie Howe has imbued his game with a dangerous new dimension. While the adhesive touches, deft flicks and clever link play that have always distinguished Woltemade’s performances remain, the Newcastle manager’s “physics” have enhanced the mix.Xabi Alonso fights for Madrid future in latest edition of modern classicRead more“I think especially my physical work is getting way better,” Woltemade said, speaking with a maturity, intelligence and humour that belied his 23 years. “I can sprint more, I can win more duels. It’s really important for the Premier League and the gaffer has worked with me a lot because, in this league, you don’t get many chances as a striker sometimes.”The benefits are psychological as well as physical. “The feeling for myself now is that I always know I can score a goal,” said the former Stuttgart striker. “I think this is what Newcastle gave me also a lot, because I always have that feeling in the game now. I think, ‘OK, I can score a goal’, even when I don’t touch the ball maybe for some minutes. I know always the ball will come because I have such good teammates. They give me good balls. But I think all in all, the thing I have most improved is the physics.”In Germany, and particularly in the vicinity of Bayern Munich, there are still plenty of pundits happy to mock Newcastle as “idiots” forpaying £69m for Woltemadein the summer. His seven goals for the club this season suggest it was money well spent and the man himself is, outwardly at least, unconcerned. “To be honest, I don’t care,” Woltemade said. “I think a lot of people speak about me and, if I would listen to everything, what it’s saying about me, I can’t focus on myself anymore. So I don’t read it.“I’m just taking care of myself, and focus on myself, and that’s the way that helps me the best. At the end I’m not deciding what someone is paying for me, but I can say I’m really happy that Newcastle is paying this for me because I’m really happy that I’m now in Newcastle.”Many footballers might baulk at questions regarding their love lives but Woltemade merely smiled when he was asked if he had found a Geordie girlfriend? “I don’t know why everyone is talking about this,” he said. “But, no, I have a lot of games so I didn’t really have time.” The good news for Howe is that he has affection for his adopted city and Yoane Wissa. Theformer Brentford strikeris finally fit following three months sidelined by a knee injury and Woltemade believes they can form a menacing partnership, perhaps even against Bayer Leverkusen and then at Sunderland on Sunday.View image in fullscreenNick Woltemade says he has improved the physical side of his game since playing in the Premier League.Photograph: Scott Heppell/Reuters“I’m really happy living in Newcastle and I’m really excited about playing with Yoane,” said a striker seemingly more suited to a No 10 than a No 9 role. “He’s a really good, quality player. He’s a player who can score goals and also he’s a nice guy. He brings really positive vibes in the team because he’s laughing a lot and gives good energy. We can definitely play together.”Perhaps inevitably, Woltemade was asked if Peter Crouch had been a role model in his youth. “I’m too young, I wasn’t born until 2002,” he replied. “But when I was 16 at Bremen my teammates called my ‘Crouchy’ because I was so tall and skinny.”Judging from Howe’s demeanour, Newcastle’s manager regards Alexander Isak’s successor as near perfect. “Nick’s done brilliantly, “ he enthused. “I’ve just had the pleasure of half an hour with him on the way here and he’s just a great person, a really good character. Nick’s got the ability to laugh at himself and that’s always a good quality to have. It was great to talk to him about the German league and the German mentality.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s very difficult to come in and do what he’s done. He’s fitted in superbly. He’s really bought into the team ethos in terms of giving for the team, whether that’s out of possession, whether that’s coming back and defending set plays, which he’s actually done really well for us, and, of course, scoring goals. But there’s still so much more to come from Nick. I’m excited about what he can be.”Howe remains insistent he is not prioritising the north-east derby and knows a win in Leverkusen would all but secure Newcastle a place in the Champions League playoffs with two games – at home to PSV Eindhoven and away to Paris Saint-Germain – remaining. It would also leave them possibly one more victory away from earning a top-eight finish and proceeding straight to the knockout rounds.Leverkusen may be a shadow of the side that Xabi Alonso led to the2023-24 Bundesliga titlebut Kasper Hjulmand’s team contain the prolific Czech international striker Patrik Schick and the talented Spain left wing-back Alejandro Grimaldo. Moreover, after a summer of turmoil featuring the exits of key players including Florian Wirtz and Granit Xhaka, not to mention Erik ten Hag’s short-lived managerial tenure, Leverkusen appear to have stabilised, seen with their2-0 win at Manchester Citylast month.Woltemade represents a different challenge for Leverkusen. Should Hjulmand’s defence fail to subdue him here, no one in Germany is likely to dub Newcastle “idiots” again any time soon.Explore more on these topicsNewcastle UnitedfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Guardian Australia has received several reports of thoseunder 16 passing the facial age assurance tests, but the government has flagged it is not expecting the ban will be perfect from day one.All listed platforms apart from X had confirmed by Tuesday they would comply with the ban.The eSafety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, said it had recently had a conversation with X about how it would comply, but the company had not communicated its policy to users.Bluesky, an X alternative, announced on Tuesday it would also ban under-16s, despite eSafety assessing the platform as “low risk” due to its small user base of 50,000 in Australia.Children had spent the past few weeks undertaking age assurance checks, swapping phone numbers and preparing for their accounts to be deactivated.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThe Australian chief executive and co-founder of the age assurance service k-ID, Kieran Donovan, said his service had conducted hundreds of thousands of age checks in the past few weeks. The k-ID service was being used by Snapchat among others.Parents of children affected by the ban shared a spectrum of views on the policy. One parent told the Guardian their 15-year-old daughter was “very distressed” because “all her 14 to 15-year-old friends have been age verified as 18 by Snapchat”. Since she had been identified as under 16, they feared “her friends will keep using Snapchat to talk and organise social events and she will be left out”.3:15Are Australian kids breaking the law if they sneak onto social media? – videoAnother parent said the ban had forced him to teach his child how to break the law. “I’ve shown her how VPNs work and other methods on bypassing age restrictions,” he said. “I’ve had to set her up with her own adult YouTube account and have assisted her in bypassing TikTok’s age-estimation and will keep doing so each time it asks.”Others said the ban “can’t come quickly enough”. One parent said their daughter was “completely addicted” to social media and the ban “provides us with a support framework to keep her off these platforms”.The Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said inan opinion piece on Sunday: “From the beginning, we’ve acknowledged this process won’t be 100% perfect. But the message this law sends will be 100% clear … Australia sets the legal drinking age at 18 because our society recognises the ­benefits to the individual and the community of such an ­approach.“The fact that teenagers occasionally find a way to have a drink doesn’t diminish the value of having a clear, ­national standard.”3:33Ezra is a teen quadriplegic. He says Australia’s social media ban will make him lonelier – videoPolling has consistently shown thattwo-thirds of voters supportraising the minimum age for social media to 16. The opposition, including leader Sussan Ley, have recentlyvoiced alarm about the ban, despite waving the legislation through parliament and the former Liberal leader Peter Dutton championing it.The ban has garnered worldwide attention, with several nations indicating they will adopt a ban of their own, including Malaysia, Denmark and Norway. The European Union passed a resolution to adopt similar restrictions, while a spokesperson for the British government told Reuters it was “closely monitoring Australia’s approach to age restrictions”.Inman Grant told the Guardian that from Thursday, she would be sending notices to the platforms covered by the ban to find out how the implementation was progressing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If they were not, it could take that platform to court to seek fines.There would be an independent evaluation of the ban conducted by an academic advisory group examining the short-term, medium-term and longer-term impacts of the ban.“It will look at the benefits over time, but also the unintended consequences,” Inman Grant said.How is Australia’s social media ban affecting you and your family?Read more“Everything from are they sleeping? Are they interacting or are they actually getting out on the sports fields? Are they reading books? Are they taking less medication like antidepressants? Are their Naplan scores improving over time?” Inman Grant said.Potential unintended consequences to be investigated included whether children were moving on to “darker areas of the internet”, learning how to bypass the bans through VPNs, or moving on to other platforms, she said.Teens on Snapchat affected by the ban had been publicly sharing their mobile numbers in their profiles ahead of their accounts being shut down.A spokesperson for Snapchat said the platform understood under-16s were disappointed by the ban but “would strongly encourage any teens using Snapchat not to publicly share their personal contact information”.Inman Grant said she had sent notices to 15 companies not initially included in the ban, asking them to self-assess whether they should be.Yope and Lemon8, which shot up the app store rankings as teens looked for alternatives, were among those contacted.Explore more on these topicsSocial media banSocial mediaAustralian politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Now they are fighting backSteve RoseTue 9 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 9 Dec 2025 04.26 ESTShareLate one night in April 2020, towards the start of the Covid lockdowns, Shanley Clémot McLaren was scrolling on her phone when she noticed aSnapchatpost by her 16-year-old sister. “She’s basically filming herself from her bed, and she’s like: ‘Guys you shouldn’t be doing this. These fisha accounts are really not OK. Girls, please protect yourselves.’ And I’m like: ‘What is fisha?’ I was 21, but I felt old,” she says.She went into her sister’s bedroom, where her sibling showed her a Snapchat account named “fisha” plus the code of their Paris suburb. Fisha is French slang for publicly shaming someone – from the verb “afficher”, meaning to display or make public. The account contained intimate images of girls from her sister’s school and dozens of others, “along with the personal data of the victims – their names, phone numbers, addresses, everything to find them, everything to put them in danger”.McLaren, her sister and their friends reported the account to Snapchat dozens of times, but received no response. Then they discovered there were fisha accounts for different suburbs, towns and cities across France and beyond. Faced with the impunity of the social media platforms, and their lack of moderation, they launched the hashtag #StopFisha.It went viral, online and in the media.#StopFishabecame a rallying cry, a safe space to share information and advice, a protest movement. Now it was the social media companies being shamed. “The wave became a counter-wave,” says McLaren, who is now 26. The French government got involved, and launched an online campaign on the dangers and legal consequences of fisha accounts. The social media companies began to moderate at last, and #StopFisha is now a “trusted flagger” with Snapchat and TikTok, so when they report fisha content, it is taken down within hours. “I realised that if you want change in your societies, if you come with your idea alone, it won’t work. You need support behind you.”View image in fullscreenShanley Clémot McLaren at the UN.Photograph: Baz RatnerFour years later, this strategy is playing out on an even larger scale. McLaren and other young activists across Europe are banding together against social media and its ruinous effects on their generation. Individually, young people are powerless to sway big tech, but they are also a substantial part of its business model – so, collectively, they are powerful.This is the first generation to have grown up with social media: they were the earliest adopters of it, and therefore the first to suffer its harms. The array of problems is ever-expanding: misogynistic, hateful and disturbing content; addictive and skewed algorithms; invasion of privacy; online forums encouraging harmful behaviours; sextortion; screen addiction; deepfake pornography; misinformation and disinformation; radicalisation; surveillance; biased AI – the list goes on. As the use of social media has risen, there has been a corresponding increase in youth mental health problems, anxiety, depression, self-harm and even suicide.“Across Europe, a generation is suffering through a silent crisis,”says a new reportfromPeople vs Big Tech– a coalition of more than 140 digital rights NGOs from around Europe – andCtrl+Alt+Reclaim, their youth-led spin-off. A big factor is “the design and dominance of social media platforms”.Ctrl+Alt+Reclaim, for people aged 15 to 29, came about in September last year when People vs Big Tech put out a call – on social media, paradoxically. About 20 young people who were already active on these issues came together at a “boot camp” in London. “We were really given the tools to create the movement that we wanted to build,” says McLaren, who attended with her partner. “They booked a big room, they brought the food, pencils, paper, everything we needed. And they were like: ‘This is your space, and we’re here to help.’”The group is Europe’s first digital justice movement by and for young people. Their demands are very simple, or at least they ought to be: inclusion of young people in decision-making; a safer, healthier, more equitable social media environment; control and transparency over personal data and how it is used; and an end to the stranglehold a handful of US-based corporations have over social media and online spaces. The overarching principle is: “Nothing for us, without us.”“This is not just us being angry; it’s us having the right to speak,” says McLaren, who is now a youth mobilisation lead for Ctrl+Alt+Reclaim. Debates over digital rights are already going on, of course, but, she says: “We find it really unfair that we’re not at the table.Young peoplehave so much to say, and they’re real experts, because they have lived experience … So why aren’t they given the proper space?”McLaren’s work with #StopFisha took her on a journey into a wider, murkier world of gender-based digital rights: misogynist trolling and sexism, cyberstalking, deepfake pornography – but she realised this was just one facet of the problem. What women were experiencing online, other groups were experiencing in their own ways.A fellow activist, Yassine, 23, is well aware of this. Originally from north Africa and now living in Germany, Yassine identifies as non-binary. They fled to Europe to escape intolerance in their own country, but the reality of life, even in a supposedly liberal country such as Germany, hit them like a “slap”, they say. “You’re here for your safety, but then you’re trying to fight not only the system that is punishing the queerness of you, but you also have another layer of being a migrant. So you have two battles instead of one.”View image in fullscreen‘The systems are patriarchal and racist by design’ … Yassine, who leads on digital rights at LGBTQ+ youth rights organisation IGLYO.Photograph: IGLYOAs a migrant they are seen as a threat, Yassine says. “Our bodies and movements must be tracked, fingerprinted and surveilled through intrusive digital systems designed to protect the EU.” For queer people, there are similar challenges. These include “shadow-banning”, for example, by which tech platforms “silence conversations about queer rights, racism or anything that is challenging the dominant system”, either wilfully or algorithmically, through built-in biases.Measures such as identity verification “are also putting a lot of people at risk of being erased from these spaces”, says Yassine. There can be good reasons for them, but they can also end up discriminating against non-binary or transgender people – who are often presented with binary gender options; male or female – as well as against refugees and undocumented people, who may be afraid or unable to submit their details online. Given their often tenuous residency status, and sometimes limited digital literacy and access, migrants tend not to speak out, Yassine says. “It definitely feels like you are in a position of: ‘You need to be grateful that you are here, and you should not question the laws.’ But the laws are harming my data.”On a more day-to-day level, Yassine says, they must “walk through online spaces knowing they could do harm to me”. If they click on the comments under a social media post, for example, they know they are likely to find racist, homophobic or hateful attacks. Like McLaren, Yassine says that complaining is futile. “I know that they will come back with, ‘This is not a community guidelines breach’, and all of that.”These are not mere glitches in the system, says Yassine, who now leads on digital rights atIGLYO, a long-running LGBTQ+ youth rights organisation, founded in Brussels, with a network of groups across Europe. “The systems we design inherit the very structures they arise from, so they inevitably become systems that are patriarchal and racist by design.”Adele Zeynep Walton’s participation in Ctrl+Alt+Reclaim came through personal experience of online harm. In 2022, Walton’s 21-year-old sister, Aimee, took her own life. She had been struggling with her mental health, but had also been spending time on online suicide and self-harm forums, which Walton believes contributed to her death. After that, Walton began to question the digital realm she had grown up in, and her own screen addiction.Walton’s parents made her first Facebook account when she was 10, she says. She has been onInstagramsince she was 12. Her own feelings of body dysmorphia began when she was 13, sparked by pro-anorexia content her friends were sharing. “I became a consumer of that, then I got immersed in this world,” she says. “Generations like mine thought it was totally normal, having this everyday battle with this addictive thing, having this constant need for external validation. I thought those were things that were just wrong withme.”View image in fullscreenAdele Zeynep Walton, who became a campaigner after the death of her sister, in the garden of her family home in Southampton.Photograph: Peter Flude/The GuardianIn researching her bookLogging Off: The Human Cost of our Digital World, Walton, 26, also became aware of how little control young people have over the content that is algorithmically served up to them. “We don’t really have any choice over what our feeds look like. Despite the fact there are things where you can say, ‘I don’t want to see this type of content’, within a week, you’re still seeing it again.”Alycia Colijn, 29, another member of Ctrl+Alt+Reclaim, knows something about this. She studied data science and marketing analytics at university in Rotterdam, researching AI-driven algorithms – how they can be used to manipulate behaviour, and in whose interests. During her studies she began to think: “It’s weird that I’m trained to gather as much data as I can, and to build a model that can respond to or predict what people want to buy, but I’ve never had a conversation around ethics.” Now she is researching these issues as co-founder ofEncode Europe, which advocates for human-centric AI. “I realised how much power these algorithms have over us; over our society, but also over our democracies,” she says. “Can we still speak of free will if the best psychologists in the world are building algorithms that make us addicted?”The more she learned, the more concerned Colijn became. “We made social media into a social experiment,” she says. “It turned out to be the place where you could best gather personal data from individuals. Data turned into the new gold, and then tech bros became some of the most powerful people in the world, even though they aren’t necessarily known for caring about society.”Social media companies have had ample opportunities to respond to these myriad harms, but invariably they have chosen not to. Just as McLaren found with Snapchat and the fisha accounts, hateful and racist content is still minimally moderated on platforms such as X, Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube. After Donald Trump’s re-election, Mark Zuckerberg stated at the start of this year that Meta would bereducing factcheckersacross Facebook and Instagram, just as X has under Elon Musk. This has facilitated the free flow of misinformation.Meta,AmazonandGooglewere also among the companies announcing they were rolling back their diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, post-Trump’s election. The shift towards the right politically, in the US and Europe, has inevitably affected these platforms’ tolerance of hateful and racist content, says Yassine. “People feel like now they have more rights to be harmful than rights to be protected.”All the while, the tech CEOs have become more powerful, economically, politically and in terms of information control. “We don’t believe that power should be in those hands,” says Colijn. “That’s not a true democracy.”Europe’s politicians aren’t doing much better. Having drafted theDigital Services Actin 2023, which threatened social media companies with fines or bans if they failed to regulate harmful content, the European Commission announced last month itwould be rolling backsome of its data privacy laws, to allow big tech companies to use people’s personal data for training AI systems.“Big tech, combined with the AI innovators, say they are the growth of tomorrow’s economy, and that we have to trust them. I don’t think that’s true,” says Colijn. She also disagrees with their argument that regulation harms innovation. “The only thing deregulation fosters isharmfulinnovation. If we want responsible innovation, we need regulation in place.”Walton agrees. “Governments and MPs are shooting themselves in the foot by pandering to tech giants, because that just tells young people that they don’t care about our future,” she says. “There’s this massive knowledge gap between the people who are making the decisions, and the tech justice movement and everyday people who are experiencing the harms.”Ctrl+Alt+Reclaim is not calling for the wholesale destruction of social media. All these activists say they have found community, solidarity and joy in online spaces: “We’re fighting for these spaces to accommodate us,” says Yassine. “We’re not protesting to cancel them. We know how harmful they are, but they are still spaces where we have hope.”View image in fullscreen‘The only thing deregulation fosters is harmful innovation’ … Alycia Colijn, co-founder of Encode.Photograph: Henry MaathuisColijn echoes this. “Social media used to be a fun place with the promise of connecting the world,” she says. “That’s where we started.” And that’s what they want it to be again.Will big tech pay attention? They might not have a choice, as countries and legislators begin to take action. This week Australia will become the first country toban social media accountsfor under-16s on major platforms including Snapchat, Instagram, TikTok and X. Last week, after a two-year deliberation, X wasfined €120m(£105m) by the EU for breaching data laws. But these companies continue to platform content that is hateful, racist, harmful, misleading or inflammatory, with impunity.Meanwhile, Ctrl+Alt+Reclaim is just getting started. Other discussions on the table include campaigning for an EU-funded social media platform, an alternative to the big tech oligopoly, created by and for the public. Another alternative is direct action, either protest or consumer activism such as coordinated boycotts. “I think it’s lazy for us to be like: we don’t have any power,” says Walton. “Because we could literally say that about anything: fast fashion, fossil fuels … OK, but how do we change things?”The other alternative is simply to log off. “The other side of the coin to this movement of tech justice, and a sort of liberation from the harms that we’ve experienced over the past 20 years, is reducing our screen time,” says Walton. “It is spending more time in community. It is connecting with people who maybe you would have never spoken to on social media, because you’d be in different echo chambers.”Almost all the activists in Ctrl+Alt+Reclaim attest to having had some form of screen addiction. As much as social media has brought them together, it has also led to much less face-to-face socialising. “I’ve had to sort of rewire my brain to get used to the awkwardness and get comfortable with being in a social setting and not knowing anyone,” says Walton. “Actually, it would be really nice to return to proper connection.”In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

CNBCreported in Junethat Google was using YouTube videos to train its Gemini andVeo3 models. Google said it used a subset of videos for training purposes.In September, YouTube said: “We use content uploaded to YouTube to improve the product experience for creators and viewers across YouTube and Google, including through machine learning and AI applications.”The EU’s competition chief, Teresa Ribera, said: “AI is bringing remarkable innovation and many benefits for people and businesses acrossEurope, but this progress cannot come at the expense of the principles at the heart of our societies.”A spokesperson for Google said: “This complaint risks stifling innovation in a market that is more competitive than ever. Europeans deserve to benefit from the latest technologies and we will continue to work closely with the news and creative industries as they transition to the AI era.”The EU’s investigation is the latest in a series of challenges to US big tech companies in recent years.In September, EU regulatorsissued a fine of almost €3bn (£2.6bn) against Google, claiming that it favoured its own digital advertising services over rivals.

She had tried conventional mental health services but “chat”, as she came to know her AI “friend”, felt safer, less intimidating and, crucially, more available when it came to handling the trauma from the deaths of her young friends.As she started consulting the AI model, the Tottenham teenager joined about 40% of 13- to 17-year-olds inEnglandand Wales affected by youth violence who are turning to AI chatbots for mental health support, according to research among more than 11,000 young people.It found that both victims and perpetrators of violence were markedly more likely to be using AI for such support than other teenagers. Thefindings, from the Youth Endowment Fund, have sparked warnings from youth leaders that children at risk “need a human not a bot”.The results suggest chatbots are fulfilling demand unmet by conventional mental health services, which have long waiting lists and which some young users find lacking in empathy. The supposed privacy of the chatbot is another key factor in driving use by victims or perpetrators of crimes.After her friends were killed Shan, 18, not her real name, started using Snapchat’s AI before switching to ChatGPT, which she can talk to at any time of day or night with two clicks on her smartphone.“I feel like it definitely is a friend,” she said, adding that it was less intimidating, more private and less judgmental than her experience with conventionalNHSand charity mental health support.“The more you talk to it like a friend it will be talking to you like a friend back. If I say to chat ‘Hey bestie, I need some advice’. Chat will talk back to me like it’s my best friend, she’ll say, ‘Hey bestie, I got you girl’.”One in four of 13- to 17-year-olds have used an AI chatbot for mental health support in the past year, with black children twice as likely as white children to have done so, the study found. Teenagers were more likely to go online for support, including using AI, if they were on a waiting list for treatment or diagnosis or had been denied, than if they were already receiving in-person support.Crucially, Shan said, the AI was “accessible 24/7” and would not tell teachers or parents about what she had disclosed. She felt this was a considerable advantage over telling a school therapist, after her own experience of what she thought were confidences being shared with teachers and her mother.Boys who were involved in gang activities felt safer asking chatbots for advice about other safer ways to make money than a teacher or parent who might leak the information to police or other gang members, putting them in danger, she said.Another young person, who has been using AI for mental health support but asked not to be named, told the Guardian: “The current system is so broken for offering help for young people.Chatbotsprovide immediate answers. If you’re going to be on the waiting list for one to two years to get anything, or you can have an immediate answer within a few minutes … that’s where the desire to use AI comes from.”Would you entrust a child’s life to a chatbot? That’s what happens every day that we fail to regulate AIRead moreJon Yates, the chief executive of the Youth Endowment Fund, which commissioned the research, said: “Too many young people are struggling with their mental health and can’t get the support they need. It’s no surprise that some are turning to technology for help. We have to do better for our children, especially those most at risk. They need a human not a bot.”There have been growing concerns about the dangers of chatbots when children engage with them at length. OpenAI, the US company behind ChatGPT, is facingseveral lawsuitsincluding from families of young people who have killed themselves after long engagements.In thecase of the Californian 16-year-old Adam Raine, who took his life in April, OpenAI hasdeniedit was caused by the chatbot. It has said it has been improving its technology “to recognise and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress, de-escalate conversations, and guide people toward real-world support.”. The startupsaidin September it could start contacting authorities in cases where users start talking seriously about suicide.Hanna Jones, a youth violence and mental health researcher in London, said: “To have this tool that could tell you technically anything – it’s almost like a fairytale. You’ve got this magic book that can solve all your problems. That sounds incredible.”But she is worried about the lack of regulation.“People are using ChatGPT for mental health support, when it’s not designed for that,” she said. “What we need now is to increase regulations that are evidence-backed but also youth-led. This is not going to be solved by adults making decisions for young people.Young peopleneed to be in the driving seat to make decisions around ChatGPT and mental health support that uses AI, because it’s so different to our world. We didn’t grow up with this. We can’t even imagine what it is to be a young person today.”In the UK, the youth suicide charityPapyruscan be contacted on 0800 068 4141 or emailpat@papyrus-uk.org, and in the UK and IrelandSamaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

President Xi responded positively!”Trump said the Department of Commerce was finalising the details and that he was planning to make the same offer to other chip companies, including Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Intel. Nvidia’s H200 chips are the company’s second most powerful, and far more advanced than the H20, which was originally designed as a lower-powered model for the Chinese market that would not breach restrictions, but which the US banned anyway in April.The president said the US would receive 25% of the proceeds, more than the15% previously agreed towith Nvidia in an earlier deal to lift restrictions. This deal follows similar unorthodox plans for the federal government to take a financial cut from private business dealings. In August, Trump said the US wouldreceive a 10% stakein the tech company Intel. Some lawmakers havequestioned the legalityof such arrangements.According to the Hill, the Democratic senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Andy Kim of New Jerseysent lettersto the commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, last week outlining their concerns over selling these chips to China and saying it risked powering the country’s “surveillance, censorship and military applications”.They wrote: “I urge you to stop ignoring the input of bipartisan members of Congress and your own experts in order to cut deals that trade away America’s national security.”On social media, Warren called for Huang to appear before Congress to testify under oath.Huang has worked closely with Trump since the inauguration and has made several trips to the White House. The CEO attended the president’s AI summit in July, met Trump as recently as last week and was even a guest at the White House dinner for the Saudi crown price, Mohammed bin Salman. Huang haspledged to invest $500bn in AI infrastructurein the US over the next four years.Huang has visitedChinaseveral times, meeting officials and Chinese tech executives, as US bans were variously lifted and reintroduced. Earlier this year, China imposed its own controls on the imports of Nvidia chips, with top tech firms reportedly instructed to cancel orders, citing national security concerns and confidence in China’s domestic chip development.In October, Huang said Nvidia has gone from having 95% of the Chinese market to having none, and called the bans a “strategic mistake”.Selling chips to China, the world’s second largest economy, could now mean a windfall worth billions of dollars for Nvidia, which is already valued at $4.5tn.An Nvidia spokesperson said: “We applaud President Trump’s decision.” He said offering the H200 chips “to approved commercial customers, vetted by the Department of Commerce, strikes a thoughtful balance that is great for America”.The Nvidia spokesperson and Trump said the move would support US jobs and manufacturing.In his Truth Social post, Trump condemned the Biden administration’s policies, which imposed strict export controls on powerful chips. The Biden administration had said withholding such technology from China bolstered US competition, protected national security and hampered AI development in China.“That Era is OVER!” Trump wrote. “My Administration will always put America FIRST.”On Tuesday afternoon, China’s foreign ministry said it had noted the reports. “China has always adhered to the principle that China and the United States can achieve mutual benefit and win-win results through cooperation,” the spokesperson said. A final decision from Beijing is still in the works, according to areport from the Financial Times. The newspaper said regulators may still opt to limit access to H200 chips in China so that the country can continue to focus on its own technology.Ma Jihua, a telecom industry analyst, told the state media outlet the Global Times that years of US curbs on AI exports had “provided a rare chance of China’s domestic chip industry to grow and catch up”.Explore more on these topicsNvidiaTechnology sectorTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsChinaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The originalTony Hawk’s Pro Skatertitles were anarchic, arcade fun while the recent return of EA’s belovedSkate franchiseoffered competent yet jarringly corporate realism. Skate Story, which is mostly the work of solo developer Sam Eng, offers a more impressionistic interpretation while capturing something of the sport’s essential spirit. It transposes the boarding action to a demonic underworld where the aesthetic is less fire and brimstone than glittering, 2010s-era vaporwave. It is also the most emotionally real a skateboarding game has ever felt.The premise is ingenious: you are a demon made out of “pain and glass”. Skate to the moon and swallow it, says the devil, and you shall be freed. So that is exactly what you do. You learn to ollie first, a “delicate, precise trick” according to the artfully written in-game text. Then come the pop shuvit, kickflip, heelflip and more.View image in fullscreenCaptures the spirit of skateboarding … Skate Story.Photograph: Devolver DigitalThe controls are easy: one button to ollie. If you’re holding down a shoulder button at the same time, you perform a more involved trick. Beyond the ravishing visuals, what’s most striking is the exquisite fluidity, the delicious “gamefeel”, of the actual skateboarding: the way the knees of this glittering demon bend just the right amount after landing a trick; the way you can see their foot stretching out across the top end of the board in order to apply just the right force that will cause it to flip.The vaporwave aesthetic is not Skate Story’s only bold design choice. You will fall many times on the ghoulish asphalt and when you do the action cuts to first-person, causing you to see the world tumbling for what feels like a tormenting eternity. Along the way, you meet a bizarre cast of characters: a mystical rabbit, a pigeon trying to type a screenplay, and a ghost hanging out in a launderette.View image in fullscreenReal emotions … Skate Story.Photograph: Devolver DigitalThe game’s action can be divided into two types: narrow, linear tunnels that you hurtle through at breakneck speed, and wide-open sandbox levels. The former are furious, momentum-filled thrill rides that demand utmost precision; the latter, set in nightmarish, nocturnal visions of New York, feature many offbeat objectives, such as chasing spooky laundry. In these levels, there is ample room to enjoy the deceptively deep skating mechanics.Gradually, a melancholy surfaces in this crystalline universe. Of course, the skateboarder wants to be free of the underworld, but they also seem enraptured by the idea of devouring these moons. As you thread together tricks with manuals and grinds, scoring ever-larger combos, all as a brilliantly downbeat electro soundtrack chimes away, questions arise. Why is this skateboarder so hungry? Why do they seek pain? In some ways, we’re reminded of the physical risks of skateboarding in real life.These questions – and the sadness buried within their answers – distinguish Skate Story from its traditionally zany video game counterparts. Rather, Eng’s gently emotive work is more in touch with the likes of acclaimed documentaryMinding the Gapand Jonah Hill’s movieMid90s.The result is a skateboarding game of rare poetry. There is the poetry of the skating itself, the miraculous interplay of body and board rendered with aplomb. There is the actual poetry that accompanies the end of each level. Finally, there are the tender emotions that refract through, and seem amplified by every bailed kickflip in this surreal, shimmering take on hell.Skate Story is out now, £17.99Explore more on these topicsGamesNintendo Switch 2PlayStation 5PCreviewsShareReuse this content"

European leaders must learn to fight back.Tue 9 Dec 2025 13.49 ESTLast modified on Tue 9 Dec 2025 20.14 ESTShareSir Keir Starmer, Emmanuel Macron and Friedrich Merz have become adept at scrambling to deal with the latest bad news from Washington. Theirmeetingwith Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Downing Street on Monday was so hastily arranged that Mr Macron needed to be back in Paris by late afternoon to meet Croatia’s prime minister, while Mr Merz was due ontelevisionfor an end-of-year Q&A with the German public.But diplomatic improvisation alone cannot fully answer Donald Trump’s structural threat to European security. The US president and his emissaries are trying to bully Mr Zelenskyy into an unjust peace deal that suits American and Russian interests. In response, the summit helped ramp up support for the use of up to £100bn in frozen Russian assets as collateral for a “reparations loan” to Ukraine. European counter-proposals for a ceasefire will need to be given the kind of financial backing that provides Mr Zelenskyy with leverage at a critical moment.More broadly, though, an ominous lead-up to Christmas has underlined the limits to firefighting and turning the other cheek to Maga provocations. The extraordinarynational security strategypaper published last week by the White House did European leaders a service in this regard. Brimming with contempt for liberal democratic values, it confirmed the Trump administration’s desire to minimise security guarantees in place since the second world war, while simultaneously pressuring the EU into betraying the principles on which it was founded. This was a “for the record” version of the US vice-president JD Vance’s mocking Munichspeechlast February.Passagespredicting the “civilisational erasure” of Europe through migration and EU integration could have been written in the Kremlin, which dulynotedan overlap in worldviews. Ditto the hostile calls to cultivate “resistance” to Europe’s supposed trajectory, and support for “patriotic” nationalist parties. For good measure, Mr Trumpechoed“great replacement” conspiracy theory tropes this week in an interview that rammed home the same talking points in less coherent form.However tempting it may be to pretend otherwise, given the desire to persuade Mr Trump to do the right thing overUkraine, a US administration that acts in such a way cannot be viewed straightforwardly as an ally. The president and his America First ideologues see the EU as a drain on security resources best deployed elsewhere, an economic competitor to be dominated, and a cultural adversary to be undermined at every opportunity.The response must be a belated push towards greaterstrategic autonomyand unity in defence, and the promotion of European interests in the wider economy. That, in turn, will mean playing hardball with Washington in a way that the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, conspicuouslyfailedto do when negotiating a humiliatingly one-sided trade deal in the summer. A world where China and the US both wish to eat the EU’s economic lunch, and Russia harbours darker designs to the east, is no place for a romantic view of multilateralism.The White House national security strategy paper and the US president himself have laid it out in black and white: Mr Trump seeks a fragmented, weakened Europe that is reliant on US industry and tech, and will therefore meekly comply with its aggressive demands. Europeans deserve far better than a continent made fit for Elon Musk. Time to fight back.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

If you ignore thegenocides in SudanandGaza,fighting in eastern Congo, continuedattacks on Ukraine, militaryairstrikes in Myanmar, near-dailystrikes on Lebanon,“extrajudicial killings”onVenezualan vessels, increasedpolitical violencein the US, along with variousother inconvenient issues, then I think we can all agree that Donald Trump has ushered in world peace.Trump awarded inaugural Fifa peace prize at World Cup draw in WashingtonRead moreGood luck convincing the nasty Norwegians on the Nobel committee of that, though. They’ve doledout peace prizesto many an alleged war criminal but have a weird grudge against Trump. Still, at least Fifa, an organisation renowned for itsimpeccable ethics, appreciates the president’s efforts. Last Friday,Trump was awardedthe inaugural Fifa peace prize in an over-the-top ceremony that would have made a lesser man, one burdened with a smidgen of self-awareness, feel like a prize idiot.Ridiculous as theFifapeace prize may be, the strategy was sound; if you want something from Trump, you need to flatter his ego. I wouldn’t be surprised if Fifa kickstarts a trend for organisations and corporations bestowing outlandish awards upon the president in an effort to get on his good side. To get the ball rolling I have a few suggestions.1. The Volkswagen Golf awardTrumpmay have German heritage– and hassparked numerous comparisonswith one particular German head of state – but he doesn’t have much love for the fatherland. He’s certainly not a fan of its auto industry: in a 2024 interview the former German chancellor Angela Merkel claimed Trump was “obsessed by the fact that, in his view,there were too many German cars in New York”. He has since done his best to boot them out;in July, Volkswagen saidTrump’s US import tariffs cost it more than £1bn in the first half of 2025. If Fifa can give out peace prizes, then the car industry can bestow sports awards. We all know Trump likes to brag about his golfing prowess – he is alwaysgoing on about his handicap. If Volkswagen came up with some sort of Trump Cup for golfing, it could be a good vehicle for tariff negotiations.2. The Big Cheesetrophy formaking AmericagrateagainIt’s not just Germany in Trump’s bad books; the president is not thrilled with France. Last monththe president told Fox News: “We’ve had a lot of problems with the French …” Time,peut-être, for France’s famous dairy industry to butter him up with an accolade that makes him feel like a grand fromage. The McDonald’s enthusiast is no gourmand, but has an insatiable appetite for adulation.3. The Humpty Dumptyprize foreggcellence in the AmericanlanguageThe Trump administration is now trying various tactics,from bullyingtobribery, to get US universities to Maga-fy themselves. Instead ofsigning dystopian “compacts”for education, I suggest colleges work together to get the president on-side by making him feel special. We all knowhe has a very high IQ, but his verbal dexterity ought to be acknowledged by the educational elite. This is a man whocoined the phrase “truthful hyperbole”andbrewed up words such as covfefe; a man with an“unpresidented”(sic) vocabulary. Whilesome sayhe rivals James Joyce in terms of output,I think the best literary reference might be Humpty Dumpty. Namely, thisquote from Lewis Carroll’s Through the Looking-Glass: “‘When I use a word,’ Humpty Dumpty said in rather a scornful tone, ‘it means just what I choose it to mean – neither more nor less.’”4. The Energizer Bunny trophy for battery conservationAt79, Trump is the oldest person ever inaugurated US president. And if you ignore the fact that he keeps beingcaught on camera dozing off, he is bursting with vim and vigour. Particularly when he’s sharing his thoughts on Truth Social. He keeps going, and going, and going … How does he keep this up? Well, Trump has said he believes the humanbody is like a batteryandhas a finite amount of energy: you can’t exercise too much or you waste it. He might not win any awards for environmental conservation, but Big Battery should find a way to empower him.5.The American Gas Associationaward forlighting thewayWhile Trump deserves a plethora of prizes, no earthly award really does him justice. He is marching the world into a new golden age; we know this because he keeps saying so. His word is like a lamp to our feet and a light to our path.

It’s about keeping the truth – and those skilled at protecting it – at a safe distanceTue 9 Dec 2025 10.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 9 Dec 2025 11.20 ESTShareDonald Trump’s war on the truth has taken many forms – spreading thousands of falsehoods, insulting journalists and suing news organizations.It’s clear he desperately wants to control the message received by the public, and to havehisversion of reality go unchallenged, whether that’s about a “rigged” election or the decreasedprice of eggs.Now there’s a new wrinkle, one that is likely to keep a lot of skilled workers from coming to the United States.A few days ago, the state department – led by Trump’s appointee and close ally Marco Rubio – instructed staff todeny visasto international applicants who work on factchecking and content moderation.The Guardian view on online safety: don’t let Trump dictate the terms of debate | EditorialRead moreIn other words, crack down on those who try to make the internet safer, to point out lies and misinformation. Keep those workers out.Applicants for H-1B visas are the first targets. Those visas usually are for highly skilled foreign workers, often in the tech industry.If applicants have worked in the past on misinformation, disinformation, fact-checking and similar topics, they simply aren’t welcome here. The Guardiandescribed the effortas the latest of Trump’s recent moves to restrict legal immigration to the US by using state department powers to bar entry to anyone who, in Rubio’s words, would suppress free speech “essential to the American way of life”.For theTrump administration, in other words, the work of fighting online misinformation is seen as anti-American censorship, contrary to the country’s free-speech ethos.Convoluted? Certainly.“The policy is incoherent and unconstitutional,” charged Carrie DeCell, an attorney and legislative expert at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University.“People who study misinformation … aren’t engaged in ‘censorship,’” she said in a statement. “They’re engaged in activities that the first amendment was designed to protect.”And Alice Goguen Hunsberger, an anti-misinformation expert for major tech companies,told NPRthat she was “alarmed that trust and safety work is being conflated with censorship”.What’s really going on here?It’s all part of a larger effort to weaken or restrict those who might hold Trump and his allies responsible for dangerous practices on the internet. More broadly, this topic predates Trump; rightwingers have long charged that they are targets of lefty censorship.For Trump, of course, this is personal, as everything with him tends to be.Recall that in early 2021, in the wake of his own online statements – about the supposedly “stolen election” that triggered the mobbing of the US Capitol on January 6 – he was permanently suspended from Twitter.That evidently hurt. For years, Twitter had been his favorite place for bluster, bombast and straight-up lies. Other major social-media platforms locked him out too, at least for a while, and there were unsubstantiated charges that the platforms were colluding with Democrats.When Elon Musk came along to buy Twitter and remake it as X – driving out many on the content-moderation team – he reinstated Trump, who by then had decamped to the ironically named Truth Social.But the pain of being barred has clearly lingered.Thus, Trump’s special animus toward content moderators, trust and safety teams, and factcheckers. It seems he didn’t forget the sting.In January, the newly elected presidenttouted“restoring freedom of speech and ending federal censorship”.“No longer will our government label the speech of our own citizens as misinformation or disinformation, which are the favorite words of censors,”Trump crowed in a speechvia video conference to the World Economic Forum.In his first-day flurry of executive orders,one of themprohibited the US government from “any conduct that would unconstitutionally abridge the free speech of any American citizen”. And it charged the attorney general with investigating the Biden administration’s supposed efforts to stem the flow of misinformation online. It said the AG should recommend “remedial actions”.Yes, retribution lies at the heart of this crackdown.“In the past, the president himself was the victim of this kind of abuse when social media companies locked his accounts,” astate department spokesperson saidin a statement last week. “He does not want other Americans to suffer this way. Allowing foreigners to lead this type of censorship would both insult and injure the American people.”Somehow, I doubt Trump is fretting about possible harm to anyone except himself. This isn’t about protecting citizens and it isn’t about censorship.It’s about keeping the truth – and those who are skilled at protecting it – at a safe distance, far from American shores.Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and cultureExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionDonald TrumpUS politicsMarco RubioSocial mediacommentShareReuse this content"

My party needs to think biggerTue 9 Dec 2025 08.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 9 Dec 2025 09.20 ESTShareYou don’t need a doctor to tell you America’s healthcare system is broken, but I’ll tell you anyway. Having led two public health departments, I’ve seen first-hand the struggles that working people face trying to survive in a system that has become unaffordable and purposely confusing.We all feel it. Most of us feel it when we try to schedule an appointment. Others feel it when we wait hours for eight minutes with a provider. Worst of all, we feel it when we face bills we can’t pay – despite being insured.Republicans are dead set on destroying the Affordable Care Act. They are proving it with cuts to Medicaid and ACA subsidies. That’s why it’s not enough for Democrats to play defense. We need to go on offense for the kind of healthcare system Americans actually deserve. And that is nothing short of the full elimination of medical debt – and guaranteeing healthcare through Medicare for All.For the last 15 years, Republicans have taken a sledgehammer to what little stability we have, all to boost their big insurance and big pharma donors. After a government shutdown over expiring ACA tax credits, many Republicans now seem hellbent on eliminating ACA tax credits altogether, effectively pricing millions out of coverage. When people are forced out of the system, they still need healthcare. They get it in emergency rooms – after their illness has progressed. That care isn’t free; its costs just get shifted on to the rest of us.The consequences of the end of ACA subsidies will pale in comparison to the$1tn in cutsto Medicaid they are making. Together, the moves point to a full-blown catastrophe. About2.3 millionpeople in my home state of Michigan use Medicaid. Americans with disabilities and seniors will lose the care they depend on. Medicaid covers39%of children in Michigan. In town halls across the state, I’ve heard directly from the folks affected by hospital closures in rural communities. There’s no way to sugar-coat these realities.At this breaking point, Democrats must meet the moment with a solution that matches the scale of the crisis: we can eliminate America’s staggering$220bn in medical debtfor pennies on the dollar. We did it for all of Wayne county when I was health director. And if Michigan’s largest county can do it, so can the rest of the country. But it’s not enough to erase debt – we have to protect Americans from accruing it in the first place. That means guaranteeing every American healthcare through Medicare for All.Medicare for All means a guaranteed comprehensive government health insurance program without copays, premiums or deductibles that is available to every single American from cradle onwards and does not exclude additional employer or union-sponsored plans as add-ons. It would protect Americans from all the ways they can lose healthcare now – including turning 26, losing a job, getting divorced or turning 65. Because it decouples employment from health coverage, people wouldn’t be punished for changing jobs. Folks who like their private insurance, through an employer or a union, could keep it as an add-on to the public plan. But they would still be protected if they lost that job or their factory closed down.Medicare for All would bring down healthcare costs across the board by eliminating the middleman in healthcare. It would also eliminate the overhead that doctors’ offices, hospitals and healthcare systems have to sustain simply because of the complexity of billing. By fully expanding the government’s power to negotiate drug prices on our behalf, Medicare for All would also reduce prescription drug prices.Expanding Medicare to cover all Americans would make the program stronger and more sustainable for seniors. It would expand the pool with younger, healthier people paying into the system.It would be good for business, too. Medicare for All could unleash a flurry of entrepreneurship by freeing Americans with great business ideas from dead-end jobs they stay in simply for the health insurance.When eight Democratic senators caved on the shutdown in the face of mounting healthcare costs, it showed that the current iteration of the party isn’t as serious as the problems they claim to be fighting against. Mounting an offensive for expanding healthcare coverage, not just defending against Republican attacks, could spur the kind of attention and excitement thatDemocratsneed heading into the midterms.That’s what I’m doing here in Michigan. I’ve seen what functional government can do for real people. I’ve made it happen myself. Americans are sick of being screwed over by their own government. This is about building trust that Democrats have the vision and grit to actually deliver for Americans. And we gain that trust by delivering marked results. It’s not enough to continue to leave Americans with scraps and expect them to thank us. We need leaders who have the courage and vision to deliver the healthcare system we all deserve.Dr Abdul El-Sayed ran two of Michigan’s largest health departments and is running for US Senate.Explore more on these topicsUS healthcareOpinionUS politicsDemocratsRepublicanscommentShareReuse this content"

Everything that does not fit this vision must be renovated, razed or sold to the highest bidder.In March, the General Services Administration published a list of443 propertiesit wanted to dump. A day later, bad press – or as the GSA put it,“overwhelming response”– moved the agency to reduce the number to 320 and a day later, totake the list downaltogether. It’s back again, with 45 properties and no stampede at the door. Oddly, nobody wants a courthouse in Medford, Oregon.Many of the buildings, like the brick and concreteCoast Guard headquartersin Boston or the monolithicWilliam O Lipinski federal buildingin Chicago, are unremarkable.There aregaragesand warehouses in the mix. Lesser structures inHawaii,NashvilleorPortlandare dear only to local historians and preservationists.But other properties on the block are gems of America’s architectural history and its collective heritage. They are not Trump’s to dispose of, like battered file cabinets or obsolete computers. They belong to us.TheRobert C Weaverbuilding, headquarters of the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (Hud), is widely considered a brutalist masterpiece, its tapered pedestals and softly arced shape showcasing what one art historian called architect Marcel Breuer’s“heavy lightness”. TheWilbur J Cohen federal building– perhaps the most distressing of the dispositions – ordisposessions –was built both to house the Social Security Administration and to celebrate the act that created the program in 1935. The building’s “commanding limestone facade combines prewar Art Moderne and stripped classicism with a subtle Egyptian flair”, says theArchitect’s Newspaper. The sumptuous interior features bronze doors, Vermont verde marble panelling and a central flight of yellow-bronze escalators.And then there’s what’s on the walls: the lobby of theJ Will Robinson federal building, in Utah,houses Early and Modern Provo,Everett Clark Thorpe’s 1941 expressionist mural, commissioned by the treasury; reminiscent of the American painter Thomas Hart Benton, it depicts a nuanced history of the city, including a white settler making a vow to the Native Americans that viewers know would be broken. Inside the Cohen building, meanwhile, are some of the country’s most important New Deal murals, including works by Ben Shahn, Philip Guston, and Seymour Fogel. Historian Gray Brechin calls it the “Sistine Chapel of the New Deal”.But whether they are celebrated or despised, the theft of these buildings from the public domain is more than a matter of brick and mortar. The selloff erases the hometown face of the federal government, literally alienating it from the people it serves. It’s hard not to imagine that is part of the plan.Furthermore, these works stand for something. Most bear the mark of Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s New Deal or the post-second world war period when human progress seemed limitless, and leaders of both parties believed that government should try to maximize it.Fogel’s mural Wealth of the Nation symbolizes the New Deal faith in science, engineering, and manual labor; his Security of the People, picturing a mother with a baby, children studying and playing, and a man reading at a fruit-laden table, illustrates the wellbeing a benevolent state can provide.Breuer’sWeaverbuilding was designed in 1965 to meet the“guiding principles for federal architecture” published by John F Kennedy’s administration – to “reflect the dignity, enterprise, vigor, and stability of the American National Government” and “embody the finest contemporary American architectural thought” – and extol Hud’s mission of urban renewal.The public-minded optimism embodied into these structures is not just symbolic; it’s material. The construction of Philadelphia’sUS Custom Houseunder the Works Progress Administration, for instance, employed 4,000 people for two years and helped hoist the city’s economy out of the Great Depression.Belief in science, muscular government, the dignity of labor, urbanism and contemporary creativity: the values of modernity, coupled with commitment to the greater good, are antithetical to all that Trump is.Meanwhile, in the spirit of his executive order“Making the District of Columbia Safe and Beautiful”, Trump is remaking the District of Columbia in his own image.TheEisenhower Executive Office Building, slated for a paint job, houses the treasury department, among other offices, but it is no architectural treasure. When it opened in 1888, Mark Twain called the Napoleonic pile the “ugliest building in America” – just Trump’s kind of place. A white coat does not promise improvement, however. Even Fox News’sLaura Ingrahamwondered whether it might look like a “big white blob”.The Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool upgrade appears so far to involve nothing more than raking muck from around the edges. Eleven months into his term,Trump blames his predecessorfor the eyesore.The ballroom approaches groundbreaking, with anew architectsigned on (the first one is facingconcerns about his professional standing). The watchdogs are sedated. When the East Wing was a heap of rubble, the presidentfiredsix of the seven members of theUS Commission of Fine Arts, whose job is to advise officials on design and aesthetics in public structures and spaces. Suddenly a rule-follower, Trump now plans tobring the new blueprintsto the National Capital Planning Commission, chaired by Will Scharf,his former lawyer. Scharf worked on the supreme court case that got the president criminal immunity for official acts. If his administration cankidnapcitizens off the streets, surely the president can knock down some fusty rooms and raise a 90,000-sq-ft monstrosity in their place.The next item on the agenda, aneoclassical triumphal arch, would be topped by a gold Winged Victory figure flanked by two eagles. Sited in the traffic circle at the Arlington Memorial Bridge, its largest version would dwarf the Lincoln Monument. The arch is supposed to commemorate America’s 250th anniversary. But like Trump’s twomilitaryparades, it has a more mortal honoree.“Who’s this for?” askedCBS News’s Ed O’Keefe, noticing the maquette in the Oval Office.Trump replied: “Me.”In 1968, New York Times architecture criticAda Louise Huxtablepraised Breuer’s Hud building as “a handsome, functional structure that adds quality design and genuine 20th-century style to a city badly in need of both”, rather than “some half-baked adaptation of the grandeur of the past”.Trashing monumental public works while building cheesy monuments to himself, Trump denigrates both history and the future, the collective heritage and the idea of modernity itself.“We have spent too many decades mistaking the superficial forms for the essential spirit and forfeiting the Capital’s greatness,” Huxtable added. The sentence could describe Trump’s Washington – and his mingy, me-first American ideal.Judith Levine is a Brooklyn-based journalist, essayist and author of five books.

It won’t be easy – but here’s how to fight backPaul TaylorWith democratic values under attack from populists within and former allies without, there are no simple solutionsTue 9 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 9 Dec 2025 11.15 ESTShareThree decades after political philosopher Francis Fukuyama declared theEnd of Historyand the “universalisation of western liberal democracy as the final form of human government”, the democratic model is under attack in many parts of the world, not least here in Europe. Populists bent on weakening the rule of law, rolling back human rights protections, subjugating the judiciary and cowing independent journalism are amplified by anything-goes social media algorithms that promote anger and polarisation over rational discourse.They have now received amandate from the Trump administration, which effectively declared civilisational war on the EU and its values in itsNational Security Strategy.The growing failure, meanwhile, of our market democracies to deliver affordable housing, universal quality education and healthcare, and security of employment – what the economist Joseph Stiglitz calls the “inequality emergency” – is alienating many young and working-class people from democracy, fuelling the rise of illiberalism and authoritarianism.The combination of grievance-based identity politics and what some calltechno-fascismposes a danger to our democratic system of governance. It is tearing at the fabric of our liberal polities, reversing women’s and gay rights, and loosening the employment and welfare protections that arepart of Europe’s social contract.In the past 12 months alone, enemies of liberal democracy haveundermined the integrity of elections, harmed the ability of governments to implement evidence-based policy on issues such as climate change and vaccination, andweakened the role of watchdogssuch as the courts,digital regulatorsandanti-corruption authorities.Yet we are much better at describing and analysing – cynics say “admiring” – the problem than at crafting effective strategies to combat the forces undermining democracy. A range of suggestions for how to fight back was outlined at the annual conference of the European Policy Centre (EPC) inBrussels last week. But each one of them is fraught with difficulty.Many people argued that the European Union and key national authorities such as Ireland’s communication regulator should speed up enforcing the EU’s existing digital laws. The EU has the power to fine US tech giants for failing to moderate and remove illegal content, disclose their algorithms to researchers and regulators, and protect the private data of European users.Why is enforcement taking so long? Well, because of the rule of law. “This is a due process system,” Renate Nikolay deputy-director for communications at theEuropean Commissionsaid. She rejects allegations that the EU is deregulating or lowering standards as part of its drive to simplify EU legislation, or going slow out of fear of threatened US trade retaliation.The commission has issued seven so-called preliminary findings against tech giants such asApple, Meta, Googleand TikTok, accusing them of breaching EU tech rules over issues such as denying researchers access to platforms’ data, ability to notify illegal content and challenge moderation decisions. Its most recent action was to slap a€120m fineon Elon Musk’s X (formerly known as Twitter) for making users pay for blue tick authentification without doing any effective verification.Trump’s new doctrine confirms it. Ready or not, Europe is on its own | Georg Riekeles and Varg FolkmanRead moreTechnology, especially AI, is advancing faster than EU regulation. The EU’s effort to prevent big tech undermining the European way of democracy is not exactly helped when Ireland, the low-tax country where many US tech companies elected to put their European headquarters,appoints a former Meta lobbyistas one of its three top data protection regulators.For some, especially on the left, the key to preserving liberal democracy is to address people’s bread-and-butter needs for affordable housing, well-paid jobs and effective public services. They contend that the main reason for the rise of the extreme right and radical left, and their attraction for young people and old industrial workers, is the failure of the mainstream centre-left and centre-right parties that have governed for decades to deliver on these issues. In this telling, those who have lost out under neoliberalism and globalisation are wreaking revenge on liberal democracy.The trouble is that solutions to the housing crisis reside at national and local level, not under an EU roof, and they are hard to deliver quickly because of planning regulations, nimbyism and cost. Many European social democrats and leftists are excited about the New York mayoral election victory of Zohran Mamdani on a laser-focused platform of free bus travel, rent control, public non-profit grocery stores in poor neighbourhoods, free childcare and building more affordable housing. They also point to the success of Spain’s leftwing government, which has raised social benefits and welcomed immigration while presiding over thefastest growing economy in Europe.Yet that has not stopped the growth of far-right populism. Spain’s anti-migrant Vox party has seenits support jumpfrom 12.4% at the 2023 general election to almost 20% now. Social democratic parties are losing ground across much of Europe.Some democracy campaigners see the key to turning the tide in appealing to public fears by depicting the populists as a danger to the European way of life and prosperity. Fabian Zuleeg, chief executive of the EPC, argues that liberal democrats must start behaving as if they were in an existential fight, because they are. “Why are we not doing anything offensive, attacking the other side’s weaknesses, their disdain for the people?” he asked.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Nor has exhuming past racist statements by their candidates or highlighting the incoherence of their economic platforms caused more than passing embarrassment, if that.Dramatising a dramatic situation carries its own dangers. Framing the last US presidential election as an existential battle between democracy and authoritarianism – however accurate that may have turned out to be – did not swing voters behind Democrat Kamala Harris. Donald Trump triumphed by playing on public anger over the cost of living, immigration and perceived threats to family values and masculinity. Nor did warnings of massive economic damage, which opponents brandedProject Fear, save David Cameron from losing the 2016 referendum over leaving the EU.An alternative way propounded by some democracy campaigners is simply to do politics better and learn from the campaigns of the extremists. “We need to get back to grassroots politics,” said Lisa Witter, CEO of the Better Politics Foundation, a non-partisan centre that trains young political pros and activists in modern campaign techniques.Populist parties have become trailblazers in the use of TikTok, Instagram and other social media platforms. In Hungary, Viktor Orbán’s Fidesz party makes huge and effective use of paid online influencers. In Romania, the hard-right Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR) party is better at using playful apps to attract and reward young activists, and more assiduous at the shoe-leather politics of leafleting marketplaces and doorstep campaigning.Centrist Emmanuel Macron outflanked the mainstream parties by using grassroots activism in his rise to the French presidency in 2017, and Dutch left-liberal leader Rob Jetten’s D66 party successfully used some of the same techniques to score asurprise winwith a positive, pro-European message recently. But centrist populism is no guarantee of success, especially for parties that have long been in coalition governments.Perhaps some combination of the four can save Europe’s liberal democracies, but for the moment the tide seems to be flowing strongly in the other direction.Paul Taylor is a senior visiting fellow at the European Policy CentreExplore more on these topicsEuropeOpinionThe far rightDonald TrumpEuropean CommissioncommentShareReuse this content"

For others, it will mean considering how they will cope with the next heatwave or bushfire. Already,two states have been burning.The least bold prediction for the summer is that temperature records will tumble. It’s what happens when temperatures are on average 1.5C hotter than a little over a century ago.If logic ruled, it might sharpen focus for the Australian political class going into 2026 on prioritising how to tackle the country’s addiction to the main driver of this change: the production of fossil fuels.It’s been two years since the climate change minister, Chris Bowen, declared“the age of fossil fuels will end”after nearly 200 countries agreed that the world should transition away from use of coal, oil and gas. That position was reinforced at the recent Cop30 summit in Brazil, when Australia signed up to what activists described asits strongest declaration yetthat countries should act rapidly on fossil fuels to try to limit global heating to roughly where it is now.What does that mean the country should do at home? So far, on its world-leading coal and gas export industries, the message from the government is: not much different.1:51Ed Husic says Australia ‘begs for the scraps’ from profiteering gas companies – videoChange is happening in the country’s main power grid, where renewable energy contributed nearly 50% of electricity over the past week, surpassing coal-fired generation. That trajectory is increasingly clear, thoughthe pace is uncertainand the transition faces resistance.The response to a recent report by the Australian Energy Market Operator was a snapshot of how the climate challenge is often framed. The report warned the investment needed in system security measures to keep the power grid functional as ageing coal plants closed was not happening fast enough. It raised the possibility that the Eraring coal station, the oldest in the country, may have its life extended if enoughsynchronous generators– spinning machines that provide the inertia that the system needs – were not connected in time.Sign up to get climate and environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a free newsletterSome news media translated this into headlines warning of blackouts if Eraring shut in 2027. The message to a casual reader or listener was reduced to a caution not to shut down fossil fuels.The report had a different emphasis. Its central point was that investment in grid security needed to accelerate, and that a short extension of the life of a coal plant could be necessary if that didn’t happen in time.Put bluntly: change is coming, we better get moving.That message should be familiar. It echoes the advice from scientists, global investors, plenty of industry, most of civil society and the leading international agencies. But, as the treatment of the Aemo report showed, it often receives only lip service in an environment that struggles to imagine a world beyond reliance on fossil fuels.This is most obviously the case with Australia’s biggest contribution to the climate crisis – its world-leading coal and liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports.Thirsty work: how the rise of massive datacentres strains Australia’s drinking water supplyRead moreAustralia is second only to Indonesia in shipping thermal coal, which is burned to create electricity. It rivals the US and Qatar as the biggest seller of LNG. It is easily the biggest exporter of metallurgical coal, which is used in steelmaking.The country has not reduced this footprint since the then Coalition government signed up to the landmark Paris climate agreement in 2015. Instead, it has sprinted in the opposite direction.A recent report by Oil Change International found Australia led the world in expanding its oil and gas industries between 2015 and 2024, increasing production by 77%.On coal, Australia is shipping more of the thermal stuff than it was a decade ago. And the Albanese government has approved at least 32 fossil fuel developments and expansions since its election in 2022, overwhelmingly for export.Some in the government appear to believe these exports can continue indefinitely. Dan Repacholi, the Labor MP for Hunter in the New South Wales coal belt, last monthtold parliament it was “rubbish”to suggest the government’s commitment to reaching net zero emissions by 2050 meant coalmines would have to shut because “net zero is about one thing: offsets”.Under this thinking, pollution can continue at existing or greater levels indefinitely. Nothing to worry about.But thescientific advice plainly says the opposite– that reaching net zero emissions will require deep cuts in emissions and limiting the use of offsets to cases where there are not viable alternatives.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The world will fail if they are deployed to justify burning dirty fuels when there are alternatives.That’s the science. If you believe Australia has an ethical responsibility to act on climate, that should be enough.But the more potent political argument that Australia needs to do much more to prepare for an end to its fossil fuel exports is likely to be based on economics.When demand for coal does fall, China and India are likely to cut imports firstTreasury modelling in September found the value of coal and exportscould crash by 50% in the next five years, regardless of how fast Australia cuts emissions domestically. It forecast that the volume of coal exported would drop by between 42% and 51% over the next decade. LNG exports would fall by about a quarter.Why? Because despite the best efforts of the leaders of the US, Saudi Arabia and Russia, most countries are preparing for a world less reliant on fossil fuels.A new report by the advisory firm Climate Resource argues that if countries act to meet their targets the decline of the coal export industry could come even faster than Treasury suggests. It found demand for Australia’s thermal coal – mostly from NSW – could fall 64% or more over the next decade. The Queensland-based metallurgical coal industry could reduce output by at least 28%.Labor’s nature law overhaul contains wins – but we should watch for gremlins in the details | Adam MortonRead moreIt indicates when demand for coal does fall, China and India are likely to cut imports first, allowing their domestic thermal coal industries a more gradual decline.South Korea, Australia’s fourth-biggest market for thermal coal, has alreadysignalled it is headed for the exit, last month joining 60 other nations in the “Powering Past Coal Alliance” and pledging to shut all its coal plants by 2040.Climate Resource’s Dr Anita Talberg says the message for Australia is that it should be doing more to manage economic risks. That includes helping fossil fuel communities through what is coming and expandingits commitment to foster the green industriesit wants to build.Her warning is the same as that from scientists after the bushfires that this week destroyed parts of NSW and Tasmania: “The worst thing we can do is not prepare.”Expect to hear that a lot more next year.Adam Morton is Guardian Australia’s climate and environment editor and writes theClear Air newsletterExplore more on these topicsFossil fuelsClear airCoalEnergy (Australia news)Climate crisisEnergy (Environment)Renewable energycommentShareReuse this content"

Asylum for people genuinely fleeing persecution will always remain the mark of decent, compassionate countries. But controlling who comes here is an essential task of government and is what the public rightly demands.That’s why we are both taking practical action to fix the asylum system.Denmarkhas led the way here, with tough but fair reforms which have delivered results.Last year, the number of people being granted asylum in Denmark was thelowest in 40 years, excluding the Covid year of 2020.The UK has taken similar steps. After years of gimmicks and failed policies, we are going further than ever before with action at home – surging removals of those with no right to be here and making settlement reliant on integration and contribution, while pushing for coordinated international action too.The current asylum framework was created for another era. In a world with mass mobility, yesterday’s answers do not work. We will always protect those fleeing war and terror – but the world has changed andasylum systemsmust change with it.Today, millions are on the move not only because their lives are in danger, but because they want a better future. If we fail to take account of this, we would fail the needs of genuine refugees and the communities that for too long have been asked to absorb rapid change.For decades, citizens in our countries have demanded action. So we are acting – not to exploit these issues and stoke grievances as some do, but to find real solutions.The best way of fighting against the forces of hate and division is to show that mainstream, progressive politics can fix this problem.Listening to legitimate concerns and acting on them is what our politics is about. That’s not empty populism, it’s democracy. We are determined to show that our societies can act with compassion while upholding law and order, and fairness.We are making this case across Europe, and momentum for change is building. More countries are now pursuing similar approaches – ensuring that protection is available for those refugees who need it, while making it connected to clear expectations of integration and contribution.That’s what people want their governments to do – maintain control over who comes and who stays, and do it on our terms. We get it. And if you commit serious crimes, you lose the right to stay. That principle is not extreme – it is common sense.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is not a new trend – but it is now being supercharged by generative AI tools that make it easier, quicker and cheaper than ever to perpetrate online violence against women in public life – from journalists to human rights defenders, politicians and activists.The objectives are clear: to help justify the rollback of gender equality and women’s reproductive rights; to chill women’s freedom of expression and their participation in democratic deliberation; to discredit truth-tellers; and to pave the way for the consolidation of authoritarian power.These are not the rantings of a “crazy cat lady” or a “fat, ugly whore”, although I’ve been called both. This analysis is rooted in hard – and frankly terrifying – data from new research I led, which hasjust been publishedby UN Women.For the report – Tipping Point: The chilling escalation of online violence against women in the public sphere – my team and I surveyed hundreds of women in journalism, human rights and activism across 119 countries, documenting their experiences with online violence and the real-world harms it triggers.What we found is a sharp, and potentially deadly, escalation in the incidence of online violence escalating to “real-world” harm. This is most acute for female journalists, where we see a dramatic acceleration in this trajectory.When we surveyed this groupin 2020, one-fifth of them reported offline attacks, abuse and harassment connected to the online violence they had experienced. But when we repeated the survey five years later, that alarming statistic had more than doubled – to 42%. These women have beenswatted, assaulted – and even abused in the company of their children.These threats are heightened by the mainstreaming of generative-AI tools that allow for the near-instant misrepresentation and discrediting of female journalists through the deployment of deepfakes and worse. We found that over 19% of female journalists had experienced what they believed to be AI-assisted online violence.The online-offline violence trajectory represents a vicious and self-perpetuating circle. Online harassment and threats beget offline attacks, and offline abuse, such as political actors targeting female journalists during public appearances, can trigger an escalation of online violence that, in turn, can exacerbate offline risks.This cycle of violence is even more dangerous when the abuse comes from powerfulpolitical figures. These abuses of power are part of a continuum of violence experienced by women in public life all over the world. I have studied dozens of emblematic cases of online violence against female journalists – from Mexico to India and South Africa, and from the UK and the US to the Philippines. My new boss – theNobel laureate Maria Ressa– has beenthreatened with being raped “to death”. But none was more chilling than that of the assassinated Maltese investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia,whose murderwaslinked to years of misogynistic online violencedirected at her prior to her death.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But do they have any long-term benefits or increase lifespan?Melissa DaveyMuch of the enthusiasm for these ‘anti-ageing’ products is based on animal studies, mostly involving rodentsTue 9 Dec 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 9 Dec 2025 20.19 ESTShareThere are many acronyms you might find on the packaging of so-called longevity supplements, promoted by influencers for their ability to “repair DNA” and assist in “anti-ageing”.NRC (nicotinamide riboside chloride) and NMN (nicotinamide mononucleotide) are two of them – both precursors or “building blocks” for NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide), anaturally occurring moleculein the body. Trimethylglycine (TMG) is another and is sometimes added to “support” other ingredients.Packaged together, these ingredients are supposed to “boost daily vitality” and “improve cellular health”, according to their promoters.But is there any evidence to support these claims?What are longevity supplements?While some longevity supplements contain multiple ingredients in one tablet, others promote “stacking” – that is, buying different products and ingredients and taking them together for an optimum longevity boost.Want to live longer? Forget blue zones – these factors improve your chances of ageing well | Melissa DaveyRead moreProf Oliver Jones, an internationally recognised expert in analytical science with RMIT University, says NAD is involved in many chemical reactions in the body, including energy production and DNA repair.“Your body has two main ways to get NAD,” he says.“It can create it from scratch … or it can recycle it from other compounds. Some people suggest one can boost NAD production by providing the precursor compounds.”The reason NAD-promoting supplements keep getting pushed as anti-ageing is twofold, Jones says, “Because NAD is part of a lot of essential biochemical processes in the body, and because concentrations of NAD are reported to decline as we age.”What the evidence saysWhile clever marketing makes it sound like products containing these or other building blocks can increase longevity, “the likelihood that any single compound among the many thousands in the body is responsible for all ageing is pretty much zero”, Jones says.“Even if NAD concentrations did decline with age, that would not mean that the decrease in NAD caused the ageing,” Jones says. “There are plenty of biochemical changes associated with ageing but that does not mean the changes caused the ageing.”One Instagram ad states that “NAD levels increase by 51% in 14 days” after taking a particular longevity supplement. But Jones says increases in a single biomarker don’t always equate to meaningful changes, such as reduced disease.“While 51% sounds like a large increase, it only means your original concentration went up by half the original amount,” he says.“For example, if you start with 0.25mg of a compound, increasing it by 51% gives you 0.38mg, which is not much more. It is easy to use a percentage increase to make something sound large.”The question we should ask is not “do NAD concentrations increase or not” but “does it matter if they increase or not”, he says.What is protein water – and can it help me lose weight and gain muscle? | AntiviralRead moreProf Bruce Neal, a physician and executive director of the George Institute for GlobalHealth, says to determine that “you need large, well-designed trials that show real outcomes, such as fewer heart attacks, better physical function, longer life”.“For these products, that kind of evidence just doesn’t exist.”Very few human studies have been doneDanielle Shine, an accredited dietitian, nutritionist and PhD candidate researching nutrition misinformation on social media, says much of the enthusiasm for longevity products is “based on animal studies, mainly involving rodents, which rarely translate reliably to humans, especially for complex outcomes like ageing or long-term health”.“Humans aren’t rodents,” she says. “We metabolise compounds differently, live in far more variable environments and age in fundamentally different ways.”She said a few small NMN studies in adults aged 40-65 reported minor improvements in subjective energy or walking distance “but there’s no evidence that these short-term changes translate into long-term health benefits or increased lifespan”.Neal adds that combining ingredients in the hope the right “stack” will boost health “is just another clever way of getting people to spend more money on things that probably won’t help them”.“If you think the supplement offsets drinking more or smoking, that’s also a problem.”So what actually improves longevity?Shine says maintaining a healthy and well-balanced diet, drinking water, exercise that includes resistance training, getting enough sleep, managing stress, nurturing social connections, avoiding harmful substances and protecting your skin with broad-spectrum sunscreen all help.“Keeping up with preventative healthcare, including vaccinations, routine check-ups and evidence-based screening tests” is also important, she says.“No supplement can match or replace these foundational habits for supporting overall health and longevity.”Melissa Davey is Guardian Australia’s medical editorAntiviralis a fortnightly column that interrogates the evidence behind the health headlines and factchecks popular wellness claimsShare your experienceShare your experienceWhat health trend do you want examined?Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

Just don’t forget to engage your brainMarina HydeThe Green party leader is riding high in the polls. But across the political spectrum, uncritical adulation leads nowhere fastTue 9 Dec 2025 06.57 ESTLast modified on Tue 9 Dec 2025 12.35 ESTShareShortly after Donald Trump launched his first White House run in 2015, television’s Kelly Osbourne made one of her regular appearances on The View, which is basically the American version of Loose Women but doesn’t feel the need to have a cringey title. Trump had made someextremely nasty commentsabout Mexican immigrants, and Kelly had a rhetorical question for the other ladies gathered round the wood-effect dining table that morning. “You kick every Latino out of this country,”she sassed, “then WHO is going to be cleaning your toilet, Donald Trump?”Oooooof. The reaction from fellow panellist Rosie Perez was instantaneously negative, to the point that even Kelly realised in the moment that this needed clean-up. Apparently there weren’t any willing rubber-gloved Latinos on hand, so madam was going to have to do it herself. “I didn’t mean it like that,” Osbourne shot back. “Come on! You know I would never mean it like that! I’m not part of this argument.” Amedia firestormnonetheless ensued, though Kelly declined to apologise for even the appearance of racism, I think on the basis that people like her simply are not capable of subconsciously holding unpleasant views that they accidentally reveal while making important TV appearances.I must say I thought of Kelly’s faux pas when I saw Green party leader Zack Polanskiappearing on Question Timelast week. If you missed this moment, or are trying to avoid it because you quite want to vote for him and are already trying to avoid the boob-hypnosis video (more on that later!), Zack took the opportunity of the show’s immigration special to explain to the audience: “One in five care workers are foreign nationals. I don’t know about you, but I don’t particularly want to wipe someone’s bum, and I’m very grateful for the people who do this work.”Again: ooooooof. Sothat’swhat they’re there for – and, indeed,that’swhat care work is. Still, what a standup guy for being grateful.And thank goodness for the anti-woke vibe shift, right? After all, Zack metaphorically showing his arse while talking about elderly and disabled people’s “bums” is precisely the sort of thing that the cancellers would have cancelled you for as recently as a year ago. Imagine my synthetic shock, then, to note so many of the great witch-hunters of the past decade finding absolutely nothing to see here. Imagine my synthetic wonderment at all theGreen partydevotees who are able to defend this moment as coming from a good place. I guess that like Kelly, people like Zack simply are not capable of subconsciously holding unpleasant views that they accidentally reveal while making important TV appearances.Indeed, Polanski’s reflexive supporters point to the fact his partner works in palliative care, a line of reasoning that feels not entirely unrelated to that old rhetorical masterstroke: “How can I hate women? My mum’s one.” But the Greens are currentlypolling almost equalwith the Tories and Labour, meaning any criticism of them is conveniently dismissed by vocal supporters as evidence that critics are “rattled”. If only Kelly Osbourne had been polling at 16% 10 years ago – it would have saved her a lot of flak.And in many ways, there can be no more sobering comment on the utter failures of this century’s various governments than the fact that 16% of the country is currently intending to vote for a guy who once told a woman he could make her breasts bigger by hypnosis. “This is an extremely new approach,” Polanski claimed in a video of the 2013 session, which he knew upfront was for anarticle for the Sun, “but I can see it becoming popular very quickly, because it’s so safe and a lot cheaper than a boob job.” Oh dear.Yet so tribal is our politics these days that Zack’s “extremely new approach” in this department is routinely defended as an adorable form of altruism by people who would literally never stop decrying it had the boob-hypnosis been performed by any other male party leader. “His crime?” explained a hilariouspro-Polanski opinion articlein the Evening Standard. “Remaining professional while being bated [sic] and volunteering his time and skills to help a woman feel at ease with her body … A Prime Minister who could boost cup sizes would boost the national mood and inspire more patriotism than the current competitive flag loving.” Okaaay!Listen, nobody’s perfect. People have always held their nose at aspects of politicians’ characters in order to be able to put a cross in one box or another. But across the political spectrum in recent years, that sort of realistic clearsightedness has evaporated in favour of something much more likestan culture, where your idol has to be ferociously defended even when they’re in the wrong, simply because they’re your idol. In fact, because they’re your idol, they are axiomatically incapable of being in the wrong. This tendency is most definitely not limited to the left of that spectrum – you get it with Donald Trump or Nigel Farage or anyone whose supporters frequently refuse to be honest with themselves in the face of inconvenient revelations.

But trans people are protected by discrimination law tooTue 9 Dec 2025 06.45 ESTLast modified on Tue 9 Dec 2025 07.56 ESTShareWhen the chief executive of the Women’s Institutesaid last weekthat she felt the organisation had no choice but to end its 40-year policy of transgender inclusion, she sounded genuinely upset. When askedon Woman’s Hourwhether a debate over trans members had been raging inside the organisation this year, Melissa Green was clear that “this hasn’t been a conversation that has dominated”. Much of the pressure, she said, had come from outside the organisation.The decision followed asimilar announcement from Girlguidingthe day before, which will now ban trans girls from joining. Both organisations blamed the change on April’s supreme court ruling on the meaning of the word “sex” in the Equality Act 2010, but that’s far from the whole story. Really, it’s about those pressuring organisations on the basis that the case is closed, and exclusion is now legally required – when that is far from the case.Consider theGuides. The court ruled that “sex” in the Equality Act means “biological sex” (what is, usually, recorded at birth) in contrast to “certificated sex”– which would have meant, for example, that trans women with a gender recognition certificate were considered female under the act. But under-18s have never been able to get gender recognition certificates. This means that whether a “biological” or “certificated” interpretation is adopted is entirely irrelevant to the inclusion of trans girls. Either way, they would have been considered “male” under the act. If they could be lawfully included notwithstanding this before April, they still can be now. Clearly, then, it isn’t a change to statutory interpretation which is at issue here.So, what has actually happened? Since the supreme court decision, organisations have faced lobbying and legal threats seeking to compel them to exclude trans people. Girlguidinghasreportedlyfaced a legal threat over its longstanding policy of inclusion, while Green said there had been “reference to legal challenge” in communications the WI had received. (In one Mumsnet thread, a user claimed that she was getting her husband to sue the Women’s Institute for sex discrimination against him, in order to force them to exclude trans women.) Sex Matters has filed a claim with the high court to try to force the Hampstead ladies’ pond to exclude trans women – even though they recently voted to remain inclusive. The group is also writing toa vast swatheof organisations putting pressure on them to change their policies to be trans-exclusionary because “the law is clear”. But the truth is that the law is as clear as mud on this issue.The Equality and Human Rights Commission, which rushed out anow-withdrawn“interim update” just nine days after the supreme court ruling, is awaiting judgment from the high court in a challenge against the lawfulness of that guidance. The EHRC had claimed that service providers and employers were now required to exclude, for example, trans women from women’s toilets. Both the Good Law Project, where I am the trans rights lead, and the equalities minister, Bridget Phillipson, argued that this was wrong and that organisations could remain inclusive. Meanwhile, the government is still considering the EHRC’s guidance, which must be approved by Phillipson before it is put to parliament.The Equality Act potentially permits organisations to operate on a trans-exclusionary basis, providing this can be justified, but it does not require it. And there are multiple ways under the act that an organisation may justify operating on a trans-inclusionary basis. A decision of an employment tribunal in Scotland last week ruled thatLeonardo UK’s trans-inclusive toilet policydid not place biological women at a disadvantage, and was a proportionate means of achieving an inclusive workplace. Inanother tribunal decision this week, the judgesaida trans woman using female-only facilities “may be lawful” under the Equality Act.Does it even matter what the law actually says? As a lawyer, I would hope so. But in reality, frightened of being sued, I can see how organisations would be tempted to capitulate – especially when they think the legal threats are all coming from one side. It doesn’t matter if they would eventually win in court – the question is whether they can justify the risk, and the potentially destructive cost of litigation against them. When that organisation is a charity, trustees are placed in an even more difficult position, and will be scared of what view the Charity Commission might take if you decide to fight back.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Trans people are protected by discrimination law, too, and as organisations start to realise that they were mis-sold on the implications of the supreme court judgment, many will see that they have been led astray. We are also still realising the full extent of the human rights implications, which will become clearer, not just for trans people, but also for women’s rights to freedom of association under article 11 of the Human Rights Act. These issues will come back to bite both organisations and the government if they are not urgently addressed.What last week has shown is that, despite their hopes to the contrary, anti-trans campaigners have not won the hearts and minds they hoped the supreme court would give them. The response to these decisions from those inside and outside the organisations shows how many people want to remain trans inclusive, and are looking for ways to continue to be so. The pressure on organisations looking to stay trans inclusive is immense – the hope is that they will capitulate, and that this will cause a domino effect of smaller organisations which feel like they have no chance of fighting back.But this is a moment that requires bravery in standing up for what is right. Organisations that value trans people should know not just that the law is on their side – but so, also, are many people who will step up to defend them if they have the courage to take a stand.Jess O’Thomson is trans rights lead at the Good Law Project and head of policy at the Trans+ Solidarity AllianceDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

As the Blairite ideologues mass behind Wes Streeting, we should hold them to account tooTue 9 Dec 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 9 Dec 2025 11.12 ESTShareThere have been far too few defences of Keir Starmer in the British press of late. Time for a modest redress. As the last rites are muttered over his premiership, his colleagues want you to know that this is all his fault. The humiliation is complete: even Labour Together – the outfit that quietly plotted Starmer’s leadership bid – is now sharpening its knives. It ispolling memberson who should replace him, indulging the comforting fantasy that swapping captains will somehow stop the ship from sinking.The Tory experience of regicide should offer a caution: do not depose a king unless you have already settled on a prince who understandswhythe kingdom is in crisis. The Tories toppled Boris Johnson and installed Liz Truss, whose zeal to slash taxes for the wealthy detonated the markets and sealed her party’s fate. Why? Because they convinced themselves that Johnson had failed for being insufficiently rightwing.In Starmer’s case, the Blairites – including Blair himself – whisper that asupposed leftward lurchis to blame. Starmer, they insist, was never a true believer in the Labour right. Combine that with his lack of vision and shortage of charisma, and the autopsy is complete. Their answer is the health secretary,Wes Streeting: a Blairite ultra who seems to have coveted the premiership since roughly the moment he learned to walk.Streeting has tried in recent months toburnish progressive credentialsonGazaandanti-racism, but don’t be fooled. A couple of years ago, he openly sketched out hisleadership bid strategy: “I’d tack left. You win the Labour leadership from the left, as I reminded Tony Blair from time to time.” His true instincts were laid bare in 2021, when he was reported to havetold the shadow cabinet: “Every day, we should drag a sacred cow of our party to the town market place and slaughter it until we are up to our knees in blood.” New Labour zealotry married to (alleged) charisma: the perfect antidote, they say, to the doomed Starmer project.His charm is loston the British public. Despite being Labour’s favoured media performer for years, his net approval rating sits at -21. As shadow health secretary during the NHS’s collapse under the Tories, he had the easiest gig in British politics – stand up for a beloved, ailing national institution – and stillhis ratings were negative. Admirers tout his backstory, from childhood poverty to Cabinet Office, but being the son of a toolmaker does not appear to have saved Starmer.The latter is now dismissed as wooden. It wasn’t always thus.Commentators once cooedthat “he looks the part”.Labour MPswho today might shudder at his name once boasted, upon his election, “for the first time in 10 years we’ve got a leader who looks like a prime minister”.After posing as a leftwing candidate to win the leadership of the Labour party in 2020, Starmer made a pact with the Labour right, effectively saying, I will do whatever you ask. Those same ideologues bragged that Starmer was merely their frontman – that he “thinks he’s driving the train” when they’d placed him at the front of a driverless DLR, as an anonymous member of his inner circle is reported to have said. He duly packed his operation with Blairite torchbearers. The current government is littered with New Labour retreads, such as Blair’s chief of staff Jonathan Powell, and former advisers Tim Allan and Liz Lloyd.NoLabourleader has ever enacted such a ruthless purge of the left. As for the “sacred cows” attributed to Streeting, the slaughterhouse has been busy indeed. Starmer has repeatedly attacked the welfare state – from winter fuel payments to disability benefits – though the latter was too extreme even for a supine parliamentary Labour party. Anti-migrant rhetoric has culminated with plans to introduce one of the harshest asylum systems in Europe. The international aid budget has been gutted. He genuflects before Donald Trump. And he has resurrected Blair’s great obsession: ID cards. By the sacred cow metric, Labour are up to their necks in blood. If bashing migrants and the welfare state were truly popular, this administration would be flying high. Instead, it is the least popular government in polling history.My defence of Starmer is a limited one, admittedly, but it is clear enough: this is not all his fault. Yes, he is responsible for surrendering to the very faction Streeting embodies. But Starmer’s central failing – a total absence of vision – is not uniquely his. It is the defining weakness of the Labour right, the faction to whom he outsourced his politics. Their worldview,which positions them as the credible managers of British capitalism against a supposedly juvenile left, effectively expired with the 2008 financial crash, which destroyed the strategy of pumping money into public services without challenging the Thatcherite economic model beneath. Starmer is simply a convenient scapegoat for a faction that offers no serious analysis of Britain’s predicament.There has been no “leftward lurch”. Belatedly ending the two-child benefit cap was welcome, but should have been instinctive for any Labour government. The budget was designed primarily to soothe the bond markets. If Labour has veered left, its voters have not noticed. The Greens, running on an explicitly leftwing platform, are surging. Polling suggests that far more 2024 Labour voters would switch to the Greens or the Liberal Democrats than Reform or the Tories. Blairites have long insisted that leftwing views were marginal and that progressive voters had nowhere else to go. They were wrong on both counts.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Anyone hoping Rayner will offer salvation should prepare for disappointment. Someone who moved from being a Jeremy Corbyn loyalist to one of the faces of Starmer’s government will inevitably face accusations of being a shapeshifter. For now, she certainly looks like someone without a clear, robust and coherent vision or the kind of support base needed to support a premiership that breaks from Britain’s failed economic model.Labour should make Streeting’s lifelong dream come true. No one can claim he is not a true Blairite believer. When he fails, no excuses will remain for Labour’s right. It is they, not Starmer, who have sunk the party.

For all the talk of Brexit ‘benefits’, the anti-EU ideologues know the tide has turnedTue 9 Dec 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 9 Dec 2025 08.46 ESTShareAll the old gang were there: a reunion of the Brexit triumphalists. I was one of the guests in the stately drawing room of Jacob Rees-Mogg’s Georgian townhouse in Westminster last week, as the Bruges Group met to cheer the launch of the new book 75 Brexit Benefits: Tangible Benefits from the UK Having Left the European Union. Tory Brexiteers Iain Duncan Smith, Bill Cash and John Redwood were all there, a gathering of the kind of Eurosceptics John Major once called the “bastards”.Our host, Rees-Mogg, was in jubilant form, celebrating Keir Starmer’s recent speeches that named the economic damage done by Brexit. In Labour’s new willingness to touch the Brexit live rail, the Bruges Group members welcomed the revival of the grand old conflict as their way back to referendum glory days. Rees-Mogg chortled: “Starmer’s view that re-entering theEuropean Unionis the answer to our economy is as true as everything else he says.” Much mirth, as he departed early for his State of the Nation slot on GB News.Are they right thatLabourreopening the Brexit wound will reignite toxic old referendum passions? Nothing ever divided the country as much as that mendacious, xenophobic and in essence frivolous leave campaign. Its leaders were in it for fun and personal advancement: the Tory party was destroyed by it, only Nigel Farage has benefited. The bitter campaign split families, workplaces and neighbourhoods, stirring anti-migrant hate. Nothing in my lifetime has caused such deep political grief.For all the anguish it caused the losing side, it was soon plain it gave no corresponding joy to most leave voters, who are still facing its real-life effects. Soured political attitudes spring partly from the empty hyperbole of “Take back control” and a “sovereignty” signifying nothing. Who feels empowered by the failure of a country falling further behind? Thepernicious warningthat 88 million Turks could “flood” into a UK remaining in the EU, and Farage’s “breaking point” poster showing streams of refugee men (not on their way to the UK) entered the political bloodstream. Now some of the wave of newly elected Reform politicians are caught out in thecrudest racism, echoed by a Tory party unrecognisable from the days Enoch Powell was ejected from the shadow cabinet for “racialist” speech: Robert Jenrick would have been out on his ear back then.View image in fullscreenThe cover of 75 Brexit Benefits.Photograph: Richard Gardner/ShutterstockUntil now, Labour has lived in fear of what that referendum demagoguery fired up. Best to pretend to agree, despite knowing that “makeBrexitwork” was an impossibility. Laying down red lines against joining the customs union and single market is now as deeply regretted by many Labour people as the manifesto’s fateful tax straitjackets. But the dam has broken because there is no disguising the truth about what Brexit does to UK growth.At last, Starmer publicly acknowledges that Brexit “significantly hurt our economy” when “wild promises were made to the British people and not fulfilled”.Rachel Reeves first dared speakthe forbidden words, stating: “The cuts to capital spending and Brexit have had a bigger impact on our economy than was even projected back then.” Wes Streeting said Labour should undo “the economic damage done by Brexit”, whileDavid Lammy refused seven timesin one interview to rule out reversing Brexit, arguing it had “badly damaged our economy” and Britain needs closer integration with Brussels, though rejoining the customs union was not “currently” government policy. No one will be sacked for breaking the line. Let’s have more ministerial truth-tellers preparing the country for rocky trade-offs on the long pot-holed road back. To deter others, Britain won’t get any deals that make leaving the EU look anything but semi-suicidal. Other models beckon – Switzerland and Norway – but they cost in money and free movement. Voters need to be prepared.Tories gloat that Labour has fallen into the remainer trap. The Mail accuses Starmer of wanting “to unravel Brexit”, the Telegraph talks of a “cabal of … remoaners” in a “plot to reverse Brexit”. But that old ploy may be dead now that the public thinks Brexit a calamity, by56% to 31%. Even the vast Brexit-backing media struggle these days to find actual positives: those vaunted trade deals outside Europe offer minuscule gains compared with what is lost. Worse reports roll in weekly, the latest from economists John Springford and Andrew Sissons’sdetailed analysisof this trading nation floundering when cut off from the EU. Grim new research from the National Bureau of Economic Research puts the loss at6-8% of GDPcumulated so far up to this year, £240bn in wealth and £90bn in tax revenue every year. Think how that would have changed last month’s budget. “You do not need to have a PhD in economics to know that erecting unnecessary trade barriers with your biggest trading partner will hurt growth and raise the cost of living,”Starmer wrotein the Guardian.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Monday’s meeting of Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Friedrich Merz and Emmanuel Macron at No 10 presses the crisis case for unity, though collapsing UK negotiations on defence contributions shows no EU deals are easy, however life-and-death urgent.Meanwhile, in the Rees-Mogg salon, their book of 75 alternative facts looked like a remnant from bygone days. Unfortunately the facts that are true are insignificant, while Brexit’s economic tsunami is airbrushed away. Some facts are right: yes, we can have stricter animal protection laws since leaving Europe. Some are not: thecost of motor insuranceis increasing far less rapidly in the EU than it is in the UK. Yes, Brexit made it possible to reduce the price of bananas, already cheap, even more. And yes we do escape £14-19bn in EU contributions, but missing from this text is that up to £90bn a year is lost in Treasury revenues.“You lot only talk economics. We talk of freedom that has no price,” a Bruges Grouper tells me. That’s a good reminder of how they won the referendum: these cavalier romancers trounced the roundhead number-cruncher remainers.

You suddenly become aware that actually it’s been a boundary around our history, and around contemporary art. But that boundary is dissolving.”Charlotte Hollinshead, Kalu’s studio manager and artistic facilitator, made a winner’s speech on her behalf. She said: “Nnena has faced an incredible amount of discrimination, which continued to this day, so hopefully this award helps to smash the prejudice away.”Kalu wore a rosette which read “Idol, Legend, Winner, Whatever”, which was something a participant in a workshop had said about the artist.Kalu’s drawings and sculptures, described by the Guardian art critic Eddy Frankel as “huge cocoons wrapped into massive, tight, twisting, ultra-colourful knots”, impressed the judging panel, who were torn in a year when nearly all the artists were tipped as potential winners.View image in fullscreenNnena Kalu’s drawings and sculptures have been described as ‘huge cocoons wrapped into massive, tight, twisting, ultra-colourful knots’.Photograph: PA Images/Alamy Live NewsTheTurner prize, regarded as one of the art world’s most prestigious awards, is presented to an artist born or working in Britain for an outstanding exhibition or presentation of their work over the previous year.The 2025 nominees were widely seen as artists who all seemed to speak to Britain’s contemporary times, where identity and the concept of belonging are in flux. The critical response to the work was typically passionate and divided.The Guardian’s Adrian Searle praised the show, but pickedKaluas the standout artist. Her work is constructed from adhesive tape, clingfilm, repurposed plastics, fabrics, cable ties and VHS tape which is bound up into different forms.Searle said Kalu, an autistic artist with learning disabilities and limited verbal communication, created work that was “irreducible” and reminiscent of the US artistJudith Scottand the German artistHanne Darboven.“There’s no fudging,” he wrote. “Kalu deserves to win this year’s Turner prize.” His comments proved prophetic but other critics felt similarly passionately about other artists.The Telegraph’s Alastair Sooke singled out the “violent” work of Mohammed Sami, an artist who began his career paintingofficial portraits of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad. He picked out his painting, The Hunter’s Return, writing that the “colossal, 19ft-wide vision of combat forces, in which green lasers slice through a thick orange dust storm”, was so unnerving that, “surely, the prize must go to him”.The Times’ Nancy Durrant also picked Sami as 2025’s best work. “Evocative, allusive and fantastically well executed, these are stunning works that reward lengthy contemplation,” she wrote.View image in fullscreenWork by Rene Matić, whose black dolls represented ‘contested ideas of nationhood and belonging’.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPAPeterborough’s Rene Matić was the second youngest-ever nominee, and their work featured an installation where the voices of Nina Simone and bell hooks drifted over the room.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The prize headed back out on the road after last year’s ceremony at Tate Britain, its spiritual home.At Cartwright Hall each of the nominees was given a separate room, with the work displayed across two floors of the building. The award was given out by Steven Frayne AKA Dynamo.Kalu was born in Glasgow in 1966 to Nigerian parents, but moved at a young age to Wandsworth in London. She first began practising art at the Hill House day centre in Tooting, south London in the late 1980s. She now has her studio at ActionSpace in Clapham, a charity that provides space and help to learning disabled artists.Her trajectory has been meteoric. In 2016, she showed alongside contemporary artists including Laure Prouvost in Belgium; then took part in Glasgow International two years later. Her first commercial gallery show was last year, and in 2025 her first major institutional exhibition opened at Norway’s Kunsthall Stavanger.Kalu made history by winning the award, with the disability charity Sense calling her nomination, “richly deserved and long overdue”.Farquharson added: “The drawings have this beautiful visual, subtle formal quality, while the sculptures look like vortexes or whirlpools and draw you in. They are these amazingly compelling things, which draw you in, give you joy and that keep you coming back.”Explore more on these topicsTurner prizeArtNeurodiversityBradfordAwards and prizesInstallationDisabilitynewsShareReuse this content"

Here, his friends, peers and collaborators pay tribute to a masterTim JonzeandLanre BakareTue 9 Dec 2025 08.12 ESTLast modified on Tue 9 Dec 2025 12.26 ESTShare‘We wanted to visit disappointing tourist attractions’Grayson Perry, artistI’ve never really been a fanboy, but the first time I saw Martin Parr I ran up and drunkenly hugged him. I said: “I love you Martin Parr!” I couldn’t help it. He was a hero of mine. And over the years he became my best artist friend.We were fellow travellers. He was funny, very dry and a big fan of comedy. One of the things we shared is that we both took comedy seriously. The problem with British culture, especially in the art world, is that it suffers from what I call “performative seriousness”. We tend to privilege misery. If you think of someone likeDon McCullin– another great British photographer – it’s all about suffering and doom and we are being told it isvery importantphotography. Whereas Martin’s work was funny, albeit in a very discomfiting way, which I think is why he got a lot of pushback from the British cultural establishment.Like me, Martin was an equal-opportunities piss-taker. Nobody was safe. He travelled the entire country taking pictures, which is why I consider him to be our national photographer.View image in fullscreen‘He had an amazing eye for details’ … The Perry family (from left): Florence, Philippa and Grayson, 2012.Photograph: Martin Parr/Magnum PhotosHe had an amazing eye for details. His bookLuxuryinvolved him going to all these vulgar events full of wealthy people. He might photograph a woman in a beautiful satin suit, but he would focus on the grease stain on her lapel, or a fly that had landed on a hat. That’s what made it a Martin Parr photograph.We did a kind of collaboration for my showSuper Rich Interior Decoration, which was all about art collectors and money laundering and tax evasion. I asked if I could use some of his pictures of rich people and he gave me the key to his digital archive. I went through it and really loved the ones he’d taken of rich women’s hands. They’d be covered in diamonds, holding glasses of champagne, and you could see all the veiny, grasping details, with these lurid nails on the end. They looked like little claws and they were perfectly suited to the subject matter of my works.I was a fan of so many of his images. His early black-and-white stuff, before he made his super-saturated colour photographs in the 1980s, was also brilliant. People aren’t so familiar with that –his work up in Yorkshire, in the Methodist chapels. But he served his time as an excellent black-and-white photographer before he became famous with The Last Resort.Martin travelled the world as well as the UK – he accrued so many air miles that he was able to take his wife Susie around the world for a month on them. We always said that we should do a travel series together, where we visited the 10 most disappointing tourist attractions in the world. That would have been hilarious. He was always saying: “Oh you should go to Machu Picchu, it’s just a crowded misty mountain top!”View image in fullscreen‘He served his time as a black-and-white photographer’ … Mayor of Todmorden’s inaugural banquet, West Yorkshire, 1977.Photograph: Martin Parr/Magnum PhotosHe would often dispense advice on photography to people when he was at events. I remember him telling people they shouldn’t smile in their holiday photographs, and that they should take pictures of their food.Well, look at Instagram now. He was certainly a very early adopter of that one.He did whole books about food, and all sorts. The last book he gave me wasall about smoking. He would get obsessed with things, like the last parking space in a car park, and make a book out of it. He was an obsessive collector as well. When I used to stay with him in Bristol he always had five or 10 bids going on eBay at once, for Saddam Hussein watches or Barack Obama potato chip packets, or whatever it was he was collecting that week. He had space memorabilia, political memorabilia, a huge collection of stuff on the miners’ strike.Martin always liked to complain about how he was an absolute celebrity abroad but that nobody in Britain knew who he was. I think that helped him, though. I went out with him once on a shoot and got to see how he worked. He was this invisible character wandering around. Nobody noticed him. Then suddenly he would pounce. He’d get in really close, push the button and then walk away. He’d be gone before the person had even realised they’d had their photograph taken!‘I often noticed he was in a hurry’Wendy Jones, collaborator on Parr’s biographyWorking withMartin Parron his biography Utterly Lazy and Inattentive: Martin Parr in Words and Pictures was first and foremost fun. Martin was drily witty and able to turn a good phrase. The photographs – of which we had 50,000 on Magnum to choose from – were also funny, some laugh-out-loud funny, most notably The Conservative Midsummer Madness Party. It’s an iconic picture of Conservatives looking uptight and not at all relaxed in 1980s Bath.I worked with Martin concertedly and continually for the last two years to write the biography. When it came to choosing the photos, Martin would politely ask me first, I would defer to him, then he would be decisive. He knew immediately which photos worked, which illustrated a particular part in his life best, which of his photographs were technically the most accomplished. I discovered he was reluctant to talk about himself. It took 250,000 words of interviews to get a 40,000-word biography, often asking the same question in different ways to encourage him to tell his life story.View image in fullscreen‘Martin was humble’ … New Brighton, England, from The Last Resort, 1983-85.Photograph: Martin Parr/Magnum PhotosAnd Martin was humble. Though one of our greatest photographers and social documentarians, he was awed and delighted when other celebrated photographers turned up at the Martin Parr Foundation in Bristol. He would smile, chat away and discuss new photo books, for which he had a lifelong passion. I often noticed Martin was in a hurry. “Next photo!” he would call as we skipped through his archive trying to choose. “Next question!” he would say. We worked together with alacrity, and I am so glad we did. The book was published 10 weeks ago, in the nick of time before his death.I can only think now of all the trends, fashions and changes in society that will happen over the next decades, which we won’t have Martin to document for us. Most of all, I liked how Martin looked anonymous and invisible in his nice Marks & Spencer jumper, dressed like a conventional accountant from the suburbs, someone’s slightly boring dad. We didn’t see him, but he was seeing us. I was with Martin last Monday, six days before he died. “I haven’t taken any photos today!” he said in exasperation. “Right, let’s go!” he said. Then he got in a cab and was whisked away.‘He captured ordinary extraordinariness’Maria Balshaw, director of TateMartin’s photographic world was the changing spectacle of UK life in all its ordinary extraordinariness. From his earliest work in a still postwar Manchester, to British coastal towns from Blackpool to Rothesay on Bute, his cool eye has always captured the something more of daily life. His knowledge and passion for photography was also capacious and his wry humour and candour mean he will be a much-missed and hugely influential force in British visual culture. In addition to his own work he was a passionate collector and his extraordinary photobook collection is held jointly by Tate and theLuma Foundation, Arles, a fitting legacy to his truly international influence.‘We were chalk and cheese – but it wasn’t a problem’Don McCullin, photographerPhotography had been wallowing around the black-and-white world for years but Martin brought it into the modern world. He had a very powerful way of looking. He slicked it up a bit with this rather gaudy colour. We all have our timings in life and Martin was the man who came along at the right time.View image in fullscreenSophisticated, intelligent … Glenbeigh Races, County Kerry, Ireland, taken from A Fair Day, 1983.Photograph: Martin Parr/Magnum PhotosHe’d been a very good black-and-white photographer in the early days of his career. But when he took up colour he became a kind of David Hockney of the photographic world. It was a real right-hand turn. And he didn’t have an easy time of it. In the early days his work was seen as a bit of a joke. A lot of photographers at the time – and I include myself in this – thought photography should be black and white. It shouldn’t be, of course, because there are seven colours in the spectrum.Martin had a very good eye. He was sophisticated, an intelligent man. There was a great deal of humour in his work. He wasn’t taking the mickey, but he was showing us all that there’s humour in human life. The seaside was his grazing ground, and his work was in the similar vein of those saucy old postcards you’d see of fat ladies on the beach.He would visit me in Somerset with a load of my books to sign. He was an extremely nice man, totally unselfish. With his foundation he did his utmost to keep photography alive. It’s a tragedy we’ve lost him, because he would have gone on supporting and promoting photography.View image in fullscreen‘He was showing us all that there’s humour in human life’ … Ramsgate, England, 1996.Photograph: Martin Parr/Magnum PhotosHis output was extraordinary. He produced dozens upon dozens of books and there are people out there who absolutely adore him. He attracted huge crowds, much bigger than I ever could. He brought a lot of pleasure to people who didn’t necessarily want to look at the kind of pictures that I take, the downside of humanity.Our work was in total contrast – it didn’t gel together. We were chalk and cheese. But we exhibited together in France last year atLa Gacilly Photo festivalin Brittany. I have no problems with people doing things differently to me. Life should be a bit of a fruit salad. And that’s exactly what Martin’s work looked like: a glorious fruit salad.‘He never lost a sense of wonder’Jamie Hawkesworth, photographerI remember getting an email from Martin when I was first starting out. It was completely out of the blue. I’d just finishedmy series on Preston Bus Stationand he got in touch to request a copy and some prints. I thought: Jesus, an email from Martin Parr! It felt really special.From time to time he would contact me to say he had liked some work I’d done. Then, when myBritish Isles bookcame out, I ended up going to theMartin Parr Foundationto do a talk there. He, his team and I finished the evening eating a curry cooked by his wife, which is a lovely moment to remember.The key to Martin’s success was that he never lost that sense of wonder. In my experience the hardest thing with photography is holding on to the curiosity and naivety you had when you first fell in love with it. Martin never lost that, he always had a curious eye.View image in fullscreen‘He inspired me in a strange way’ … O’Connell Bridge, Dublin, taken from Bad Weather, 1981.Photograph: Martin Parr/Magnum PhotosI came to photography quite late. I remember going to Preston library and going through an A to Z of all the photographers out there. The first thing I found of his was a book of his early black-and-white stuff. It had this picture of a guy with an umbrella walking in the rain. That’s the image that has always stood out for me, even though it’s not what you would call a classic Martin Parr photograph.He inspired me in a strange way: his work made me realise that I wanted to take pictures differently to the way he did. I realised I needed to go up to people and ask to take their picture. But it was seeing his work that helped me arrive at that.Photography can be a fragile thing. If you take on board what other people say you can get a bit lost. But Martin always remained very honest and true to himself. His way of seeing was just this unwavering force.‘He helped me edit a book, then we played poker’Ewen Spencer, photographerMy first photography teacher was the brilliant Geoff Weston. He introduced me to Martin’s work and shortly afterwards described the meaning of photography as “death”. Quite a dark concept when the technical act of making a picture is about the manipulation of light.Martin became a household name in the 90s. It can be argued that he also increased the acceptance of photography as an artistic pursuit in the UK.I am still in awe of him and was very pleased to meet him and befriend him via our mutual friend Elaine Constantine in 2002. Both Martin and Elaine are rare kinds within the world of photography in that they readily celebrated and promoted other artists. Martin celebrated so many people and gave many a start by his recommendation. I was fortunate to benefit from his praise, I enjoyed the plaudits but I relished the approval.View image in fullscreenPassionate, engaging … Gourock Lido, Scotland. Inverclyde, 2004.Photograph: Martin Parr/Magnum PhotosAs a young upstart, while working on my first photobook Martin helped me edit the images in one intense meeting at Elaine’s house on Essex Road in London. We then all played poker together.He sat front row in a lecture I gave at Newport photography course and proceeded to heckle me, taking the piss as I watched the room swell with people and then as the lecture came to a close proceeded to ask insightful and tender questions in front of almost every student and staff member on the course. I’m convinced he had something to do with the numbers on that day.We contacted one another often to discuss forthcoming work. He’d buy prints and books for the foundation and I’d try desperately to swap a print for one of his, always very early morning emails.There are so many encounters and meetings they all seem slightly odd and hilarious now. I’ll miss him but he’s never really gone is he? The king is dead, long live the king.‘The rhubarb farmers loved his pictures of them’Simon Wallis, secretary and chief executive, Royal Academy of Arts, LondonMartin was a passionate and engaging advocate for the power of photography as a vital and evolving art form. He spent untold hours with me sharing his wide-ranging enthusiasms embodied in his peerless library of tens of thousands of photography books. I hugely enjoyed working with him on his exhibitionThe Rhubarb Triangle and Other Storiesat the Hepworth Wakefield gallery in 2016.View image in fullscreenHumour, irony, insatiable curiosity … Acropolis, 1991.Photograph: Martin Parr/Magnum PhotosMartin had a longstanding connection to Yorkshire and his seminal seriesThe Non-Conformistswas created at the beginning of his career when he lived in the county. He immersed himself in exploring the local area of Wakefield and his photographs captured fascinating aspects of the rhubarb business. From the back-breaking work of moving the rhubarb from field to forcing shed, the freezing cold and exhausting labour of picking the vegetable by candlelight (or occasionally by head-torch), and the consumption of rhubarb by coach parties and food tourists, his work told a compelling visual narrative. At the show’s packed opening it was so heartening to see all the rhubarb farmers and workers proudly looking at what he had captured of their lives and work.He had boundless energy, generosity and curiosity in the world and the local cultures around him. His huge body of photography leaves us a rich and varied legacy brought together in his many publications. He helped us see the world around us in such a vivid and acute way: laced with humour, irony and insatiable curiosity. So many of his images are intensely etched in my memory; he’ll be greatly missed.‘He didn’t just take photographs – he built worlds’Hans Ulrich Obrist, curatorThere are so many dimensions to Martin Parr’s practice. He was not only one of the great photographers of our time but also a chronicler of the quotidian, a historian, a collector, editor, curator and importantly also an institution builder. He didn’t just take photographs – he built worlds. The radiance of his work will continue to be felt and appreciated for many generations to come.‘I was fortunate to call him a friend’Paul Smith, fashion designerI’m very sad to learn of the passing of Martin Parr, a joyful photographer and someone who I was fortunate to call a friend. It was an honour to know him and observe his brilliant wit and skill of the “caught moment”.‘He provoked laughter and discomfort at the same time’Michael Benson and Fariba Farshad, co-founders of Photo LondonIt is with deep sadness that we learned of the passing of Martin Parr, a photographer whose sharp wit, bright colour and unflinching eye reshaped the story of British photography. Few artists have held a mirror to a nation with such clarity and affection. His influence has been profound, and his loss will be felt throughout the global photography community.View image in fullscreenHumour and humanity … Chowpatty Beach, Mumbai, India, 2018.Photograph: Martin Parr/Magnum PhotosMartin’s connection with Photo London has been central to our history. He was our Master of Photography in 2023, presenting a remarkable exhibition of new work created across the British Isles. True to his lifelong fascination with the rituals and contradictions of everyday life, this presentation captured all that defined him as an artist. His generosity to the fair was longstanding. He was a frequent exhibitor, a regular visitor and an enduring champion of our mission to broaden the public understanding of photography.For more than 50 years, Martin chronicled Britain with a gaze that was humorous, empathic and deeply observant. From chapel communities and summer fetes to supermarket aisles and seaside towns, he revealed the idiosyncrasies that shape our shared experience. Photobooks such asThe Last ResortandThe Cost of Livingshifted the language of documentary photography, bringing colour, satire and anthropological precision into a field dominated by black-and-white reportage. His images could provoke laughter and discomfort at the same time, a duality he embraced with characteristic candour. As he once said: he made serious photographs, disguised as entertainment.View image in fullscreen‘Deeply observant’ … Autoportrait, New Ming Chun photo studio, Singapore, 2007.Photograph: Collection Martin Parr/Magnum PhotosMartin also transformed the wider photography ecosystem. His presidency at Magnum marked an important moment of renewal for the agency. His unwavering support for emerging artists helped new voices to flourish. The establishment of the Martin Parr Foundation in Bristol created a vital home for British and Irish photography, ensuring that future generations will have access to an extraordinary archive and a beacon for the study of visual culture.Above all, Martin believed in the importance of looking closely at the world around us. He understood the camera as a tool for curiosity. He understood the value of the ordinary. He understood that photography could hold humour and humanity in the same frame.A world without Martin’s gimlet eye observing each of its twists and eccentricities is a much-impoverished place. British photography has lost one of its great champions and we have lost a treasured friend whose tireless enthusiasm ensured that we never, ever, rested on our laurels.Explore more on these topicsPhotographyMartin ParrGrayson PerryDon McCullinHans Ulrich ObristfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But his music is quite different: a slippery layer cake of samples, multitudinous keys and lo-fi pop production, with Brown singing of a world where “the ebb and flow isn’t ebbing right”, be it in love or civic life. There is still room for an instant-classic R&B ballad though, in Tossed Away.Ben Beaumont-Thomas49Rochelle Jordan – Through the WallEverything isjust soon the British Canadian producer’s sixth album: expensively plush deep house suggesting club lights low, gleaming mirrors, potent looks igniting across the dancefloor. As much as the cold beat and ballroom flow of Ladida or the slapping “body, body, body” incantations of On 2 Something suggest a steadfast commitment to abandon, Jordan maintains impeccable poise and control throughout, whether in diva mode on Words 2 Say, breaking hearts on Bite the Bait, standing up for her needs on Doing It Too (“I’m not too much / You just give too little”) or patiently waiting for a frustrated lover to see the light on Ladida. Commanding, wise and committed to atmospheric excellence, party hosts don’t come better.Laura Snapes48Jerskin Fendrix– Once Upon a Time … in ShropshireView image in fullscreenHarebrained prog cabaret … Jerskin Fendrix.Photograph: Tim GuttJerskin Fendrix’s high-profile scores for the last three Yorgos Lanthimos films can’t really help prime you for the Midlands composer’s eccentrically beautiful second album, which pairs pristine musical theatre with the harebrained prog cabaret of Faith No More and (particularly) the under-sung Morphine. At first, Once Upon a Time … casts the rural bliss of growing up in 00s Shropshire in a golden light, a haven of getting ratted on Baileys and listening to Kanye on a farm, then having a lovely hungover group breakfast in someone’s kitchen. But the unexpected deaths he has experienced in recent years intrude to spoil paradise, eliciting feverish, absurdist expressions of grief – Jerskin Fendrix Freestyle is a bravura wig-out – and fathomless devastation from his camp, craggy voice. It demands a full theatrical production.LS47Clipping– Dead Channel SkyClipping frontman Daveed Diggs is best known for being in the original cast of Hamilton, and for all that this album is filled with noisy industrial rap, you can easily imagine it being successfully adapted for the Broadway stage. Dead Channel Sky is set in a cyberpunk dystopia not dissimilar to the scorched-sun “real world” of the Matrix, humming with janky tech and populated with fascists and freaky hedonists. Producers William Hutson and Jonathan Snipes render it in acid squiggles and revving breakbeats, while Diggs delivers his mutoid poetry like a prophet jacked up on some amphetamine he’s synthesised in a backstreet lab.BBTTell us your favourite albums of 2025Read more46The Tubs – Cotton CrownIn different hands,the Tubs’ second album might be a crushing listen, and understandably so. In 2014, frontman Owen Williams’ mother, the songwriter and author Charlotte Greig,died by suicide. Grief, as these songs detail, made him a rubbish boyfriend. But Cotton Crown is often funny and ardent, and especially self-aware about how new love might feel like a life raft to a depressed mind ill-equipped to reciprocate: “Know it’s all in my brain / Caught in the middle of loving you and being insane,” Williams sings on Fair Enough. His striking voice, somewhere between Richard Thompson and Bob Mould, bolts through the band’s joyful jangle-pop. Clear students of the form, they’re virtuosos with zero patience for perfection, their riffs hurtling and plundering like seagulls going at a spilled catch as they vigorously rough you up with profundity.LS45Smerz – Big City LifeView image in fullscreenAn album of stilted beauty … Smerz.Photograph: Alva Le FebvreCatharina Stoltenberg and Henriette Motzfeldt feel like the pop girlies of the incredibly prolific and off-kilterCopenhagen Rhythmic Music Conservatory scene, making music that’s more outward-facing and arch than some of their insular and traditional (and equally great) classmates. Their second album lurches between throwing yourself at life – “you’re a girl in the city and you shouldn’t think twice”, they chant in deadpan harmony on Roll the Dice – and actually thinking twice quite a lot in existential spirals about purpose and desire. The dissonance between confidence and anxiety comes through in the album’s stilted beauty: one minute, their whorls of prepared piano carry you along like clouds amid perfectly turned pop-R&B and balladry; then they stab and stutter, like cracks in the pavement destined to trap your heels. In 2023, K-pop’s brightest hopes NewJeans hired them as co-writers: more pop bearing their imprint can only be a good thing.LS44Sabrina Carpenter – Man’s Best FriendReleased almost exactly a year after her superstar-minting breakthrough Short n’ Sweet, and using a palette of soft rock, 80s pop, light disco and yearning country melodies, Carpenter added rich colour to one of pop’s most distinctive self-portraits. Her blatant sexuality is offset by an ironising sense of camp and a deep streak of cynicism, as she wonders whether to wrap her little finger round a series of hot but useless men. But whether dialling her exes while hopped up on “go-go juice” or being toxic for the sport of it (“you think that I’m gonna fuck with your head / well, you’re absolutely right”), Carpenter knows she’s part of the problem. Her fake helplessness at her own worst impulses is just one part of a formidable screwball comedy arsenal – she’s a Rosalind Russell for the dating app era.BBT43Jennifer Walton – DaughtersView image in fullscreenBolt from the blue … Jennifer Walton.Photograph: Liam CosfordThis Sunderland producer’s previous work included one EP of power electronics, one of antic club tracks, collabs with Aya and 96 Back as Microplastics, gigging with Kero Kero Bonito and a smattering of other credits. So her staggering, fully formed songwriterly debut was a total bolt from the blue. A swarming orchestral epic with shades of Julia Holter and Phil Elverum, it addressed her grief for her late father in serenely surrealist images – hitting a deer with a car in the middle of the night – and the painfully mundane realism of sitting in hospital corridors together. The standout Miss America combined both to stunning effect, a numbed incantation of everything Walton had seen on the US trip where she learned of her father’s diagnosis, the familiar now remade horribly mythic.LS42Erika de Casier– LifetimeErika de Casier’s fourth album updates the Y2K R&B template that fought for body-to-body sensuality in the face of rising digital creep. The old-school dial tones that pierce Lifetime’s rapt, liquid atmosphere work both as Janet homage and ironic sigh at how good those forebears had it when emotional warfare could only be conducted via pager: “Took a screenshot so / I could look at your pretty face all the time now / Without a sign that I’m online,” de Casier sings on earworm Delusional, a low-slung anthem for contemporary dating anxiety. “Hit midnight / Not even a text to hold me warm,” she rues on The Chase. That’s one of the most inviting things about Lifetime: its seductively cool surfaces conceal de Casier frantically kicking her feet below the surface, just like the rest of us.LS41Danny Brown – StardustThe Detroit rapper’s first post-rehab record totally disprovedhis fearsthat sobriety makes artists boring. On Stardust, Brown is still hard-wired with cartoonish verve, coupled with a genuinely touching sense of gratitude: “Sleeping real good at night ’cos I’m proud of myself,” he raps on Book of Daniel. While you probably wouldn’t describe someone who ponders “going bonkers and knocking out your chompers” as a wise elder, his hunger for life, opportunity and unmediated sensation blares through in how evidently gagged he is to centre younger producers from the digicore and hyperpop undergrounds: his unruly kids 8485, Jane Remover, Underscores, Frost Children and more make Stardust trip with glitch, rave, squealing riffs and overdriven noise. The rare record that makes you want to riot and shed a smiling single tear emoji.LS40-3140YHWH Nailgun – 45 PoundsView image in fullscreenChews you up … YHWH Nailgun.Photograph: Steve GullickIn 21 minutes, the New York band’s debut chews you up and spits you out the other side in a tentacular whirr of rototoms, guitars that shriek and whine like neglected machinery, erratic tempos and frontman Zack Borzone’s choked-out vocals. The way the record lurches and reels brings to mind the classic horror film scene in which a human undergoes a violent, magnificent transformation into some sort of beast: much like Gilla Band’s Most Normal, 45 Pounds is a font of mutant rock pleasures.LS39Sudan Archives – The BPMThe title refers to the beats per minute of dance music, but for an album that is so totally alive, it surely also refers to a pounding heart. Sudan Archives (AKA Angeleno producer-singer-songwriter-violinist Brittney Parks) announces that “life’s a game and I got VR goggles” as she revels in the epicurean joys of sex, dancing, travel and music itself with an almost superhuman appetite: “The rest are cowards / They choose to eat and we devour.” It’s all done with breezy good humour but there’s something inspiring, even quietly political about this mindful rejection of the straight life. Her backings – full of pop-R&B and ethereal electro – also dart away from obvious mainstream paths.BBT38Ethel Cain – Willoughby Tucker, I’ll Always Love YouView image in fullscreenRomantic slowcore … Ethel Cain.Photograph: Dollie KyarnIt’s easy to see why US singer-songwriter Cain has become so adored. This album further sketches out the kind of storytelling universe that attracts footnote-writing fandoms: it’s a prequel to the events of her debut album Preacher’s Daughter, deepening the tale of Ethel and a cast of young peers as they fumble towards connection and understanding. Her moody, romantic slowcore is also perfect music for listening to on headphones as you walk around boring suburban streets wishing you could leave for bigger things. It’s also great for road trips: songs between five and 15 minutes that seem to make a long, slow blur of the pell-mell world outside.BBT37Olivia Dean – The Art of LovingThe British breakthrough of the year, as Dean – already doing decent business with her pleasant but rather neat debut Messy – reached a completely new level of songcraft. Bossa nova, folk and soul (classic and neo) are warmed together with beautiful production, evaporating any sense of pastiche to make a sound that’s both easy on the ear but distinctly Dean’s. Every song has a superb top line, Dean stretching them into loose jazzy shapes (Let Alone the One You Love, Lady Lady) or tightening them into brisk pop (Man I Need, Something Inbetween). But it’s the lyrics that make these songs so red-blooded: every stage of love, from the first flutter of flirtation to the adrenal shock of rejection, is made so true to life.BBT36Anna von Hausswolff – IconoclastsView image in fullscreenSense of awe … Anna von Hausswolff.Photograph: Philip SvenssonAnna von Hausswolff is no stranger to a monumental statement: her primary instrument is the pipe organ,a towering edifice of tin and arsenicthat offers her an ever-renewing sense of awe. But the Swedish composer’s sixth album goes bigger than ever, grappling with mortality, transcendence and evil in a series of stormy epics that also lash a little pop structure to her prow. “Oh, I’m breaking up with language / Oh, in search of something bigger than this,” she screams on Stardust, an exhilarating co-pilot on the path to absolution.LS35Bon Iver – Sable, FableIf, as Justin Vernon recently suggested, this is the last ever Bon Iver album, it’s a beautiful redemption arc: a loving send-up of his anxious, myopic sad-sack self blossoms into a radiant appreciation of possibility, sensuality, risk. Everything Is Peaceful Love has one of the year’s best refrains: “Damn if I’m not climbing up a tree right now!”, giddy with thrill and absolutely no idea of what to do when you get up there other than enjoy the view. And while there are gorgeously passionate songs here, it’s the ones about gracefully letting go of an unviable love that really underscore the admirable humility in Vernon’s bowing out.LS34Snocaps – SnocapsKatie Crutchfield’s full-throated transformation into country doyenne on her last couple of albums as Waxahatchee almost makes it easy to forget her indie-rock origins. Fourteen years since she and twin sister Allison wound down their teen band PS Eliot, the DIY stalwarts got back together – with a little help from MJ Lenderman and producer Brad Cook – and went back to brass tacks for their surprise album as Snocaps. What a treat it was: full of punchy indignation – “I could never just …coast!” they exclaim on Coast – crunchy ruminations and sing-songy contemplations of what it means to depend on and grow alongside one another. You’d follow them anywhere.LS33Amaarae – Black StarView image in fullscreenIrrepressible … Amaarae.Photograph: Salomé Gomis-TreziseWe all need an Amaarae in our lives: the person who, when you weakly protest that you’re a bit tired to go out, will soon have you holding a bottle of decanted rum in the back of an Uber, while alongside you she looks quizzically at a series of resealable plastic bags. “Ketamine, coke and molly,” she chants on Starkilla; “I spiked this drink so please open your mouth,” she tells her lover on Fineshyt. And this club-ready album from the irrepressible Ghanaian-American pop star ends up being a sensual body high, as she chases sex and glamour into the ends of the night.BBT32Perfume Genius – GloryWith typical grace and humour Mike Hadreas sends up his self-defeating tendencies on his seventh album, and wonders how old you have to be to escape those lifelong patterns: like the contradiction of struggling to face the world while also fantasising about violence and romanticising “all the poems I’ll get out” of it. It feels apt that Glory starts with the western twang of It’s a Mirror, suggesting a fixed, brawny masculine archetype – then breaks it down over the course of the record, a gothic, celestial voyage into the interior, and the latest addition to a uniquely beautiful American songbook.LS31Horsegirl – Phonetics On and OnView image in fullscreenFinely tuned … Horsegirl.Photograph: Ruby FayeSpindly rock à la the Velvets and the Raincoats is as spartan in its constituent parts as it is high on reward, and Chicago trio Horsegirl demonstrated the inexhaustible pleasures of this 60-year-old form on their second album. With production from Cate Le Bon, they wove magic from just a few thrumming guitar and bass notes and Nora Cheng’s nonchalant, near-spoken vocals, as well as a knack for melodic hooks as finely turned as intricate woodwork: the bittersweet, skipping chorus of Information Content is an all-timer.LS30-21 coming soonCome back tomorrow for the next 10 albums in the countdown!

Mangling nominees’ names may be traditional – but it’s still embarrassingYesterday’s Golden Globes announcement was a masterclass in mispronunciation that threatens to undo every effort to internationalise awards. Why can’t producers just make their presenters practise?Stuart HeritageTue 9 Dec 2025 06.30 ESTLast modified on Tue 9 Dec 2025 06.32 ESTShareThe day after an awards show announces its nominations, the focus typically falls on the nominees. However, yesterday’s Golden Globe nominations were a little different, because all anyone can talk about is how badly the actor Marlon Wayans mangled everyone’s name.If you didn’t see it, it was a masterclass in getting it wrong. Watching Wayans announce the Golden Globe nominations was like living through one of those anxiety dreams where you’re asked to fly a jumbo jet and realise that you don’t know what any of the controls do. If you did see it, then I’m sure your toes will uncurl eventually.I won’t list every mistake – I wrote them all down and they filled a page – but it was a firework display of ostentatious mispronunciation. In Wayans’s mouth, Ludwig Göransson became “Ludwig G Ronson”. Hannah Einbinder became “Hannah Eye Bender”. Joel Edgerton became “Joel Edd Gerton”. Nouvelle Vague was pronounced to rhyme with “plague”. He accidentally called Sarah Silverman’s comedy special Postmortem “Postpartum”. He had two cracks at Renate Reinsve and got both equally wrong.Some presenters might be able front their way through something like this, but not Wayans. Every time a foreign-sounding name appeared on the Teleprompter, the fear in his voice was palpable. When he had to read the Korean names behind the KPop Demon Hunters song Golden, he was so nervous that he somehow put a question mark after all of them. He said the name Joachim Trier like he was reading the bottom line of a Snellen chart. He visibly slumped in defeat before even attempting Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas.View image in fullscreenNailed it … Marlon Wayans at the Golden Globe nominations.Photograph: Jim Ruymen/UPI/ShutterstockUnhelpfully, his co-presenter Skye P Marshall was everything he was not. During her half of the nominations, she was polished and slick, slamming through all her names like they were old friends. No wonder Wayans walked off the stage dabbing his brow.Now, to the casual observer, this probably just looked like a tough day at the office. But imagine being one of the nominees whose name Wayans mangled. Imagine having your big moment undermined by someone who was supposed to say your name properly, but just ended up making a noise like a house key in a waste disposal unit. It can’t be a great feeling, knowing that you have made it in Hollywood while not quite making it enough for anyone to learn your actual name.Which isn’t to say that this is an easy job. It isn’t, at all, especially now that awards shows have finally opened themselves up to the glorious possibilities of world cinema. Having to pronounce a long list of unfamiliar names can be daunting. Many of us would struggle with it. And many people before Marlon Wayans have done so.Most notably, there was Tiffany Haddish. After the success of her role in Girls Trip, it felt for a moment as if she could do it all. And then her hot streak ended, as she crashed, as a co-presenter with Andy Serkis, into the immovable wall of the 2018 Oscar nominations.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She messed up Luca Guadagnino so badly that she looked offstage for help. But then she had to say the name Daniel Kaluuya. First she called him “Daniel Koolyé”. Then, after her co-presenter Andy Serkis coached her on the proper pronunciation, she got it wrong again. She called him “Daniel Kahlua”. She called him “Daniel Kallelujah”. “He knows his name,” she muttered at the end, broken and humiliated.The point is that presenters shouldn’t sound as if they are being ambushed by these names. They shouldn’t swan in unprepared and attempt to coast on their charisma, however great it might be, because that approach clearly doesn’t work. These are names that need to be rehearsed and rehearsed; drilled into them by the award organisers. And it can be done. Skye P Marshall is living proof of that. They should bring her back every year.There is, of course, an exception. Don’t forget, this is the 10th anniversary of the funniest thing that has ever happened on planet Earth, which is Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences president Cheryl Boone Isaacs mispronouncing the name of lauded cinematographer Dick Pope as “Dick Poop”. Until the day I die, nothing will ever be funnier than Dick Poop. So perhaps that’s the new rule. Presenters should work hard to get the name of every nominee correct, unless they can somehow make them sound like a defecating penis, in which case God bless them.Explore more on these topicsFilmGolden GlobesAwards and prizesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The FX half-hour comedy about a group of recent college graduates in New York begins, naturally, on the subway; what seems like an over-studied portrait of early adulthood intimacy – tangled limbs, in-group references, aggressively relaxed banter – quickly devolves into a standoff between a creepy subway masturbator and the group’s instigator, Issa (Amita Rao), trying to out-masturbate him to make a wildly off point about feminism. “Is this the world you want?!?” she shouts at him, hand vigorously in pants.Adults review – Friends for the TikTok generation sitcom is a try-hard misfireRead moreThe moment is intentionally off-putting, perhaps too much so – I’m as ripe as anyone for surprise, but found the try-hardness of this shock memorably irksome. Yet it’s also unintentionally revealing: this, it implicitly screams, is a show toget young people’s attention. A similar anxiety courses through the opening ofI Love LA, HBO’s west-coast rejoinder to Adults that is similarly pitched as a zeitgeist-y take on the thrilling chaos of young adulthood. We meet Maia, played by creator and co-writerRachel Sennott, mid-sex with her boyfriend, heedlessly determined to come before going to work, even if it means ignoring an earthquake.Both scenes contain many of the hallmarks of TV about the wilderness that is one’s 20s – intense relationships, staggering narcissism, blinkered optimism, intoxicating messiness – though watching them, and many of the scenes that followed, I was reminded less of the turbulence of that age than of the television industry at large. TV is desperate to connect with young people, who increasingly opt for YouTube or social media for their screen time. Perhaps that’s why the industry seems especially bullish on I Love LA, in a way that’s incongruous with a show that still feels like a work in progress. Before it even aired, Variety declared the series a “generational text” and put Sennott, a former internet comedy “It girl” turned nascent screen star, on its cover; HBO has already announced a second-season renewal, calling it “among the fastest-growing” of its original comedies, averaging 2 million viewers – substantial for prestige cable, though by no means generationally defining.View image in fullscreenA still from Adults.Photograph: Rafy/FXAll of this belies a strange phenomenon in Hollywood: youth still dominates the culture, but not on television. Gen Z, generally defined as those born between 1997 and 2010, are thesecond largest generational demographicin the US behind millennials, and critical to the future of television. And yet the market for any series, let alone a great one, about being young and single and hanging with your friends is virtually wide open. Past generations had broad network sitcoms like Living Single, New Girl, Happy Endings, How I Met Your Mother and The Big Bang Theory; prestige creator-star HBO entries like Lena Dunham’s Girls and Issa Rae’s Insecure; and cult hits like Comedy Central’s Broad City, TBS’s Search Party and Freeform’s The Bold Type. Gen Z has duds likeGeneration, a one-and-done HBO teen show attempt in 2021, or the latest round of small network attempts to speak to those in their 20s – I Love LA, Adults and Overcompensating, internet comedian Benito Skinner’s college-set series for Prime Video, all of which have been renewed for second seasons on modest buzz.What once used to be a staple entree of the television buffet – TV that reflects young people’s realities, anxieties, fantasies and hijinks – is now a small subsection, neither drawing the eye nor tasting right. The closest one could get to a definitional gen Z hit is Euphoria, the overwrought HBO soap about high schoolers that reads as a millennial fever dream of all the ways the internet can ruin adolescence, though it did christen a distinctive sexualized aesthetic, popularize someimitably outlandish fashionand launch several movie-star careers. It has also been off the air for five years, with its long-awaited third season, including a time jump to post-college life, delayed until spring 2026.I Love LA review – Rachel Sennott’s HBO comedy finds itself but takes its timeRead moreIn the meantime, the Friends for gen Z seems to be, well, Friends itself. According to viewership data fromNielsen, when gen Z does pick a show to watch, they tend to go back in time – 65% of the shows watched by 16 to 34 year olds are so-called library series, including NBC’s archetypical twentysomething hangout sitcom (10.63bn minutes watched in 2024), fellow coming-of-age series Gilmore Girls (11.6bn) and medical soap Grey’s Anatomy (17.37bn).Nearly halfof gen Z prefers YouTube or social video platforms like TikTok over traditional TV or paid streaming, aharbingerof what Vox’s Rebecca Jennings termed theMrBeastification of entertainment.A very online segment of the cohort have taken torewatching Girls, close-reading the series as a rich archival text of cringe millennial striving.But for reflections of their own experience, much of the same cohort turn to social media – to see their peers post about their dating experiences or gag-worthy stories online, to watch influencersriffon fun and flirty nights out with friends or, in the case of thelong-running TikTok seriesby comedians Kyle Chase and Veronika Slowikowska, to tune into the latest lore-filled chapter of roommate situationship that may or may not be real. (SNL, also looking to attract young viewers, smartly tapped Slowikowska for its current season.)Hollywood is attempting to meet an audience increasingly acclimated to bite-size content where they are, paying firms to chop their series into micro-chapters for social media; Hollywood trade The Anklerreportedthat a producer on Adults paid the firm $15,000 to blast out 2,500 videos from the series on social media as experimental marketing. (The scheme reportedly netted 40m views across TikTok, Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts.) Studios such as Fox Entertainment and Miramax are investing millions in vertical video companies, part of a “microdrama”gold rushthat attempts to capture fractured youth attention spans with compact narratives told in two-minute “episodes” that slot easily on to social media.Under the influence: Beast Games and the YouTube-ification of televisionRead moreBut once you reach an audience, you still need to connect with them, and TV, no matter how TikTok-able the episode, is in a tough bind: there is no way that television, even with accelerated production and release schedules relative to film, could ever hope to keep up with the warp-speed trends and nimbleness of social media, or model the speed, hyper-referentiality, and distinctly un-prestige aesthetic of internet comedy. It isnotoriously difficultfor film and television to capture the seamless presence of the internet in our lives or our sprawling online selves, let alone the creator economy, in a way that doesn’t feel distracting, deadening, or cheap. As Jeff Astrof, a 59-year-old alum of the Friends writers’ room, put it toThe Ankler, if the iconic NBC series “took place now, Chandler would go on his phone the entire episode”.But they must try, in order to have a semblance of accuracy to the generation they’re portraying. I Love LA and Adults both attempt to build internet life into the fabric of its characters’ social groups – the former focuses on Maia’s career managing her influencer best friend Talullah, the latter features side plots such as air-tagging a roommate’s crush. The results are expectedly mixed. In I Love LA, the satire of influencers is too toothless, Talullah’s actual work as an influencer too vague; Adults fares better, but still handles the tribulations of online dating and location sharing with what feel like oven mitts.I should say that, like many aimless twentysomethings, both of these series show promise; the second halves of both freshmen seasons are significantly better than their firsts. But watching them mostly left me nostalgic for the gut-twisting insights of Girls, or the resonant friendship fights in Insecure, or the well-worn coziness of Friends – shows that feel connected to some hazy, common experience of growing up and figuring it out. Perhaps traditional television, transitioning from dominant cultural art form to niche medium, will too.Explore more on these topicsUS televisionTV comedyComedyTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Having broken the all-time worldwide box office record in 1997 with Titanic and again 12 years later with Avatar, his work is the acme of big-screen spectacle.His latest offering, Avatar: Fire and Ash, arrives in radically different circumstances. With several years now between us and the pandemic, it is clear that theatrical box office is likely not coming back to what it was: US total box office for 2025 currently stands at $7.6bn (down from $11.3bn in 2019); the worldwide haul is expected to be around $34.1bn, a 13% drop from pre-Covid times. All the more onus on Cameron’s hypertrophic Smurfs to bring in the box office cavalry at year’s end. And hopefully supply some further indications about the magic elixir needed to break the Netflix’n’chill stranglehold and get boots back in cinemas.Streaming entertainment has the upper hand. With Netflix and co often having a cursory theatrical release, or nixing it entirely, for their flagship films, the traditional studios are under increasing pressure to get their wares on to digital platforms. The pre-pandemic 90-day “theatrical window” during which films were exclusive to cinemas has become 45 days, if they’re lucky. Universal was the first to break with tradition: in 2020, it began putting films that failed to break $50m box office out to premium video on demand (PVOD) after 17 days. A collective Keanu “woah” was the only possible response to Warner Bros scuttling The Matrix Resurrections – beloved big-screen IP, if ever you saw it – by releasing it simultaneously on HBO Max in December 2021.View image in fullscreenBig-screen spectacle … Avatar: Fire and Ash.Photograph: Capital Pictures/AlamyFacing down this digital firehose of – pardon the Silicon Valleyese – “content”, how does Hollywood now decide what merits a cinema release? What executives are looking for – at least at Sony, according to one of its partner producers I spoke with recently – is “theatricality”. By that term, the company means films with “the urgency to get people to leave the comfort of their homes”, he says. Working out what urgency – or “theatrical intent”, to use the marketing lingo – means is the current Hollywood obsession.Tom Cruise, for instance, interprets urgency literally – banking on personal peril in the form of old-fashioned, non-CGI stunt work to pack in the punters. It worked for 2022’sTop Gun: Maverick, the worldwide No 2 film that year ($1.5bn), but not so much for the two last underperforming instalments of the Mission: Impossible franchise (both took under $600m worldwide). His proselytisation of real thrills in real cinemas is one way of defining theatricality – though the danger is the approach relies only on fading muscle memory of blockbusters past. But neither is Cameron’s technologically led version of cinema a foolproof guarantee – especially for sequels, like Fire and Ash, which generally produce diminishing returns for US audiences.With their recent successes rooted in long-established pedigree, both men seem like exceptions that prove the new rule of box office volatility. Ironically, it was on-screen exceptionality that was the law of blockbuster-making in their 80s and 90s heyday: exceptional faces (A-list stars) engaged in exceptional exploits (an unmissable story), driving demand through scarcity (an exclusive cinema release).View image in fullscreenPersonal peril … Tom Cruise in Top Gun: Maverick.Photograph: Paramount Pictures/APThe hullabaloo over something like the Harrison Ford thriller The Fugitive seems quaint now – but it was the definition of a big-ticket event movie in 1993. Good old Harrison Ford framed as a criminal and subjected to unrelenting high jeopardy, with the short sharp shock of Tommy Lee Jones thrown in, was a must-see pitch. The film retains enough zing to make it a streaming catalogue perennial. But a 21st-century equivalent – something like Rebel Ridge – would be deemed lacking in sufficient theatricality.The various traditional drivers – IP, superlative VFX, stars, sharp storytelling – can still collectively generate theatricality. But this is becoming more difficult, with many of these pillars looking individually shaky. Much IP has gone through too many repeat washes, though some virgin territory still remains (Warner worked this effectively with the Dune films and this year’s overachiever – $1bn worldwide – A Minecraft Movie). The ubiquity of VFX, and the synthetic look of so much of the work, detracts from the miraculous allure it should ideally serve up. The shock and awe of Jurassic Park’s brachiosaurus reveal feels very distant.On the star front, the post-90s dilemma persists: there’s no guarantee that new so-called A-listers, like Margot Robbie and Timothée Chalamet, have any consistent box office pull when not playing known entities like Barbie or Harley Quinn, or Paul Atreides or Bob Dylan. At blockbuster level, Hollywood now only trusts the personnel when sheltered by the right IP; a setup that made Spider-Man: No Way Home’s class reunion of all-time webslingers, teaming up Tom Holland with Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield, one of the biggest pandemic-era theatrical hits (nearly $2bn worldwide).View image in fullscreenNo guarantee … Timothée Chalamet in Marty Supreme.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyPrecise storytelling, meanwhile, is arguably being sacrificed in favour of the IP packaging in which the film industry prefers to trust to generate heat for theatrical releases. Too many blockbuster plots – sprawling out over interminable sequels or nodding to the wider extended universe – now default to daytime-soap-level convolutions, instead of delivering indelible onscreen events.The endless double-crossings and alliances of the Fast & Furious “family”, the equally cliquey office intrigue of Ethan Hunt’s Mission: Impossible squad, the mopey group-therapy postmortem in Avengers: Endgame after Thanos’s finger snap – very little of this feels dramatically purposeful and ruthless in the vein of drum-tight blockbusters like Back to the Future or Mad Max: Fury Road. The incentive to bloat the franchise – elongating them with flabby storytelling and unneeded instalments, like The Hobbit, or Mission: Impossible’s two final reckonings – is just too tempting.As Hollywood struggles to define what constitutes the right stuff for cinema, there’s growing recognition that streaming v theatrical isn’t a zero-sum game. To put it bluntly: “The better it does in theatres, the better it does on streaming,” as Joe Earley, the head of Disney+ and Hulu, told the New York Times recently. This was why, for example, Amazon put its $250m Dwayne Johnson action comedy Red One into 4,000 US cinemas; though it didn’t break even ($185m), the long marketing runup helped drive it to becoming the streamer’s No 1 film debut. Two-thirds of Netflix’s weekly top 10 English-language films since 2022 have had theatrical releases.View image in fullscreenBarbenheimer … Margot Robbie in Barbie and Cillian Murphy in Oppenheimer.Photograph: APAll the more reason why the industry needs fresh wellsprings of theatricality. First up is redefining event movies as ones that make an event of the novelty of a cinema trip, a strategy exploited by a number of post-pandemic hits. The choose-your-camp incongruity of Barbie ($1.44bn worldwide) and Oppenheimer ($975m) being released on the same July 2023 weekend – dubbed Barbenheimer – was a win-win situation for both.Deadpool & Wolverine ($1.3bn) used a different spin on audience participation, with radioactive levels of fanboy in-jokiness beckoning filmgoers into the onscreen party atmosphere. Tapping a live-entertainment participatory vibe is the aim of the ongoing Broadway-adaptation industrial complex, hoping sing-along theatre energy will rub off in the cinema; the two Wicked films have conjured impressive grosses ($759m/$223m and counting) that way.But these are isolated events. Children’s films released over holidays still thankfully seem untouchable, as reaffirmed by Zootopia 2’s record-breaking haul on Thanksgiving weekend. What else can help secure cinema’s future? Properly serving theatrical audiences means a broader spread of releases – and the likes of Sinners ($90m budget) and Weapons ($38m) reminded us this year that mid-high and medium-budgeted contenders, if sharply conceived, can still carve out awareness as capably as tentpole releases.View image in fullscreenSmaller budget – and skirt … Liam Neeson in The Naked Gun.Photograph: Frank Masi/APThere are signs this renewed adventurousness is extending to lower budgets too. Rather than dumping smaller fish on streaming as loss leaders to gain subscriptions, there is a growing willingness to let less expensive punts turn a profit in theatres (though studios only take a 50% cut there, as opposed to 80% of PVOD). Paramount especially has been more forthright than most studios about its commitment to a broader slate of theatrical releases. The 2022 horror Smile, for example, was destined for streaming – but after excelling in test screenings drummed up $217m on a $17m budget in theatres.A more varied offering is good news, of course – and bolsters the overall appeal of cinemas. But sustainably fostering such a spread means tightly controlling budgets: $42m made The Naked Gun remake viable (and it has turned a profit); One Battle After Another – masterpiece though it is – looks reckless at a reported $130-$175m.Cinemas were once dream palaces, replete in entrancing drapery and underlighting, with names like the Million Dollar Theater, Le Rialto and Kino Babylon. You went there to walk into the fantasia. Recapturing that glamour seems like a long shot in an age when cinemas are mostly Haribo-encrusted industrial sheds where people second-screen their favourite OnlyFans while Rocket Raccoon bawls for their attention. But community remains their genuine USP, the legacy of the era when the whole of society congregated in them. Whether it’s stars, a party atmosphere, or a pipeline of stories that touch on people’s lives, cinema’s greatest hope now is keeping human beings in sharp focus.Avatar: Fire and Ash is released on 19 DecemberExplore more on these topicsJames CameronAvatarTom CruiseMargot RobbieTimothée ChalametSpider-Man: No Way HomeDeadpool & WolverinefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The idea that cynics are somehow more astute is the first of many notions demolished in this succinct, uplifting book.Cynics perform less well in cognitive tests and “have a harder time spotting liars than non-cynics”. They are wrong more often than optimists, and the damage to their wellbeing, and to society, is higher than that incurred by their hopeful counterparts. Like an autoimmune disease, what starts out as a misguided defensive reaction ends up causing self-harm. (Zaki is careful early on to distinguish between “big-c” Cynics of the ancient philosophical tradition, and the cynicism “most of us know today” – which can be summarised as a lack of faith in our fellow humans.)Cynicism is bad for us on several levels. Cynics are sicker, more depressed, drink more and die younger than their less cynical counterparts. On a societal level, “study after study finds that cynical beliefs eat away at relationships, communities, economies, and society itself”. Conversely, people who live in high-trust communities are longer-lived, healthier and happier – benefits Zaki translates into the equivalent of a 40% pay rise. And yet, over a 50-year period, cynicism has risen dramatically. The proportion of Americans agreeing that “most people can be trusted” fell by 20% between 1972 and 2018. Zaki’s data focuses on the US, but his findings can certainly be applied more widely.Farrah Jarral£9.89 (RRP £10.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseTerrorismHarrowing account of the Paris attacks trialV13Emmanuel CarrèreV13Emmanuel CarrèreHarrowing account of the Paris attacks trialIn the early evening of 12 November 2015, three cars left Charleroi in Belgium, arriving a few hours later at a rented house in the northern suburbs of Paris. The occupants of the cars – or “the death convoy”, as they called it – were Islamic State terrorists who, the following night, rampaged through the French capital. Three attacked the Stade de France, where a football friendly between France and Germany was being played. Arriving late, they were denied entry to the stadium and blew themselves up outside.At the same time, another group opened fire on cafes and bars in the city centre. Two members fled, while another walked into a restaurant and detonated his suicide vest. Meanwhile, the remaining trio entered the Bataclan theatre, where a crowd of 1,500 were attending a gig by the US rock band Eagles of Death Metal. The attack and subsequent siege lasted two and a half hours and ended with all three terrorists dead. Across the city, 130 people had been murdered and hundreds more injured.Five years later, in the autumn of 2020, on the eve of publishing his new book, Yoga, and reeling from a difficult few years – mental illness, divorce, legal battles – Emmanuel Carrère was hunting for a subject. The author, who wrote fiction before branching into true crime, unconventional biographies and a string of extraordinary, deeply exposing memoirs, making him one of France’s most highly regarded writers, contacted an editor at the news magazine Le Nouvel Obs putting himself forward for work – “You know the kind of stuff I’m comfortable with: less opinion pieces than fieldwork, maybe a criminal case.”What the editors of Le Nouvel Obs eventually decided on wasn’t just any criminal case, but the largest in French history: the trial of those accused of involvement in the Paris terror attacks of 13 November 2015 (Friday, or vendredi, 13: V13). Carrère’s task was to show up, observe and file a weekly piece, and this book (translated from French by John Lambert) is the result. The challenge posed by a trial as inherently dramatic as V13 isn’t how to render it interesting, but how to traverse its morass of detail and sometimes contradictory defence testimony. The skill with which he does so is extraordinary.Chris Power£9.89 (RRP £10.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseBiographyLessons in chemistryThe Elements of Marie CurieDava SobelThe Elements of Marie CurieDava SobelLessons in chemistryTo write a biography of a figure as well known as Marie Curie and still offer something fresh or surprising is no easy undertaking. The double Nobel prizewinner is, as author Dava Sobel acknowledges, the only female scientist most people can name.To help shed new light on such an iconic figure, Sobel, a bestselling writer of science histories, has interwoven her account of Curie’s life and scientific discoveries with those of dozens of female scientists who passed through her lab in Paris.Alongside all the firsts – Curie was the first woman to win a Nobel prize and remains the only person to win Nobel prizes in two different scientific fields – she was also a devoted mother and carer for ageing relatives. She experienced the grief of miscarriage, and then in 1906 the earth-shattering loss of her beloved husband, Pierre, in a carriage accident. A few years later, she had an affair with the married physicist Paul Langevin that became a public scandal and virtually forced her into hiding. She lived through the first world war, when she led efforts to bring X-ray units closer to the battlefield to treat wounded soldiers, and drove one such voiture radiologique herself. She lectured far and wide and befriended many great scientists of her time, including Albert Einstein. There is, in other words, much to cover before you even consider the women whose paths briefly crossed with Curie’s until their work or life took them in other directions.Sobel does an excellent job of helping the reader to understand the historical importance and context of Curie’s work, but her interior life remains largely mysterious. I found myself itching to consult other sources – her collected letters to her daughters, her mourning journal, the biography written by one of her daughters, Ève – in order to fill in the gaps.Sophie McBain£9.89 (RRP £10.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseMemoirBlur reunitedOver the RainbowAlex JamesOver the RainbowAlex JamesBlur reunitedIn 2023, Blur played the biggest shows in their history over two weekend nights at Wembley Stadium. For Damon Albarn, Graham Coxon, Alex James and Dave Rowntree, it was a signal moment in an objectively great band’s history.Over the Rainbow is less the story of a rock band reconvening for one final(ish) weekend of triumph than a 180-page insight into the joyfully chaotic life of Blur’s food-obsessed bassist. James has written two other memoirs: the first, Bit of a Blur, told the raucous story of 90s excess, the second, All Cheeses Great and Small: A Life Less Blurry, the less-raucous tale of swapping life in London for a rambling farm in the Cotswolds. Over the Rainbow is a mixture of these two strands: the story of trying to balance the demands of running a farm, and the festival that takes place there, with a return to stadium rock’s frontline.He is an underrated musician, but don’t expect tracts on the merits of the Fender Precision bass: his passions are of the edible sort. There’s probably more in Over the Rainbow on the merits of broth, crisps, cheese on toast and cider. And there’s less than you might expect on the relationships between the members of the band.That’s a shame because, as interesting as the story of the English sparkling wine James has sourced for his festival is, it wouldn’t hurt to have a bit more on the mechanics of the reunion. There are some touching moments in To the End, when relations between James and Albarn tentatively thaw over a pint near Albarn’s home studio in south Devon. Here, the only hint at complex dynamics comes at a show in Mexico City, during which Albarn won’t even make eye contact with his bass player. James is crestfallen until he discovers that the singer is actually just trying hard to fend off a bout of food poisoning.James is an entertaining narrator. You might not learn much about rock’n’roll while reading Over the Rainbow, but you’ll probably have a fine old time while doing so.Will Dean£9.34 (RRP £10.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseMysteryA corpse at ChristmasEveryone This Christmas Has a SecretBenjamin StevensonEveryone This Christmas Has a SecretBenjamin StevensonA corpse at ChristmasBenjamin Stevenson is unashamedly tapping into the demand for festive mysteries with his latest novel, Everyone This Christmas Has a Secret. His series character Ernest Cunningham – not a detective, just a regular guy who keeps solving murders – starts by thanking the “literary god [who] had the foresight to drop a corpse at my feet at Christmas time”, and then reminds “the cynics out there” that even the likes of Agatha Christie and Arthur Conan Doyle “aren’t immune to a little yuletide cash grab”. Duly warned, there’s lots to enjoy: Ernest is called to Katoomba, a small town in Australia’s Blue Mountains, by his ex-wife Erin, who has been arrested for the murder of her new partner, Lyle. Only problem is, he’s got to keep it secret from his fiancee, Juliette, who won’t be delighted to learn he’s at Erin’s beck and call. Once Ernest is up in Katoomba, attending a magic show (it does make sense in the context of this particular murder), you guessed it: more bodies start to stack up. This is light and fun, if you don’t mind the archly knowing air of it all; the sort of thing to pop in the stocking of your fellow mystery fan on Christmas Day. Which I’m sure is exactly what Stevenson intended.Alison Flood£8.99 (RRP £9.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseMemoirFamily burn book dishes on DonaldWho Could Ever Love YouMary TrumpWho Could Ever Love YouMary TrumpFamily burn book dishes on DonaldOnce again, Mary Trump strafes her family, with her third book in four years. Who Could Ever Love You presents the Trump name as both cocoon and nightmare. Dysfunction reigns. Think of it as a burn book. All get singed.At times, Trump wishes Trump was not her surname. But she won’t abandon the legacy. She has delivered two bestsellers – Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World’s Most Dangerous Man and The Reckoning: America’s Trauma and Finding a Way to Heal. Her third book also follows All in the Family: The Trumps and How We Got This Way, a memoir by Fred C Trump III, Mary’s older brother, now estranged.Their home life sounds brutal – Linda Clapp, their mother, straight out of Mommy Dearest. Mary portrays her as cruelly oblivious. She repeatedly refused to bring young Mary to the hospital during late-night asthma attacks. Instead, she plunked Mary into her own bed.Mary’s father, Fred Trump Jr, neglected his kids. When he was around, he wasn’t present. He hit the bottle, divorced Clapp and died young. Mary loved him anyway. But his own father, Fred Trump Sr, repeatedly trampled his son, despising him for who he was and what he wasn’t. The elder Trump came to disinherit Fred Jr and his “issue”, at the urging of his surviving children, the next oldest boy, Donald Trump, among them. Think The Apprentice or Family Feud, crossed with Lord of the Flies.Predictably, Mary dishes on Uncle Donald. Her animus runs long and deep, back to grade school days. He bullied her, equating cruelty with attention. Little has changed.Mary writes: “It didn’t take me long to realize that Donald couldn’t do much more than throw a baseball, which he did, as hard as he could at his nieces and nephews, who were all under ten.”Trump pitched hard and wild, she writes, rarely meeting the strike zone. On the rare occasions when he connected with her mitt, her eight-year-old hand shuddered.The epilogue is more upbeat. Mary describes a winter evening in New York. “The lights of the city – my city – shone behind me. There is no way to know if a chance for redemption or even forgiveness exists anymore, but in that moment, I felt the world opening up again.”Lloyd Green£15.29 (RRP £16.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseHistoryDebunking misogynist myths of ancient RomeUnfortunately, She Was a NymphomaniacJoan SmithUnfortunately, She Was a NymphomaniacJoan SmithDebunking misogynist myths of ancient RomeJoan Smith is braver than I am. A classicist, as well as a feminist campaigner, she describes pulling up a male guide in Rome’s Palazzo Massimo on his description of one of the women of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. “It’s in the sources,” he protested, to which Smith replied, possibly with an eye-roll, that she was familiar with them. His belittling phrase provides the title for her book.There was a chapter on ancient Rome in her 1989 classic, Misogynies, but the impetus for a full-blown study came from the British Museum’s Nero exhibition in 2021, which aimed “to question the traditional narrative of the ruthless tyrant, revealing a different Nero, a popular leader”. This revisionism, Smith proposes, is rarely if ever extended to the wives, sisters, daughters and mothers of the emperors, perennially depicted as shrews, scheming bitches or lust-crazed she-wolves. Accordingly, she sets out to tell alternative stories of 23 Roman noblewomen.Smith takes aim at modern historians (not all of them male) who unthinkingly repeat ancient slanders, and rereads the sources with an eye to misogynist tropes. Her most stirring and contentious strategy is to relate the misdeeds of the Roman emperors to contemporary crimes, to indicate just how little has changed. Thus the fate of Claudius’s much younger wife Messalina, her name for centuries a byword for lust, is linked to the scandal of grooming gangs. Nero’s alleged sexual interest in his mother, Agrippina, leads Smith to observe that “mother-son incest” is a common internet search, and his matricide brings to mind the Sandy Hook killer’s first victim. Nero’s habit of throttling his wife, Octavia, meanwhile, is a sinister echo of the “rough sex” murder defence. “You don’t have to be a Roman emperor to get away with terrifying women,” Smith drily observes.Daisy Dunn’s recent The Missing Thread, which aimed to restore women’s place in a traditionally male-centred account of the ancient world, is considerably more measured in its pages on imperial Rome. Where Smith’s Claudius is indifferent to his wife Messalina’s murder, to Dunn he’s “in denial”. Dunn has Julia the Elder dying “probably of starvation”; Smith makes no such caveat. Sources can be read in vastly different ways. Still, on this impassioned reading, the “nymphomaniac” slur can confidently be put to bed.Suzi Feay£9.89 (RRP £10.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseConservationHidden gemsMyself and Other AnimalsGerald DurrellMyself and Other AnimalsGerald DurrellHidden gems“Gerald Durrell was magic” chirrups David Attenborough across the cover of this collection by the beloved naturalist and author who died in 1995. Chosen by Durrell’s widow to mark his centenary, it includes magazine pieces, radio talks, letters, introductions to other people’s books and a selection from the vast archive of his unpublished writing. What binds the pieces is the signature magic of which Attenborough, whose own career parallels and counterpoints Durrell’s, speaks. It might best be described as the gift of finding wonder everywhere.Durrell’s most famous book remains My Family and Other Animals (1956) and for those who can’t get enough of it, there’s a chance here to revisit the strawberry-pink villa, with its garden of sun-drunk wildlife and the ebullient Spiro, taxi-driver turned major-domo who watches over the Durrells fondly, “as though we were slightly weak-minded children”. Theo is here too, the polymathic scientist who presents Gerry with his first pocket microscope so that the boy-naturalist may peer with even more concentrated wonder into the exquisite silk-lined burrows of the trapdoor spiders that are dotted all over his new island home.In his conservation and writing work, Durrell made a point of concentrating on “the little brown jobs”, those unglamorous species whom no one would miss until it was far too late. Creatures like the cleaner fish of the Great Barrier Reef, which scurries around hoovering parasites from larger fish before “standing back to admire their handiwork rather like hairdressers admiring the creation of a new hairstyle”. Or what about the big Madagascar hissing cockroach, “a beast the size of a small tangerine, with a formidable array of spikes and spines on his chocolate brown body and legs”, which, when captured, purrs loudly. The list of these underrated creatures unspools delightfully. There is the hairy frog, the booming squirrel, the umbrellabird, the paradoxical frog and the (frankly irresistible) fairy penguin, which brays like a donkey. Truly, there is magic here.Kathryn Hughes£10.79 (RRP £11.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreClose"

He was 60.Malo died on Monday night, his wife, Betty Malo,postedon his Facebook page. He had been diagnosed with cancer. The frontman of the Mavericks had documented his health journey on social media since he disclosed in June 2024 that he was receiving treatment for colon cancer.In September 2025, Malo said on Instagram that he was battling LMD, or leptomeningeal disease, a rare complication when cancer spreads to membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord.The diagnosis forced the Mavericks to cancel dates with Dwight Yoakam in the middle of a joint tour. Malo left home in Nashville, Tennessee, to seek treatment in Houston, keeping his fans updated along his health journey.“He was called to do another gig – this time in the sky – and he’s flying high like an eagle,” Betty Malo wrote. “No one embodied life and love, joy and passion, family, friends, music, and adventure the way our beloved Raul did. Now he will look down on us with all that heaven will allow, lighting the way and reminding us to savor every moment.”Malo’s band praised his deep commitment to the “preservation of the multilingual American musical repertoire” and his steadfast championing of “music education as an inspiration for every child across America and throughout the world”.Born Raul Francisco Martínez-Malo Jr in Miami to Cuban parents, he co-founded the Mavericks in 1989 with drummer Paul Deakin and bass guitarist Robert Reynolds. Their self-titled debut album was released the following year on the independent, Miami-based label Y&T Music.Some call the band alt-country. Others describe it as Americana, roots, Latin, Tejano or swing. It’s all of the above and more, driven by songs written by Malo, his expansive guitar style and his broad vocal range, from a soaring, velvety baritone to operatic high notes.His musical prowess was in the blend, also incorporating rock, traditional country and surf. In the early days in Miami, the Mavericks played punk and rock clubs to get their sound out there.“I grew up in a household where we listened to all kinds of music,” Malo said in a 2020 NPR interview. “I just remember it was a celebration of all these cultures.”At that time, the Mavericks had just released an all-Spanish album, En Español, featuring original songs and classic Latin American standards. In 2002, Malo released an all-Spanish album for children, El Cancionero de la Familia Volume 1, featuring vocals from his sister, Carol, wife, Betty, and mother, Norma, along with other guests.The band has taken on various iterations over the years as some members came and went. The Mavericks also disbanded a couple of times. Malo put out a dozen or so solo albums and collaboration projects as well, including his instrumental Say Less, You’re Only Lonely and Sinners & Saints.The Mavericks released their 13th studio album, Moon & Stars, in 2024. Between that and their debut, the band received a Grammy, two Country Music Association awards and three Academy of Country Music Awards.Raul has a BMI award for songwriting, for All You Ever Do Is Bring Me Down, and was nominated for several solo Grammys, including one for his album Lucky One and another for his work with the Latin supergroup Los Super Seven.He is survived by his wife of 34 years, Betty; sons Dino, Victor, and Max, mother Norma, sister Carol, and Mavericks bandmates Paul Deakin, Eddie Perez, and Jerry Dale McFadden.Explore more on these topicsMusicnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a sequence depicting the desire to overcome the forces that seek to limit and constrain which lay at the heart of the director Henrik Malyan’s new wave critique.Or, as Malyan says in an unearthed interview that forms part of Stepanyan’s archival exploration: “It is about the fake and real concept of love … and without trying to sound pathetic, our film is about freedom.”View image in fullscreenTamara Stepanyan in a still from Khagher, a 1990 Soviet short film by Edgar Baghdasaryan, that features in My Armenian Phantoms.Photograph: Courtesy: Armenian Film SocietyFreedom, and what that entails for both the landlocked republic of Armenia and its large diaspora, has come into sharper focus against this decade’s backdrop of war, displacement and conflicts over sovereignty and identity.It is estimated that there are around three times more ethnic Armenians living outside the country than within it – a factor that has given rise to the idea of “stateless power” linked to a region that is increasingly the site ofgeopolitical tensionsbetween the US, Russia and Iran.Sossie Kasbarian, a senior lecturer in politics at the University of Stirling, says: “The diaspora can act as a complement to the nation state, and as a dynamic site of (trans)national identity and culture.“The experience of being Armenian in the republic, and being Armenian in the post-genocide western diaspora are two distinct historical experiences, and their cultural production will reflect that.”One such reflection is My Armenian Phantoms – an audiovisual journey through the works produced by her country’s lost pantheon of cinematic pioneers, prompted by the passing of the director’s father, the actor Vigen Stepanyan, in 2021. Through the nostalgic collage of personal archives and Soviet-era film, Tamara reflects on the state of a national cinema “organically linked to a political, social and cultural universe that has now disappeared”.View image in fullscreenJoy and exile … Monsieur Aznavour.Photograph: Courtesy: Armenian Film SocietyThe documentary, which is Armenia’s entry for the best international feature category at the Oscars in March, had its UK premiere during the Armenian film festival inLondonlast week.Returning for a second year, the festival – which ran from 4 to 7 December at the ICA – opened with the biopic, Monsieur Aznavour, featuring a performance by Tahar Rahim cast in the leading role as the iconic French Armenian singer-songwriter Charles Aznavour.View image in fullscreenNew wave …  Kira Adibekov and Tatevik Ayvazyan.Photograph: Garo BerberianAlso premiering was Eric Nazarian’s Die Like a Man, set in working-class Los Angeles and shot in a fortnight using a cast of mostly untrained actors – many of whom were Angelenos affected by the carceral state. The film serves as an example of what Kasbarian describes as “Armenian communities [being] part of the fabric of each of their societies and [sharing] all their concerns”.This year, the four-day event secured BFI funding for the first time and is fast establishing itself among the UK’s Armenian community. Concentrated in London and Manchester, they form part of a global diaspora that shares the scarring memories of repression, displacement and genocide.Tatevik Ayvazyan, one of the festival’s organisers and a member of the Armenian Film Society, says that “for a small, fragmented community, it was heartening and very rewarding to see how much the festival resonated and how well we did in the first year”.Regarding the history of migration that has shaped the diaspora in Britain, Ayvazyan says: “The Armenian community in the UK came in waves. The first, most significant wave to Manchester [were] escaping the Hamidian massacres, which were the precursor tothe Armenian genocide.“They came from Cyprus, from Iran after the revolution, from Iraq after the war, from the Soviet Union after the break-up. There is a horrific amount of baggage, from genocide, from displacement.“Somebody would come to me and ask: ‘Can we have more comedies?’”In the opening scene of Monsieur Aznavour, a young Charles watches, claps and participates in a community gathering. There’s music and dance, but interspersed with the images of joy are glimpses of footage – reminders of what led to their exile in interwar France – showing the starvation and deportations that took place duringthe genocide that killed more than a million people between 1915 and 1922.Ayvazyan adds: “We want to have intelligent, awareness-raising art about the tragedies we have faced … [but there is also] the importance of talking about and engaging with other cultures, because stories of displacement, war and identity are not unique to us. Every war and genocide happening in the world resonates with us.”View image in fullscreenAzerbaijan’s president Ilham Aliyev, Donald Trump and the Armenian prime minister Nikol Pashinyan sign a joint declaration for a ‘Trump route’ in the Caucasus region.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesRecently, Armenia has been in a state of flux. Two years after apopular uprising in 2018ousted the old guard of Armenian politics, the country was plunged intowar with neighbouring Azerbaijanover the disputed area of Nagorno-Karabakh.Stemming from an unresolved conflict of post-Soviet borders and territories, the Armenian-majority region held a degree of autonomy within Azerbaijan as the Republic of Artsakh, until Baku sought to end its de facto independence militarily, with Turkish support.By 2023, amajor offensiveand subsequent acts of ethnic cleansing forced thousands of Armenians to flee the region for Armenia in yet another cycle of tragedy and disorientation. Hemmed in by major regional powers, there are signs that the country is pivoting further to the west in an attempt to break out of its constrained position.View image in fullscreenResonant … the Armenian film festival in London last year.Photograph: Armenian Film SocietyKira Adibekov, who worked alongside Ayvazyan to organise the film festival and is involved with a project called Tumo that provides free creative education to teenagers, says: “It is clear that Russia traded the Republic of Artsakh for a deal with Turkey and Azerbaijan.”Earlier this year, Armenia’s parliament passed a bill to begin the process of joining the EU, and in August, Donald Trump turned his attention to the region with a US-brokered peace treaty signed by Yerevan and Baku, including provisions for a “Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity” (Tripp).Although viewed as a “vague proposal”, Adibekov says that the prospect of Tripp has “brought some calm” in the region with the hope of regional communications that initiatives like the Tumo project may benefit from.Reflecting on contemporary Armenia, which will mark the 35th anniversary since its independence from the former USSR next year, Ayvazyan says “Under the shiny facade of relations with the EU, the country still needs to recover from the war and learn how to function after years of Soviet and oligarchic rule.”Explore more on these topicsFilmArmeniaEuropeLondonShareReuse this content"

Tarantino said he would have moved Paul Thomas Anderson’s 2007 drama higher than No 5 had a different actor played preacher Eli Sunday.“There Will Be Blood would stand a good chance at being No 1 or 2 if it didn’t have a big, giant flaw in it … and the flaw is Paul Dano,” said Tarantino.“Obviously, it’s supposed to be a two-hander, but it’s also drastically obvious that it’s not a two-hander. [Dano] is weak sauce, man. He is the weak sister. Austin Butler would have been wonderful in that role. He’s just such a weak, weak, uninteresting guy. The weakest fucking actor in SAG.”Quentin Tarantino has strong opinions about Paul Dano and none of them are right | Sian CainRead moreAn Instagram account claiming to be Day-Lewis’postedon Monday: “Paul Dano is one of the best and most talented actors of his generation.” Later that day, the post was removed, and representatives for the actor confirmed to the Guardian that the account was in fact run by a fan.However, Day-Lewis’s representatives added that the actor - who suggested Dano for the role in There Will Be Blood after the original actor dropped out at short notice - endorsed the sentiments.Dano and Day-Lewis had previously worked together on 2005 film The Ballad of Jack and Rose.Numerous film industry names have also showed support for Dano, with Ben Stiller posting that Dano “is fucking brilliant”, while The Batman director Matt Reeves called him “an incredible actor, and an incredible person”.Dillon Freasier, who played Day-Lewis’s adopted son in There Will Be Blood told TMZ the film is “perfect,” adding: “It’s a work of art. And it’s that way because everyone was perfectly cast.”Others have flagged Dano’s prowess as a director, urging people to seek out his 2018 filmWildlife.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Speaking at a GalaxyCon event in Ohio, Lillard said such criticism “hurts your feelings”.He added: “It fucking sucks. And you wouldn’t say that to Tom Cruise. You wouldn’t say that to somebody who’s a top-line actor in Hollywood. I’m very popular in this room. I’m not very popular in Hollywood. Two totally different microcosms, right?

There were more than 50 such performers this year, including veteran bands such as Pulp and Architects and newer pop acts such as Gracie Abrams.View image in fullscreen‘We should contribute towards a more sustainable ecosystem’ … Ben Lovett of Mumford & Sons in 2012.Photograph: Brian Rasic/Getty ImagesHeralding the O2’s announcement was Ben Lovett, multi-instrumentalist with Mumford & Sons, who perform at the O2 this week; Lovett is also an entrepreneur whose company TVG has opened concert venues in cities including London, Los Angeles, and Huntsville, Alabama, and he has separately donated to MVT.“We think it’s brilliant that a venue like the O2 is making a meaningful donation,” he said. “To contribute, as we all should, towards a more sustainable ecosystem within live music in the future.”He referred back to Mumford & Sons’ first O2 headline concert in 2012, “back when many of the venues where we had cut our teeth, including the Luminaire in Kilburn where we played our first headline show, had started closing down. This trend has only continued, in London and across the country.”More than 150 grassroots venues have closed in the UK since 2023. Factors affecting these venues include the cost of utilities, ongoing recovery from Covid losses, and a further loss of revenue due to the cost of living crisis prompting less gig-going among the public.Emma Bownes, senior vice-president of venue programming at the O2 Arena’s parent company AEG Europe, said: “Every artist who headlines the O2 for the first time reflects the strength of that grassroots network … we’re investing in the pipeline that nurtures the next generation of breakthrough artists and ensures they have a place to start.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Drawn with care and precision, the image may be the only anatomical drawing of a black body made during the Victorian age.Now it is part of a new exhibition that focuses on the work of Joseph Maclise,a surgeonand artist whose work – including his 1851 atlas Surgical Anatomy – made the human anatomy accessible to the general public, and who was the brother of the celebrated artist Daniel Maclise.Jack Gann, the curator at Thackray Museum of Medicine inLeeds, which is hosting the Beneath the Sheets: Anatomy, Art and Power exhibition, says Joseph Maclise’s work also broke new ground by centring black bodies and focusing on queer desire.The portrait of the black man featured in Surgical Anatomy, which sold widely. But when the book was published in the US that image was the only one omitted, with racial prejudice and segregationist attitudes in the lead-up to the American civil war blamed for the decision.Maclise used living models from the streets of London and Paris to create his drawings, combining their figures – often idealised visions of the human body – with dissections of corpses taken from the morgues of the French capital.View image in fullscreenMaclise used living models from the streets of London and Paris, combined with dissections of corpses, to create his drawings.Illustration: Mark Newton PhotographyHis drawings were intricate and delicate, often homing in on small details that other artists might have avoided. “He drew little scars or blemishes,” says Gann. “One of them has an ear piercing, they aren’t like Greek gods.”The artist also consistently drew the genitalia of his subjects, even when the drawing concerned another part of the body. “He drew these beautiful portraits and lavished attention on the body far beyond the bits that the anatomist needed to show,” says Gann.The American medical historian Michael Sappol describes Maclise’s work as “a catalogue of irrelevant penises” and that recurring feature has led to speculation about Maclise’s sexuality.Although there is no evidence to confirm it, Gann says some believe Maclise was gay and that the drawings doubled as erotica.“He never left any real records of his personal life – he never wrote letters or diaries and he never married,” Gann adds. “The story is most clearly told by just looking at the pictures and coming face to face with that sensuality.”View image in fullscreenMaclise’s drawings were intricate and delicate, often homing in on small details that other artists might have avoided.Illustration: Mark Newton PhotographySappol argues in his book Queer Anatomies that Maclise’s images are part of a“lost archive of queer expression”, alongside the work of artists including the French anatomist and painter Jacques FabienGautier d’Agoty and the English surgeon William Cheselden.Ultimately, Maclise’s work was eclipsed by the popularity ofGray’s Anatomy, which was much more accessible and cheaper. But his work has continued to fascinate: one of his illustrations was used to promote the National Theatre’s production ofFrankenstein in 2011.Female bodies also feature in the exhibition, including the case of Mary Paterson, whose body was sold for medical study after she was a victim ofBurke and Hare, the most notorious serial killers in Scottish history. She is described by the Thackray as “a posthumous object of anatomical fascination, medical men marvelled at her preserved beauty, raising troubling questions about class, violence and the male gaze”.View image in fullscreenDrawing of Mary Paterson, taken from William Roughead’s Trials of Burke and Hare, 1948.Illustration: Thackray Museum of MedicineCharles Estienne’s 1545 book, De Dissectione Partium Corporis Humani Libri Tres, with images that were essentially collages, or “body parts stitched together like Frankenstein’s creation from sketches of many dissections”, also features.As does Andreas Vesalius, whose 1543 De Humani Corporis Fabrica publication was the first major work to show human anatomy drawn directly from dissected bodies.Beneath the Sheets: Anatomy,Artand Power at the Thackray Museum of Medicine in Leeds opens on 7 February 2026 and runs until 27 June.Explore more on these topicsArtRaceBiologyLeedsMuseumsMedical researchWest YorkshirenewsShareReuse this content"

Nuzzi, worried Donald Trump will catch on and start spreading rumours, convenes an emergency meeting with the Politician to strategise. RFK Jr – who has denied having an affair with Nuzzi – doesn’t see the big deal.So, she agonises “Did he take me seriously?”and reflects that she had “little cause to consider the question before now.”But once the question did cross Nuzzi’s mind, it imprinted itself on to her psyche. American Canto is part-memoir, part-political analysis. But it is, above all else, a plea by Nuzzi to be taken seriously; as a writer, thinker, person. This is not easy in the best of circumstances when, like Nuzzi, you’re a young and conventionally attractive woman. And, of course, it is even more difficult when, like Nuzzi, you’re a female journalist who made headlines for allegedly engaging in an inappropriate relationship with a famous subject. (Or, considering theaccusationsrecently level by Nuzzi’s former fiance, Ryan Lizza,subjects.)Nuzzi’s looks: the doors they might open, the preconceptions they engender – as well as the misogynistic system they operate within – are a recurring motif in American Canto, albeit one that is frustratingly underexplored. During her first meeting with Trump, she recounts, he looks her up and down and proclaims: “Very young and very beautiful.” Later on, her reporting irritates the president and he publicly insults Nuzzi, calling her “shaky and unattractive.” She is thrown by this, writing how strange she felt it “that the president of the United States had called me both beautiful and unattractive”.Then, at an exclusive DC party, Nuzzi stands in the kitchen with New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd, a woman namechecked perhaps because the US does take her seriously, and is accosted by an unidentified female movie star who grabs Nuzzi’s face. “‘Olivia, the secret to life is to be rapeable,’ she told me. ‘You are rapeable.’” She leaves that jarring anecdote to hang there, unexamined.It goes on and on: a series of overwritten non sequiturs whose purpose, it would appear, are to demonstrate that Nuzzi is a serious personWhen, in September 2024, Nuzzi’s alleged affair with the Politician is revealed, the star reporter, a person it’s hard to imagine as naive, seems shocked at how it plays out. “The Politician had orchestrated a narrative in which I was not just reduced to my sexuality but into a hyper-sexualized honeypot,” she writes. Most upsetting, Nuzzi says, are blind quotes suggesting she had used her “appearance as a tool for manipulation while performing my work. Of the lies told about me, this was among the hardest to take.”Nuzzi is right to be angry about the double standards applied to her; the way she was raked over the coals while a far older, far more powerful man coasted away from the scandal into a plum cabinet position. But American Canto would have been a better book if Nuzzi had interrogated her own behaviour. Instead, she glosses over it. “The Politician had been, briefly, my subject,” she admits. But, she argues, “[h]e had not been my source”. She seems to see no impropriety on her part; she’s just angry her privacy was violated.Nuzzi is angry, too, at entreaties to dish the dirt that the public (and, one imagines, her publisher) so desperately want. “I thought of that phrase,Tell all,often … Tell what, exactly? Tell why, exactly?” she fumes. Well, one reason, I suppose, might be to sell some books. Tell-alls, the ones that actuallytell, tend to sell.There is not much telling in American Canto, however; or not of anything anyone wants to hear about, anyway. For the first 116 pages, Nuzzi, who, after losing her job at New York magazine has self-exiled to California, barely mentions the Politician. Instead, she writes about Madeleine Ruthven, a screenwriter in the silent era, “hauled before Congress in the McCarthy hearings”, and then, in the next paragraph, about the North American tectonic plate triumphing over the Farallon tectonic plate “one hundred million years ago, give or take”. On the next page a quote from Nietzsche. Then an extract from an interview with Trump. And it goes on and on like this: a series of overwritten American Non Sequiturs whose purpose, it would appear, are to demonstrate that Nuzzi is a serious person with serious thoughts on the state of the United States and “consensus reality” (she is very fond of this phrase) who should be taken seriously.The alleged affair, when it finally comes up, is crept around. We learn little of interest about RFK Jr, a man who, as secretary of health and human services, is systematically destroying decades of medical progress. We are told instead that: “He desired. He desired desiring. He desired being desired. He desired desire itself.” She overintellectualises what is ultimately a sordid episode. For example, the Politician asks Nuzzi for advice, she says: “I approached his dilemma Socratically.”While American Canto may suggest otherwise, Nuzzi is not a bad writer. She can paint a vivid scene, pull you into a place. And the places she’s been are important, some of the world’s greatest centres of power. Buried among all the pretension, unnecessary filler and insufferable prose, there are the bones of an excellent book. Perhaps one day, if Nuzzi stops taking herself quite so seriously, we might get to read it.American Canto by Olivia Nuzzi is published by Avid Reader Press / Simon & Schuster (£20).

As she reached for the overhead locker the basket overturned, spilling the contents on her neighbour. He turned out to be the chief executive of Hermès, the French luxury goods company, and immediately offered to make her a bag with internal pockets and a secure closure. Birkin sketched what she wanted on a sick bag and “The Birkin” was born: a slouchy trapezoid in finest leather complete with its own little padlock. These days a Birkin bag starts at around £10,000 while the original, made for Birkin herself, was auctioned this summer for £7.4m.It is a tale that gets endlessly repeated thanks to its neat compression of the main beats of the Jane Birkin story. First, there’s the insouciance, the fact that the Anglo-French singer and actor never seemed to go after anything; rather, it came to her. Then there’s her lack of mortification at having her whole life upended on a strange man’s lap, nappies and all. Finally, there’s her refusal to feel overawed by her bounty. Birkin famously did not treat her Hermès bag with especial reverence, enthusiastically festooning it with charms, beads, stickers and ribbons. The trend for personalising your handbag with bits of tat was ubiquitous this summer, part of a wider revival of the Birkin aesthetic, comprising flared mid-wash jeans, peasanty cheesecloth blouses and ballet flats. You couldn’t avoid it if you tried.Gainsbourg was a famous soap-dodgerAll of which is to say that Marisa Meltzer’s biography of Birkin doesn’t really break new ground. Meltzer, a journalist who has previously written books on the founder of Weight Watchers and the millennial cosmetics company Glossier, has not persuaded any of Birkin’s friends or family to talk. (It says much for the affection and loyalty in which Birkin is held that, two years after her death at the age of 76, her inner circle remains tight-lipped.) So instead, Meltzer has trawled through the thousands of profiles and interviews published since 1969, the year when Birkin broke through with Je T’aime … Moi Non Plus, the orgasmic pop song that made her “world famous in three minutes” according to one Swiss magazine. In addition, she draws on Birkin’s published diaries that cover the period 1957 to 2013.The result is a brisk account of how the future star walked out of her Isle of Wight boarding school at 16, discovered that her tall, thin, androgynous look was just right for the 1960s and started getting small acting parts. By the age of 21 she had appeared naked in Antonioni’sBlow-Up, been seduced by the film composer John Barry, got pregnant and split up.It is when Birkin made it to Paris in 1967 that her story properly began. She auditioned for a part in a film starring a man she thought was called “Serge Bourguignon”, fell in love and moved to Paris to be with him. Serge “Bourguignon” Gainsbourg sounds ghastly, not least because of his need, despite already being 40, toépater le bourgeoisat every opportunity. This tendency reached its climax when Je T’aime … Moi Non Plus was condemned by the papacy and banned by the BBC. Naturally, he was thrilled.Birkin’s 12 years with Gainsbourg sound like a piece of deranged performance art. People got used to seeing them in drunken fights at Brasserie Lipp, and Gainsbourg took to carrying a gun which he swore he would use on anyone who made eyes at her. Birkin in turn registered her despair by jumping into the Seine before thinking better of it and scrambling out dripping wet (she was annoyed that her Yves Saint Laurent blouse permanently shrank). It is a relief for the reader, let alone Birkin, when she finally manages to wriggle free and set up home with film director Jacques Doillon, who is no less controlling, but at least takes showers (Gainsbourg was a famous soap-dodger).Jane Birkin’s original Hermès handbag sells for record €8.6m at Paris auctionRead moreMeltzer shows herself to be careless with details and ignorant of the wider cultural background. She describes Roman Polanski as “Polish-born”, despite Paris being his birthplace, and suggests that the city is home to several “cathedrals”. More forgivable, perhaps, is her insistence that Jane Birkin was a major creative force in music and theatre in the late 20th century.She really wasn’t, which is why Birkin’s continuing appeal to both women and men remains so intriguing. Although she was still scheduling concerts at the time of her death, audiences weren’t flocking to hear Birkin sing so much as soak up her essence. And it is the precise nature of that essence that resists parsing. She was romantic yet raunchy, British yet French, an idealised woman yet a self-described “garçonne”. Jane Birkin contained multitudes, and until we have an account that dives deeper than this one, she will remain tantalisingly elusive.It Girl: The Life and Legacy of Jane Birkin by Marisa Meltzer is published by Atria (£20).

In PD Ouspensky’s 1915 novel Strange Life of Ivan Osokin, the feckless Osokin is given the chance to live his life over again, only to find himself making all the same mistakes. Like Groundhog Day’s insufferable Phil Connors, Osokin can change nothing without changing himself.Solvej Balle’s much-lauded series On the Calculation of Volume takes a very different approach. She first began working on the idea decades ago, several years before Groundhog Day was released. The film, she says, “helped me with research by trying out some of the roads I did not want to take”. The books, five so far with two more planned, have proved a literary sensation in her native Denmark, with the first three volumes together scooping the 2022 Nordic Council Literature prize, the highest literary honour in Scandinavia. This is the third to be published in English this year; the first wasshortlisted for the 2025 International Booker prize.Balle’s protagonist, Tara Selter, is an antiquarian book dealer from a small town in France who, on a buying trip to Paris, finds herself trapped in 18 November. For everyone else, as morning comes and the day resets, it is 18 November for the first time. They perform the same actions in the same order, unaware of any repetition. Only Tara remembers the November 18ths that have gone before. She counts the days and tries to grasp the bafflingly inconsistent rules of her new reality. Some possessions she acquires stay with her when the day repeats itself, while others return to wherever they came from. She herself can travel: she is trapped in time but not in space. She can interact with people, too, changing the events of their day. The problem is that, as 18 November loops round again, they remember nothing.Balle spins a profound meditation on love, loneliness, human consumption and everyday lifeIn Volume I, Tara returns home from Paris to her partner, Thomas. She tries to enlist his help but the ordeal of explaining anew every morning exhausts her and she moves into the spare room, haunting his day invisibly, like a ghost. In Volume II, hungry for seasons, she traverses Europe, north to south, seeking the ordinary shape of a year in a single repeated day. It is only at the start of Volume III that she finally detects a break in the pattern. “I have met someone who remembers,” she announces, giddy with grateful incredulity.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

For 1,143 days, Tara’s journals have been her “sole witness, [her] confidant”. Now she has Henry; not a friend exactly but a fellow traveller. Before long they meet another couple who share their predicament. The four find themselves suddenly defined by one another, and the different ways they have chosen to respond to their situation. Which is most reasonable, most ethical, mostcorrect? They struggle to agree. Should they use their foreknowledge to prevent the accidents and disasters that repeatedly occur on 18 November? Or should they – could they – change the systems that make accidents inevitable? Is it enough to pay meticulous attention, to try to understand what repetition reveals about the world? How should they structure their shared lives now that they are four?Volume III is more digressive than its predecessors, more freighted with history and philosophy. It is also looser, opening its sealed spaces to more air and light. For all her sensitivity and fierce intelligence, Balle’s Tara is a disconcertingly disembodied creation: indifferent to food and, after Thomas, untroubled by sexual appetite, she never once in three volumes alludes to her period, surely for a woman in her 30s a definitive marker of time. She is also dispiritingly disinclined to make jokes.But as her focus widens, Balle introduces some welcome flashes of humour while sustaining the compulsively hypnotic effect of the first two books. And they are compulsive, there can be no doubt about that. Three volumes in, Balle’s piercing attentiveness and her forensic curiosity continue to render 18 November endlessly interesting. From a continuously looping span of 24 ordinary hours, she spins a profound meditation on love and loneliness, on grief and hope and longing, on the rapacity of human consumption and the ordinary, unthinking mundanity of everyday life, on how we understand the past and anticipate the future. Her sinuous sentences wrap themselves around us, her readers, binding us over and over to 18 November, drawing us deeper and deeper into its ungraspable possibilities. By this third volume, the day no longer belongs exclusively to Tara. It belongs to her three companions – and to us.Five of the best translated fiction of 2025Read moreIn Groundhog Day and indeed in Strange Life of Ivan Osokin, the story draws its propulsive momentum from the protagonist’s search for an escape. Somewhere, within them or without, is a key that will unlock time and set them free. Tara Selter no longer believes in freedom. She knows she will never escape. But what she learns from her November 18ths, and what other people teach her, adds up to its own lifetime.On the Calculation of Volume III by Solvej Balle, translated by Sophia Hersi Smith and Jennifer Russell, is published by Faber (£12.99).

Most will tell you: shared canine custody arrangements prevent exes from moving on. It’s a logistical headache. It causes fights. It’s annoying for all involved (and then some). And apparently, in a revelation worthy of a straight-to-streaming movie, it makes dogs depressed.Oh. What. Fun. review – Michelle Pfeiffer leads Amazon’s underbaked Christmas turkeyRead moreNot to minimize the mental health of dogs – I’ve listened to my mother boast about our family chihuahua’s “EQ” enough to know that man’s best friend has the capacity for great emotional sensitivity. (And the ability to convey it on command – for a truly outstanding performance of doggie depression, please see Bing the bereft great dane in 2024’sThe Friend.) I have no doubt that a dog like Merv, a wired-hair terrier sort played by Gus the Dog in Merv’s eponymous Amazon movie, would struggle to adjust from life in a single family unit to split homes. Whether or not the ill-advised dog-sharing arrangement can sustain a whole Christmas romcom, however, is a dubious proposition.To be fair, Merv, written by Dane Clark and Linsey Stewart and directed by British playwright Jessica Swale, does not pretend to be bigger or better than it is. This is a tech company-cum-studio holiday release – it is not that deep. You know the plot will be simple and straightforward – forced to confront the fact that their respective post-split depressions are outmatched only by Merv’s, exes Russ (Charlie Cox, thankfully allowed to still be British) and Anne (Zooey Deschanel) take a cheer-up trip to a dog resort, where they will presumably stumble into realizing that they’re better off together. The side characters – here played by Chris Redd, Jasmine Mathews, Wynn Everett and Ellyn Jameson – will be eccentric, underused, overtuned, or all of the above. The visual quality will be that of an Amazon brand bestseller, the wintry atmosphere obviously contrived. (In this case, the fake snow clumps around verdant trees, as North Carolina in June stands in for Boston in December.)Whether or not these known quantities cohere into something enjoyable, then, depends on the quality of the performances, and one’s appetite for comfort food. On the second count, Merv selects a key target audience – the type to scroll Instagram Reels for dog videos, and please know I say that with an algorithm that is 70% chihuahua videos – and delivers with a plethora of dog montages. The selling point is dog, and though that unfortunately entails some awkward edits between dog line (of sorts) and human response, Merv delivers on dog beach, dog party, dog walk, dog depression and, ultimately, doggie joy.The same cannot be said for the human side of the project, which veers uneasily between relationship study, winking zaniness, basic romcom and slapstick, not really nailing any of them. That’s no fault of Cox, who is admirably game here, willing to go for the silly and cringe necessary to fully participate at the resort for dogs. There’s an inherent self-deprecation to the performance that is winsome, supplying more than his share of the charm and the chemistry for this obviously perfect-for-each-other couple on the rocks. Deschanel, as she does, brings a certainmillennial quirkinessto the proceedings, which either is your speed or isn’t. Her Anna is a touch too dry and aloof for my taste, particularly when matched with Cox’s sad-sack sincerity. (For what it’s worth – though not given much to do besides “be depressed”, Gus the Dog flops on the floor and whines convincingly – he’s no Messi in Anatomy of a Fall, but still a very good boy.)Merv tries to imbue Anna and Russ’s relationship with enough weight to carry through scenes without the title dog present – a shame, as he is by far the cutest part of this cute-aiming pic – and, as expected, meets the bare minimum. There is a reason why the two broke up, one which would feel more grounded and adult if provided a little more time to sink in and a little less blunt explanation. As it is, Merv is slight and sweet and entirely to expectations. Making a movie about co-parenting a dog is not a bad idea – though I wouldn’t say it’s a great one, either.Merv is available on Amazon Prime on 10 DecemberExplore more on these topicsFilmComedy filmsZooey DeschanelDogsAnimalsRomance filmsChristmasreviewsShareReuse this content"

First released in the US in 2015, it’s an ultra-low-budget debut from first-time director Charles Poekel, set almost entirely on a 24-hour pop-upChristmastree stall. Poekel’s style is far too authentic-indie and unaffected to get slushy or sentimental about Christmas; through his lens Christmas tree lights blink like police lights. But in its own low-key way, he pitches his film just right for a little squeeze of festive warmth.Kentucker Audley stars as Noel (it took someone in the film to joke about his name before I twigged). Noel is back for his fifth year selling Christmas trees in Brooklyn, standing outside in the freezing cold and sleeping in a not-much-warmer caravan parked next to the trees. A few customers ask about the girl working with him last year. But this year Noel is alone, broken-hearted and working the night shift. There’s a documentary feel to a lot of the scenes, customers asking pointless random questions. One woman wants the same Christmas tree as the Obamas (this is 2014). Noel looks frozen to the bone physically and emotionally; he’s weary and disillusioned, though Audley’s subtle performance makes it clear that he wasn’t always like this.In truth, not much happens. Noel rescues a woman, Lydia (Hannah Gross), who has passed out drunk on a bench. She pops up again later in some genuinely moving scenes as Noel drives around New York, delivering trees – and these moments could spark a little flicker of good cheer in the grinchiest of hearts. Poekel hasn’t made a feature since this which is a shame – you can’t beat it for naturalness and ease, and it’s shot on gorgeously textured 16mm film.Christmas, Again is in UK cinemas from 12 December and on digital platforms in the US.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsChristmasreviewsShareReuse this content"

One day she catches the eye of Skinner, played by Fred Hechinger, a young military veteran who impulsively starts to talk to her. There is a spark between them and then something more.But the very question of any possible relationship brings other problems into focus: Skinner is on medication for PTSD, and as for Aishe, marrying a US citizen might not solve her residency worries; it might simply mean drawing attention to her questionable status and lead to imprisonment and expulsion.The film shows how the two slip into a limbo, drifting and circling around each other. Perhaps Aishe isn’t sure she wants to commit to the moody and boozy Skinner who can disappear for days at a time; Skinner isn’t sure he really understands the abyss of cultural and historical sadness from which his new girlfriend has appeared. For Aishe, survival has meant anonymity, and that effacement of self works against romance and marriage.So what now? Is she waiting for something better in the next life, a scary concept with which she is faced while pondering the resumption of her faith. Or is this it? The movie’s strength lies in showing that there is nothing necessarily liberal or humane in the story of an intercultural romance – it is existentially challenging. For each participant, the relationship poses a question that would not be there if either simply got together with one of their own culture, as they might have been blandly assuming would be the case. Their differences foreground the idea of choice and heightens its visibility; it forces Aishe and Skinner to look at themselves. Have they chosen each other for life? And what is life?This is a story in which happy endings are not guaranteed and in fact not forthcoming. It has a seriousness, an unsentimental readiness to look reality in the face.Preparation for the Next Life is in UK and Irish cinemas from 12 December.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsRomance filmsFilm adaptationsUyghursNew YorkChinareviewsShareReuse this content"

Instead, Moroccan film-maker Sofia Alaoui’s debut begins as insightful, sharply observed commentary on class and gender in her home country. The young pregnant woman of the tagline is Itto (Oumaïma Barid), who lives with her husband and his parents in palatial marble-and-gold luxury.But Itto was not born into wealth: she is from a poor rural family, a fact that her stuck-up mother-in-law (Souad Khouyi) won’t let her forget. Itto is at home alone when a meteorological event hits, a flood that brings out the army in trucks. A neighbour is paid to drive her to the city where her husband and his family are stranded, but the neighbour abandons her in a village. Extremely pregnant and alone, Itto is vulnerabile which makes her fierce, conveyed by the intensity of Barid’s captivating performance. We’ve seen Itto being passive or sulky at home, but suddenly her face has the determination of an Olympic sprinter running towards the finish line.And here a creeping mood of eerie strangeness takes over the film. Green lightning flashes in the sky; animals behave strangely, dogs biting and skittish birds dive-bombing people. The men in the village are hostile to Itto; is it because she is a woman travelling alone or because they are possessed? Other people speak cryptically with the zeal of prophets. By the end, Animalia is more Terrence Malick than apocalyptic, with mystical transcendental suggestions of the interconnectedness of the universe. How satisfying that feels is a matter of personal taste, but this is undoubtedly an intriguing, eccentric and distinctive debut.● Animalia is in UK and Irish cinemas from 12 December.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsScience fiction and fantasy filmsMoroccoAfricaMiddle East and north AfricareviewsShareReuse this content"

This area, which is seen by just about everyone (apart from the People’s Republic of China) as part of the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone, has been increasingly infiltrated by Chinese boats, some of them fishing vessels but mostly Chinese coast guard vessels that have harassed, rammed and attempted to board Filipino boats as part of the dispute over sovereignty in the area. Some of the footage seen here is pretty tense, although mostly it’s a game of bluster at sea, with officers on different vessels exchanging puffed-chest speeches peppered with legalese over short-wave radios, a kind of airwave diplomacy.The film’s title refers to the ongoing efforts by the Filipino army to deliver foodstuffs to some of the tiny islands in the WPS where soldiers hold the line, literally, for long lonely stretches. And when we say “islands”, we’re talking about dollops of sand in shallow waters no bigger than a football pitch, accessible only by inflatable motorboats travelling at frightening speeds. They are certainly scary for the poor baby goats, loaded along with canned food and other supplies that we see scrambling for better footholds as the boats go zooming across the waves. Elsewhere, we follow fishers living in the more populated Scarborough Shoal who complain they are catching less due to Chinese fishing boats in the area.In technical terms, this suffers a bit from a somewhat scattered narrative approach and a tacky musical score that overemphasises the emotional beats. But it’s a fascinating subject that’s little discussed outside the far east.Food Delivery: Fresh from West Philippine Sea is at Rich Mix, London from 10 December.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsPhilippinesChinaAsia PacificreviewsShareReuse this content"

Me neither. But an incongruous dinosaur sidekick is just one of the wonderfully silly additions to this take on the fairytale, along with a daft classroom routine, some capering ghouls and a regiment of toy soldiers come to life.Now in the fifth year of its current formula, helmed by panto veteran Paul Hendy as writer-producer, the YorkTheatreRoyal’s festive offering feels solidly bedded in. It’s reliably crowd-pleasing and family-friendly, with a string of familiar set pieces to delight those who come back year after year. We know there will be the slop scene, the ghost bench, the pun-packed comedy routine, the pre-interval spectacle. Part of the joy is in waiting for these moments and wondering what new twist will be put on them.View image in fullscreenWicked … Jocasta Almgill as Carabosse.Photograph: Pamela RaithThe secret ingredient is Theatre Royal favourite Robin Simpson as the dame – in this case, Princess Aurora’s thrice-widowed protector Nurse Nellie. While some of the show’s jokes about things going wrong feel rather too rehearsed, there’s always an unpredictable twinkle in Simpson’s eye and he’s at his best when riffing on genuine slip-ups. This year’s usual bit of audience interaction with a male spectator who catches the dame’s eye lands with a particularly brilliant gag, leaving cast as well as audience gasping for breath between laughs.There’s strong supporting work from returning Tommy Carmichael in the Buttons-style role of Jangles, as well as an entertaining double act from CBeebies’ Jennie Dale and seasoned musical theatre performer Jocasta Almgill as the good and bad fairies respectively. But what’s slightly lost in this offering – aside from a cursory sprinkling of easy cracks at Hull and Nigel Farage – is the distinctive local and topical flavour of pantomime at its best.At York Theatre Royal until 4 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsPanto seasonTheatreComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)reviewsShareReuse this content"

An old woman, Marjorie, talking to a hologram modeled after her long-dead husband perhaps seemed like a wild, far-fetched idea, that a computer program could somehow closely mimic the cadence of real conversation, could fake intimate knowledge of a person’s life. What a strange and alienating idea.‘It was legs out all the time!’ June Squibb on starring in Scarlett Johansson’s directing debut – and Broadway’s original GypsyRead moreJust 11 years later (and eight years after a little-seen film adaptation), Marjorie Prime plays far more credibly. We may not have the hologram technology down quite yet, but everything else in Harrison’s AI speculation now seems well within reason. Perhaps that’s why Second Stage Theater decided to revive the play in itsBroadwayhouse, an attempt at commenting, and capitalizing, on the excited buzz and nervous chatter surrounding recent technological advancements.Whether or not this has been actual advancement and not instead a terrible deviation toward a brainless future is perhaps best left for others to debate, outside the confines of a theater review. What can be said here is that this Marjorie Prime, directed with restraint by Anne Kauffman (who was also behind the off-Broadway production in 2015), is both helped and hindered by its sudden relevance. It presents an intriguing and poignant suggestion of what might exist just a few decades from now, but perhaps doesn’t suggest enough. With its novelty gone, Marjorie Prime must rely more firmly on its internal mechanics, which can be creaky.June Squibb, enjoying a remarkable later-life career peak, plays Marjorie, born in 1977 and now 85 years old, well on her way to shuffling off this mortal coil. She’s looked after by her daughter, Tess (Cynthia Nixon), and son-in-law, Jon (Danny Burstein), but spends much of her time alone in her lounge chair. Though, by some measure, Marjorie isn’t alone at all. She’s frequently joined by a projection of her husband, Walter (Christopher Lowell), at what we can guess was his prime, handsome and turtlenecked in his 30s, gamely remembering cute stories about movie dates and dearly departed family pets.Something grim lurks at the edges of these reveries into the past, an occasional mention of a son who died many years ago. Tess believes that in at least one crucial way, Marjorie’s dementia is doing her a favor. Why should she remember the great tragedy of her life? Jon – who has a warm and playful relationship with Marjorie that Tess envies – disagrees. Marjorie should have access to a full recollection of her experience; he tells the Walter AI everything, so it can better relate to Marjorie.Marjorie Prime is ultimately more about memory and mortality than it is about technology. It’s a rumination on what, if anything, a life amounts to when it’s done. Tess, played with aching clarity by Nixon, is flailing to find the purpose in any of it. She is experiencing the existential astonishment and terror of anyone who has watched a loved one slip away, desperate to find the grand meaning in her mother’s life, and in her own. What the Walter bot represents is something like an afterlife, a ghost willed into existence by the grieving living. Is such a thing a tool of comfort, or delusion?Chess review – messy Broadway revival wastes catchy Abba songsRead moreHarrison, in his poetic but sometimes cliched language, suggests it is a little bit of both. Our time on Earth is terribly fleeting, and isn’t that sad? But also some part of us does linger on in those who knew us, those who tell our stories, who reach fondly for us in moments of nostalgia. If tech can somehow aid in that, perhaps we should let it. Marjorie Prime is frustratingly ambivalent about that idea, tossing it around and wanly entertaining both sides of the argument before it ventures off into what perhaps interests Harrison more. With its tech conceit set aside, Marjorie Prime is mostly a story of trauma echoing through generations of a family, which is a quite common theme within the American theater canon.Marjorie Prime finds some lovely ways to till that old earth, but does nothing big or revolutionary enough to fill a Broadway house (small as the Hayes Theater might be). Only Nixon does the work of making the play seem urgent, worthy of its new high-profile positioning. Squibb is great with a wry one-liner, but she’s really only got that one level. We never feel the fear, the grief, the desperation that is meant to underscore Marjorie’s condition. Burstein, such a reliable musical-theater performer, is too broad for this small, quiet play. Lowell, meanwhile, doesn’t have much to do beyond being blandly charming.But Nixon scratches at the deeper thing roiling beneath Kauffman’s polite production, the howling bewilderment of it all. Nixon is a great and necessary counterbalance to the AI’s cold, placid approximation of personhood. No computer program, no matter how convincing, could ever sufficiently simulate the frenzied contradiction of a human being trying to comprehend their place in the fullness of time. Nixon, in her climactic scene, tears through all of the play’s mannered construction and shows us to ourselves. Let’s see a hologram try to do that. Or, better yet, let’s not give it that prompt at all.Explore more on these topicsBroadwayUS theaterCynthia NixonTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Tristan und Isolde, Tchaikovsky’s First Piano Concerto and Beethoven’s Ninth were all once declared beyond reach. But whenBarbara Hannigan– the fearless, seemingly limitless soprano with more than 100 world premieres to her name – admits that a work came close,reducing her to “a state of panic”over a multi-year study period, you believe her.Inspired by Finland’s national epic the Kalevala,John Zorn’s Jumalattaretis less a song-cycle than a musical seance, summoning a series of spirits and goddesses in sound. The singer morphs from persona to persona in yelps and keening cries, guttural moans and shouts, sometimes anchored, sometimes released by the piano (here Bertrand Chamayou) – an ever-present sorcerer’s assistant.On the page it sounds like a novelty, a circus-act for high-wire soloists, but in Hannigan’s delivery it was strange musical magic: lyrical, primal, ravishingly beautiful. Zorn’s 2012 score gathers up armfuls of musical history – folksongs and rock grooves, plainchant and jazz’s scat singing – before shattering them into glittering sonic fragments. The close conspiracy between Chamayou’s percussive piano and Hannigan’s freewheeling vocals made for exhilarating listening; you marvelled at sounds not feats, even if the latter were monumental.What do you programme alongside this kind of musical singularity? Messiaen’s 1938 Chants de Terre et de Ciel – the second of only three large-scale works by the composer for voice and piano – shares the spiritual ecstasy of the Zorn, answering its eternal feminine with the sternly masculine God of Catholicism. It’s home-territory for both Chamayou, whose piano seems to speak with French vowels, and Hannigan, who caressed Messiaen’s texts with almost indecent intimacy, rolling them around in her mouth, letting them move through her gently swaying body.Together they took the capacity crowd (who else could sell out this repertoire on a Saturday night, or hold them so rapt?) into their confidence, exposing the intimacy rather than the musical extremity of a cycle that celebrates the birth of the composer’s son. Hannigan’s uncanny ability to reinvent not just her sound but her physicality persisted here – now playful, chattering innocence for Danse du Bébé-Pilule, now infinitely tender in love-song Bail avec Mi. The long silence after the pealing finale Résurrection said more than the standing ovation that followed. Applause is for a performance; this was something closer to a confession.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

The originalTony Hawk’s Pro Skatertitles were anarchic, arcade fun while the recent return of EA’s belovedSkate franchiseoffered competent yet jarringly corporate realism. Skate Story, which is mostly the work of solo developer Sam Eng, offers a more impressionistic interpretation while capturing something of the sport’s essential spirit. It transposes the boarding action to a demonic underworld where the aesthetic is less fire and brimstone than glittering, 2010s-era vaporwave. It is also the most emotionally real a skateboarding game has ever felt.The premise is ingenious: you are a demon made out of “pain and glass”. Skate to the moon and swallow it, says the devil, and you shall be freed. So that is exactly what you do. You learn to ollie first, a “delicate, precise trick” according to the artfully written in-game text. Then come the pop shuvit, kickflip, heelflip and more.View image in fullscreenCaptures the spirit of skateboarding … Skate Story.Photograph: Devolver DigitalThe controls are easy: one button to ollie. If you’re holding down a shoulder button at the same time, you perform a more involved trick. Beyond the ravishing visuals, what’s most striking is the exquisite fluidity, the delicious “gamefeel”, of the actual skateboarding: the way the knees of this glittering demon bend just the right amount after landing a trick; the way you can see their foot stretching out across the top end of the board in order to apply just the right force that will cause it to flip.The vaporwave aesthetic is not Skate Story’s only bold design choice. You will fall many times on the ghoulish asphalt and when you do the action cuts to first-person, causing you to see the world tumbling for what feels like a tormenting eternity. Along the way, you meet a bizarre cast of characters: a mystical rabbit, a pigeon trying to type a screenplay, and a ghost hanging out in a launderette.View image in fullscreenReal emotions … Skate Story.Photograph: Devolver DigitalThe game’s action can be divided into two types: narrow, linear tunnels that you hurtle through at breakneck speed, and wide-open sandbox levels. The former are furious, momentum-filled thrill rides that demand utmost precision; the latter, set in nightmarish, nocturnal visions of New York, feature many offbeat objectives, such as chasing spooky laundry. In these levels, there is ample room to enjoy the deceptively deep skating mechanics.Gradually, a melancholy surfaces in this crystalline universe. Of course, the skateboarder wants to be free of the underworld, but they also seem enraptured by the idea of devouring these moons. As you thread together tricks with manuals and grinds, scoring ever-larger combos, all as a brilliantly downbeat electro soundtrack chimes away, questions arise. Why is this skateboarder so hungry? Why do they seek pain? In some ways, we’re reminded of the physical risks of skateboarding in real life.These questions – and the sadness buried within their answers – distinguish Skate Story from its traditionally zany video game counterparts. Rather, Eng’s gently emotive work is more in touch with the likes of acclaimed documentaryMinding the Gapand Jonah Hill’s movieMid90s.The result is a skateboarding game of rare poetry. There is the poetry of the skating itself, the miraculous interplay of body and board rendered with aplomb. There is the actual poetry that accompanies the end of each level. Finally, there are the tender emotions that refract through, and seem amplified by every bailed kickflip in this surreal, shimmering take on hell.Skate Story is out now, £17.99Explore more on these topicsGamesNintendo Switch 2PlayStation 5PCreviewsShareReuse this content"

Every street is alive with sparkling fairy lights and soft candlelight. There are thousands of tiny wooden figurines, train sets and toy animals displayed in shop windows, wooden pyramids taller than doorframes and colourful nutcracker characters. Forget elves in the north pole, this is the real Santa’s workshop. For hundreds of years, here in the village of Seiffen, wood turners and carvers have created classic wooden Christmas toys and sold them around the world.map showing SeiffenNear the border of the Czech Republic, Seiffen may be well known in the German-speaking world as the “home of Christmas”, but so far it has been largely missed by English-speaking seasonal tourists. Tucked away in the Ore Mountains, about an hour and a half south of Dresden, it is not the easiest place to get to by public transport – the nearest train station is in Olbernhau, nearly 7 miles (11km) away. Buses are available, but we opt for a hire car and make our way into the hills, arriving the day after the first snowfall of the year. The roads are cleared quickly, but snow clings to the branches of the spruce trees. We half expect to see the Gruffalo’s child, but only spot a rust-coloured fox making its way through a fresh field of snow.The surrounding forests we drive through are key to Seiffen’s survival. (The only reason we are here is a tipoff from a friendly German forester who said it was a must-see.) The Ore Mountains – Erzgebirge in German – were classified as a Unesco world heritage site in 2019 due to their rich history of mining. For 800 years, the area was shaped by intensive silver and tin mining (and later uranium).Every street is alive with sparkling fairy lights and there are thousands of tiny wooden  toys displayed in shop windowsSeiffen was built in the 1300s just below the mountain ridge and is surrounded by forests of spruce, pine and beech. Mining and forestry go hand in hand. Timber was essential for making pit props to hold up the roofs of mines, and for tool-making. So when the supply of tin dried up and the miners were forced to find an alternative way to make a living, they sourced the timber on their doorstep, modified their machinery and first made wooden bowls and spoons, before turning to what would make them famous – toys. One craftsman took his toys to a nearby Christmas market and came back with pockets full of coins, and the rest, as they say, is history. Families in every corner of the village began making small animals and figurines in their homes, with everyone pitching in to help carve and paint them.It is difficult to know where to start in a town full of twinkly lights and warm, inviting shops, but a trip to the toy museum (Erzgebirgisches Spielzeugmuseum, €9) makes sense. Open since 1936, it tells the story of Seiffen’s toy-making traditions. The short video is recommended as it is the only information supplied in English. Despite the language barrier, the 5,000 exhibits – ranging from nutcrackers to train sets, Noah’s arks to minuscule matchbook carvings (including the “smallest kitchen in the world”) – will, if you are into that kind of thing, keep you amazed for hours. There are even traditional wooden toys that little (or big) kids can play with. To this day, Seiffen continues its toy-making tradition and even played host to the European Toy Maker festival earlier this year.View image in fullscreenA traditional handcrafted wooden nutcracker.Photograph: Dpa Picture Alliance/AlamyTo experience the toy-making in action, we head to theSeiffener Volkskunstworkshop for the toy-decorating session we have booked. We walk through the shop, the tiny figurines and moving candle wheels stealing our attention, then past the viewing gallery of wood-turners and toy-painters. The way they turn the wood here is something special. In the 1800s, craftsmen created a method called hoop-turning, in which a specifically designed lathe turns a piece of wood into a thick ring shape with notches and grooves. When they slice it, the shape of the animal or toy is revealed. This enabled the mass production of figurines, contributing to the economic success of Seiffen throughout the 19th century. Currently, only a few people in the world still use this technique.For our decorations, I choose a Christmassy-looking toadstool to paint, my partner a characterful duck, plus we take home a forest house to build with the children. Our little decorations are made with wood from local birch, beech, maple and linden trees. We sit alongside the professional toy painters, who are painting nutcrackers and snowmen, a slow mindful feeling settling over us.View image in fullscreenSeiffen turned to wooden toy-making when the tin mines dried up.Photograph: AlamyOne decoration I am particularly drawn to is the candle arch, orschwibbogen. These beautifully crafted objects depict the history of the village, sometimes with the local church above and mining figures at work below. Heritage is important in Seiffen, and when the advent season starts each year, there is a miners’ parade, with costumes that would have been worn 400 years ago.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Some toymakers focus on nutcrackers, some on angels, some onRäuchermänner, incense-burning figures. The more modern artisans’ shops, such asWendt & Kühn, are fascinating to look around, with smartly decorated interiors, although the toys’ price tags reflect this. In fact, you could spend hundreds of euros in even the most down-to-earth places, with some pyramids costing more than €2,000.After a lunch of delicious leek soup called Heidi (€7.80) atHotel Seiffener Hof, we walk to the church, an unusual octagonal shape, which is depicted in so many of the archways and decorations they sell here, and listen a while as the organ is played.As the Christmas season sets in the sun drops early, so we try a shot ofheisseholunderbeere, hot elderberry served with vodka and a dollop of whipped cream on top, to warm us up. Then we take two cups of redglühweinon a walk up the hill and on to the historic miners’ trail. The snow is untrodden up here and it crunches underfoot as we make our way to the Binge, once the opencast mine used to extract tin, now an amphitheatre for the community. The wooden benches arranged in a semi-circle are white, and the only sound we hear today is the dripping of the melting snow.We climb further up the steps on to the hill made of the waste material left over from the mining years. Now there are birch trees thriving, and we look down over the valley as the lights of the houses click on.Before the temperature drops further, we enjoyrostbratwurst(grilled sausage) from a street seller and another mulled wine outside the centralHotel Erbgericht Buntes Haus. It is properly cold now. The shops are shutting and the paths are freezing, so we begin to walk back up the hill to our hotel, stopping every few minutes to look at the lights below. We are welcomed into thePanorama Berghotel Wettiner Höhe(rooms from €79), where we settle in for the night, well and truly ready for the Christmas season ahead.Explore more on these topicsGermany holidaysChristmas and New Year holidaysEurope holidaysToysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

However, there are also a few American ones that I hold on to staunchly: one is the pronunciation of “aluminum”, and another is the importance and beauty of a soft cookie. In both of these easy but delicious bakes to share, I use spice and heat to balance the usual sweetness with which the season can often overload us.Black pepper soft gingerbread cookiesPrep5 minChill1 hrCook50 min, plus coolingMakes10-12520g plain flour, plus extra for dusting8g cocoa powder8g ground ginger3g ground cloves5g ground cinnamon3g aleppo pepper4g coarsely ground black pepper7g table salt3gbicarbonate of soda225g soft unsalted butter175g caster sugar1 large egg(60g)77g treacle77g pomegranate molasses40g golden syrupFor the icing120g icing sugar30g waterWhisk the first nine ingredients in a bowl and set aside. Either in the bowl of a stand mixer or using a handheld mixer, beat the butter for a few minutes until light and creamy. Scrape down the bowl, add the sugar and mix for four minutes more, until properly whipped. Add the egg and mix in well, continuously scraping down the sides of the bowl to ensure everything is well combined. Add the treacle, molasses and golden syrup, and mix again.Add the dry mix, combining until a dough forms. Shape the dough into a rectangle, then wrap in clingfilm and refrigerate for an hour.Take the dough out of the fridge and let it sit for five to 10 minutes. Lightly dust the dough with flour, then roll it out so it’s roughly a third of an inch/1cm thick. Use cookie cutters to stamp out whatever shapes you fancy – gingerbread people, say, or you could even use a patterned roller. Re-roll any scraps and cut out some more.Transfer the cookies to a baking tray lined with baking paper, keeping them spaced at least 5cm apart. Bake at 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 for 11-13 minutes, until the edges are firm, and the cookies slightly darken, but still seem a little soft. Leave to sit for 10 minutes.Meanwhile, whisk the icing sugar and water to make a glaze. While the cookies are still warm, brush them with the glaze, then leave to set. The cookies will keep in an airtight container for a week.Ginger and pumpkin loaf with spiced lemon icingView image in fullscreenPrep5 minCook1 hr 10 minMakes1 x30cm loaf cake, to serve 7-10425g pumpkin puree375g soft dark brown sugar2 tsp vanilla extract275g vegetable oil250g eggs350g plain flour1 tbsp ground ginger1 tsp ground cinnamon1 tsp ground cardamom½ tsp mixed spice10gbicarbonate of soda8g baking powder10g table saltFor the spiced lemon icing250g icing sugar1 tsp ground cinnamon¼tsp ground turmericJuice of 1 lemonIn a medium bowl, whisk the pumpkin puree, brown sugar, vanilla and oil. Add the eggs and mix again until emulsified.In a second bowl, whisk the flour, spices, bicarb, baking powder and salt. Fold the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, being careful not to over-mix, because that will result in a tougher sponge – the batter doesn’t have to be totally smooth, but you don’t want any clumps of flour. Transfer to a 30cm loaf tin.Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4. Bake the loaf for 50-55 minutes, until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean; start checking from the 50-minute mark. Leave the loaf to coolcompletely in its tin before turning out.To make the spiced lemon icing, whisk the icing sugar, spices and just enough lemon juice to make a thick icing. Once the cake is cool, slather on the icing and leave to set. This will keep for five days once iced, or seven days uniced and wrapped.Adriann Ramirez is head of pastry atFinks, which has just opened Finks at Clissold House, London N16Explore more on these topicsChristmas food and drinkChristmas food giftsFoodChristmasCakeBakingDessertrecipesShareReuse this content"
