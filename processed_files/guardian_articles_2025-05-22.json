She may need a little respite care. From herself. Little more than 24 hours after one of her by now customary car-crash outings at prime minister’s questions in which she didn’t appear to have noticed that Keir Starmer had U-turned on the winter fuel allowance, KemiKaze was emailing Tory party members to tell them the exciting news. She had had the prime minister on the rack and it was only down to her that Labour had done their reverse ferret.Where do you even begin to start with this level of denial? Is it the assumption at Conservative party HQ that anyone left supporting the Tories must be technically brain dead so won’t have a clue what is going on? To be fair, that may not be a bad shout.But what does it say about party bosses that they are still trying to rewrite history a day later? Trying to make out this was Kemi’s finest hour. “Congrats, Kemi. I’ve got to hand it to you. You really nailed PMQs today. Keir Starmer didn’t know where to look.” It’s kind of embarrassing. Not least because Labour’s U-turn owed nothing to Kemi and the Tories. They are an irrelevance. It was the discontent amongLabourMPs and voters what swung it.As for Robert Jenrick, Kemi’s main rival for the leadership, he was making a rare appearance in the Commons – he never comes to PMQs to offer Kemi amoral support – to reply to the lord chancellor’s statement on the independent sentencing review (ISR) conducted by the former Tory justice secretary David Gauke. Someone you would have thought might attract cross-party support.Back in the day, Gauke was something of a Tory legend. Uncork the Gauke! As a Treasury minister during the early days of theBrexitnegotiations, he would often be sent out by the chancellor to field awkward urgent questions as the government got increasingly muddled. And Dave would do it with good grace. Never afraid to make an idiot of himself in pursuit of a higher goal.But somewhere along the way, during the time he was justice secretary, Gauke got fed up with being the fall guy. Decided that he couldn’t keep silent while some of the self-radicalised leavers in his own government cheerfully advocated a no-deal Brexit. So he spoke out and was kicked out of the party by Boris Johnson.That alone should have booked Dave a place among the pantheon of good guys. Only not for Honest Bob. For Jenrick, Gauke’s centrism marked him out as a wrong ’un. A cheese-eating surrender monkey. And Honest Bob had had enough of surrender this week after Labour’s EU deal that had undone a few nano particles of Boris’s Brexit agreement.So Jenrick was spitting blood. The government’s ISR was yet another betrayal in a long history of betrayal. Labour had gone soft on criminals. Why couldn’t ShabanaMahmood, the justice secretary, and Gauke have adopted the Texas model? There was a US state that knew how to execute crims. Even if they were innocent. Wait. What was that? Labour had used the Texas model? In which case, why not something more like Russia or Saudi Arabia. They took no prisoners. Or rather they did.Everything was wrong, said Honest Bob. Violent criminals were going to be running around on the street, raping women and slaughtering children. We needed to get offenders to build their own jails. Preferably underwater. All foreigners should be drowned at birth. He had always known Labour was soft on crime.Take Lord Timpson. A bleeding-heart liberal who believed in rehabilitation. It was time to lock people up for life on suspicion of not being English. Mostly, Honest Bob wanted politicians who had waved through a planning application from a party donor that had been turned down by the local authority to face the firing squad. Whoever could he have in mind?Tory Desmond Swayne rather agreed. He was worried that people weren’t serving enough of their sentences. It was time that criminals learned that a 20-year sentence actually meant 25. Otherwise, it was hard to guess which of his MPs he was trying to appeal to. Those like John Glen and Mark Pritchard have wised up that a kneejerk lurch to the right on every issue is not a good look. They were more or less behind the government’s review.As for Mahmood, she just told it as it was. The Tories had left the prison system on the verge of collapse. Had only built 500 new spaces in 14 years. Labour would do better. Was doing better. Had deported more foreigners than the Tories. But still something needed to give. Hence early release and better tagging. Especially for women. Chemical castration for some sex offenders. This went down very well with Mike Tapp. He is the Alan B’Stard of Labour’s 2024 intake. Draped in a flag, standing on the White Cliff and having it in for illegal immigrants. What’s not to love?That just left Kemi and the rest of the Tories to grumble about one further act of surrender. Not another one! For, after a 12-hour delay in the high court, the government’s Chagos deal was finally concluded. And even though most Conservative MPs had never been able to locate theChagos Islandson a map before they became newsworthy, they were adamant this was a capitulation of the highest order.Never mind that the Tory government had started the negotiations. Never mind that the international and UK courts had approved the deal. Never mind that all our allies had given the deal their blessing. Somehow the Tories – and presumably Nigel Farage, if he hadn’t been busy lying on a “sunbed” in France – knew best. As Starmer and John Healey were quick to point out in their hastily arranged press conference, it was Russia, China and Iran who were opposed to the deal. Whose side would you rather be on?Yeah but no but yeah but no but surrender, mumbled Kemi. Always surrender. A life lived in a permanent state of betrayal. Mainly a betrayal of her own intelligence. Recess can’t come soon enough.Explore more on these topicsKemi BadenochThe politics sketchConservativesBenefitsBrexitChagos IslandsUK criminal justiceFuel povertycommentShareReuse this content"

He has unmanaged anxiety, admits to being an alcoholic, is in a relationship of convenience with the mother of his child after deciding, whether unilaterally or mutually, that they cannot resolve their differences, and seemingly only notices the bad about his four-year-old son. His expectations of his son’s behaviour are unreasonable and his comments, in front of his son, about him are almost completely negative.I’ve tried to talk to him about getting treatment for his anxiety, which he has not done. He lives with his partner as he has constructed a narrative that he cannot afford not to do so, despite them now communicating through a shared calendar.The lack of sleep and relentless nature of parenting do not allow him the solitude and recovery time that he has always relied on to manage his anxiety (untreated and unassisted). He feels trapped and both his mental health and parenting have suffered as a result. It’s not clear that he has taken any positive or productive steps to improve the situation, which has worsened over the past year. I now feel angry and so disappointed with how he behaves toward his lovely boy. How can I help him?I love my kids but I regret having them. How can I accept my life as a parent? | Leading questionsRead moreEleanor says:It sounds like your friend’s in that space where they know there’s a problem but for some reason don’t change it. What’s missing isn’t knowledge but engagement.If I’m hearing you correctly, he wouldn’t be surprised by a lot of what you’ve said: his anxiety spills into how he treats his son, long-term he might be happier living apart from his co-parent. That can be a very poignant place to get stuck: in some sense we know things are dire but that just becomes part of the wallpaper, we go limp.What usually stands in the way of engaging with known problems? Maybe it’s not having a sense for quite how bad things are. Maybe he knows he drinks too much and is sharp with his kid, but doesn’t know if he’s an outlier. Maybe, so far as he knows, many people’s lives look like this.Or maybe he thinks the problem will pass with time. Maybe “it’s just been a hectic little while”. Maybe he’s holding on for some imagined time around the corner when things settle down of their own accord. “It’s just for now” is a powerful trap.Or maybe he just doesn’t know how to change it. Sometimes, it can be so hard to acknowledge where life has taken us that we plug our ears and go “la-la-la” about the problem. Maybe he can’t face the full impact of how far he’s gone from where he hoped to be.Until he (or you) knows what stands in the way of acting on the problems he already knows about, fresh reminders – “I’m mean to my son”, “I’m not handling my anxiety” – won’t join the issue with the actual question. The question is:Why isn’t knowing about these problems enough to change them?I don’t know whether you should try once more to say something directly. It sounds like you’ve tried to talk about his anxiety, but were rebuffed. And those kinds of conversations come with a big social cost – nobody likes to feel judged. But I do think thatifyou say something, you should really say it. It’s easy to look for ways of half-confronting someone; to hope that the odd remark here or raised eyebrow there will somehow get the message across while letting us pretend we didn’t send it. We think we can raise the problem without paying the social cost. This is a false hope. It is just as annoying to have someone drip-feed mini criticisms as it is to have them sit you down and tell you what they think. If you’re going to pay the cost either way, you might as well do it in a way that requires a response – like with questions that require answers – not just with small signals you hope he’ll decode.Our neighbours never return my son’s ball when it goes over the hedge. How can I get it back without conflict? | Leading questionsRead moreIf you decide not to say anything directly, another strategy might be to help the boy (and even his mum). A shared glance, a routine activity, a safe place for a biscuit or a natter – any way of modelling positive relationships and the possibility that life could be a bit nicer.

What’s it like being directed byPaul Greengrasswith his fast-cut, handheld camera, reportage style? Do you have to approach your acting in a different way?HighPriest1967Paul is an extraordinary director, a visionary director, and I absorbed so much by watching him work. He comes from documentary, so even though he was filming these elaborate, very expensive, complicated action sequences, he was still able to see things happening spontaneously. I remember when we were shooting The Bourne Ultimatum in Tangier, running through those windy streets. Normally as an actor, you turn a corner and you think you’re off camera, so you’d stop. But you could never do that with Paul because there might be a camera around the corner. He always liked to keep us on our toes.View image in fullscreen‘Different energy’ … with Michael Gross in Chosen Family, 2024.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyYou stole the show asHeather Graham’s sister in Chosen Family. Is it easier to approach comedic, unpredictable roles as opposed to more intense, serious, Bourne-like performances?BicuserI absolutely love working on comedies. People don’t normally think of me as a comedic actress, but when they do, I really appreciate it. It’s such a different energy, trying to get other people to laugh. Working with Heather Graham was great. I’ve just finished shooting a Christmas comedy, Unbearable Christmas, with a lot of improv comedians, and had to keep up in terms of ad-libbing lines. It was the most fun I’ve ever had.Have you ever considered being in a superhero film? What hero appeals to you the most?nailsthatglowI wouldn’t mind playing a villain. I think Mike Myers said that the villain is the hero of his own story. I would find a nerdy acting way to make my villain especially villainous.The hip-hop dance montages in Save the Last Dance were an absolute hook, but the emotional breakthrough scene about the loss of your mother was so powerful. Did you have to dig deep to convey the grief and trauma?MissMuftyThankfully, no, I did not have to draw from personal things. What is beautiful about the setup of that movie, with her mother dying in a car crash, is that it touches on something fundamentally sad and tragic for any human being. So my imagination took over. It was such a wonderful opportunity to do formal dance training. I’d taken ballet, modern dance, jazz and tap classes as a teenager, but never that intensely. I put a lot of pressure on myself, but it was such a great opportunity to dance for six hours a day. I think I got the job because I was better at hip-hop than ballet.View image in fullscreenA break from dancing six hours a day … Stiles as Sara and Sean Patrick Thomas as Derek in Save the Last Dance, 2001.Photograph: Entertainment Pictures/AlamyYou once said you always wanted to be Madonna in Desperately Seeking Susan. Do you still?MrSOBaldrickWhat I responded to about that character was her free-spiritedness. She just didn’t care, and she was so playful. But I think her grifter loneliness is not for me any more.You committed to studying Englishliterature when your career was flying, which is hugely impressive. What did your studies do for you the most?SidKupI was an English major. The joke is that English majors are just reading books, writing essays, and what are you really being trained for? But what I was learning was storytelling. When I finally got to direct my own movie, Wish You Were Here, a lot of what I had learned in terms of classical storytelling, act structure and character development came in handy.Did you seek out advice from other directors?Sagarmatha1953I did. I called Doug Liman, who directed The Bourne Identity. I was lamenting my budget constraints and he gave me advice that I will take with me for ever: when they start giving you more money, they start telling you what to do. I sent Rodrigo García [who directed Stiles in web series Blue] my director’s cut and asked for notes. I also sent it toSusan Seidelman, who directed Desperately Seeking Susan, who I do not know personally, but I’m getting bolder in my old age. She wrote me really extensive, thoughtful notes. I thought that was really lovely, because she didn’t have to take the time to do that.Do you regret breaking up withDexter?Shauny79Well, I didn’t break up with Dexter. Lumen, my character, broke up with Dexter. I remember the writer saying: she’s now been freed of the darkness. It was a beautiful relationship because he helped heal her from trauma. But she didn’t need to be on the dark side any more. She could go back into the light.View image in fullscreen‘Beautiful relationship’ … Stiles as Lumen and Michael C Hall as the eponymous Dexter, 2010.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyWhich meal/dish from New York do you miss when away?RobHughes84I used to be a really good cook. I have three kids now, so I’m really good with things like chicken nuggets. I always miss New York City pizza. That’s one of the first things I want to eat when I come back. If I go to another country, particularly in Europe or even parts of the US, I will taste-test their pizza to see how it compares to New York City pizza. There’s something about a local slice that you really can’t beat. Do I like British food? I love a good Sunday roast. I remember working in London on a play for many, many months. It was a two-hander, so there weren’t a lot of other people to hang out with. But on the weekends, the producers would host a Sunday roast, so it was always something to look forward to.Have you ever considered opening a tile shop, called Julia’s Tiles?Danko1981No, I have not.I don’t think I’ve been so entertained by a TV show with such an insane plot line as Riviera. Did it make sense to you, or did you just do the role to spendsummers in the French Riviera and Venice?brianofbritainI loved making that series. I think we really hit our stride in the third season. I would be lying if I said I didn’t … of course, filming in Venice and the south of France was hugely appealing. But I couldn’t go to work every day if I wasn’t interested in the character and the story I was telling.View image in fullscreen‘Am I going to be in the sequels?’ … Heath Ledger as Patrick and Stiles as Kat in 10 Things I Hate About You, 1999.Photograph: Touchstone Pictures/AllstarCan you still remember Kat’s sonnet from the end of 10 Things I Hate About You [as quoted by Drake in his feud with Kendrick Lamar]?RDMillerOh, I don’t think I could remember the whole thing. I’ve had to clear out space in my brain for 25 years of other monologues. Let’s see … “I hate the way you talk to me. I hate it when you stare … something, something, something … I hate your big dumb combat boots and the fact that you read my mind … something, something, something. But mostly I hate the way I don’t hate you, not even a little bit, not even at all.” That’s the heartbreaking part of it. She’s like: I reallylikeyou. Am I going to be in the sequels?

Now that Gaza is flattened, turned into mass graves and rubble, people who have kept quiet for the past 19 months areslowly starting to speak up. Now that Israel and the US are not even trying to pretend that they aren’t intent on emptying Gaza andthe West Bankof Palestinians, of “taking control” of all of the land, some criticism has started to trickle in.Over in the UK, they’ve pulled out the “e” word. After 19 months of genocidal violence and almost three months of astarvation campaignthe UK has decided to describe the situation asegregious.The UK, along with France and Canada, has threatened – and I’m sure Israel’s leaders are quaking in their boots over this – that there might be a “concrete” response if the mass killing and starvation continues.Meanwhile, there’s been a slight shift in the media coverage. Instead of just parroting the Israeli government’s talking points,major media figures such as Piers Morganare starting to challenge Israeli spokespeople about why the international media has not been freely allowed into Gaza to see what is happening for themselves.All of this is too little, too late. It will not bring back littleHind Rajab, a five-year-old girl who was killed when 335 bullets were fired by Israeli soldiers into the car the terrified child was trapped in. Or the aid workers executed by Israel and buried in shallow graves.It will not rebuild the hospitals, kindergartens,IVF centersand universities that have been systematically levelled by Israel. It will not give kids in Gaza – thelargest cohortof child amputees in the world – their limbs back. It will not fix the long-term damage that malnutrition and almost two years of no schooling has done to a generation.The criticism we are seeing now is simply an exercise in ass-covering. Performative opposition, so that in the future, when the true scale of the slaughter inGazais clear, the politicians and media figures responsible for enabling and justifying this horror for 19 months can say: “Look! I said something! I didn’t just stand by!”And what will you say? When future generations read about Gaza with horror and wonder how the western world, with all its moral superiority, itsrule-based orderand its focus on international human rights law, allowed a livestreamed genocide to happen, what will you say? When future generations learn that, for 19 months, we woke up every morning to videos of children being burned alive – bombed with weapons that the US taxpayer helped pay for and the western world helped justify – will you be able to say that you spoke up?If you have stayed quiet until now, telling yourself that all this is just far too complicated for you to speak up about, it is not too late to raise your voiceA lot of ordinary people will be able to hold their head up high and say they were not silent; that they use whatever platforms or privilege they had.Logan Rozos, an NYU student who had his diploma withheld because he used his commencement speech to recognize “the atrocities currently happening inPalestine”, will be able to say he wasn’t quiet. The studentsexpelledfrom Columbia University for protesting will be able to say they put their futures on the line in the name of justice. Actors like Melissa Barrera, who wasfired from Scream 7over her pro-Palestine posts, will be able to say that she prioritized integrity over her career.The people with real power, however, will not be able to say the same; they will not be able to wash the blood from their hands. It seems likely that all this horror will eventually be pinned on Benjamin Netanyahu while others try to absolve themselves of blame. But this isn’t just Netanyahu’s genocide. This is the Biden-Harris genocide; the Trump-Vance genocide; the Keir Starmer and David Lammy genocide. It is Microsoft CEOSatya Nadella’sgenocide. This is the mainstream media’s genocide. The list goes on.We would not be where we are today were it not for the systematic dehumanization of Palestinians by the western media and the suppression of pro-Palestinian speech. We would not be here if western reporters and Joe Biden hadn’t manufactured consent for the genocide by repeating the incendiary lie that Hamas hadbeheaded babies. We would not be here if the Biden administration had actually worked towards a ceasefire instead oflying about their effortsand giving Israelcarte blancheto do whatever it liked. Eventually history will judge all these people.But perhaps that is wishful thinking. Perhaps I am being naive in thinking that, even if all the Palestinians are sent off to exile inLibyaand Gaza is turned into a Trump-branded resort, there will ever be a reckoning. After all, how many Americans or Europeans really know about theNakba? How many people know about Israel’s “Cast Thy Bread” operation in 1948 where the drinking water in Palestinian villages was poisoned? How many Americans know aboutRachel Corrie, the young non-violent activist from Washington who was killed by an Israeli bulldozer while she tried to save Palestinian homes in Gaza from destruction in 2003?The Guardian view on the calls to save Gaza: Palestinians need deeds, not words | EditorialRead moreEver since the Nakba, Palestinian voices have been actively suppressed and Israeli atrocities have been minimized. (One Palestinian writer I know had a piece about mapping in Palestine pulled from a very prestigious US magazine several years ago after they refused to remove discussion of the Nakba.) You will have heard of every atrocity committed by a Palestinian, however. You will have been told over and over again that all this started on 7 October 2023.It is too late for real justice in Gaza now. We can never bring back the dead children. We can’t erase what has happened. But it is not too late for accountability. The atrocities must be documented. The dead in Gaza must be properly counted so we know how many people have been murdered. The media must stop parroting the official death figure of more than 55,000 people being dead without putting this into context and noting that when you account for indirect deaths from starvation, disease, or cold, the real number of deaths is probablyenormously higher.If you have stayed quiet until now, telling yourself that all this is just far too complicated for you to speak up about, it is not too late to raise your voice. What is happening in Gaza is different from the horrors happening in Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo because, if you are in the west,it is happening in your name.It is happening with your tax money and with the help of your leaders. If you are in the US, your elected representatives have delivered astanding ovationfor this genocide. We are all complicit. Although some of us are far more complicit than others.So, again, think about what you want to say to future generations when they ask what you did at this very moment. Silence is not neutrality. And your silence will not be forgotten.

After starring as Jack Ryan on TV, he now plays Luke Purdue, an Indiana Jones knock-off and son of an adventurer-archaeologist (named Harrison, no less) in Guy Ritchie’s soulless business-class yarn. Despite plucky work fromNatalie Portmanas Luke’s disapproving sister Charlotte, this hodgepodge of plundered elements adds up to nothing more than Indiana Bourne and the Thomas Crown Da Vinci Code.Bankrolled by dying billionaire Owen Carver (Domhnall Gleeson), Luke and his dad’s old team are on the trail of themythical Fountain of Youth. He even has a PowerPoint presentation to show how he intends to find it: hidden on the backs of six paintings by artists such as Caravaggio and El Greco are clues which will lead to this fabled source of immortality. Charlotte cautions against the whole enterprise but is soon whisked along, apparently persuaded by her brother’s bumper-sticker slogans (“Life is about adventure!”). It’s almost as if she can’t see that he is an obnoxious bully, chiding her for her life choices, puckering up creepily for kisses from Esme (Eiza González) who is trying to prevent him from finding the fountain, and given to knocking women unconscious with a disabling spray. Nice.Amid interminable chases and fisticuffs, and tourist-board jaunts to Bangkok, Vienna and Cairo, there is the odd bright spot. Gleeson enjoys himself more as his character’s motives become murkier, even if he is forced to play a restaurant comedy scene that makes no sense in terms of characterisation. As a police inspector on the adventurers’ trail, Arian Moayed gets one nice moment: visibly touched that Charlotte has noticed he is wearing houndstooth, he says: “It’s wasted on most suspects.” The gag is only slightly tainted by the fact that it’s a callback to Ritchie’s Sherlock Holmes films.A movie as derivative and uninspired as this will always be surplus to requirements so long as the first three Indiana Jones movies remain in circulation. As the family name Purdue suggests, Luke and Charlotte’s father believed that some things should remain lost. Would that this had been the fate of the film.Fountain of Youth is on Apple TV+ from 23 May.Explore more on these topicsFilmAction and adventure filmsThrillersGuy RitchieNatalie PortmanDomhnall GleesonreviewsShareReuse this content"

The largest union said it planned to take the first step towards possible industrial action.The decision to award 1.4 million NHS staff including nurses, midwives and ambulance workersa smaller rise – 3.6% –also provoked criticism. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) said it was “grotesque” to hand doctors a bigger increase than nurses who earned less than them.Wes Streeting, the health secretary, and Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, sought to promote the rises by highlighting that they represented the second time public sector personnel had received above-inflation pay rises since Labour took power last July.Inflation rose sharply from 2.6% in March to 3.5% in April – the highest level since January 2024.The pay rises are bigger than the 2.8% ministers had previously maintained was the most they could afford for 2025-26. They are broadly the amounts recommended by the independent public sector pay review bodies.But the British Medical Association (BMA) said increases of 4% for consultants, GPs, specialists and speciality doctors and 4% plus £750 for resident doctors (formerly known as junior doctors) were “woefully inadequate” and showed ministers’ “lack of commitment to restoring doctors’ lost pay”.Chart showing changes of pay of different public sector jobs compared with the private sector since 2010The BMA told Streeting he needed to open talks and explain how he would end the significant erosion in the real-terms value of salaries that doctors had experienced since 2010. “The health secretary can avert strike action by negotiating with us and agreeing a route to full pay restoration,” said Prof Philip Banfield, the union’s chair of council.The 4% plus £750 deal offered to the BMA’s estimated 55,000 resident doctor members was inadequate because it did too little to reverse historic pay erosion, the union added. The BMA recently initiated a ballot of resident doctors on their willingness to strike for better pay, even before they received details of the offer.Sources close to Streeting pointed out that resident doctors’ leaders had recently said 5% was the minimum rise for this year they would find acceptable, but were rejecting one that equated to a 5.4% rise. He was frustrated that they were “moving the goalposts” with their public comments, they said.The Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association said the 4% for consultants was “a real-terms pay cut for senior doctors compared to inflation”. It will hold a consultative ballot to assess its members’ readiness to take industrial action over their salaries, as will the RCN and GMB unions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As things stand schools in England will have to find £400m of savings from their existing budgets, with Phillipson providing £615m extra to cover the bulk of the cost.Luke Sibieta, a research fellow at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the £400m equated to about 1% of schools’ budgets. “This is a bit less than was assumed a few months ago in the government’s proposals to the pay review body, which will probably come as a slight relief to schools,” he added.Daniel Kebede, the NEU’s general secretary, said in many schools the 1% would result in “cuts in service provision to children and young people, job losses, and additional workloads for an already overstretched profession”. He said: “Unless the government commits to fully funding the pay rise then it is likely the NEU will register a dispute with the government on the issue of funding, and campaign to ensure every parent understands the impact of a cut in the money available to schools, and that every politician understands this too.”Phillipson defended forcing schools to part-fund the award, saying the government was “taking tough decisions” on spending and value for money. “School leaders must meet the challenge too. That’s why we are asking schools to fund the first 1% of the pay rise through improved productivity and smarter spending,” she said. “We know this is achievable. There are schools already driving down their costs and making the savings needed.”Pepe Di’Iasio, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, welcomed the 4% increase and that the award had been announced earlier than in previous years, but he also criticised the failure to fund it. “If the government really thinks it will be possible to bridge this funding gap through ‘improved productivity and smarter spending’ then it is mistaken.Schoolshave already spent many years cutting costs to the bone and beyond,” he said.Explore more on these topicsPublic sector payNHSIndustrial actionTrade unionsPublic services policyHealthTeachingnewsShareReuse this content"

Because there’s nothing in that judgment that says that you can’t have gender neutral loos, as we have here in this festival.” She applauded the fact that Charleston’s organisers went ahead with that decision “despite the fact that there are people saying that you can’t do that”.The judgment “says nothing about that”, she added. “It’s for other people to work out the other parts of the Equality Act, which permit but do not require services to be provided differently for people according to sex.”The 80-year-old, who is a member of the House of Lords, also questioned what was meant by “biological sex”.“I was with some doctors last week who said there is no such thing as biological sex,” she said. “There are plenty of things to quarrel with” about the judgment, but Hale said her main concern was the “very binary reaction that there has been to it”.The “proper answer to all of this”, she believed, was “somewhere in the middle. So that’s what I very much hope we will come out with when people have calmed down and start being sensible about things.”Hale’s fellow panellist, her daughter Julia Hoggett, the CEO of the London Stock Exchange, said: “And it’s the duty of society to foster that conversation now.”Hale said: “Yes, it’s on all of us to foster it.”-Hoggett, the first out gay person to be employed in her role, has previously spoken about the importance of LGBT+ representation in the workplace. When asked by an audience member whether trans women should count towards gender quotas on company boards, she said: “The idea that the trigger for all of this case was whether trans women should represent women in the representation of women on boards, I find heartbreaking.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Much was made of the fact that she was wearinga brooch in the shape of a spider, with some speculating that the fashion choice was in reference to a song by The Who called Boris the Spider, who comes to a sticky end.“The spider brooch was a mistake,” she told the Charleston audience, had she known the attention it would attract, she “would have worn a frog”. She had not heard Boris the Spider until a friend sent hera YouTube videothe day after the judgment – she found it to be “not a very tuneful song” – but if she had known about its existence she would not have worn the brooch, “because that was not the object of the exercise”.Hale said: “The object of the exercise was to uphold constitutional principle and the rule of law, and to say to the government there are things you cannot do.

They said the event sold out in 90 seconds, with 2,000 people on the waiting list.Ó hAnnaidh arrived on stage at 9pm with tape over his mouth.He said: “There’s a reason where what’s happened to me, happened before Glastonbury. There’s a reason they’re trying to fucking stop me speaking at Glastonbury in front of the UK.”Naoise Ó Cairealláin, 30, who performs under the name Móglaí Bap, said: “This is our first gig back after [Coachella]. They want to stop what we’re doing, because they want us to stop protesting.”“There’s 60,000 plus dead in Gaza right now. That’s the real story, it’s not about us,” he added.During their Coachella set on 18 April, the band led the crowd in chants of “free, free Palestine” and displayed various messages on the stage’s screens including: “Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people.”Ó hAnnaidh said on Thursday: “The reason that we are being witch-hunted here is because we at Coachella spoke about this about the genocide.“We’re not the fucking story here, they’re using us as a scapegoat not to talk about the real fucking issue.”The poster for Thursday’s surprise concert featured a recent quote from the former Sex Pistols frontman John Lydon, who said the trio “need a bloody good kneecapping” in response to the controversy around them.Last month, counter-terrorism police assessed footage of the band from November 2023 which appeared to show one person of them saying: “The only good Tory is a dead Tory. Kill your local MP.”Brendan Cox, the husband of MP Jo Cox, and Katie Amess, the daughter of MP David Amess, who were both murdered, criticised the trio’s comments.In a statement, the band said: “To the Amess and Cox families, we send our heartfelt apologies, we never intended to cause you hurt,” adding that the clip had been taking out of context.The band has been removed from several festival lineups, including scheduled German appearances at Hurricane festival and Southside festival.They were also axed from the Eden Project in Cornwall and Plymouth Pavilions.MPs have continued to call for them to be removed from the line-ups of TRNSMT, Glastonbury and other upcoming events. However, there were no announcements of further cancellations after the news of Ó hAnnaidh being charged.The group from Belfast, who rap in the Irish language, have a headline slot at Wide Awake Festival in Brockwell Park, south London, on Friday night.The band said they would vehemently contest what they called a politically motivated charge in a statement before the concert.“A charge not serious enough to even warrant their crown court, instead a court that doesn’t have a jury. What’s the objective? To restrict our ability to travel. To prevent us speaking to young people across the world. To silence voices of compassion. To prosecute artists who dare speak out.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

According to the filing, the suspect told police after his arrest: “I did it for Palestine, I did it for Gaza.”Speaking at a news conference on Thursday afternoon, Jeanine Pirro, the interim US attorney for Washington, described the slate of charges against the defendant – which also include two counts of first-degree murder, causing the death of a person through the use of a firearm, discharge of a firearm during a crime of violence – as an “initial” list of crimes. The killing, she said, was also being investigated as a “hate crime and a crime of terrorism”.“We will add additional charges as the evidence warrants,” she said.Washington DC shooting of Israeli embassy staff: what we know so farRead moreRodriguez made his first court appearance on Thursday afternoon, hours after federal agents intactical geardescended on his Chicago apartment. According to apost on Xfrom the FBI’s Washington field office, agents in Chicago were “conducting court-authorized law enforcement activity” that it said was “in relation to yesterday’s tragic shooting in Washington, DC”.The FBI director, Kash Patel,described the slayingas an “act of terror” and “targeted anti-Semitic violence”. The US attorney general, Pam Bondi, said: “We are doing everything we can to protect our entire community, and especially our Jewish community right now.”At Rodriguez’s arraignment in federal court on Thursday, magistrate judge Matthew Sharbaugh told the defendant that he faced the possibility of the death penalty as punishment if found guilty of the crimes he is charged with. Pirro said it was “far too early” to say whether prosecutors would seek capital punishment but added that it was a “death penalty-eligible case”.At the White House, the press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said Donald Trump was “saddened and outraged” by the deadly act and vowed that the US Department of Justice “will be prosecuting the perpetrator of this to the full extent of the law”. She said Trump spoke with Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday.The killings occurred shortly after 9pm on Wednesday evening, outside the Capital Jewish Museum, where, according to officials, a gunman approached a group leaving an event hosted by the American Jewish Committee and opened fire at close range.The victims, identified as Yaron Lischinsky, who grew up in Germany andIsrael, and Sarah Milgrim, a US citizen from Kansas, were a young couple about to be engaged, according to Yechiel Leiter, the Israeli ambassador to the US. Leiter told reporters Lischinsky had “purchased a ring this week with the intention of proposing to his girlfriend next week in Jerusalem”.View image in fullscreenVisitors lay flowers and light candles at a memorial service in front of the Israeli embassy in Berlin, Germany, on Thursday.Photograph: Bernd von Jutrczenka/APThe suspect was observed pacing outside the museum before the shooting, the Metropolitan police chief, Pamela Smith, said. After opening fire, he walked into the museum, was detained by event security and began to chant, “Free, free Palestine,” she said.Officials have said the suspect was not on any security watchlists and there were no heightened security threats before the shooting. The firearm believed to be used in the killings was retrieved, officials said. The New York Timesreportedthat the gun had been purchased lawfully in Illinois and had been transported legally to Washington DC.Asked at Thursday’s press conference whether the suspect targeted the event or the individuals, Steve Jensen, the assistant director in charge of the FBI’s Washington field office, replied: “We’re not saying at this time.” He said law enforcement officers were still investigating the circumstances of the suspect’s travel to DC, which they believe was work-related, as well as how the alleged gunman learned the location of the event at the museum on Wednesday night, which was private and not publicized.The FBI deputy director, Dan Bongino, said the suspect was interviewed by authorities within hours of being taken into custody. Officials were aware of “certain writings” possibly authored by the suspect that have been circulated online, he wrote in a post on X, adding: “We hope to have updates as to the authenticity very soon.”The flags at Israeli diplomatic missions around the world wereloweredto half mast, and Netanyahu ordered security to be stepped up following what hecalled“the horrifying antisemitic murder”.The attack comes asIsrael expanded its ground offensive in Gaza, and faces growing international pressure, including from the US, to end its nearly three-month long blockade of food, medicine and other supplies that humanitarian groups say has pushed the enclave to the brink of famine.“When antisemitism is normalized, that’s where we start to see the real danger that results in the violence we saw last night,” Ted Deutch, a former Florida congressman and the chief executive of the American Jewish Committee, which had put on the reception for young diplomats on Wednesday night, said in an interview on MSNBC.In a social media post early on Thursday, Trump wrote: “These horrible DC killings, based obviously on antisemitism, must end, NOW! Hatred and Radicalism have no place in the USA.”Gideon Sa’ar, the Israeli foreign minister, blamed critics of the Israeli government, including the “leaders and officials of many countries and international organizations, especially from Europe” for inciting violence and hatred against his country since the Israel-Hamas war began on 7 October 2023.France on Thursday denounced Sa’ar’s comments as “unjustified” and “outrageous”. “France has condemned, France condemns and France will continue to condemn, always and unequivocally, any act of antisemitism,” the foreign ministry spokesperson, Christophe Lemoine, said.International criticism of Israel over the Gaza war has risen in recent weeks. On Tuesday, in an unprecedented, joint statement with Canada and the UK, France condemned “the appalling language” of members of Netanyahu’s government, and the “outrageous actions” and the “intolerable level of suffering” of civilians.The Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair) condemned the deadly attack as “completely unacceptable” and said that political violence “only undermines the pursuit of justice”.Washington DC shooting of Israeli embassy staff: what we know so farRead moreTributes poured in for the victims of the attack from the US and overseas as those who knew Lischinsky and Milgrim described the couple as “bright” and “talented”.Lischinsky, 30, who worked as a research assistant in the political department of the Israeli embassy in Washington, was born in Nuremberg, according to the Israeli ambassador to Germany, Ron Prosor. “He was a Christian, a true lover of Israel, served in the IDF, and chose to dedicate his life to the State of Israel and the Zionist cause,” hewroteon X.Milgrim, 26, an American from Kansas, organized trips to Israel, according to a spokesperson for the Israeli foreign ministry, officials said. She was also a volunteer with Tech2Peace, an advocacy group training young Palestinians and Israelis and promoting dialogue between them, according to the organization.KU Hillel, a Jewish student organization at her alma mater, the University of Kansas, described Milgrim as a “bright spirit” whose “passion for the Jewish community touched everyone fortunate enough to know her”.Lischinsky was preparing to propose to Milgrim when they traveled to Jerusalem next week to meet his family, according to officials. Lischinsky had purchased an engagement ring, which Miligram’s family only learned of only after the shooting.“The ironic part is that we were worried for our daughter’s safety in Israel,” her father, Robert Milgrim, told the New York Times in an interview. “But she was murdered three days before going.”Explore more on these topicsWashington DCUS crimeGun crimeIsraelAntisemitismUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The statement did not mention China, but “nonmarket policies” typically refer to that country’s export subsidies and currency policies that the Trump administration says give it an advantage in international trade.The high-profile gathering of officials from the US, Canada, the UK, Japan, Germany, France and Italy appeared to be more congenial thanan earlier meeting of G7 foreign ministers in March. That meeting, also in Canada, occurred as Donald Trump was in the middle of threatening stiff tariffs on Canada andsuggestingit could become the 51st state.US treasury secretary Scott Bessent told AFP: “I don’t think there were any major disagreements, I thought the meeting went great.”German finance minister Lars Klingbeil told reporters it was crucial to “resolve the current trade disputes as quickly as possible,” as tariffs had placed “a heavy burden on the global economy”.“Our hand is extended,” Klingbeil added.French finance minister Eric Lombard said: “The atmosphere was warm … We don’t agree on everything, but we talked about everything.”The G7 statement did not mention the US tariffs, which have disrupted global trade and supply chains and added economic uncertainty.Champagne downplayed the lack of communique language on tariffs, but said ministers “were not skating around” the issue and discussed the effects during the meeting.Canadais seeking a deal to eliminate Trump’s 25% tariffs on many goods, including steel and aluminium.“We’re trying to enhance growth and stability. And obviously tariffs are something in that context that you can’t avoid discussing,” Champagne said.The Chinese embassy in Ottawa said it could not immediately comment on the G7 statement.The G7 finance chiefs also condemned what they called Russia’s “continued brutal war” against Ukraine and said that if efforts to achieve a ceasefire failed, they would explore all possible options, including “further ramping up sanctions.”The description of the Ukraine war was watered down from the prior G7 statement issued in October, before Trump’s re-election, calling it an “illegal, unjustifiable, and unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine”.Trump has diminished US support for Ukraine and has made statements suggesting that Kyiv was to blame for the conflict as he tries to coax Russia into peace talks.Diplomatic efforts to end the conflict have accelerated in recent weeks, with Russian and Ukrainian officials holding their first face-to-face talks in more than three years last week in Istanbul.But the Kremlin said on Thursday that new peace talks with Ukraine had “yet to be agreed,” disputing reports the two nations would soon hold negotiations at the Vatican.The finance meeting sets the stage for a G7 leaders summit June 15-17 in the nearby mountain resort area of Kananaskis. Trump will attend the summit, the White House confirmed on Thursday.Reuters, Agence France-Presse and Associated Press contributed to this articleExplore more on these topicsG7ChinaInternational tradeGlobal economyCanadaJapanGermanynewsShareReuse this content"

A lawyer specialising in sexual abuse cases questioned whether it would even work.Prof Don Grubin, who worked on the 2007 pilot in HMP Whatton in Nottinghamshire to medically manage sexual offenders who volunteered for treatment, said: “Doctors are not agents of social control. It would be ethically unsound to use medication to reduce risk rather than to treat a health indication.”Grubin, a criminal psychiatrist and emeritus professor of forensic psychiatry who has researched male sexual offenders for years, said he and others in the field would refuse to work on a mandatory programme.He said: “The problem with prescribing medication on a mandatory basis is that doctor’s role is to treat patients with their consent, not without it – particularly when medications can have significant side effects.”Grubin said mandating medical intervention would not be ethical because sex offenders were not mentally ill. “They have capacity to make their own choices and these choices include whether or not to take medication,” he said. “It also includes choices about whether or not they want to manage their own behaviour.“Most offenders don’t want to go back to prison, and they don’t want to go out and offend. So most will voluntarily participate in programmes that are going to reduce the chances of either of those things happening.”Prof Belinda Winder said making medication compulsory could make it more likely that sex offenders would commit other crimes. “I would be very worried if the government made it compulsory,” said Winder, who has more than 15 years of experience working on reducing reoffending of sex offenders, supporting rehabilitation and promoting ethical and evidence-based practices within the criminal justice system.“If offenders are being coerced and forced, you’re just pushing the problem somewhere else,” she said. “You might reduce the sexual urges but you’ve perhaps increased their hostility, aggression and sense of having a grievance.”The administration of medications suppressing libido and sexual activity is legal in several US states, where it is often used as a condition of parole or early release. Voluntary in most states, it was made a mandatory condition of parole in 2019 in Alabama for certain offenders.Other countries mandate the intervention for certain sexual offenders, usually repeat child sex offenders. In Moldovia, however, compulsory intervention was revoked after a year when its constitutional court ruled it violated fundamental human rights.Dr Adarsh Kaul, a consultant forensic psychiatrist and clinical director at Nottinghamshire healthcare NHS trust, has more than two decades of experience in managing sexual offenders, particularly through pharmacological interventions. He also said he would not work with patients who had been coerced, saying that far from being a “one size fits all” solution, medical intervention was only appropriate and effective for about a third of sex offenders.“The only people I will work with are those in prison for whom therapy has, or is likely to, fail,” he said. “But if a patient shows any indication that he is being forced to take these drugs, then I won’t prescribe them because it’s a medical treatment I’m providing on the basis of voluntary consent.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionMarcus Johnstone, the managing director at PCD solicitors and a specialist in representing serious sexual offenders, said any attempt to force offenders to take libido-altering chemicals would be challenged in the courts and European courts, adding: “These proposals will fail as a way of reducing reoffending without investment in adequate psychological treatment services in tandem.”Prison Reform Trust chief executive Pia Sinha said forcing medical treatment raised “clear ethical considerations” that could put medical practitioners in an “invidious” position.She said: “Medical interventions to address the behaviour of people convicted of sexual offences only applies to particular types of offending – it must not be seen as a panacea. Any treatment that targets its use needs to be strictly risk-assessed by medical experts rather than ministers.”The Sun disclosed on Wednesday night that Mahmood would examine plans to chemically castrate paedophiles. A review led by the former justice secretary David Gauke recommended reforms to overhaul the prison system. It also looked at ways to cut reoffending, with one proposal to consider further use of chemical suppressants, which are being piloted in south-west England.In a statement to the Commons, Mahmood said: “The review has recommended we continue a pilot of so-called medication to manage problematic sexual arousal.“I will go further with a national rollout, beginning in two regions covering 20 prisons. And I am exploring whether mandating the approach is possible. Of course, it is vital that this approach is taken alongside psychological interventions that target other causes of offending, like asserting power and control.”Problematic sexual arousal can be reduced by chemical suppressants and prescribed medication, but the review highlighted the treatment would not be relevant for some sex offenders such as rapists driven by power and control, rather than sexual preoccupation.Explore more on these topicsUK criminal justicePrisons and probationnewsShareReuse this content"

The information provided since the session establishes that Karen Kneller omitted important information that would have provided a more accurate account of how the CCRC handled the Henley report.“As a result of our concerns regarding the performance of the CCRC and the unpersuasive evidence Karen Kneller provided to the committee, we no longer feel that it is tenable for her to continue as chief executive of the CCRC.”The committee also deemed justifications given by Kneller for her attendance atexpensive training courses in Franceusing public money to be unsatisfactory.The CCRC had “deteriorated significantly” and required root and branch reform, the report found. Criticisms included the current lack of a chair, for which it said the Ministry of Justice bore some responsibility; the CCRC’s struggle to secure a sufficient number of commissioners; and the move to fully remote working, which “is out of step with the rest of the public sector and seems unsuited to the nature of their work”.The committee said that while Henley’s review focused on one case, it had “significant implications for the CCRC’s overall approach to its casework. The mistakes made in relation to Andrew Malkinson’s application should have been taken as evidence of systemic problems within the CCRC.”Slaughter said: “For an organisation that is designed to identify failures within the criminal justice system, the CCRC’s leadership has shown a remarkable inability to learn from its own mistakes.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Falconer said the CCRC was “generally regarded as useless”.A CCRC spokesperson said it noted the committee’s recommendations, adding: “We look forward to an announcement on the appointment of an interim chair and to working with them in an organisation deeply committed to finding, investigating and referring potential miscarriages of justice.”Explore more on these topicsCriminal Cases Review CommissionUK criminal justiceEnglandWalesNorthern IrelandHouse of CommonsnewsShareReuse this content"

He visited the day after he was added to the UK sanctions list for “threatening, perpetrating, promoting and supporting acts of aggression and violence against Palestinian individuals”.The settlers set up a basic shelter next to a sheep enclosure with a small herd, which formed the base for a campaign of intimidation that began immediately.“I haven’t slept since they came, and the children are terrified,” said Ahmad Sulaiman, a 58-year-old father of eleven whose home was closest to the outpost.Born just a stone’s throw away, he had spent his life in Mughayyir al-Deir, but by Thursday he was packing to leave, although the family did not know where they would go.“The settlers told me: ‘This is our home’,” said Sulaiman. “There is nothing I can do. They have guns and other weapons.”Map of West BankThe intended deterrent effect of the UK sanctions was not visible at Mughayyir al-Deir, where settlers expanded their campaign of intimidation in the days after the British announcement, and the only public response from Israeli officials was a visit in support of the settlers.Zvi Sukkot, a member of the Knesset and the far-right Religious Zionist party, was filmed by activists as he left the illegal outpost. During a debate on Israel’s Channel 12 last week Sukkot said: “Everyone has got used to the idea that we can kill 100 Gazans in one night during a war and nobody in the world cares.”The hills nearby are surrounded by the burned remains of Palestinian villages, whose residents were forced out by campaigns run from similar Israeli outposts. But setting up such a short distance from the Palestinians being targeted is unprecedented.Yonatan Mizrachi, the co-director of Settlement Watch, part of the campaign group Peace Now, said settler outposts had been getting nearer to Palestinian communities since the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel, “but I don’t remember any others that were established so close”.“It shows the settlers’ lack of fear, and the understanding that they can do what they like; they can just set up in the Palestinian community. And they didn’t come to be good neighbours,” Mizrachi added.Sabah was indicted by Israeli authorities in September for his role in an attack on a school in Mu’arrajat East, where settlers targeted teachers, a 13-year-old pupil and the principal, who was hospitalised.Shai Parnes, a spokesperson for the Israeli human rights group B’tselem, said: “Israeli policy to take as much land as possible hasn’t changed. But what has been changing under this current government is the total impunity for soldiers and settlers.“They used to hide their faces or attack at night, everything is happening much more brutal and violent and it is happening in broad daylight. They are really proud about what they’re doing, sometimes even uploading the assaults themselves to social media.”Forced displacement began before the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel and the subsequent ongoing Gaza war, but hasintensifiedsince then. Around 1,200 Palestinians, nearly half of them children, have been forced to leave 20 communities, according to figures from B’tselem.It is a second displacement for families such as Sulaiman’s, who lived near what is now the Israeli city of Be’er Sheva until 1948. They were forced out in the nakba, or catastrophe, in which about 700,000 Palestinians were expelled from their homes in 1948 after the creation of Israel.View image in fullscreenAhmad Sulaiman says he hasn’t slept since the settlers arrivedPhotograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The GuardianIsrael’s military occupation of the West Bank began in 1967. Around 500,000 Jewish Israelis live in settlements there, all illegal under international law. Dozens of small makeshift outposts are also illegal under Israeli law – like the one set up in Mughayyir al-Deir – but authorities rarely try to remove them.Ben Pazi set up his own farm in the area east of Ramallah in 2018 and has been involved in attacks and land grabs in the area for many years, according to the British and US governments.Most use a combination of attacks on people, destruction of property and deployment of herds of sheep and goats to graze land where Palestinians have fed their flocks for decades.The US state department said in 2024, when sanctions were imposed on Ben Pazi under the Biden administration: “Ben Pazi has expelled Palestinian shepherds from hundreds of acres of land. In August 2023, settlers including Ben Pazi attacked Palestinians near the village of Wadi as-Seeq.” Donald Trump lifted those sanctions.Ben Pazi’s violence attracted the attention of Israel’s military commander for the region, Maj Gen Yehuda Fuchs, who issued an administrative order barring Ben Pazi from entering the West Bank in late 2023.Ben Pazi’s role in the campaign to force Palestinians out of Mughayyir al-Deir was unclear. He hung up when the Guardian called to ask for comment, and did not respond to further messages. The Guardian was unable to contact Sabah.Ben Pazi was a regular visitor to the new outpost, spending several hours there on at least three days this week, according to several Israeli activists who recognised him from work in the region.On one visit he was photographed greeting an unidentified man wearing a military-style uniform. A spokesperson for the Israeli military said the country’s armed forces did not authorise or organise the forced displacement of Mughayyir al-Deir.“The alleged evacuation was neither conducted by [IDF troops ] nor carried out with their approval,” a spokesperson said. Asked why the military did not remove the illegal outpost, they said any demolition would be a political decision.“Enforcement against unlawful construction in the area is undertaken in accordance with the priorities set by the political echelon and is carried out under its authorisation,” the spokesperson said.Ben Pazi drove a group of settlers and equipment to the edge of the village, where they started erecting a fence around land where Palestinians had lived and farmed for decades.Parnes, of B’tselem, said: “The international community have so much more to do in terms of directing steps towards the Israeli government.“What is happening is not just about a violent threat in this place or that; it’s all part of a well-defended and subsidised policy run by the government.”Explore more on these topicsIsraelWest BankPalestinian territoriesIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

His last filmLong Day’s Journey Into Nightfrom 2018 was an extraordinary and almost extraterrestrial experience in the cinema which challenged the audience to examine what they thought about time and memory; this doesn’t have quite that power, being effectively a portmanteau movie, some of whose sections are better than others – though it climaxes with some gasp-inducing images and tracking shots and all the constituent parts contribute to the film’s aggregate effect.Resurrection is, perhaps, a long night’s journey to the enlightenment of daybreak; it finishes at a club called the Sunrise. It is also an episodic journey through Chinese history, finishing at that historic moment which continues to fascinate Chinese film-makers whose movies are a way of collectively processing their feelings about it: New Year’s Eve 1999, the new century in whichChinawas to bullishly embrace the new capitalism while cleaving to the political conformism of the old ways.We are in a kind of alt-reality universe where humans have discovered they can live indefinitely if they do not dream, an activity which burns up humans like a lit candle. Bi Gan leaves it up to us to ponder what that implies for overpopulation.But there is one outlier, one dissident, a man who does dream – he is a sacred monster called the Fantasmer (Jackson Yee) and the paradox is that the Fantasmer’s ecstatic perception of illusions and dreams allows him to reincarnate and resurrect in an exotic variety of lowlife existences at different historic times in the last century – and a woman enters his life. Is it the woman perceiving these events, or is the Fantasmer doing it?At the beginning of the century, and occupying a kind of antique silent-movie world, he is a white-faced figure like the vampire Nosferatu being tended to by a mysterious woman (played by longtime Hou Hsiao-shen performer Shu Qi). During the second world war he is involved in a violent imbroglio in a mirror shop – shades of Welles’s The Lady From Shanghai perhaps – involving a theremin. We flashforward 20 years and our time-travelling itinerant Fantasmer is in a remote and wintry temple where he breaks a Buddha statue and encounters a Spirit of Bitterness.Some decades later, he is a crooked card-sharp who inveigles a little girl into a scam he’s got going against a local gangster and finally we are at the brink of the new century in which the Fantasmer meets another mobster Mr Luo – his vampiric destiny, and the movie’s own visuals, ascend to a new plane.It is a deeply mysterious film whose enigma extends to the title – is what is happening “resurrection” in any clear transformative sense? Or is it just a continuous flickering shape-shifting: the Fantasmer just a pulsating star on the far-reaches of the universe, that might in a few hundred thousand years explode or collapse in on itself?Asking or answering these questions may not be the film’s point and its riddling quality, combined with its spectacular visual effects, may leave some audiences agnostic – and I myself wasn’t sure about the silent-movie type effects. Yet it’s a work of real artistry.Resurrection premiered at theCannes film festivalExplore more on these topicsCannes film festivalFestivalsChinareviewsShareReuse this content"

Imelda Staunton and Bessie Carter here make a more compelling double act and bring an added frisson to the play’s intimacies and disputes.Carter plays Vivie, a no-nonsense young woman with ambitions to take up the legal profession. Her mother, Kitty (Staunton), has a successful profession of her own – the world’s oldest – and a string of brothels to her name. When Kitty visits Vivie, who has just graduated from Cambridge, this secret is explosively revealed.You can see why it was originally banned by the Lord Chamberlain. If Victorians were shocked by the theme of sex work, its ideological grenades about the corruptions of capitalism and establishment hypocrisies still resonate today. Some go off in director Dominic Cooke’s period-dress production, which he has edited for sleekness.It feels abidingly faithful but moves stiffly at times, carrying the sense of a dusted down drama despite Chloe Lamford’s shining set, an island of flora and fauna bobbing like an eternally fragrant English garden against a bare black backdrop, before being stripped of its naturalism. The period dress strangely mutes the play’s shocks while, in an awkward touch, lugubrious ghostly figures in undergarments (Victorian sex workers?) crowd around the edges and act as stagehands.View image in fullscreenIdeological grenades … Imelda Staunton and Bessie Carter in Mrs Warren’s Profession.Photograph: Johan PerssonIt is never staid when Staunton is on stage, though. Both mother and daughter give dignified performances, Staunton the more subtle and formidable with an edge of the dandy while Vivie is plainer and more upright. The play flares fully to life in their duologues but the scenes around them feel filled with extraneous, thinly drawn characters and plot. Mr Praed (Sid Sagar)seems redundant to the drama as a whole while the reverend’s self-serving son, Frank (Reuben Joseph), sounds like a pale imitation of Oscar Wilde’s shallow men.Sir George Crofts (Robert Glenister, excellent) appears every bit the arrogant “capitalist bully” that Vivie accuses him of being, although his defence implicates society and Vivie’s privilege too, while the Reverend (Kevin Doyle) is fabulously performed, bumbling, comic and venal.This is, in large part, a static play of ideas, but the arguments are nuanced.Sex workis not an immoral act in itself but symptomatic of the exploitation of – and limits put upon – working women, it is suggested. Capitalism, high society and the church are implicated, and damned.The script’s intellectual restlessness is still enlivening too; the mother-daughter battles are excellent, twisting and switching our sympathies. Kitty, by turns, seems selfish and honest, Vivie puritanical and moral. Generation and class clashes are also at play alongside existential guilt and rebellion, as well as reflections on mothers and daughters’ rights over and responsibilities to each other. Shaw shows himself to be well ahead of his time in capturing all of this and his arguments still hold a grip, even if it comes off like a Wilde play without the jokes.At theGarrick theatre, London, until 16 AugustExplore more on these topicsTheatreGeorge Bernard ShawImelda StauntonWest EndSex workreviewsShareReuse this content"

Then she found out he had been spying on her all alongThu 22 May 2025 00.00 EDTShareIn February 2004, Kate Wilson – then 25 and known to her friends as Katja – decided to make a Valentine’s card for her partner, Mark. He was an affectionate person – he would write her poems, give her gifts, text her love messages – and she wanted to reciprocate in some way. “He was quite demonstrative and I was not. That was a little bit awkward for me,” she says. “The gesture of making a card for Valentine’s Day, which to my anarchist self was soppy and commercial, was a big deal.”More than a decade later, Wilson read the incident back, as recorded in a police log:Sunday 15th February. 19.37Call from Source who has received a Valentines card from Katja. This has put Source’s mind at rest re the challenges about being an undercover/informant.For the entire course of Wilson’s 16-month relationship with “Mark Stone” – who she now knows was Mark Kennedy, an undercover police officer – their conversations, weekends away, gifts, lunches, dinners and family events were reported by him (the “Source”) to a police handler and duly logged. A trip to Ikea with her parents: “Call from Source who has left Ikea with a vehicle full of furniture and mattresses on the roof. The Wilson family are in their vehicle in front of Source.”His gift of a mountain bike just before a trip to Ireland:“REASON: Ease of transport within Dublin. Provide facility for quality time to reinforce bond/relationship. Provide joint interest.”Even the death of Wilson’s grandmother: “Source believes that they may invite Source to the funeral. I told Source that from a position of intrusion we should make excuses as to why Source does not attend.”Undercover Met police officer Mark Stone, AKA Mark Kennedy.Kennedy spent seven years as an undercover police officer, infiltrating a group of environmental activists and at the same time, according to Wilson, sleeping with at least 11 women who knew him as Mark Stone. He is perhaps the most well-known of the“police spies” brought to light by Guardian reporting, who are now the subject of the long-runningundercover policing inquiry.The highly secret police policy of infiltrating protest groups stretches back decades, and targets were wide and varied. More than 1,000 groups came under its radar, including trade unions, Greenpeace, the justice campaign for murdered teenagerStephen Lawrence, a branch of Hedgehog Rescue,School Kids Against the NazisandEat Out Vegan Wales. Deployments typically lasted years and the officers selected were often married and settled, in order to have secure bases to return to. At least25 formed intimate relationshipsand four are alleged to have fathered children with women who were unaware of their true identities.Several of these women launched legal action, but funding challenges forced them to settle without receiving answers to their wider questions, or any real disclosure from the police. Only Wilson was able to pursue a human rights claim right to the end through theinvestigatory powers tribunaland, for this reason, she is the only woman to have received any kind of “disclosure”. To support her case, police were forced to hand over boxes of files (more than 5,000 pages) logging much of Kennedy’s undercover career. It included his relationship with Wilson and also their “friendship”, which had continued until his true identity was revealed. Wilson has now written a book, Disclosure, which recounts this mind-bending experience, seeing her life reflected through this fairground hall of mirrors.“I’d always believed I was the centre of my own life story and this just knocks it all sideways. I’m a character in somebody else’s spy story,” she says. “It absolutely occupied my every waking moment for a good few years – and, to a certain extent, it still does.”View image in fullscreenDemonstrators outside the Royal Courts of Justice, London, in 2018, during the investigatory powers tribunal’s hearing of the case of Kate Wilson (right).Photograph: Tess De La Mare/PAWilson met Kennedy in the autumn of 2003 when she was training as a translator and was an active member of the environmental advocacy group Earth First! Kennedy was deployed on Operation Penguin, then headed by Nottinghamshire police. (Later, his management moved to the Metropolitan police.) He sat beside Wilson at a meeting of a group known as Nasa (Nottingham Assembly of Subversive Activists) held at the Sumac Centre, a community space in Nottingham. Ironically, Wilson now knows that one of the Sumac’s founder members, Rod Richardson, was also an undercover officer – someone she already knew, who might have briefed Kennedy about her in advance.“As soon as I found out that Mark had been a cop, the questions started,” says Wilson. “Was I the target of the job, a tool of the job or a perk of the job? Was he just looking to sleep with a popular blond woman 10 years his junior? It’s impossible to know.”From the start, the two seemed to have lots in common. They both grew up around the Battersea/Wandsworth area of London. They loved caravans and country music. But in truth, Kennedy had been raised in Kent, and when he moved on from Wilson to his next undercover relationship, he was suddenly more interested in whisky tasting and drum’n’bass. “They were trained in emotional manipulation, and one of the things that all the women who were in relationships with these men describe is this mirroring, where the officers really shared our interests,” says Wilson.View image in fullscreenWilson … ‘It ruined my life in some ways.’Photograph: Jordi Matas/The GuardianKennedy presented as a slightly damaged working-class boy from a broken home, recovering from a dark period of drug dealing but now working as a delivery driver. He was enthusiastic about everything – charming, attentive, curious. “We got together very soon after meeting,” says Wilson. Within months, Wilson had moved into the house that Kennedy was already sharing with her friends. “He was the first partner that I moved in with, so that was quite a big decision.”The relationship continued until February 2005, when Wilson moved to Spain (“Text from Source,” the police log reads, “Katja is just pulling out of Dover”). “I’m very lucky that I left him,” she says. “I was very young. I wasn’t looking to settle down. He made a big thing about how I broke his heart, though obviously it wasn’t like that. I went on to live in Barcelona, then Berlin, and he visited me everywhere. He was one of my closest friends.”It was October 2010 when Wilson learned Kennedy’s true identity. He had been exposed when “Lisa”, his girlfriend after Wilson, had found a passport in his real name and a phone with messages from his children: not only was he a police officer, but he was also a married father of two. When someone called Wilson to tell her about it, she was weeks into a medical degree at the University of Barcelona, studying to be a doctor. “I was focused, dedicated and on this path,” she says. “This totally derailed me.”As an experienced activist, Wilson had heard of police infiltration. “It wasn’t something I’d never thought about,” she says. “But Mark was somebody I’d loved for a long time. I’d had dinner with him just two months before. What none of my political background prepared me for was that the principal emotion on finding out that someone was a police spy would be grief. It was as if he’d died – but he hadn’t, he’d never existed. He was gone but he was also out there giving interviews.”View image in fullscreenMark Kennedy on holiday in Italy in 2010.After his exposure, Kennedy hired the publicist Max Clifford and appeared in the media. “Watching was so strange,” she says. “I got the impression that he wasn’t sure who he was any more. In the first appearances, he’d cut his hair and appeared very strait-laced, very much ‘Mark the cop’. But as time went on, he let his hair grow and looked punky. In a documentary, he appeared in an All Cops Are Bastards T-shirt.”One of Wilson’s early reactions was to email him. “You have all these questions,” she says. “‘Why?’ is a big one. You think, ‘Well, Mark has all the answers,’ but I’m not sure he did.”Part of their email exchange is included in her book, but Kennedy is vague and dishonest. One of his replies reads: “I hope you will understand when I say that so many things never went anywhere. You and others were never mentioned by me ever … There is no black and white only a huge grey area in which I was trapped.”“I think he’s a very messed-up man who doesn’t know which way is up,” says Wilson.The impact on her life was devastating. “There was a lot of insomnia, waking early in a cold sweat, like something was really wrong but not knowing what,” she says. “Only years later, I realised that I no longer listened to music and I’d stopped reading books. I just couldn’t put my emotions at risk. Medicine is a very demanding course. I couldn’t focus, I couldn’t concentrate.” At the end of her first term, she failed the exams by one mark. “The tragic thing is that I could probably have gone to the uni and got some support and time away, but how can you begin to explain this? I didn’t even know where to start. Would they think I was some kind of terrorist?”Instead, Wilson left the course – and that was how she was able to pursue her legal claim to the end. Initially, she joined seven other women in a civil action led by lawyer Harriet Wistrich from the Centre for Women’s Justice against the Met, in which five officers were implicated. However, all but Wilson settled with compensation and an unreserved public apology from the police, who refused to give answers and information through a policy of “neither confirm nor deny”.View image in fullscreenWilson … ‘What you see when you look at the files is that Mark had a job.’Photograph: Jordi Matas/The GuardianThe fact that Wilson had lost a potentially lucrative medical career meant there was funding for her to fight on with a human rights claim. It took years but, finally, the police were forced to surrender files; they arrived randomly, in boxes, pages upside down, passages redacted, all jumbled, in no chronological order. A team of friends and family had to help her sort through, index them and make sense of it.Perhaps the most striking aspect of Kennedy’s reports, as set out in Wilson’s book, is how trivial they are. (“Source is engaged ‘Carol singing’ outside Putney rail station with Katja, family and friends raising funds for Amnesty International.”)In fact, one of the presiding judges in Wilson’s case made a similar observation. At one point, Kennedy mentions activists’ plans for “an aquatic assault on ships”. In reality, this was a dozen people riding inflatable dragons to stop a ship docking for an arms fair.“It was absolutely disproportionate,” says Wilson, “but you can’t think of this as an operation with ‘higher level’, ‘greater good’ importance. What you see when you look at the files is that Mark had a job. His handler had a job. His handler’s boss had a job. And they wanted to keep their jobs so they needed to justify what they were doing. I’m sure Mark and his handler were absolutely aware how petty it was, but every intelligence report helped keep them in work. Understanding that took me quite a while.”As Mark Stone, Kennedy didn’t just passively observe – he influenced outcomes. “He was one of the core group, proposing, organising, recruiting for the actions that were then used to justify his deployment,” says Wilson. She is unconvinced by the argument that, in some contexts, undercover policing is an important tool. “What we’re seeing is that it’s very, very dangerous. You’re putting people into positions of power and separating them from all the social controls that make them behave respectably. They’re anonymous. Their families don’t know what they’re doing and the people that they’re doing it to are never expected to find out.Lisa Jones, girlfriend of undercover policeman Mark Kennedy: ‘I thought I knew him better than anyone’Read more“When the police are asked if they considered the damage that would be caused when women realised the truth, the answer they keep giving is that ‘no one was ever supposed to know’. And if no one will ever know, it means they’re free to do whatever they want.”Wilson’s legal case took more than a decade, and in 2021, the investigatory powers tribunal found the Met responsible for “a formidable list” of human rights violations during an “unlawful and sexist” operation. Compensation was settled the following year. Along the way, Wilson qualified as a nurse and now works abroad.Her life has changed fundamentally. “One of the most insidious and damaging things is the loss of trust,” she says. “Not trusting strangers is OK, but this is not trusting people close to you. It ruined my life in some ways: until this happened, I’d always lived in collective communities, but slowly, slowly, it became impossible. You can’t live in a community if you don’t trust people.” Her political activism changed, too. “I don’t feel comfortable going into those spaces, so my activism is more or less limited to working with victims of spy cops.”At present, much of her focus is on the undercover policing inquiry, ongoing since 2014. “We are chipping away, getting answers, but it’s a lot like getting blood out of a stone.” Although the inquiry’s original chair had said that women deceived into relationships would be given the fullest possible accounts, including the man’s real name, this hasn’t happened. Earlier this year, one officer, known asHN1, was allowed to give all his evidence anonymously.Kennedy’s appearance is likely to be next year. “I hope he’ll be truthful and help some of the other people he has damaged to understand why,” Wilson says, “but I really don’t hold much hope. I don’t know where he is or what he’s doing, and I don’t know that he would have anything useful to tell me. That ship sailed a long time ago.”Disclosure: Unravelling the Spycops Files by Kate Wilson is published by Weidenfeld & Nicolson on 29 May (£20).

A few years ago, they say, the market would have been bustling with ice-cream sellers, salt vendors and horse-drawn carts delivering freshly caught fish to the women, who would set about sun-drying, salting and sorting the catch into affordable portions for local families to buy.Today, trade is dead, says Aissatou Wade, one of the remaining small-scale fish processors left in the town. “Without fish [to sell], we have no money to send our children to school, buy food or get help if we fall ill,” she says.So what has happened? Wade and her fellow workers have become victims of the supply chain that feeds aquaculture – the world’sfastest-growingfood sector.View image in fullscreenWomen clean fish in Yenne, south of Dakar. Local fishmeal factories are increasingly using whole fish rather than waste products such as heads and tails.Photograph: Ricci Shryock/The GuardianA booming global trade in millions of small fish, caught to feed bigger farmed fish abroad, has drained Senegal’s waters of a food sourcethe country’s population relies on. Until now, this opaque supply chain has obscured which companies use Senegal’s fishmeal. However,a two-year investigationby the environmental investigations outlet DeSmog and the Guardian, spanning three countries, can reveal that UK consumers are playing a role in food insecurity and unemployment in west Africa.View image in fullscreenSome sea bass sold at Billingsgate market may have been fed on Senegalese fishmeal.Photograph: Karen Mcveigh/The GuardianBy examining trade data and shipping records and combining this with on-the-ground reporting in three countries, the investigation found that Turkish-farmed sea bass and sea bream is being fed on fishmeal exported from three factories in Senegal: Omega Fishing and Africa Feed south of Dakar, and Afric Azote at Dakar port. The women who work locally must keep their prices affordable for their customers and saythey cannot compete on price with the factories, forcing increasing numbers of them out of work.The data led us from these factories, via Turkey’s sea bass and sea bream farms, to Billingsgate fish market in London and the fish counters of supermarkets across the UK. Here, fish grown by farms that have used Senegalese fishmeal are labelled “responsibly” sourced or farmed, based on certification from the Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC) and other standards bodies.We can reveal that at least five UK supermarkets – Waitrose, Co-op, Aldi, Lidl and Asda – have sold sea bass or sea bream grown by one of Turkey’s largest fish farmers, Kılıç Deniz, or its subsidiary Agromey,which sources fishmeal made from small Senegalese fish. The supplier lists, in-store labels and interviews with industry sources link these supermarkets to Kılıç’s farms.These retailers are supplied by two UK wholesalers – New England Seafood International and OceanFish, who use Kılıç and Agromey. These two wholesalers have also sold sea bass or sea bream to Morrisons, Marks & Spencer, Sainsbury’s and Tesco, the investigation found. The investigation was unable to establish whether that fish came to the wholesalers via Kılıç or another supplier.Between them, these wholesalers have supplied supermarkets with 473 tonnes of fish raised by Kılıç, or its subsidiary Agromey, over the past four years, according to official data. That’s enough fish to stack supermarket shelves with nearly 5 million fillets.The factories along Senegal’s coastline used to rely on waste products, including fish heads and tails from the port and other factories, but now increasingly use more fresh pelagic or “forage” fish, the mainstay of African small-scale fisheries.“Farmed fish comes as this nice product, all the same size, good for the consumer, and no one knows it is jeopardising the prospects of people in west Africa,” says Béatrice Gorez from the Coalition for Fair Fisheries Arrangements.Sea bas route graphicMore than 3,000 miles away from Senegal, Turkey is a fish-farming powerhouse, supplying more than half of the world’s sea bass and a third of its sea bream. Kılıç is one of Turkey’s leading sea bass and bream producers, earning $443m annually. A supplier of UK wholesalers and supermarkets, it is thebiggest importerof Senegalese fishmeal among 11 Turkish rivals. It has shipped fishmeal and fish oil from Senegal every year for the last four years, a total of 5,400 tonnes, customs data shows. This would have been enough tomeet the recommended dietary intakefor nearly 2 million people.Sea bass and bream fed on Senegalese fishmeal may also have entered UK markets via three other Turkish fish farmers that also buy west African fishmeal, the investigation found – but it was not possible to trace their products’ journey to sale points in the UK.View image in fullscreenThere is no way for consumers to tell if the sea bass fillet they are eating was fed on fishmeal from Senegal.Photograph: Burcu Atalay Tankut/Getty ImagesKılıç told the Guardian it was not breaking any laws by buying raw materials from Senegal, and that “we do not manage the fishing policies” of other countries. Acknowledging “concerns in world public opinion” Kılıç added: “We think we can limit our purchases from Senegal.”Senegalese fish oil and fishmeal made up less than 1% of its total fishmeal purchases in 2024, Kılıç said, adding that the fish used were bigeye grunts and bumpers, which it claimed were “not caught for human consumption”. Fishmongers and other sources in Senegal dispute this claim.Aby Diouf, a fishmonger, remembers selling dried fish as far inland as Mali and Burkina Faso. Now, she claims, much of that fish is sold to the factories, bypassing the women who wait on the shore to buy it. “We were proud,” she says. “We built our houses, we bought cars. We bought boats for our husbands – we even financed their fishing trips.” Diouf, who raised and educated her seven children from the trade, now rents out plastic chairs for baptisms and weddings.View image in fullscreenAby Diouf once made a good living trading fish, but now rents out plastic chairs for weddings and baptisms.Photograph: Ricci Shryock/The GuardianNearly a quarterof the global catch of all wild-caught species – 17 million tonnes – was ground into meal or oil in 2022, the majority of it fed to farmed seafood.For a companyfarmingmillons of fish a year, even a small percentage of its purchases of fishmeal can have an outsized impact in Senegal. “Changes that seem small at a global scale can have devastating consequences locally,” says Christina Hicks, an expert on small-scale fisheries and nutrition at Lancaster University.In 2023, a year in which its fishmeal exports reached an eight-year high, persistently high food costspushedSenegal into crisis levels of hunger. Thousands of women have lost their jobs, according to Didier Gascuel, a fisheries ecologist at the Institut Agro Rennes-Angers in western France, who has lived and worked in Senegal.“We are entering danger zones,” he says. “It is clear that overexploitation combined with climate change and water degradation can lead to a collapse phenomena.”The Senegalese government offers financial sweeteners to companies that export more than 80% of their products or services, including a50% discount on income taxand exemption from import duties. (The government did not respond to requests for comment.)Once the fishmeal arrives at Kılıç’s feed mill, it is mixed with wheat, soy, fish oil and other ingredients to feed the millions of fish Kılıç harvests annually. Some of it travels frozen, overland or by boat in 18-tonne containers to ports in the UK such as Liverpool, Portsmouth, Dover and Hull.A graph shows that fish consumption in Senegal dropped by more than half between 2010 and 2022A quarter of all imports of Turkish bass and bream into the UK between 2021 and 2024 were from Kılıç, according to data from the Department for Environment,Foodand Rural Affairs (Defra),released in a freedom of information request.Fish farmed by Kılıç, or its subsidiary Agromey, has two routes to UK plates. The first is via hubs such as London’s Billingsgate market, where men in white overalls gather at dawn among boxes brimming full of silvery sea bream and sea bass. The Guardian found some of them marked “Kılıç”.“We sell a lot, about 100 tonnes a week,” one trader for another UK wholesaler, Polydor, told the Guardian. “It goes everywhere: fishmongers, Chinese restaurants, the public.”Defra data shows that Polydor has imported more than 7,000 tonnes of sea bream from Kılıç in the past four years, equivalent to more than 17 million whole fish, or 78 million fillets.The second route to UK tables is via wholesalers to supermarkets. In 2024, more than half a million fillets of sea bass farmed by Kılıç or its subsidiary arrived on supermarket shelves via New England Seafood International, which has offices in Grimsby and Chessington and Cornwall-based Ocean Fish, Defra data shows.View image in fullscreenFish for sale in Yenne in Senegal.Photograph: Ricci Shryock/The GuardianJoal Fadiouth satellite viewIn an opaque and fragmented supply chain, there is no way for consumers to tell if the sea bass or sea bream fillet they are buying was fed on fishmeal from Senegal.The Guardian and Desmog investigation has established that Kılıç-produced fish is on sale at Waitrose, whichliststhe Turkish company as one of its suppliers, and the Guardian understands that Co-op sells about six tonnes of sea bass farmed by Kılıç a year.Identification on packaging, supplier lists and conversations with employees of Kılıç, and its subsidiary Agromey, shows Lidl, Asda and Aldi have also sourced from Kılıç or Agromey. Sainsbury’s and Tesco have sourced sea bass and sea bream from New England Seafood International, according to labelling on fillets on sale in supermarket branches and their latest supplier lists.When presented with the findings of the investigation, Lidl, Sainsbury’s, Tesco and Waitrose declined to comment, referring the Guardian to a statement from Sophie De Salis, sustainability policy adviser at the British Retail Council: “UK retailers are dedicated to sourcing seafood products responsibly. Our members regularly review fishing practices in their supply chains to ensure they meet the highest standards.”De Salis added: “Retailers adhere to all legal requirements around product labelling. They ensure high standards are upheld throughout their supply chains through third-party certified verification.”View image in fullscreenFishers arrive with the day’s catch on the beach at Joal.Photograph: Ricci Shryock/The GuardianMorrisons and Aldi said they did not currently source from Kılıç or Agromey farms but declined to say whether they had in the past. Aldi also said that, since last year, it no longer sources from the wholesalers mentioned in the investigation. M&S told the Guardian after publication that it had never sourced from Kılıç nor ever used fish from Senegal as feed for sea bass or sea bream. Asda did not respond to requests for comment.Of the wholesalers involved in the chain, New England Seafood International said it was dedicated to “sourcing responsible and sustainable seafood”. The other two, Polydor and Ocean Fish, did not respond to requests for comment. The Senegalese-owned factory Afric Azote, in Dakar, denied it contributed to overfishing or women’s unemployment and said it only ever used whole, fresh fish when this was no longer fit for human consumption. The other factories in Senegal, OmegaFishingand Africa Feed, did not respond to requests for comment.Seafood fed on small west African fish can be labelled “responsibly” sourced or farmed as long as it meets standards determined by the ASC. Under ASC rules, a farm can only buy fishmeal from sources where fisheries are “reasonably well managed” with healthy stocks.View image in fullscreenA Kılıç feed factory in Turkey.Photograph: Tunca Ilker OgretenKılıç, which produces a quarter of its sea bass and sea bream from four farms certified by the ASC, said it was not in breach of ASC standards.The ASC said Senegal was not listed as a sourcing country in 2024 for whole fish marine ingredients by Kılıç. But in any case sourcing of this fish may not breach its rules, it said, if these fish were mixed into feed.

Teenage Fanclub’s greatest songs – rankedAs their album Grand Prix turns 30, we rate the standout moments from a group Kurt Cobain called ‘the best in the world’Alexis PetridisThu 22 May 2025 10.02 EDTLast modified on Thu 22 May 2025 14.20 EDTShare20. The First Sight (2016)In 2018, bassist Gerry Love departedTeenage Fanclub(TFC) after 29 years, much to fans’ despair. It’s perhaps a little romantic to see The First Sight as his parting gift, but it’s certainly an impressive closing statement of his songwriting talent: an intricate mesh of guitars, a buoyant horn section, and a typically stunning tune.19. Did I Say (2003)Most artists called upon to pad out a best-of collection with a few new tracks – by a major label about to drop them – would understandably offer something substandard. Not TFC. Driven by an unexpectedly tricky rhythm, Did I Say is folky, beautiful and a noticeable diversion from their usual style.18. Escher (1993)Bandwagonesque’s follow-up Thirteen gets a bad rap, not least from the band themselves – its recording was fraught – but 30-odd years on, it sounds better than its reputation suggests. Escher certainly smooths out Bandwagonesque’s rougher edges, but its drawing of a muddled relationship is no less charming for that.View image in fullscreenSlightly bruised … Teenage Fanclub in 2023: Raymond McGinley, Norman Blake, Francis Macdonald, Dave McGowan and Euros Childs.Photograph: PR17. I Will Love You (2023)From its title down, TFC’s most recent album Nothing Lasts Forever conjured up a kind of twilit optimism: a band staring down their 60s, slightly bruised by life but facing forward. Final track, I Will Love You sums the mood up: slowly shimmering atmospherics that eventually burst into striking, warm vocal harmonies. A joy.16. Your Love Is the Place I Come From (1997)The arrangement of Your Love Is the Place Where I Come From is almost wilfully understated – for most of its three minutes, you could be eavesdropping on a rehearsal – but its no-frills simplicity allows the songwriting, a sigh of contentment in musical form, to shine all the more clearly.15. Cells (2005)TFC aren’t famous for brooding, which makes the sombre tone of Cells all the more striking: the muted take on their sound perfectly fits a set of lyrics haunted by a very middle-aged sense of ageing and loss. And the lengthy acoustic guitar coda is just exquisite.View image in fullscreenStriking a chord … Teenage Fanclub on stage at Cambridge Junction in 2016.Photograph: Sonja Horsman for the Observer New Review/The Observer14. God Knows It’s True (1990)Before their perplexing second album, The King – seven grungy instrumental originals and covers of Pink Floyd’s Interstellar Overdrive and Madonna’s Like a Virgin – TFC released one-off single God Knows It’s True. It’s solo-heavy and slacker sloppy but crucially also a fabulous song.13. Planets (1997)Initially, TFC were a boozy, chaotic proposition, particularly live, but they proved surprisingly adept at growing up in public. Planets alchemises an unpromising subject – relocating to the countryside with your growing family – into musical gold. Sweet, but not cloying, there’s something really moving about its string-laden sense of contentment.12. Alcoholiday (1991)You couldn’t miss the influence of Big Star on Bandwagonesque – it even featured a quote from their lyrics on the cover – but nowhere was it deployed more spectacularly than on Alcoholiday, a glorious, harmony-laden depiction of uncertainty over a blossoming relationship: “Went to bed, but I’m not ready / Baby I’ve been fucked already.”11. I Don’t Want Control of You (1997)It wasBandwagonesque producer Don Flemingwho first suggested TFC concentrate on harmony vocals, but nowhere in their catalogue were they deployed to more euphoric effect than on the second single from Songs from Northern Britain, which is furthermore blessed with the kind of tune that isn’t ripped off from anywhere yet sounds instantly familiar.10. The Concept (1991)The chaotic early Fanclub had their moments, but the release of The Concept introduced the TFC that Kurt Cobain called “the best band in the world”: the guitars are still unruly with feedback, but the melodies are amped up to match them, the vocal harmonies are luscious, the lyrics smart and witty.9. Neil Jung (1995)The idea that none of the singles from Grand Prix made the Top 30 seems absolutely confounding: how could anything as self-evidently brilliant, as insanely tuneful as Neil Jung – romantic disaster plus incredible chorus plus fantastic (and suitably Neil Young-ish) guitar solo – not have been a huge hit? What waswrongwith people?8. Broken (1997)Thegreat TFC deep cut, Broken was inexplicably relegated to a B-side. An acoustic guitar and organ-driven masterpiece of beautiful, mournful simplicity – the lyrics feature just one line, endlessly repeated – it has subsequently also evaded streaming services. If you don’t know it, seek it out and luxuriate in its divine melancholy.View image in fullscreenWig out … Blake back in 1992.Photograph: Martyn Goodacre/Getty Images7. I Need Direction (2000)Packaged in a terrible sleeve and released by an indifferent major label to a decidedly muted response, 2000’s Howdy! tends to get overlooked. But if it’s not quite as good as its two predecessors (Songs from Northern Britain and Grand Prix), it’s still pretty great, as demonstrated by opener I Need Direction: unassuming but utterly delightful, thick with Beach Boys harmonies.6. Baby Lee (2010)By the time of 2010’s Shadows, it was clear that TFC were refining their sound rather than radically overhauling it, but they could still surprise you with the sheer quality of their songwriting. The Norman Blake-penned Baby Lee – lyrical misery, impossibly sunny music – is a triumph.5. Don’t Look Back (1995)Apparently, Love’s favourite among the songs he wrote for Teenage Fanclub, the autumnal Don’t Look Back builds wonderfully from reflective verses into a monster chorus. The advice said chorus doles out, and the acoustic version on the Teenage Fanclub Have Lost It EP, are both worth heeding.4. Everything Flows (1990)Debut album A Catholic Education is messier and noisier than the rest of TFC’s output: a decisive, Crazy Horse-influenced, instrumental jam-laden break with the members’ C86 pasts. But, Everything Flows – twentysomething ennui with a wonderful, wistful melody beneath the guitar overload – pointed the way ahead, an early song as good as any they’ve written.3. Star Sign (1991)Star Sign initially sounds like a Sonic Youth-y drone experiment – over a minute of beat-less monotone guitar – before exploding into life: an irresistible tune built around the kind of descending-but-uplifting chord sequences that helped define glam rock, and a lyric that keeps indifferently shrugging “big deal” in a way that’sveryearly 90s.2. Ain’t That Enough (1997)Songs from Northern Britain’s jewel, and – perhaps – TFC’s essence distilled: plangent guitars, sunlit harmonies, a melody the Fifth Dimension-era Byrds would have been proud of, life’s simple pleasures unfashionably hymned at the height of Britpop’s gruesome cokey grandiosity (“here is a sunrise – ain’t that enough?”). What a lovely song.1. Sparky’s Dream (1995)The songs at the top of this list are all so great, ranking them is mostly just a matter of personal preference, but the highlight of Grand Prix clinches it on the basis of its sheer ebullience – enough to pull any listener out of a gloomy mood – and its absolutely preposterous abundance of hooks: the main riff, the moment in the verses where the vocal melody soars upwards, the solo guitar motif that introduces the chorus, all three parts of the chorus. It’s essentially an album’s worth of incredible tunes crammed into three minutes – not a second of them wasted – and it soundseffortless.Explore more on these topicsTeenage FanclubRankedPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And the worst part is, you usually can’t do much about it. While social media is full of dreamy interiors and home renovation projects, most renters don’t have the option to knock down walls, retile a bathroom, or even paint without permission.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.As someone who’s rented a string of different flats – furnished, unfurnished, shoebox-sized, and occasionally some with questionable landlord DIY – I’ve learned to get creative. Making a place feel like home when you can’t even hang up artwork makes those smaller, temporary changes even more important.Whether you’re in a flatshare where you can’t touch the walls or if you’re on a budget generally and want a quick update, these upgrades are practical, affordable and, crucially, removable. From stick-on tiles to smart storage swaps, here’s how to give your space a glow-up, without losing your deposit.The best renter-friendly home updatesCupboard handlesChanging the cupboard or drawer handles is one of the easiest and most affordable ways to add personality to a rented home. Kitchen cupboards, wardrobes, bedside tables, bathroom cabinets and even a basic chest of drawers can be upgraded this way. It’s reversible and easy; just be sure to store the original handles somewhere safe for when you move out. Even better, you can take them with you with each move.View image in fullscreenBoone marble handle£18 each at AnthropologieView image in fullscreenBrasscup handle£9.50 each at Bowley & Jackson£12.50 each at Cox & CoxView image in fullscreenCeramic flower knobs£4.99 a pair at Zara HomeView image in fullscreenNicola Spring floral ceramic cabinet knobs£13.99 for six at B&QStick-on tilesIf your kitchen splashback or bathroom tiles have seen better days, peel-and-stick tiles are a quick, affordable way to freshen things up.

But you don’t have to be married to play Kurtág’s duets – just generous with your personal space.Leif Ove AndsnesandBertrand Chamayouchose eight of them for this recital, performing them alongside Kurtág’s similarly miniature solos and framing them with four works by Schubert, the master piano duet writer of the 19th century.The Kurtág pieces on the main programme were all from Játékok: translating as Games, this is a collection of mostly tiny piano solos and duets united by their concision and sense of mischief whichKurtág, now 99, has been adding to for half a century. Andsnes’s solo set began with an Evocation of Petrushka that indeed sounded like a sped-up tape of Stravinsky; immediately afterwards there was the contrast ofLes Adieux, quietly throbbing into silence, then an about-turn into the frenzied klaxon of Sirens of the Deluge. Chamayou sent his hands cartwheeling repeatedly down the keyboard in The Little Squall, and painted spots of changing colour in Hommage Tardif à Karskaya. Their duets were even more vivid, with Harangok and Kyrie showcasing differing and equally convincing ways of making the piano sound like bells.Close and complementary in style – Chamayou slightly more animated, Andsnes perhaps cooler and more analytical – the two made a rewarding team in Schubert, whether in the richly woven, melodious Rondo in A, the occasionally spiky Allegro in A minor or the constantly shifting harmonies of the E minor Fugue, written for organ. The highlight was the Fantasie in F minor, which with Andsnes on the top line was shaped into long paragraphs in a way that maintained momentum, before broadening out into an impassioned conclusion.It was back to Kurtág for the encores: two of his many Bach transcriptions, ending with theSonatina from Actus Tragicus– two minutes of quiet, unassuming beauty.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

He had been speaking to a Sky Sports cameraman for 25 minutes. Usually for a news interview it’s just 10, but today called for something more. Reports were coming out that Trent Alexander-Arnold, who inherited Carragher’s mantle as the local mainstay of Liverpool’s defence, was about to announce his long-expected departure from his boyhood club, and so, as sure as day follows night, a camera crew had been hastily dispatched to Carragher’s whereabouts to find a quiet spot, hit record and get his opinions out to viewers before they’d had a chance to fully form their own.How much was there to say about a subject that had already been talked about all season long? Quite a lot, it turned out. Like a hunter-gatherer extracting a week’s worth of food from a seemingly arid wilderness, Carragher – occasionally prompted by aSky Sportsanchor in the studio – launched into nearly half an hour of pure, free-flowing, agenda-setting football opinionating. From this monologue, Sky would carve out a TV report, YouTube interview, news article and three short-form videos. When Carragher says something – about Alexander-Arnold’s future, Arsenal’s attack, Chelsea’s owners or Fifa’s executives – we tend to hear about it very shortly after.The spot they’d chosen for the interview was, in fact, the first place that Carragher ever kicked a ball, 44 years ago – an indoor pitch that, on the day of filming, was also hosting a group of retirees playing boules just out of shot. We were in the Brunswick, a community centre just off Marsh Lane in the redbrick Merseyside docklands of Bootle. This is the centre of Carragher’s universe. All the places that formed him can be found within a half-mile radius: his childhood home, his dad’s pub, his old school, his church, his in-laws’ home, his favourite chip shop.Carragher is, with the exception of Sir Paul McCartney, the world’s most famous scouser. It’s true there are other contenders – Mel C, Wayne Rooney, Stephen Graham – but no one else is so internationally known as a scouser. For the past 30 years, through his 737 appearances for Liverpool and thousands of hours of media appearances, Carragher has been the embodiment of how the city likes to see itself: chippy, loquacious, witty, incorrigibly argumentative, perennially spoiling for some kind of fight and confident of winning it. He is a composite of so many quintessentially scouse details: Irish surname, Catholic mother, publican father, married to his childhood sweetheart, living close to where he grew up (although he did trade Bootle for verdant Blundellsands, a plush suburb beloved by footballers). His accent is the benchmark, the go-to when someone tries out an“Eeeerm”or an“Arrite ther”. He is so scouse that he avoids using a wallet, having been mocked by his friends for once doing so in his early 20s. Wallet use is, in some quarters of the city, seen as a transgression upon one’s scouseness; to have so many cards and coins to organise is to be acting above your station, or “wool behaviour” as it’s known internally. (A wool, or woolyback, is a historic, derogatory way of referring to non-Liverpudlians travelling in to the city from Cheshire or the Wirral.)Once an unglamorous utility player for a faded giant struggling to recapture its old form, Carragher now leads his more decorated peers in the art of talking about football. Since joining Sky Sports in 2013, to front its flagship analysis show, Monday Night Football, Carragher, and his old rival turned co-host, Gary Neville, have led a shift in the way the sport is discussed. They pioneered a style that embraced graphs and data points when “statistics” was still treated like a dirty word. They revelled in the detail of systems, shapes and formations, and offered insights that went into players’ minds and managers’ offices.With Neville stepping back last August, Monday Night Football has completed its years-long transition to becoming the Jamie Carragher show. Factor in the ceaseless stream of Carragher content – co-commentary on Sky’s Super Sunday games, regular interviews for Sky Sports News, guest spots on Neville’s spin-off podcasts, his pivotal role in Champions League coverage forCBSSports – and sometimes it seems the sport itself is heading that way, too. Able to channel his old-school football education, steeped in the tough-tackling, baggy-shirted Barclays of yore, with cutting edge insights and a knack for creating highly meme-able moments, he has become the face – and unlikely voice – of modern football punditry.Over the past decade or so, technology has transformed the experience of football. The days of checking the scores the next morning in the newspaper are, of course, long gone, but even watching the match and the post-match analysis feel like only a small slice of what football has become. Regrettably, from the point of view of the attention economy, a match only lasts 90 minutes – a pitifully small slice of the day. And so a whole universe of content – podcasts, TikTok and YouTube videos, Instagram reels, clips shared on X – has sprung up to fill the remaining minutes when football is not occurring. Sometimes, it can feel like football matches are played merely in order to provide the content for this great discourse machine.In this new world, every flavour of fandom is catered for. “There’s a whole host of people that want smarter, knowledgable commentary,” says Ted Knutson, the founder of the sports data firm Statsbomb, and an admirer of Carragher’s punditry. He pointed to the millions of Fantasy Premier League players seeking the latest data to stay ahead of their transfers. “They’re not a little subsection – that’s a lot of people who want better analysis.” On the other hand, there is the ever-more streamlined production line of hot takes, powered by pundits who are also full-time social media personalities. “You know,” Knutson bemoans, “where somebody says something big, and then we argue about it for a 48-hour media cycle, and then we recycle it with some other dumb take. It’s a very US-style approach.” Nobody, least of all Knutson, would accuse Carragher of being above this manner of punditry. “His job is his job,” he says, “Let’s not pretend that it’s not a volume-based industry.” But there is far more to Carragher than this.View image in fullscreenJamie Carragher argues with Gary Neville after Manchester United were awarded a penalty at Old Trafford in March 2010.Photograph: Michael Regan/Getty ImagesThe market for football punditry now demands a vast, almost contradictory, range of styles – from cool analysis to partisan rage, serious inquiry to breezy diversion – and Carragher is fluent in virtually all of them. As a generator of football content, he is unmatched. Each of his monologues can be spun off, by Sky Sports and increasingly others, into five or six different stories, from TikTok ragebait to measured analysis to 00s nostalgia – something for everyone, whether you like Carragher or not. If you’re not a fan of his, you are not alone, and Carragher is relaxed about it. He annoys his fellowLiverpoolsupporters by giving the club too hard a time; he annoys other fans who think he gives Liverpool too easy a ride. There are Evertonians who’ve never forgiven him for switching his allegiance to the red half of Liverpool, and Kopites who think he’s gone a little too showbiz since retirement. Erling Haaland, Mo Salah and Cristiano Ronaldo have all reacted negatively to his feedback, with Ronaldo once blanking him live on-air. All this, of course, makes for good numbers. “I’ve never met somebody as wholly unbothered by what people say about him on social media as Jamie is,” says Kate Scott, who presents CBS Sports’ Champions League coverage with Carragher. “He’s the king of understanding what will do well on socials, but he doesn’t allow it to move him.”Having finished filming, Carragher headed back through the foyer to one of the community centre’s classrooms, where he enjoyed a mug of soup made from vegetables grown in its garden, and then set about signing a stack of shirts and shoeboxes. Most Thursday afternoons, you will find Carragher here, working through a pile of merchandise with a Sharpie, effectively minting his own currency for local charities, hospitals and community groups to fundraise with. After that, he’ll say hello to the centre’s members, which means anyone who pays the £1 entry fee: veterans, pensioners, kids on half-term. If a game of football breaks out on the indoor pitch, he’s easily coaxed back inside to play centre-half.For years, it felt as if Carragher belonged exclusively to Liverpool, but his modern fame outstrips that of his playing days many times over. “I get stopped more now than I ever did as a player,” he told me. He can’t go two minutes in public without a honking car horn and a roar of “Carrraaaa!” dopplering past. He waves back with Pavlovian consistency.“Punditry used to feel like an add-on to the game,” Carragher mused, mopping up the last of his soup with a chunk of white bread. “But it almost feels like a game in itself these days. Are we storytellers? Are we characters? Are we both?”Monday Night Football begins,like so much else in the world, as an empty Google doc at the start of the working week. On one such mid-December Monday, I sat with the show’s production team in a glass meeting room on the fourth floor of the Keith Rupert Murdoch Building, the heart of the sprawling Sky Campus on the outer fringes of west London, as they began to turn the weekend’s WhatsApp messages into something approximating an agenda.Sweeping in at 10am, flanked by two video analysts and snacking from a punnet of impossibly tiny grapes, came Carragher. As always, he had spent the weekend obsessively watching every match he could, dutifully taking notes, before covering a chaotic Sunday afternoon tie between Tottenham and Chelsea, which saw him lambast both sides for defensive disorganisation. “We start every meeting the same way,” Carragher told me later, “It’s always: ‘What’s the story?’ That’s always the big thing: ‘What’s the story?’”The match they had lined up for this evening was a winter dogfight between West Ham and Wolves. Stats and graphs were shared around to support the narrative that was steadily taking shape in the room – that tonight’s match was the last chance saloon for both sides and their underperforming managers. As they thrashed it all out, David Jones, the show’s presenter, challenged the idea that Julen Lopetegui, West Ham’s coach, was under any great risk. “But he is!” Carragher retorted in an incredulous tone familiar to former teammates and viewers alike. “They’ve just lost back-to-back, how can you say he’s not?” (Lopetegui was fired weeks later.)Over the course of 90 minutes, the evening’s show came into focus. At one stage, with an astounding casualness – as if it was the natural next step of the conversation – Carragher sprang to his feet and, with the assistance of his two young “clip guys” playing the moments he’d asked for, started dissecting footage in real time, gesturing at a screen to highlight lapsed defensive lines and wasted touches. It was clear when he had been particularly persuasive: the team went quiet, the follow-up questions stopped and producer Jack Hazzard earmarked it for the show.In its most combative forms, Carragher’s punditry mirrors his playing style: verbal challenges, needly questions, sharp-edged jokes with the pointedness of a toe poke against the shin when the referee’s back is turned. Faced with opposing viewpoints, he piles on the pressure with a barrage of questions: “Why is that? But why is that? How can you think that?” When it comes to making his own points, however, today’s Carragher is more elegant than he ever was on the pitch. What begins as a simple question – ‘Cole Palmer: what are your thoughts?’ – can give rise to a mazy discourse that borders on the free-associative, touching on his own childhood, memories of a young Steven Gerrard, club ownership models, contract law, tactical flexibility, emotional maturity and the relationship between fans and managers, before neatly coming back to earth with a succinct point about Palmer’s eye for a through-ball. And after a decade on the air, he has learned to create as much for colleagues as he does for himself. “He’s always thinking one step ahead,” says Kate Scott, “he sets up the alley-oop for everyone else.”Today’s lead pundits don’t just arrive, talk football and leave, as ex-pros once did. Nowadays, you have to earn your keep. After lunch, on the day I visited, Carragher and Jones had been corralled into playing themselves for an advertising skit for Sky’s darts coverage. The concept was Monday Night Football – but for darts. A couple of Sky executives, watching from the sidelines, grimaced throughout. “This is crap,” one muttered, with some justification. But with Sky looking to push its darts coverage harder than ever, Carragher’s star power was deemed necessary to the effort.View image in fullscreenJamie Carragher on Marsh Lane in Bootle where he grew up.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianPromotional considerations taken care of, rehearsals for that night’s show began at 3pm with the arrival of guest host, the former West Ham, Spurs and England striker Jermain Defoe. He was greeted with big hugs and a round of stick from Carragher. “Get on you with the Dior clobber,” Carragher said, beaming. “Your diamond earring there as well, how much was that?” Defoe, though a veteran of the game, is still something of a novice pundit. This would be his Monday Night Football debut. Carragher, making his 184th appearance, coached him through the basics – standing behind Defoe, holding his shoulders, and showing him how to open up his body towards the camera and point toward the screen in a way that makes for good television. “I always describe it like being on a night out,” Carragher told me. “You’ve got so much going on in your head, hand-eye coordination, rhythm, stamina – by the end of the night you’re that wired, you can’t get to sleep.”On Monday Night Football, Carragher’s presentational tone is vaguely reminiscent of Neil Buchanan, another pioneering scouse educator, in the classic kids’ TV show Art Attack. He keeps his stance low, his sentences clipped and demonstrative as his body draws you to observe a player “there” – pause – “and over hee-yeh, right there”. The giant screen at the heart of the studio immerses Carragher in the passage of play and his body becomes the annotation, as he shuttles around to keep your eyes trained on the moments he’s trying to highlight. “That’s incredibly challenging to do,” says Statsbomb’s Ted Knutson, who has compared Carragher’s presentations to the calibre he’s seen first-hand in Premier League training grounds. “You need to make it really simple, and still have a very high impact.”How to move is one thing; what to say is another. “Whatever you do, don’t criticise Mo Salah or you’ll have hell to pay,” Carragher told Defoe. He puffed out his cheeks, “Honest to God, my social media.”About half an hour before the show was to begin, earpieces were fitted, and producer Hazzard’s voice – punctuated by occasional bleeps and cable static – began its weekly transmission directly into the pundit’s heads. Minutes before showtime, as clips were readied and graphics were finalised, the floor manager emerged to handle perhaps the most vital element of the production: what the panellists wanted to order from the Chinese takeaway in nearby Isleworth after the show. Satay chicken, concluded the Monday Night Football panel, with chicken balls, ribs, fried rice, and Carragher’s favourite, Singapore noodles.“Stand by. Coming to you, DJ,” Hazzard said to Jones through the wire. The camera blinked, and the team’s backs straightened. “Opening wipe, West Ham. Animate. Jamie, you’re next.”Carragher’s story really beginswith his name: James Lee Duncan Carragher. Both of his middle names are, in fact, a record of his father’s frustration with his beloved Everton side. On the day James was born, 28 January 1978, Everton were knocked out of the fifth round of the FA Cup by Middlesbrough, despite a spirited effort from substitute Duncan McKenzie, who had been dropped by manager Gordon Lee. Lee should’ve started Duncan, thought Carragher’s dad: and so, punditry is literally Jamie’s middle name.You can’t begin to understand Jamie Carragher until you’ve met Philly: his dad, coach and cornerman, and a formidable local figure in his own right. He is a man who makes his presence known. In the foreword for Carra, Carragher’s 2009 autobiography, Kenny Dalglish recalled his first meeting with Philly, at an under-10s match in 1990. At the time, Dalglish was Liverpool manager. When his son’s side conceded a late penalty, he complained from the stands. “Keep your fucking mouth shut, Dalglish,” roared Philly, prompting a set-to that firmly impressed the name Carragher into Dalglish’s mind. (“It was never a pen,” Dalglish maintained, although Philly and Kenny became friends long after.)Now 71, stout and sandy-haired, with the trademark Carragher squint and a gravelly voice from a different scouse vintage, Philly volunteered to pick me up from Liverpool Lime Street on the day I was due to meet Carragher at the Brunswick. The offer was intended as a warm welcome and as a vetting mission. He is fiercely protective of his first-born son – as many journalists have discovered, often through a follow-up phone call from Philly after having written something about “our James”.As Philly drove northwards from the city centre, we passed by derelict Victorian pubs, mammoth supermarkets and undeveloped flatland, before arriving, after about 10 minutes, in Bootle. Formerly a village, which became a town, briefly a seaside resort, and then a suburb for dockers, Bootle is both scouse and not: historically a part of Lancashire, run by Sefton council, and therefore lacking the city’s most cherished signifier of true scouse identity, the purple bin. It has a grand, Grade II-listed town hall, streets named after Oxford colleges, and was once the seat of a future Conservative prime minister, Andrew Bonar Law. It is also one of the poorest areas of the city. (“People in Bootle live 12 years less on average than people in Southport,” ran one Liverpool Echo headline in 2020.) As we drove past empty shop fronts draped in corrugated iron shutters, Philly gestured outward from the steering wheel. “It’s all gone to shit around here,” he said.The first few weeks of Carragher’s life were difficult. He was born with a rare condition called gastroschisis, meaning that his bowels protruded from his stomach. After an operation at Alder Hey children’s hospital, he spent six weeks in the neonatal unit. The only giveaway about his early health problems is that, owing to the surgery, he has no belly button. Carragher remains a dedicated fundraiser for the hospital. “I’ve worked with hundreds of footballers,” says his friend and charity partner, Mike Lepic, “and none of them come close to the amount of work Jamie does.” Along with his own charity, the 23 Foundation, Carragher also supports numerous local organisations, from the Liverpool Disabled Supporters Association to Football for Change, which he co-founded. In 2023, Carragher and his wife, Nicola, received personal commendations in the House of Lords and from the secretary for education for their work assisting a successful campaign tofit defibrillators at every schooland football pitch in Britain.View image in fullscreenJamie Carragher and Steven Gerrard with the European Champions League trophyafter Liverpool beat AC Milan on penalties in Istanbul in 2005.Photograph: Daily Mail/Rex/ShutterstockFamily and football were indivisible throughout Carragher’s childhood. As soon as he was a toddler, he’d join his dad on the touchline for amateur matches. In his autobiography, Carragher recalls being transfixed, “not only by the football but by the whole culture that accompanied it: the togetherness, the banter, the aggression, the celebrations in victory, the despair and conflict in defeat. I was eased into this world, then locked into it.” At home, as he grew older, he’d linger feverishly over copies of Shoot magazine, while wearing out his VHS tapes of famous Everton victories on Match of the Day, replaying and imitating them until he’d savoured every cadence. “Gray’s there again – oh, I say!” he’d repeat, doing his finest John Motson impression, in honour of Everton’s Andy Gray: the man he would later replace at Sky.Carragher’s obsession with the game was matched by a hyper-competitive streak on the pitch, as he realised the power that his enthusiasm could have against players less radically committed to football than he was. (“For me, winning was all that mattered,” he told aninterviewernot long ago. “When I played, I’d rather cheat and win than not win.”) From the age of seven, he barged his way into leagues full of players older than him, gaining a reputation as a prolific, pugnacious goalscorer. He found his way on to the radar of Liverpool’s School of Excellence, and even there, his attitude couldn’t be quelled, proudly wearing his Everton kit to training.He made his full Liverpool debut in January 1997 and, a few weeks later, he got his first Premier League start at Anfield. In those early days of his career, he still harboured a secret affection for his boyhood team. One persistent local rumour was that his trademark long sleeves were an effort to conceal an Everton tattoo. (“It doesn’t exist,” he writes in Carra. The reason, he explained, “is because I think I’ve got skinny arms.”) The moment he turned his back on the Blues came in a pub just off Marsh Lane, on 24 January 1999. Stopping into his staunchly Evertonian pub for a consolation drink after a bruising loss to Manchester United, Carragher found himself being treated “like any other ‘dirty’ Kopite”, he writes. At that, he rejected his former allegiances once and for all, as did his family.As a young player, his relationship with the media was not straightforward. In December 1998, Carragher, aged 20, made the cover of the News of the World, pictured at Liverpool’s Christmas party in the city centre, surrounded by strippers, dressed as Quasimodo and covered in whipped cream. It was a useful lesson on the nature of the tabloid press and the exposure that comes with celebrity – but instead of shying away from the media, as many young pros do, Carragher went in the opposite direction. “I loved getting interviewed,” he told me. “I used to look forward to them. I’d probably do two or three big interviews a season, because I loved talking about football.” He relished the chance to shape his own narrative. “When you’re a player, you can’t say what you think. You’ve always got to say what the club wants you to say. But in a big sit-down interview, you could get a few things off your chest –yourthoughts on the game.” Even back then, Carragher’s football knowledge was formidable. “He’s not a thick scouser from Bootle,” wrote Steven Gerrard in his autobiography. “Get Carra on past or present players, and he’ll rattle off their goal record, club history, strengths, weaknesses, birthplace and probably even their star sign and favourite holiday destination.”The pinnacle of his playing career came against AC Milan in the 2005 Champions League final. That night he put his encyclopedic football knowledge to good use. The game came down to a penalty shootout, and Carragher advised goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek to wiggle his arms and legs frantically in the shootout, in homage to Bruce Grobbelaar in Liverpool’s last successful European Cup effort two decades prior. Dudek’s antics succeeded, Milan fluffed their lines, and Carragher’s side stole perhaps the most famous victory in the competition’s history, having come back from 3-0 down. “I noticed the difference before and after we won,” Carragher told me. “I became one of the players that people wanted to speak to.”For eight more seasons, he served as bedrock and vice-captain for the Liverpool side, a dependable figure in a sometimes dismal era, before calling time on his playing career in 2013. He was hoping he might become part of the coaching staff, but it didn’t work out. The summer before his retirement, he made his on-screen debut for ITV’s pundit panel during Euro 2012. He’d enjoyed himself, and producers had taken notice. “I started to get people asking the question, ‘Do you want to be a pundit?’ And in the back of my mind I thought, ‘Yeah, I’d love that.’”Ever since the inceptionof the Premier League in 1992, Monday Night Football has been one of the foundations of Sky’s coverage. The modern era of MNF began in 2011, when the recently retired Manchester United captain, Gary Neville, began his stint on the show. “People talk about him changing punditry, and he did,” Carragher told me, as we sat in the catacombs of the Sky Sports compound in a brief moment between production meeting and rehearsal. “He was absolutely amazing.”Neville lifted the lid on the kind of video analysis used at the highest level of the game. “He looked at how Stoke were defending set pieces in zonal marking,” says Gary Hughes, Sky Sports’ director of football. “No one ever talked about how a team presses before.” That may be something of an exaggeration, but the broad strokes are true. Within 18 months, Neville took the show from a relic of the old era to a symbol of the new: younger, more combative and social media-friendly. His squealing “oohhOOOOOhhhhhhh” – quickly dubbed the “goalgasm” – in response to a late Chelsea goal against Barcelona was an early viral sensation.Gary Neville’s ‘goalgasm’GuardianIn 2013, as Neville was making a name for himself as a pundit for Sky, Carragher was starting to attract interest from rival TV operations. Neville told me: “I got a call from our producer, Scott Melvin, who said that Jamie Carragher is speaking to another channel.” He was – and it was Sky’s biggest challenger in a decade, BT Sport, who had spent millions on securing 18 big fixtures for the forthcoming season. BT wanted their own lead analyst to challenge Sky’s grip on Premier League coverage. Carragher told Sky that only one thing could tempt him to turn down BT: a spot alongside Neville on Monday Night Football. “I could have finished Carragher’s punditry career at that point, if I’d said no,” Neville told me, in a tone that didn’t sound like joking. “But actually, I said: ‘No, I think it’s the right moment to change.’” Carragher announced his Sky deal in the days prior to his retirement, and a miniaturised SkyPad was promptly shipped to his house so he could learn how to master the show’s famous “tactics table”.And so began one of the most compelling double-acts in British broadcasting history: two men who, on the pitch, had embodied their rival clubs and their cities on a spiritual level, now working side by side. Carragher arrived to a show that was thoroughly Neville’s domain: he had to deal with the perception of simply being the “mouth” of the show, where Neville was the “brain”, the better analyst. He also had to learn the mechanics of live broadcasting. On his first episode the touch screen froze for “what felt like 10 seconds, but was probably two”, he recalled. “I froze, and someone in my earpiece says to try again. I say ‘Oh, OK’ – but I say it out loud, on air, to no one.” For weeks after, the crew would greet Jamie with “Oh, OK” at every opportunity.In those early episodes, Carragher and Neville looked somewhat stiff and awkward in their oversized suits, but things sparked to life when they started bickering. As they grew more comfortable on camera, they turned arguing over football into a fine art. A typical row would feature any, if not all, of the following: Neville’s smirking and raising his eyebrows as Carragher laboured a point; Carragher’s judicious use of “Gary Neville” in the third person (Turns to camera:“What is Gary Neville on about?”); Neville issuing a cutting, patronising “James” to bring Carragher back to heel; Carragher’s dismissals growing more fervent as the TV voice fell away and he sped up to natural pace, attacking the point in full scouse flow, thrusting his body forward and back with every rebuttal, as if he was about to punch Neville. And then Carragher’s laugh, cannily deployed to defuse the situation or to further the insult.Even more than most pundits, the duo became symbols: Neville something like the representative of English football’s establishment – Manchester United, the FA, the referees, the managers, the rules – Carragher more like the puckish spirit of the sport: a diehard fan who just happens to have been a player. The pair’s clashes, over VAR or changes in the offside rule, felt real and existential, which made their points of consensus – like on the short-lived proposal of the European Super League, decried by the pair for a whole episode of Monday Night Football – seem more of an occasion.As Twitter reached its imperial pomp in the mid-2010s, Carragher and Neville became fully developed cross-platform characters, skewering each other on screen and online as often as they could. Sky Sports relished clipping this up for digital consumption, and devising new scenarios to wring every last bit of monetisable content from their two leading men. There are compilations of their most competitive moments: everything from indoor cricket to stag-do-style zorbing, step-climbing, present-wrapping, shuttle sprints, darts, trivia. Taken as a viewing experience, they feel less like punditry and more like sketch comedy.View image in fullscreenJack Grealish of Manchester City jokes with Jamie Carragher after an interview with CBS TV at the Etihad Stadium in May 2023.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThese moments are the progenitors of strange new developments in football broadcasting. Take The Overlap on Tour, Sky’s picaresque travelogue series where Carragher, Neville and Roy Keane roll through the continent, kissing the Blarney Stone or zip-lining through the mountains of Abruzzo. We are a long way from a bunch of ex-pros watching a game and sharing opinions on it. Neville’s roundtable podcast, Stick to Football, is weirder still: the venue is somewhere between a hotel breakfast buffet and the dream room from Twin Peaks, where every Premier League legend is inexplicably hanging out and making small talk with one another, over croissants and bottles of Huel. This universe of football-adjacent content, where former players chit-chat with the easy candour of dads around a barbecue, seems designed to remind you that your idols are not gods, just largely unremarkable middle-aged men who watch the same sport you do.Sky has offered versions of this for years – take Soccer AM, for instance – and the broadcaster didn’t invent comic football entertainment. But Carragher and Neville were the line in the sand between the pundits of old and the new wave, as they became characters that lived on your screen, on your feed, in your ears and in your head once the show was over – figures that now lived in the imaginations of every fan, not just their own club’s. “When I was a player, what I said probably wouldn’t have affected Arsenal supporters or Tottenham or Aston Villa,” Carragher told me. “But now, because you speak about everybody’s team, everyone feels they have ownership of you.” More platforms, and greater exposure, meant that fans, players and pundits could all duke points out in real time, all part of the same ceaseless flow of discourse.As a pundit, Carragher cultivated a reputation for giving back to all comers, a tendency that, in March 2018, nearly cost him his job. After a Liverpool defeat, he was driving down the famous East Lancs – the A-road connecting Liverpool and Manchester, whether they want it to or not – when another driver spotted him and started to goad him,filming himfrom an open window while chanting “2-1! Unlucky, lad! 2-1!” Suddenly, as the video of the incident mortifyingly shows, Carragher volleyed a mouthful of water toward the car, catching the opposing driver’s teenage daughter in the crossfire. A swift suspension by Sky, a full apology and a brutal Sky News interview allowed him, eventually, to return. He rejoined the Sky Sports team the following season.It was around this time that Neville began to pull away from Monday Night Football. “I’d done it for six years, and you can only talk about right backs and left backs, or left- and right-wingers, so many times,” he told me. He reduced his commitments, suggesting that different guests step in to take his place – an early iteration of the form that the show takes today. By the end of last season, Neville said that he had “got to the point where I thought, ‘This isn’t for me any more. I’ve done this. I’ve done everything I can.’” And with that, the era of Jamie and Gary – which helped define the coverage of the modern game – came to a quiet close. (“I still do the first one of the season,” Neville said with a smile, “because they like to get our predictions, so they can see how badly we’ve done at the end.”)Now steering solo, Carragher is determined that his Monday Night Football stays on the bleeding edge of football discourse. “You can never stand still,” he told me. “I never want to be someone who keeps talking about ‘in my day’. What are the managers doing now? What are the modern things they’re looking at? What are the training techniques? What are the stats we’re looking at? That’s what I want us to be.”If Monday Night Football Carragheris the football nerd, then the Carragher who appears on US TV is a different proposition: looser, more relaxed, as befits a show where the aim is less to impart information than to build a connection between the viewer and the hosts.The origins of the CBS Champions League show go back to the summer of 2020 when, in the midst of the first lockdown, Pete Radovich arrived in London from New York. Radovich, decorated producer of Inside the NFL, had only six weeks to find a studio, staff and talent, in time for the launch of Paramount’s new Champions League show on CBS. “I made a few phone calls to people I knew in London, and just asked, ‘Hey, if you were me, who would you start with?’ Every single person said: ‘Gary Neville.’ Every single person.”Negotiations with Neville, however, soon ran aground. “We were apart on money,” said Radovich. “We were apart on workload.” As they mulled alternatives, Radovich started paying more attention to Neville’s Monday Night Football co-host, Carragher. “I saw him and thought, ‘He’s our Phil Simms.’” Simms, as Radovich helpfully explained, was Inside the NFL’s Mr Versatile: able to switch between breaking down plays and bringing down the house with one-liners. He saw the same in the argumentative, analytical Carragher, but had one nagging fear – his accent.“One of my very first questions, if not first, was: ‘Hey, can you dial back the scouse? Is that a thing that you can do?’” Radovich recalled. “And he said, ‘Absolutely.’” (Carragher concedes the existence of his TV voice, although does so in a robustly scouse way: “Me family says I have, yeah. It’s natural when you’re on TV.”) Radovich loves to tell the story of the test that earned Carragher his spot on the CBS panel. The network’s three executives took recordings of Jamie’s voice back to their wives, and if they deemed him to be intelligible, the job was his. “He won by a vote of two to one, and that was the deciding factor, I shit you not,” said Radovich.View image in fullscreenCarragher (second right) with Kate Scott, Thierry Henry and Micah Richards during the CBS’s coverage of the Champions League semi-final between Manchester City and Real Madrid in 2023.Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt/AMA/Getty ImagesCarragher joined his new colleagues at Stockley Park, a stone’s throw from the Premier League’s VAR control room. Alongside him were Ballon d’Or host Kate Scott and Micah Richards in the studio, and roving reporter Peter Schmeichel in the field. Radovich cites the show’s first production meeting as the model for the show itself. “I get there, and Jamie’s already giving Peter Schmeichel some stick, Peter’s giving Jamie stick. Forty-five minutes go by until Kate asks, ‘Should we start to plan the show?’, and it hit me: this should be the show.” “It’s really like a family,” as Thierry Henry, who joined the team later, likes to summarise it. “I’m more serious, you have Micah’s laughs, Jamie’s spikiness and Kate’s the big sister who keeps us in check.”If you’ve seen them on-screen in the UK, it’s most likely you’ve seen them clipped up into YouTube summaries or TikTok highlights: a blessing and a curse for UCL Today, which enjoys huge numbers on social media, along with a reputation – to the producers’ slight chagrin – for being light on analysis. “I’ve been watching coverage of the sport in America my whole life,” Radovich told me. “It was all over the map. ‘This is why X player is like LeBron James’, ‘This is the offside rule’. When we took it over, we decided we were going high-level, to make coverage that could play in Europe and nobody would be offended.” The show’s analysis, for the American audience that gets to see it, is excellent. It is little more than a quirk of European sports rights as to why we can’t see Henry and Carragher dissecting Lamine Yamal’s body positioning, or the way Denzel Dumfries strikes a dead ball. Those images belong to another broadcaster, packaged in a different deal, meaning that only viewers in the US can see them. CBS navigates this by showcasing all of the bits that make UCL Today format-breaking, without the substance that grounds it in conventional sports broadcasting.Leading that effort is Carragher. “He’s good at giving you high-level analysis, but he can make it understandable to me, who’s never played the game,” says Kate Scott. Radovich, who has worked with Super Bowl winners and broadcasting legends, agrees. “You can count on one hand the pundits who have figured out the analysis side of the job and the entertainment side of the job,” he says. “Jamie gets it. When I asked everyone: ‘Who should I speak to first?’ Five years ago, the answer was Gary Neville. We’ve come to a point where if I made that same call today, it might be a different answer.”Saliba can’t play without Gabriel. Marc Cucurella has been a different player this season. Myles Lewis-Skelly is incredible. Nottingham Forest’s push for Europe wasn’t a fluke. Szoboszlai’s energy is vitally important to Liverpool. Liam Delap shouldn’t move to Manchester United; Matheus Cunha should. These are, at the time of print, Carragher’s last seven publicly stated opinions, expressed on the final Monday Night Football of the season; chopped up into a trio of YouTube clips, already tipping a million views; quoted in 34 articles at the time of press, from the Daily Mail to the Shields Gazette. By the time you read this, there’ll be more: more quotes, further takes, still more opinions about Carragher’s opinions.The constant static of the discourse isn’t quite so deafening on Marsh Lane. When he was finished with his vegetable soup back at the Brunswick, Carragher invited me out for a short tour of the universe: The Salisbury, Philly’s old pub; Dong Sing’s, “the chippy” – which in Liverpool, often means a Chinese takeaway; the family church, St James’, known locally as “Bootle Cathedral”; and the 20-foot mural of the two Carraghers: young, blue and Bootle’s own; old, red and Liverpool’s. As we walked, old ladies stopped him in the street. He seemed to know them all – he either went to school with their sons or played football with them somewhere along the way.Before I left, Carragher recommended I seek out his very first interview, a snapshot from the dank, heady fug of teenage victory over West Ham in the 1996 FA Youth Cup final. Aged just 16, in a dressing room full of raucous young players enjoying their first real taste of silverware, Carragher is remarkably calm. His haircut is the same as it is today. His mouth dictates the motion of his whole face, as it still does to this day. His accent is squeakier, sharper on the ear, yet to be smoothed out by media training. YouTube’s auto-translate assumes he’s speaking Polish. Despite the revelry in the background, he’s blunt and to the point: “Thought we played well, bit of a bad stAAArt” – his voice cracks, before he responds to some rapid-fire follow-ups. “What score was it at the end? 2-1? 3-1? Probably should’ve scored more …”The impossible job: inside the world of Premier League refereesRead moreSome might remark upon his transformation from the shouty, puce-faced visage of unbridled emotion that he seemed through the height of his playing days, to the cerebral pundit and consummate broadcaster he has emerged as 30 years later – but to do so would be to suggest a change that, by all accounts, hasn’t taken place. “That’s how I am,” he told me of that first interview. “That’s me as a football fan, that was me as a player, that’s me as a person.”I took a final walk, alone, through Bootle, back towards the station and into the centre of town when my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was Philly, calling to ask how the day went.Follow the Long Read on Twitter at@gdnlongread, listen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere."

It reflects a massive war crime, as the international criminal court has alreadycharged, and arguablygenocide. But it in no sense justifies the murder of two young Israeli embassy workers in Washington by a man who thenchanted: “Free, free Palestine”. Nothing justifies violence against civilians.The killing of Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrimoccurredon Wednesday evening outside the Capital Jewish Museum, where the American Jewish Committee was hosting a reception for young diplomats. The suspect, identified as Elias Rodriguez of Chicago, was detained shortly after the shooting. His social media accounts indicated that he had been involved in pro-Palestinian activism.Beyond that, we don’t know exactly what motivated him, but he is likely to have acted in retaliation for Israeli atrocities in Gaza. That would be unequivocally wrong.That is not to deny the severity of what Israel is doing in Gaza. As the news spread of the killings in Washington, Israeli strikes in Gaza killedat least 86 people, according to Gaza’s health ministry. After an11-weektotal blockade of Gaza, Israel has begun to allow in a merepittanceof humanitarian aid. Even the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, described it as “minimal”, just enough to avoid problems with the US government. At least 29 children and elderly people have already died from “starvation-related” deaths in recent days, the Palestinian health ministersaid, warning that thousands more are at risk.To make matters worse, Netanyahu has expanded his war aims. No longer is he seeking only the release of Hamas’s hostages and its relinquishment of power. He now alsosaysthat Israel will not stop fighting untilDonald Trump’s grotesque plan to expel all Palestinians from Gaza is implemented – a massivewar crimeand likely crime against humanity.International humanitarian law, or the laws of war, donotapply to the gunman in Washington. That law is meant for governments and organized military forces. By all appearances the gunman was acting on his own. But the principles of international humanitarian law can help us to assess this crime.A basic premise of that law is that war crimes by one side never justify war crimes by the other. The duty to comply with international humanitarian law is absolute, notreciprocal.That same law mandates thatciviliansare never legitimate targets unless they take a direct part in hostilities. The two victims in Washington were doing no such thing. Lischinsky, was reported to be a research assistant in the political department at the Israeli embassy. Milgrim organized trips to Israel. Neither activity is remotely military in nature. These two young adults would be utterly inappropriate targets even in war, and needless to say, there is no war in Washington.Frustration at Israeli atrocities in Gaza is understandable. There seems to be nothing that the Israeli government can do that would stop Trump from continuing to arm and fund it. But endorsing murder because of the other side’s atrocities is a sure path to a bloodbath. Indeed, it was that war-crime logic that seems to have led the Israeli government, responding to Hamas’s murder and abduction of civilians on 7 October 2023, to have pursued its war in Gaza withlittle regardfor the lives of Palestinian civilians that it has killed in the tens of thousands.Difficult as it may be to accept, the proper response to Israeli war crimes is condemnation, prosecution and halting the arming and funding of these atrocities, but not acts of violence against civilians who are somehow associated with Israel or its government.But that is not a point the Israeli government seems to want to make. Having itself engaged in tit-for-tat killings, the Israeli government instead tried to profit from the disturbing episode by blaming its critics. Israel’s foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar,said: “The attack is the direct consequence of the virulent and toxic antisemitic rhetoric against Israel and Jewish communities around the world that has been going on since October 7.”What did you do during the genocide in Gaza? | Arwa MahdawiRead moreThat is wrong on two counts. First, there is no evidence that the gunman acted because of Israel’s critics as opposed to Israel’s conduct. Second, itcheapensthe concept of antisemitism to equate it with legitimate criticism of Israeli war crimes. Antisemitism is a real and growing problem, but if the concept is misused to deflect condemnation of Israeli atrocities, it weakens protection for Jews around the world.There are lessons to be drawn from this tragedy. Critics of the Israeli government’s atrocious conduct in Gaza should be clear that their focus is the authors: Netanyahu, the generals directing the slaughter, and the soldiers carrying it out, but not the Israeli people, not people who happen to work as civilians for the Israeli government, and not Jews.The Israeli government might also reconsider its policy of endless reprisals. Not that I am holding my breath in anticipation, but it is nice to think that the needless and unjustified killing of these two young embassy workers could prompt a rethinking of the government’s own callous treatment of Palestinian civilians, whose horrible and mounting death toll is also needless and unjustified.Kenneth Roth, former executive director of Human Rights Watch (1993-2022), is a visiting professor at Princeton’s School of Public and International Affairs.

The United States’ later descent into civil war over slavery would prove Lincoln right. But is 21st-century Britain now also becoming, in its different way, an unsustainably divided house too? And have Britain’s economic divisions become so intractable that the UK state can no longer manage them? More than at any time in the postwar era, the answer to both questions looks increasingly like yes.History shows that Britain’s capacity for pragmatic resilience in the face of internal and external threat is not to be underestimated. Wednesday’spartial climbdownon winter fuel payments was an example of that instinct for self-preservation at work. Yet the U-turn will not have restored the public’s lost trust in the ability of government to solve their problems.Keir Starmer has inherited this uneasy long-term decline, not created it. His“island of strangers” remarkslast week were one attempt to respond. But immigration is not the sole cause of division. Centrifugal forces have been making the United Kingdom a more fragmented country for much of the past half century. Public confidence in this country’s system of government hasreached record lows. There is little evidence of a cohesive or collaborative political economic purpose that might mark a nation more at ease with itself. The May local elections, which have now triggered the winter fuel rethink, were a powerful sign of how the divisions could easily deepen further.On Friday, Starmer will attempt to remedy another part of the problem he faces. To some, theCouncil of the Nations and Regionswill sound merely like a politicians’ talking shop. Let’s be frank, there is a risk it could become just that. Nor will a Britain whose discontents are fundamentally economic and aspirational be transformed by a constitutional innovation. But this second meeting of the council, which was promised in Labour’s election manifesto and which met first in October, is nevertheless a fundamental test. Put simply, Friday will show whether modern British governance is up to the job.The council is a distant cousin of a proposal that Gordon Brown devised when Starmer’s Labour was still in opposition at Westminster. Under Brown’s ambitious plans, the council would ultimately have formed the basis of a new upper house of the UK parliament, replacing the unelected House of Lords with a more federally conceived body. That project never reached the Labour manifesto in 2024, and there is zero sign that Starmer, let alone the Labour peers, want to revive it in any way.Instead, and according to the Cabinet Office website, the new council is “designed to facilitate partnership working between the UK government, devolved governments, the mayor of London, and mayors of combined authorities and mayors of combined county authorities”. The wordiness of that language underlines that this is not the council’s final form, since Labour’s English devolution plans remain work in progress, and because much of the council’s potential role is extremely ill-defined.All this reflects the continuing piecemeal way that devolution has taken root in a system of government that still insists the UK parliament’s decisions are sovereign. From the 1990s on, UK governments have tended to turn to devolved solutions only at times of crisis in the non-English nations. One result is that some in Westminster and Whitehall still see devolution as something that happens somewhere else.Those instincts were given full rein under the anglocentric prime ministerships of Boris Johnson and Liz Truss. Both leaders had a tin ear for and a visceral dislike of devolution. Johnson called devolution a disaster, and tried to subvert it in his UK internal market act. Neither he nor Truss ever respected the devolution settlement or consulted the devolved governments on anything important,as Covid would exemplify. The hostility was roundly reciprocated.The council’s first meeting came at a propitious moment for Starmer. He was not seen as hostile to devolution, as the defeated Tories had been, while Labour’s UK general election success had made Scotland’s Scottish National party government less openly combative. With the English mayors attending, it was an overwhelmingly Labour gathering, happy to embrace the new UK prime minister and the new era he promised.That seems like another country now. In Scotland, John Swinney’s SNP has its confidence back, and is positioned to beat Labour in next year’s Holyrood election. In England, Reform UK has captured coveted mayoralties inHull and East Yorkshire, and in Greater Lincolnshire. Reform UK has its eyes on more mayoralties in 2026, as well as on winning the Welsh Senedd and on becoming at least thesecond party at Holyrood. The upshot is a much more challenging political environment for Starmer, making attempts at “partnership working” more problematic. At the same time, it also puts pressure on Reform UK’s mayors. Do they engage? Or grandstand? Or even turn up?Yet none of these new tensions weakens the case for collaboration between governments and with mayors. “The key question is: what is the council for?” Prof Michael Kenny argued this week. Last week, Kenny and colleagues from Cambridge University’s Bennett Institutepublished a reportwith Policywise broadly supporting the thinking behind the council, but lamenting its repeated lack of clarity. “It’s not a decision-making body, but it ought to be more clearly structured,” Kenny told me.Another crucial issue, according toGlasgow University’s Prof Nicola McEwen, is that attenders have such different powers. In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland there is clear legislative devolution. Almost nothing of that sort exists in England, where there is no national parliament and mayoral powers are strictly limited from the centre. The danger is that the council becomes all talk and no action. “There are risks in stretching the concept of devolution to include both the intergovernmental relationship with the nations and the functional relationship with the mayors,” McEwen warns.This may all seem somewhat academic, but don’t be deceived. This stuff really matters. Without collaboration between the different parts of the UK’s increasingly devolved system of governance, no government – whether at the UK, the devolved national, or the English regional – is going to achieve its priorities. If Starmer wants his growth agenda or the reset with Europe to work, he needs the give and take that cooperation with the devolved bodies can give. Likewise, if Swinney’s SNP wants to deliver on things such as the abolition of child poverty, it cannot do it without the UK’s help.The collaborative political impulse is not widespread among Westminster parties. Luckily for Starmer, his Paisley-born colleague Pat McFadden, the cabinet minister responsible for making the council work, definitely gets the realities. It may not suit the tribalists in UK politics to admit it, but collaborative government is the way Britain has to be governed now. This week’s council may seem a sideshow to some. Yet it could hold the key to whether public confidence in politics begins to grow again.Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnistThis article was amended on 22 May 2025.

What started off as a series of pleasantries about golfbetween the US president and South African president Cyril Ramaphosa’s delegationquickly turned into a lecture – complete with a video screening and reams of printed-out news articles – about how a white genocide is supposedly under way in my home country.The delegation was largely successful in correcting that narrative. It emphasised that crime affects South Africans of all races and that white citizens are not specifically targeted. Zingiswa Losi, president of the Congress of South African Trade Unions, rightly pointed out that in rural areas, it is Black women who bear the brunt of violent crime.On the surface, this might all seem like a familiar conflict – one between Trump’s deluded and emboldened hard-right vision of the world and a country’s leadership trying its best to stick to the facts without aggrieving the beast too much (SouthAfricais still facing 30% tariffs, after all). But as an investigative journalist and researcher who focuses on land dispossession and reform in South Africa, to me the encounter looked different. All I could see was a missed opportunity.One spark for this ongoing showdown between the Maga movement in the US (allied with some white Afrikaners in South Africa) and the African National Congress (ANC) government has been the introduction of a land reform act that was passed in January. The law aims to address the inequalities of the white-minority-rule era by tackling an issue that has been ignored for too long in post-apartheid South Africa and lies at the root of many of our problems: land. To explain why, let me return to the subject of golf – a subject that feels all the more appropriate given that, at Trump’s request, Ramaphosa’s delegation included professional golfersErnie Els and Retief Goosen.1:12Donald Trump ambushes South Africa's president with video falsely claiming white genocide – videoI’ve written extensively about golf courses and golf estates. Take the suburb of Fourways in northern Johannesburg, which contains some of the most exclusive and luxurious golf estates in the country. With homes that sell for tens of millions of rands, these enclaves serve South Africa’s wealthy elite. Among their many amenities such as private lagoons, nature trails, sports fields and high-end restaurants, the most coveted is safety. In a city with high rates of car hijackings and home invasions, their surveillance systems, access control and electrified perimeter walls offer peace of mind that is a luxury in Johannesburg.Inside those walls lies a world largely insulated from the realities of South Africa – a world that is overwhelmingly white, even thoughmore than 80%of the South African population is Black.Before Fourways became a hub of luxury living, it was an agricultural region made up of farms and smallholdings. The land was seized in the 19th century by Afrikaner settlers who forced the original Black residents into labour tenancies. Stripped of land rights, those tenants could only stay on their ancestral land if they worked it for the settlers.In the 1980s, as apartheid began to falter and the prospect of democracy grew, many white landowners sold their farms to private developers and fled the area or the country. The labour tenants were left behind, only to be forcibly relocated to underresourced townships such as Alexandra and Soweto. They lost not just their homes and livelihoods but also family graves and burial plots that could not be moved.Some 30 years into democracy, the former labour tenants of Fourways, like the majority of South African land claimants, are still trapped in a backlogged, corrupted land-claims process with their hope dwindling that they’ll ever be granted compensation or restoration of their land rights.This is why it’s so tragic that Ramaphosa’s team has been framing the failure of land reform as proof of successful race relations. It’s as if they’re effectively saying: “Look – there can be no ‘white genocide’ in South Africa because white people own72% of farmland!” This is factually correct. However, our inability to redistribute land, and thus create a more equitable and sustainable South Africa, is not a marker of national unity. It is the ANC’s most glaring policy failure, one the government is only belatedly trying to fix with this controversial law.Trump ambushes South African president with video and false claims of anti-white racismRead moreThe crowded, impoverished townships where the state relocated Black South Africans under theGroup Areas Actremain among the most dangerous places in the country. Generations of South Africans have been cut off from the wealth-building power of land ownership. Here’s the key point: this economic exclusion, combined with mass unemployment, fuels the very crime that the delegation insisted affects everyone equally.I appreciate that it may not have been the right occasion and Trump was probably not a receptive audience for a nuanced conversation. Still, it saddens me to think of the resources poured into this mission to correct the damage being wrought by a malicious, white supremacist agenda in South Africa and the US. Meanwhile the historically dispossessed South Africans who need these resources most are left to flounder, overlooked as the true victims of the violence of the apartheid regime and the dark shadow it has cast over our young democracy.Most Black South Africans will never be able to afford to move to areas such as Fourways. They live in places the government once designated for removal, with limited access to jobs, safety or infrastructure. They are the ones most exposed to violent crime, not those living in fortified golf estates and large fortified farms.Zanele Mji is a writer, investigative journalist and podcaster based in Johannesburg, South AfricaExplore more on these topicsSouth AfricaOpinionRaceCyril RamaphosaDonald TrumpAfricacommentShareReuse this content"

The prime minister announced in the Commons that he would look again at the £11,500 threshold over which pensioners are no longer eligible for the payment, meaning that more pensioners will again be eligible for the benefit. As a Labour MP who voted against the cut, I think the government should go further.During the election, I promised I would defend the community I represent, fight for working-class people and stand by my principles. And so I could not in all conscience vote forthe removal of the winter fuel paymentfrom up to 10 million pensioners as one of the first actions of the new Labour government in September. Approximately 17,000 people in my constituency lost their winter fuel payment. Similar numbers can be seen in constituencies throughout the country.When I think of today’s pensioners, I recall the great generation of working-class people who rebuilt the nation after the second world war. I worked in the clothing factories in Leeds when I left school, and in the building industry in Yorkshire. I saw that generation work hard to create the wealth that we see today. There were others who served in the armed forces. I represent many pensioners who worked in the coalmines. Their work was dangerous. It was hard and it was dirty. They helped create the light, heat and power for our homes and industries.We owe that whole generation a debt of gratitude. It is right that we have tried to secure a decent pension for all by maintaining the triple lock. It was right too that in Gordon Brown’s first budget in 1997,Labourvoted to introduce the winter fuel payment to ease the burden on cold winter days. I was proud that day to vote for it.The point has been made that the payment – of £200 or £300, paid annually in autumn to all pensioners – unjustly handed money to wealthy people. That may be so in a small number of cases. But the truth is that the £11,500 cut-off point was so low that itthrew at least 100,000 people into hardshipat the most difficult time of the year, just as autumn was slowly going to turn into winter. It was brutal in its implementation since pensioners didn’t have time to adjust their household budget before the frosts arrived.Some have said that we should restore the payment to save the Labour party at the ballot box. I say something different. Government policy ought to be guided by true Labour values, not just electoral calculations. Pay respect to pensioners, and accept that the payment cut was an error in judgment. Cuts to sickness and disability benefits also need to be completely rethought.But all this leads to a bigger question. Why did the government make these mistakes? The answer is simple. Last year, the country voted for change, not the continuation of austerity. Yet the government has become entrapped by a stale economic orthodoxy made in the Treasury and in the Bank of England. We need to break free from this narrow mindset. We should build a fiscal framework that addresses the realities of food bank Britain, its profound inequalities, broken public services and declining infrastructure.Some will say we can’t afford to look after our pensioners. But this is one of the richest countries in the world. Only this week, we learned that the richest 50 families in the UKown more wealththan half of the population (34 million people). Would those families really begrudge helping out the generation that helped to create the wealth they now own? And if they do begrudge it, ought we really take those opinions into account? I believe it’s time we taxed the wealth of the richest individuals in the country.There are two final questions the government needs to answer. First, when will pensioners know if and when their winter fuel payments will be restored? The prime minister says he will make an announcement at the next fiscal event – but that isn’t due until the autumn. It surely cannot be the case that pensioners will be left uncertain as to what will happen in the winter.And my second question is: will the prime minister and chancellor apologise for the anxiety and stress so many people experienced during the winter’s cold dark nights?It’s time for Labour MPsto stand up and be counted. Let’s insist on keeping faith with the central values of the British people who – above all things – want a country based on fairness. Justice for pensioners would be a good place to start.Jon Trickett is the MP for Normanton and Hemsworth in West Yorkshire and former member of the shadow cabinetExplore more on these topicsFuel povertyOpinionLabourKeir StarmerBenefitsPovertyEnergy billsTax and spendingcommentShareReuse this content"

But not all the old traditions should be forgottenThu 22 May 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 22 May 2025 14.17 EDTShareMany years ago, as part of a school homework project, I asked my grandparents what the most significant social change had been during their lifetime. Two of them answered “child mortality”. I was surprised. Weren’t there other, more significant experiences in long lives that had stretched from the first and second world wars to the 1980s?But now that I am older and have experienced bereavement, I understand their replies. Both grandparents had sisters who died of diphtheria. And my grandfather’s younger brother died of sepsis, meaning his parents had buried two of their four children before the age of three. Their childhoods had been profoundly shaped by loss. Child mortality was, at that time, horrifyingly common, and from their earliest years many people spent a great deal of their lives coping with theemotional fallout of grief, which shaped their lives into older age.I have spent the past 10 years researching the history of death, while also training as a bereavement counsellor. In my book, No Ordinary Deaths – A People’s History of Mortality, I argue that we have much to learn from the past, particularly in the compassion shown to those facing the end of life, and those struggling with the emotional chasm of grief and loss.The differences between today and the past of even a few generations ago are enormous. Today, most people die in hospitals or care homes, but until well into the 20th century most died at home. Relatives or close friends usually washed and prepared the body for burial. The time between death and burial were understood as a dangerous and unstable moment for the spirit, and some communities developed elaborate wake rituals that could involve smoking, drinking, singing, games and “trickster” antics (such as lowering a shrouded body down the chimney, as recorded once in 19th-century Wales, presumably to distract any passing demons from stealing away with the soul).Wakes could last anything fromhours to daysand even weeks; an issue that horrified 19th-century public health campaigners. Indeed, such practices were regularly cited as one of the main reasons why burial reform was required, demanding that funerals should happen swiftly after death, and graveyards be moved away from city centres and into the suburbs.Nowadays, dying and death are, at least in wealthy, western societies, mostly institutionally managed and medically determined. Unless we work in healthcare or emergency services, seeing a dead body is a relatively unusual experience. And we can usually pinpoint the moment of death.Without easy access to a doctor, a stethoscope (not invented until 1816) or the technology we have today to assess when heartbeat and brain function have stopped, the end of life used to be open to all kinds of interpretation. A mirror, a feather to the lips, the last rasp of agonies, a magpie landing on the roof, a black dog barking – all kinds of signs and symbols could signify the end. But until the body began to putrefy, which could take several days, the time between alive-but-near-the-end and dead was not always precise. Watching for signs of death and caring for the dying was a skilled role often undertaken by older women, who offered comfort and gathered family, friends and priest to the bedside when they assessed the moment of death was approaching.The moment of death was particularly important as it marked the beginning of activities to protect the spiritual integrity of the soul, which may include lighting candles (light around the dead was very important), cleaning and dressing the body, closing or placing coins on the eyes, and bringing aromatic herbs or personal items such as rosary beads, a favourite toy (for a child), a treasured cup or plate to be tucked in with the body. It is probable that placing such grave goods is a pre-Christian practice and may hold several meanings. Perhaps these were considered objects that would be useful in the afterlife; for some communities using things that belonged to the dead is considered to bring bad luck, so best to bury them with their original owner just in case.We might think of grief and consolatory literature such as Julia Samuel’s bestsellingGrief Worksor Megan Devine’s It’s OK That You’re Not OKas a modern phenomenon, but for centuries printing presses have churned out guides to dying and grieving well, offering a blend of richly illustrated earthly and spiritual administrative and emotional advice for preparing for the end and coping with loss.Forget Swedish death cleaning, letting go is hard – even when it’s just a jacket | Nova WeetmanRead moreWhile we may find some of the excesses of, for instance, Victorian mourning ritual – replete with wearing heavy, dark clothing for months or even years, veiled mirrors and mourning tea sets – over the top today, the acknowledgment of grief ran deep in social structures of the past.Bereavementis for many of us the most profound experience we will have. The expectation that people should “move on from” or “get over” loss is to misread its potential to disorder our sense of self. In the past it was not uncommon to find “grief” as a cause of death on mortuary rolls or death certificates. Lives spent in closer relationship to death acknowledged the ways in which it can overwhelm us.Perhaps paradoxically, our medicalised approach to end of life now has resulted in a resurgence of interest in some of the old ways of managing mortality.Death doulasseem to carry the torch of the “death watchers” of the past, acknowledging that endings can be supported, caring, even joyful. The modern “death positive” movement encourages, if they feel able, family and friends to be involved in washing and caring for their dead, and there is evidence that being more involved in these processes can help us in accepting death and loss and beginning to process our grief.For me, there is a more radical message as well. If we can learn to engage – without fear – with the idea of our own mortality, embracing the fact that we will die can be a liberating act. We may use it to reassess our relationship to accumulating stuff, or thinking about the kinds of personal legacy, if any, we wish to leave. And perhaps we can also learn to draw on the past, taking the best and most humane elements of how death was anticipated, the dying supported and, perhaps most crucially, grief and mourning were acknowledged. Doing this may help us to reach back into a deeper relationship with mortality, a kind of modern take onmedia vita in morte sumus–in the midst of life we are in death.Molly Conisbee is a social historian, visiting research fellow at the Centre for Death and Society at the University of Bath, and author ofNo Ordinary DeathsExplore more on these topicsDeath and dyingOpinionBereavementChildrencommentShareReuse this content"

But social media has given it a whole new dimension, and powerful people now have an army of rabid fans ready to do that work for them.That’s exactly what’s happening to the singer and actor Halle Bailey, after she was granted a domestic violence restraining order against her child’s father, the YouTuber and Twitch streamer Darryl Dwayne Granberry Jr, known as DDG. Once the news broke, fans jumped to his defence, ramping up an existing campaign of trolling and harassment, where she’s been accused of everything frominfidelityduring their relationship to keeping their child from him after it was over – the latter a narrative that DDG himself hashelped fuel.The Jay-Z allegation once again reveals a culture of impunity in hip-hop | Tayo BeroRead moreSince news of therestraining orderbroke last week, we’ve gotten some details of the physical, verbal and financial abuse that Bailey alleges, including photos of injuries submitted as evidence. In that time, even more accounts have spawned, claiming that Bailey islyingabout the alleged attack, and was herself abusive to DDG. Those criticizing her range from faceless troll accounts tomajorTwitch streamers with hundreds of thousands of followers, and even Twitter/X communities including one where DDGhimselfis a moderator.If this doesn’t feel like deja vu then you’re not paying attention. Just last year, hundreds of X, Instagram, TikTok and YouTube accounts popped up dedicated to keeping public sentiment about theAmber Heard and Johnny Depp trialfirmly in his favor. Heard was accused of being unhinged and, of course, said to be abusive herself. From people making fun of her testimony to memes about her crying on the stand going viral, there was no regard for her humanity or even the horrifying things she alleged happened to her – and it hasn’t stopped.Jennifer Hough, a Black woman who accusedNicki Minaj’s current husband, Kenneth Petty, of raping her when they were minors, has also felt the fury of a toxic fandom. Petty wasconvicted of attempted rapein the incident after a plea deal. When he was arrested in 2020 for failing to register as a sex offender, Minaj’s notoriouslyhateful“Barbz” got to work trying to discredit Hough, sometimesparrotingrumors that Minaj herself had started.With DDG though, this isn’t just your average social media fan; these are the children of the streaming age, a generation whose experience of fandom means being constantly and staunchly engaged with their favourite streamers – staying glued to their screens, watching every waking moment of these people’s lives, and forming twisted parasocial bonds with them.And did I forget to mention that all of this is happening against the grimy backdrop of themanosphere? Young men online are more misogynistic than ever, and the internet’s culture around hating women has gone from fringe forums to becoming a broad social movement where rather than being shamed, men are applauded for sharing their most violent, hateful thoughts about women.The patriarchy demands loyalty and requires that its beneficiaries pay their dues in acts of hatred. That means that anyone who doesn’t join in the bullying or speaks up for women is automatically deemed a traitor and punished accordingly. To be a prominent man online today can mean either falling in line with misogyny or risking mockery and ostracization.Diddy’s lawyers are banking on the ‘mutual abuse’ defence. Newsflash: it’s not a thing | Tayo BeroRead moreThe Houston rapper Slim Thug was called everything but a child of God forsimply believingMegan Thee Stallionwhen she said she was shot by Tory Lanez, and DDG justcalled outSoulja Boy (who wasfound liable for assaulthimself last month) for standing up for Bailey.Still, there’s a different kind of loyalty that’s being weaponized here, whereBlackmen specifically (and women for that matter) are being asked to protect their own, even when they cause harm. There’s no doubt that Black men are unfairly targeted by the criminal justice system, and continue to be stereotyped as violent. But there are Black men who abuse, disregard and disrespect women that they are in intimate relationships with. Both things can be true. And that delicate balance is often exploited to help cast abusive men as victims of a society that does indeed hate them.From supreme court justice Clarence Thomasclaimingthe investigation into sexual harassment claims against him were a “high-tech lynching”, to the actorJonathan Majorsgoing on asympathy tourafter he was convicted of misdemeanour assault and harassment, Black men invoking the racial persecution defence is as typical as it is diabolical.What this all really means is that the court of public opinion has been compromised; we can no longer rely on good sense to prevail even if the courts are unreliable.And at the end of the day, it seems like the message is the same – in a world designed to protect men, women simply can’t win.Tayo Bero is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsWomenOpinionHalle BaileyCelebrityGenderMegan Thee StallionNicki MinajClarence ThomascommentShareReuse this content"

If the party leadership won’t adapt, the public will move onThu 22 May 2025 13.48 EDTLast modified on Thu 22 May 2025 21.30 EDTShareSir Keir Starmer’sU-turnon winter fuel payments did not just represent a policy reversal. It was the moment when the prime minister, elected on promises of national renewal, was forced to confront the political reality that his strategy had refused to acknowledge. It may also prove to be the moment he lost control.The original policy, hatched in theTreasuryanddefendedfor months, had cut winter fuel payments, worth up to £300 annually, tomillionsof pensioners. It wasunpopular, and unnecessary. Local election losses and a loomingbackbenchrevolt over disability benefit cuts made it politically toxic. The result? On Wednesday, Sir Keirreversedcourse at the dispatch box – with his chancellor, Rachel Reeves, notably absent. Too little, too late: voters saw delay; activists cried betrayal.This wasn’t just a policy slip. It was a strategic, ideological and sociological misfire. The Labour leadership had convinced itself that its electoral base was composed not ofuniversity-educated social liberalsand younger renters – key to its election-winning coalition – but ofReform-curious, socially conservative voters yearning for fiscal discipline and border control. That misreading, fuelled by factional folklore and backed up by the Labour MPLuke Akehurst, a key figure among the party’s centre and right, was always a mirage. Most Reform UK voters are not Labour’s to win back. They are largely embedded within a “right-Conservative” bloc, as noted by Manchester University’sJames David Griffiths. Chasing them means alienating Labour’s base.That appears to be happening. Sir Keir recorded thelowestnet favourability of his spell as Labour leader in May. And now, withU-turnspiling up, the story has acquired another dimension: a cabinet revolt. A leak blew open the ideological rift between Ms Reeves and the deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner. The latter’s memo to Ms Reeves, proposingtax riseson the better-off instead of cuts to meet self-imposed fiscal rules, revealed the schism.This is not just about tax policy. It is a flashpoint in the struggle over Labour’s identity. Ms Rayner represents a politics grounded in contemporary Britain:professional, socially liberal, economically redistributive. Ms Reeves represents a cautious centrist revivalism that imagines Britain as it was in1997. But this isn’tBlair’s Britainany more. The electorate is more middle class, more educated and more diverse. The realignment is done. Labour’s survival depends on recognising it.Labour’s centrist power brokers are fighting the last war – not against the Tories, but againstJeremy Corbyn. The party risks joining Europe’scentre-left casualties– triangulating through turbulence with a broken political compass. If Labour continues to ignore electoral bloc dynamics and strategic coalition-building, it will cede ground to both the left and the populist right.Meagre public sector pay awardssuggestLabour won’t budge – yet. But its economic strategy is running out of road. A pivot is possible: towards tax fairness, green investment, a new language onimmigration, electoral reform, ending austerity and rebuilding trust with the young urban voters who put Labour in power. But it should be decisive. Sir Keir must lead a government of transformation, not Tory-lite continuity. If he won’t shift course, “stepping up” may soon look just like standing in the way. The winter fuel fiasco wasn’t only a tactical error – it exposed Labour’s flawed view of the electorate. And voters, inconveniently, noticed.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It was when a reporter asked the US president what he wanted his counterpart to do about it. Mr Trumpreplied: “I don’t know.”Leaders enter the Oval Office uneasily, especially since the kicking administered toVolodymyr Zelenskyy. The South African president came armed with gratitude, two golf stars, a billionaire and compliments on the decor – and kept a cool head and a straight face as he was ambushed. Mr Ramaphosa later described it as “robust engagement”. But, in truth, it was a clash of two worlds rather than an interaction.On one side sat a political heavyweight who calmly asserted the facts; on the other, Mr Trump, espousing wild and inflammatory myths. One side wanted to do bilateral business; the other to pander to the grievances of his domestic base, many of whom doubtless relished the public scolding of an anti-apartheid veteran. No solution was proffered to the imaginary problem.The ruling African National Congress (ANC) has fallen far short in too many regards. Violent crime is rife. But the administration’s accusations invert reality. White South Africans are 7% of the population but stillown 72% of the land. Experts say that it is poor black people, not wealthier whites, who are disproportionately likely to be victims of violence. Yet as the scholar Nicky Falkof has written, white South Africans have become a “cautionary talefor the White far right [internationally] … central to the landscape and language of White supremacy”. Look where DEI gets you.Mr Trump aired complaints about the “large-scale killing” of white farmersin his first term, amplifying conspiracy theories thatoriginated in far-right forums. Since then, he has grown closer to the South African-born Elon Musk, who hasaccusedpoliticians there of “promoting white genocide”. The US has nowcut aidto South Africa, accusing the government of “unjust racial discrimination” and attacking its genocide case against Israel at the international court of justice. Washington hasexpelled the South African ambassadorand givenwhite Afrikaners asylumeven as it turns away those fleeing wars.Mr Trump’s divisive conspiracy theories and failed attempt to humiliate Mr Ramaphosa appear, ironically, to be fostering unity on foreign affairs within South African politics, where the ANC and its (white-led) coalition partner, the Democratic Alliance, have hadvery different histories and priorities. The US still accounts for a tenth of the country’s trade. South Africa must shore up itsauto sectorandagriculture, given its sky-highunemployment rate. But like other governments, Pretoria is salvaging what it can in US relations now, while looking ahead to diversifying its ties. Few expect Washingtonto renewduty-free trade arrangements for African states this autumn.Warming relations with other western countries is one option. But increasing closeness to China, already South Africa’s top trading partner, looks like an inevitability. Members of the Brics grouping see an opportunityto strengthen ties, though South Africa is discovering that expansiondoes not always mean greater influencefor its dominant players. Mr Trump is looking for kudos, free planes and red meat to throw to his base. Washington’s partners are increasingly looking elsewhere. It’s in US interests to show them respect and nurture longstanding relationships.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

While Tottenham face an awkward calculation – weighing up whether the delirium of a first European trophy in 41 years offsets their worst league season in terms of proportion of games lost – for Manchester United the equation is far starker.Ruben Amorim will only play in one way. He is committed absolutely, uncompromisingly, irrevocably to the 3-4-2-1. Liverpool considered him, looked at their squad, realised the two things did not go together, appointed Arne Slot and won the league. Manchester United looked at their squad, flinched at the horror, and seem to have reasoned it was such a mess that it was impossible to find a manager whose philosophy would fit. There wasa dissenting voice, Dan Ashworth, but at the court of Sir Jim Ratcliffe, reasoned doubts are as unwelcome as a free lunch.Spurs prevail with Mourinho blueprint and ultra pragmatism in baffling final | Jonathan WilsonRead moreThis is where Ratcliffe deserves credit. Where nobody else could see a pattern, he found one. It turns out this squad does have a unifying theme, and the appointment of Amorim uncovered it: what linked this disparate group of players, cobbled together under five permanent managers over 11 years, is that none of them can play 3-4-2-1.TheEuropa League finalwas a mesmerisingly dreadful game of football. An average of 52 seconds elapsed between every pass Tottenham completed, and yet they still won with relative ease. Almost every one of the handful of chances United made – notably the Rasmus Højlund effort cleared off the line by Micky van de Ven and the second-half header Bruno Fernandes put wide – was the result of a Spurs error.Amad Diallo offered some invention in the first half but faded in the second. There was one little burst from Alejandro Garnacho. And that was it. With 72% possession, United were left to rely on individual inspiration from young forwards and Tottenham mistakes.It turned outEuropa Leagueform – United were unbeaten in European competition until Wednesday – was deceptive. Casemiro and Harry Maguire may thrive when there is a little more time on the ball, but up against Premier League opposition again, they struggled as they have all season.View image in fullscreenBruno Fernandes (centre) and Rasmus Højlund were unable to find inspiration in Bilbao.Photograph: Phil Duncan/Every Second Media/ShutterstockThe mind inevitably goes back to a comment Fernandes made after United had narrowlybeaten Ipswich in February: Amorim, he said, had been shocked by how good a newly promoted side threatened by relegation could be. There are no Estrela Amadoras or Gil Vicentes in English football; the Premier League is relentlessly demanding in a way no other competition in the world is. The league may have clear financial stratifications but its wealth means the level even at the bottom end is, by global standards, extremely high. Which is, if course, how United and Spurs ended up in the Europa League final in the first place.And so United are faced with a dilemma. If they persist with Amorim, the squad will need a complete and total overhaul. Of the team who played in Bilbao, how many could be of use in a 3-4-2-1? Lenny Yoro and Patrick Dorgu, probably. Diallo, perhaps. Mason Mount and Fernandes, maybe, although neither offered much evidence on Wednesday night.That level of makeover will require hundreds of millions of pounds that United simply do not have. The way Ratcliffe has been speaking, there would not have been vast sums available even if United had been in the Champions League. Without any European football at all, budgets will be tight. And besides, which self-respecting player now would want to join United?The only reason to go to Old Trafford is for the surge players get when they leave: Scott McTominay will win Serie A if Napoli beat Cagliari on Friday; Marcus Rashford has been rejuvenated at Aston Villa; Antony can’t stop scoring brilliant goals for Real Betis and either he orJadon Sanchowill lift the Conference League next week. The contrast with Kobbie Mainoo, young goalscoring hero oflast season’s FA Cup finaltransformed into peripheral figure, is unavoidable.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That option is no longer available to them. This will be a long, slow rebuild. Barring astonishing public funding, a new stadium that might increase revenues will itself be a drain on resources.So the question United now face is clear: do they place their faith in Amorim, slowly build a squad that can play his way, accepting many of their first-choice signings may no longer be available to them, or do they make the switch and turn to a more flexible manager who may be able to elevate this squad.The problem there is that almost nobody seems to want to stay. Amorim and Fernandes both said that they would be prepared to leaveif it is in the best interests of the club, the manager even offering to go without a payoff, which does not seem like the most complicated diplomatic code to crack. Garnachodescribed the season as “shit”and hinted he would be open to offers and Luke Shaw said every player had to ask themselves whether they really want to be there. Frankly, why would anybody?For United, the question is how much they believe in Amorim. Because if he is going to fix things, it is not going to be quick.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedRuben AmorimEuropa LeagueFootball tacticsJim RatcliffecommentShareReuse this content"

A home game against relegated Leicester looks to offer the perfect opportunity but the closing stretch has been tough for Andoni Iraola’s side, with the past 12 league games producing only two victories. Remarkably, a three-game league form table puts Leicester in fourth after home wins over Southampton and Ipswich either side of a 2-2 draw at Nottingham Forest. Perhaps this won’t be the walkover most are expecting, and there could be a wistful feeling in the air at the Vitality on Sunday afternoon. No one can deny it has been a strong season but what a party it might have been. With Dean Huijsenoff to Real Madridand Milos Kerkez linked heavily with the champions, Liverpool, how many of the goodbyes on the traditional end-of-season lap of honour will be permanent?David TindallBournemouth v Leicester, Sunday 4pm (all times BST)View image in fullscreenDean Huijsen will join Real Madrid this summer and Milos Kerkez could also depart Bournemouth.Photograph: Graham Hunt/ProSports/Shutterstock2A role for Rodri at Fulham?It is unlikely Manchester City’s season would have been so underwhelming had Rodri not suffered that serious knee injury against Arsenal. Pep Guardiola’s side have suffered without the assurance provided by the best midfielder in the league. No one has been able to step up in his absence. Opponents have run through City, leaving them in danger of missing out on Champions League qualification. They need a result against Fulham on the final day and Guardiola has problems in midfield before the trip to Craven Cottage. Mateo Kovacic is suspended after his red card against Bournemouth, so how does Guardiola adjust? He used Bernardo Silva and Kevin De Bruyne in deeper roles in the FA Cup final but that seems like an unsuitable solution for a tricky away game. Is this a moment for Nico González, short on Premier League experience, or the wily but ageing Ilkay Gündogan? Maybe it is time for Rodri. The Spaniard made a late cameo off the bench against Bournemouth, but putting him in the starting XI now would be a risk given his lack of football. Rodri may not be ready to start, but Guardiola may need him to make a big impact off the bench.Jacob SteinbergFulham v Manchester City, Sunday 4pm3Potter stares down a tough summerA tough sell of a match for neutrals, with Ipswich’s relegation long sealed and West Ham’s campaign raising few cheers once relegation was avoided. There is, though, public affection at stake, particularly for Graham Potter, who has remained something of a stranger to Hammers fans. Four wins in 18 matches since taking charge is the worst return since Avram Grant took the club down in the 2010-11 season. Potter’s downbeat persona has been mirrored by passive performances from his team and his record is now worse than that of Julen Lopetegui, the manager he replaced in January. Winning atManchester United, a result that used to make up for an indifferent season, has provided no fig leaf. Lose at Ipswich, who have won once at Portman Road in the league all season, and Potter faces a summer of doubts. Kieran McKenna, despite Ipswich’s struggles, retains the club hierarchy’s faith and will be looking for a positive send-off down the chute to the Championship.John BrewinIpswich v West Ham, Sunday 4pm4A party in every corner of AnfieldFew would have predicted Crystal Palace’s visit as the precursor to the 2025 Community Shield back in August, but unexpected silverware ensures all sections of Anfield will be in full-on party mode on the final day. Liverpool can hardly deny they have been on the beach since wrapping up the title four weeks ago. They have been merrily advertising the fact all over social media, popping in for two defeats and a draw in between their jollies to Ibiza and Dubai. Wayne Lineker’s new mate, Arne Slot, can hardly complain at the downturn. It is difficult to imagine Oliver Glasner hanging out with Gary’s playboy brother and there were no signs of a hangover when Crystal Palace surfed an FA Cup-winning waveagainst Wolves on Tuesday. The main event comes after the final whistle, of course, when Liverpool get to lift the league championship trophy in front of their own supporters for the first time in 35 years. But what reception awaits Trent Alexander-Arnold this time?Andy HunterLiverpool vCrystal Palace, Sunday 4pmView image in fullscreenLiverpool and Crystal Palace fans have a game to get through at Anfield before the serious business of trophy parades can begin.Photograph: Nick Potts/PA5United’s new dawn still in the distanceThe good news for Ruben Amorim is that he retains Manchester United’s backing despite overseeing Wednesday’s pathetic 1-0 Europa League final defeat to Tottenham. The bad tidings are these: his team may not yet have hit rock bottom as Sunday’s visitors,Aston Villa, are a formidable proposition who arrive firmly in the hunt for a Champions League place. A 19th league defeat of the season, and an ignominious finish in 17th place, are very much possible. Given the club’s dismal transfer market record over a decade or more, the beleaguered Portuguese coach could be about to endure a long summer. The darkest hour is supposedly before dawn but it may only be 3am at Old Trafford.Jamie JacksonManchester United v Aston Villa, Sunday 4pm6Pickford fired up by Black Cat loyaltiesMight Jordan Pickford prove a one-man human barrier blocking Newcastle’s route to the Champions League? Much as he loves life atEverton, the England goalkeeper will always adore Sunderland, the club he supported as a boy and where he began his career. Newcastle fans routinely barrack Sunderland old boys but their dislike of Pickford not only elevates such rivalry to a new level, but often seems to bring the best out in a keeper boasting high-calibre footwork his Newcastle counterpart Nick Pope must envy. Should Pickford’s saves send Eddie Howe’s side to the Europa League next season, he will revel in being the toast of Wearside. If Everton’s outfielders may not be quite as motivated, David Moyes has fashioned an obdurate side and Howe will be hoping that Alexander Isak overcomes groin trouble in time to start. If so, it could be a case of Sweden striker v England goalkeeper.Louise TaylorNewcastle v Everton, Sunday 4pmskip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sunday is far more important to club and manager than next Wednesday’s Conference League final against Real Betis in Wroclaw. Nottingham Forest are still fighting for a Champions League spot and the City Ground will be baying for blood, which will ask severe questions of a visiting unit that wilted under similar conditionsat Newcastle. The Chelsea ownership can ill-afford to be absent from the Champions League for three successive seasons, no matter what other continental baubles might be collected, and despite their presence in the summer’s Fifa Club World Cup bonanza. Forest can still make it into the top five and have nothing to lose. That, and the looming, occasionally provocative presence of the owner, Evangelos Marinakis, makes them a prospect to fear for any shrinking violets.JBNottingham Forest v Chelsea, Sunday 4pmView image in fullscreenEnzo Maresca’s first season as Chelsea manager may be defined by Sunday’s result at the City Ground.Photograph: Paul Childs/Action Images/Reuters8Saints audition for promotion challengeSt Mary’s hosts the most meaningless of all the weekend’s meaningless games.Southamptonwill finish bottom regardless, and barring an improbable drubbing that damages Arsenal’s net goal difference, Mikel Arteta’s side have the runners-up slot in the bag. The big talking point for Saints fans is the impending appointment of Will Still as manager, who could be in situ by Sunday. The highly regarded 32-year-old coach has a fondness for high pressing, intelligent running and fast transitions, none of which have been in great evidence this season, though Still should be able to get a better tune out of Southampton’s players than Ivan Juric and his more uncompromising “death metal” football. An outing against the second-best team in England offers a useful audition for those who fancy getting stuck into a promotion challenge next term after this wasted season.Tom DaviesSouthampton vArsenal, Sunday 4pm9Brighton should prosper at Spurs partyExpect an air of cognitive dissonance at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Sunday as Spurs mark their probable lowest finish of the Premier League era with a post-Europa League party. Festivities will inevitably be accompanied by speculation that this might still be Ange Postecoglou’s last match in charge. That will not be influenced by the result and performance here, which don’t greatly matter. Brighton, by contrast, still entertain hopes of joining Spurs in European competition next season. A point here will secure eighth place for Fabian Hürzeler’s side, which might secure a Conference League place depending on aconvoluted combination of other results, including next Wednesday’s Conference League final between Chelsea and Betis. Brighton were excellent against Liverpool on Monday and will arrive in north London in good form and spirits. As we have seen this week, they are simply a better team than Spurs and should wrap up that top-eight place here.TDTottenham v Brighton, Sunday 4pmView image in fullscreenBrighton could end up celebrating European football next season if they spoil Spurs’ party.Photograph: Daniel Hambury/EPA10Wolves have found bite but what next?After 19 games of thisPremier Leagueseason, Wolves were in a perilous position. They had managed only 16 points and were a point and a place above the drop zone. But since the halfway mark their transformation has been notable. Talk of relegation vanished a long time ago. The second-half-of-the-season table shows Wolves in a fairly healthy 13th. They have totted up the same number of wins as Arsenal and Nottingham Forest (eight) and their points tally (25) in that period is on a par with mid-table sides like Fulham and Bournemouth. The decision to bring in Vítor Pereira after the 2-1 home loss to Ipswich in December has been fully justified and across March and April they secured a club record six Premier League wins a row. The team has wobbled since but victory over Brentford on Sunday will complete a satisfactory campaign. What happens next is uncertain, though. Can Wolves become a team good enough to challenge for a European spot or will next season prove sticky again, with their star attacker Matheus Cunha set to move on and other prize assets, such as Rayan Aït-Nouri, linked with moves away?DTWolves vBrentford, Sunday 4pmPosTeamPGDPts1Liverpool3745832Arsenal3734713Man City3726684Newcastle3722665Chelsea3720666Aston Villa379667Nottm Forest3713658Brighton374589Brentford3795510Fulham3725411AFC Bournemouth37105312Crystal Palace3705213Everton37-34514Wolverhampton37-154115West Ham37-184016Man Utd37-123917Tottenham Hotspur3723818Leicester37-452519Ipswich37-442220Southampton37-5912Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTen things to look out for this weekendBournemouthManchester CityWest Ham UnitedLiverpoolEvertonChelseafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Test cricket, like a bank holiday picnic, is a reliable way to send the English sun running, andZimbabwe’s first day of Test cricketin this country in 22 years started under thick ripples of ominous grey cloud, and in a freezing breeze. In the shop at the bottom of the Radcliffe Road Stand staff were sent running to the stock room to fetch up fresh boxes of beanie hats and hooded tops, as the crowd, caught short by the sudden dip in temperature after weeks of good weather, made an unexpected run on their supplies of winter clothing.Zimbabwe won the toss, which was the last thing that went their way all day. “We’ll have a bowl,” said their captain, Craig Ervine, and it must have seemed like a good idea at the time. Ben Stokes admitted he would have done the same thing himself given the conditions overhead.Ollie Pope smashes 169 off Zimbabwe to show England selectors his classRead moreBut Ervine might have been starting to think twice after the first 45 minutes or so, which he spent chewing his lip at slip, hands thrust deep into his pockets, as Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett rattled off the first brisk fifty of what would go on to be a 231-run partnership.By the afternoon, Zimbabwe looked a sorry lot. They were so still and stiff in the field they might have been installed by Antony Gormley as a public art work.One tyre had already gone on their four-wheeled fast-bowling attack, the hefty left-armer Richard Ngarava, had to leave the field after he did himself a mischief while bending down to fetch the ball. And another, Tanaka Chivanga, was midway through one of the worst days anyone’s ever had in the long history of Test cricket in England. By the time he had finished his third spell, he had bowled 12 overs, and taken none for 83.Which meant the lion’s share of the work was left to the tireless Blessing Muzarabani, who knows a thing or two about what it takes in these conditions after doing the rounds of the county grounds during a two-year-spell in Northamptonshire’s first and second XIs, and the off-spinner Sikandar Raza, who ended up wheeling through 24 overs even though he had only just flown in from Lahore, where he has spent the last six weeks playing for the Qalandars in the Pakistan Super League.In the circumstances, it was hard to judge exactly what England’s runs were worth.View image in fullscreenBlessing Muzarabani celebrates with Craig Ervine – a rare moment of joy for Zimbabwe – after taking the wicket of Joe Root.Photograph: Paul Childs/Action Images/ReutersThere were four blokes bashing out Beatles covers around the back of Trent Bridge during the lunch break. Perched on top of an old shipping container that serves as an outdoor bar, they had mop tops, black polo necks, baggy caps, the full bit. As the day wore on it started to feel like 22 on the other side of the boundary rope were playing imitation Test cricket, too. No doubt there will be a lot of English chuntering about what it all means, and whether the mismatch between these teams is devaluing what is, we’re always told, the pinnacle of the sport.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And round about tea they banded together in the Fox Road Stand, and started belting out songs in a futile attempt to inject a bit of energy into their exhausted team. There were perhaps 50 of them, all expats. They would have been singing all day, one explained, but it had taken them a few hours to find each other in the stands. He was annoyed Trent Bridge’s ticketing system didn’t give them the option of sitting together in the away end. He was baffled by the idea anyone might want to sit in a bit of peace and quiet.“If England come to Zimbabwe we can beat them,” he said, “and you know why? Because of all the support we have.” His name was Simba and he had come to the game with an old friend, Ben. They were born and raised in Harare, then moved to Derby. The worse things went for their team on the pitch, the louder they sang off it. “Of course,” Simba told me, “you can’t be a Zimbabwean cricket fan if you’re going to let the bad times get you down.” And they have known a lot worse than this. The player strikes, the political interference, the maladministration.It was six years agothat the ICC suspended their team from playing cricket altogether.So England’s runs will have an asterisk attached.

The seven-time world champion was speaking after a private screening of the forthcoming film F1: The Movie, held on Wednesday night in Monte Carlo, on which he was a producer and an adviser.“At the beginning you see all the different logos for the different production houses and my one comes out, which I worked on for so long, which is Dawn Apollo and it was just amazing to see that,” he said. “This has gone in very high. Couldn’t go any higher for my first movie but we will be producing more movies in the coming years. I’ve got three concepts that I’m writing. But I’m going to write with a writer.Red Bull confident Verstappen’s Imola win will be a turning point in F1 seasonRead more“I’ve got these concepts, at least two of them will be animations and one of them we’re in the phase of the first part of a script already, so it’s exciting. Then there will be documentaries, there will be TV series at some stage, but mostly movies. I love movies.”In Monaco before this weekend’s grand prix, Hamilton also admitted he had been concerned about the reaction of his fellow drivers when they were shown the film for the first time at the private screening.“Yesterday all the drivers are there. I sat in the middle and I was nervous. Everyone is seeing it for the first time,” he said. “It was great to look around and see some of the reactions. Particularly the drivers, you know. I really care what the drivers think and I wanted them to think highly of it.“I mentioned to them afterwards, you know I welcome your honest opinions about it. The great thing is the sound is great, the image is incredible. It’s something that’s never been done before. So it’s something I’m really proud of.”View image in fullscreenBrad Pitt stars in, and co-produced, the new F1 movie and has been to several grands prix during its production.Photograph: David Davies/PAMax Verstappen, however, continued to observe his singular approach to Formula One and opted against attending the private screening. It is understood that attendance was mandatory but, because it was during the drivers’ free time not over what constitutes a race weekend, they could not be forced to attend. All the drivers apart from Verstappen and Aston Martin’s Lance Stroll did go to the screening. Verstappen said he informed F1 in advance he wanted time with his family.“I just wanted to spend more time at home,” said Verstappen, who has just had a baby with his partner, Kelly Piquet. “It was just my private time and I prefer to spend that private time at home, especially because inFormula Oneyou’re away from home so much already.“Wanting to spend more time at home on days like that is pretty normal.

Injuries and a loss of form have resulted in them exiting the Challenge Cup at the hands of their biggest rivals and tumbling outside the playoff places as the midway point of the season approaches.Manchester United face urgent dilemma: ditch Amorim or revamp the squad | Jonathan WilsonRead moreBut this was an emphatic return to form at a ground where away victories are hard to come by. The Leigh coach, Adrian Lam, had joked this week that their opponents here were a carbon copy of how his side play – perhaps in no small part due to the fact that four of the FC side were Leigh players as recently as last season.And in truth Leigh were beaten at their own game. Hull were magnificent, 26-0 ahead by half-time and while they didn’t score a point after the break, they really didn’t need to. Two late Leigh tries were nothing more than consolation as the Black and Whites returned not only to form, but into theSuper Leagueplayoff places.“We’ve put some consistent footy together against a side I rate highly,” Cartwright said. His side suffered another worrying injury to a key individual, with John Asiata to be sent for scans on a hamstring injury, but that should not take the edge off a very encouraging night.Anyone Cartwright asks to play out of position, they duly deliver. Tries from Cade Cust and Herman Ese’ese gave the visitors some early dominance, and they didn’t relent. Lewis Martin finished a fine Will Pryce break to extend that lead further, before a decisive blow right on half-time when Sam Eseh punctured another gap in the Leigh defensive line. Aidan Sezer, on his 250th career appearance, converted all four tries and kicked a penalty to open up an unassailable lead at the interval. The Leopards, woefully under par, had been comprehensively outplayed.View image in fullscreenSam Eseh crashes over for Hull’s fourth try just before half-time, to give them a decisive 26-0 lead.Photograph: Olly Hassell/SWpix.com“I just didn’t see that coming,” Lam said. “It was disappointing in every area, really soft and just not what we’ve built this season on so far.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The seven-times Premier League champion has had a miserable campaign and came into the final weekly night having to win to stay in contention for the playoffs.But Van Gerwen fell at the first hurdle, losing 6-2 to Nathan Aspinall, whose victory guaranteed him a top-four spot and completed the lineup for next week’s playoffs at the O2 in London.It is only the second time in 13 years that Van Gerwen, who has won the competition more than any other player, has not made the finals night. His exit is another stark reminder that he is no longer at the top of the sport, sitting well below Littler and Luke Humphries.View image in fullscreenLuke Littler poses with the trophy after victory in the final on night 16 of the Premier League Darts in Sheffield.Photograph: Nigel French/PAThat duo met in a fifth final of the campaign as their enduring rivalry continues to dominate the sport and Littler came out on top, with a 6-3 success. It was his sixth nightly win and he claimed a piece of history by posting a record points haul of 45; a new high in this format of the competition.“For myself, this is just the warm-up,” Littler said. “It’s been tough, it’s a tough format but I’ve got myself through. I’m happy to be top. I’m ready for the semi-final, it’s the O2, I have won a semi-final before, I’m looking forward to it.”The latest instalment of their matchup could well prove to be a dress rehearsal for next week’s playoff final, with both players favourites to get through their semi-finals.Littler will play Gerwyn Price after the Welshman threw away a 4-1 lead to lose 6-5 against Chris Dobey, which meant he slipped to fourth place. Aspinall knew that victory would book his place in the top four for the third time in his career and he delivered a fine performance against the struggling Van Gerwen. That set up a semi-final against Humphries while Dobey, Rob Cross and Stephen Bunting join Van Gerwen in exiting the tournament.Explore more on these topicsDartsMichael van GerwenLuke LittlernewsShareReuse this content"

They are like bloody buses. Or at least that is whatBathfans must be hoping. They wait 17 years for one, and along come …We are about to find out how many. One has just been. ThePremiershipCup pulled up in March to fairly inconsequential fanfare. But it looks as if another, the Challenge Cup, is waiting just a stop away, before we turn our attention to a third, the Premiership, timetabled for the middle of June – but you know what these bloody buses are like.Bath journey to Cardiff on Friday in an attempt to catch the next one. They qualified for the Challenge Cup by being jettisoned from the Champions, but they have fairly blitzed their way to the final, where they will meet Lyon.The last trophy Bath won, before the reserves triumphed in March, is, as it happens, the Challenge Cup, all those 17 years ago, when theybeat Worcester in the 2008 finalin a downpour at Kingsholm on a Sunday afternoon. That, in turn, was the first piece of silverware the club had won in 10 years, since they became champions of Europe in 1998, at the tail end of an era in which those buses came regularly and on cue.View image in fullscreenJohann van Graan believes in ‘the process’, not the result.Photograph: Dan Mullan/Getty ImagesNo one can move very far in rugby these days without someone mentioning the phrase “this club’s DNA”, but in the case of Bath the double helix is shot through with the legacy of glory. Even if one has to have been born in the 80s to have any chance of remembering it, the echoes of those years when Bath were the champions of everything in English rugby ring throughout the old walls of Aquae Sulis. What must that do to a club, as they wander all but trophy-less in the years to follow.Sam Underhill was born a few months after Bath’s last English title, in 1996, the year they also won the cup, back when it was rugby’s equivalent of the FA Cup, rather than the squad-building exercise during the Six Nations it is now. It was Bath’s 10th cup in 13 years, their sixth title in eight, their fourth double. Underhill has endured with the others the barren years, since he joined in 2017, but he senses a shift in the current squad’s approach, wrought by Johann van Graan, Bath’s South African director of rugby over the past three seasons. Van Graan believes in “the process”, not the result – the bus ride, if you like, over the destination.“You’re not doing things because it’s the right moment to do them,” says Underhill. “You’re doing them because it’s the right thing to do. It becomes a sort of self-fulfilling cycle.”Certainly, any focus on results in the past few decades would have brought Bath little but anguish, all the more so given that pedigree. So maybe this focus on process is all for the better. The season before Van Graan took over, Bath finished bottom of the Premiership, shipping 70 points at home to Saracens in October and losing 64-0 at Gloucester six months later. A nadir, even by recent standards.Since then, the journey has been steadily upwards – mid-table in Van Graan’s first season and runners-up last year, his second, when an early red card in the final did its best to corrupt those processes. A good time to put the contingency of outcomes to the back of one’s mind.When Bath won at Pau in the round of 16, Underhill was sent off himself, early in the second half, by Hollie Davidson. She will be officiating again on Friday, the first woman to referee a European cup final and the first Scot since Jim Fleming took the whistle in, you guessed it, 1998, when Bath beat Brive to become European champions. Red cards are never far away in rugby these days, but the philosophy of Van Graan inures his players to such accidents of fate. “I don’t put too much stock into how things go,” says Underhill. “If you worry too much about the outcome, you end up trying to catch smoke. You just chase it, chase it, and the more you try, the further away you get.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Lyon languish in the lower reaches of the Top 14, after three consecutive defeats; Bath have top spot in the Premiership regular season sewn up already. But such is the Zen at the Rec, hankering after anything so vulgar as results is off limits.

It goes back to not worrying so much about outcomes. It’s not quite as straightforward as the fans will be happy if we win trophies and incredibly upset if we don’t. Hopefully, there’s a level of appreciation in the process and the people.”Stop looking and you will find it, seems to be the gist of it.

In such an intense, competitive individual sport where greatness is determined though fine margins, the pressure to keep on moving is eternal. If you are not constantly training, competing and working on your craft, it is said, someone will always be there to take your place. Once you lose your spot, you may never get it back.During the most difficult period of her career, Amanda Anisimova, a former teen prodigy, had to reckon with that myth. In the depths of her depression, when the intensity of the tennis circuit had become unbearable and her mind was screaming out for change, the 23-year-old opted for the solution of a complete break from the sport two years ago.“I had done that my whole life – pushing through everything – because I never took any breaks,” says Anisimova, calmly narrating the past eight years of her life in a hectic, bustling players’ restaurant during the Madrid Open. “I felt like it was just unfair for me to keep pushing and pushing as if I’m not a human being.”Emma Raducanu suffers injury scare before French Open in defeat by CollinsRead moreAt an age when most tennis players are still finding their feet on the junior circuit, seven years ago a 16-year-old Anisimova arrived on the WTA tour seemingly fully formed. Her groundstrokes were not only devastating, they were clean and exquisite – her sweet timing, hand-eye coordination and effortless ability to redirect pace immediately set her apart. At just 17, she marched into thesemi-finals of the 2019 French Openand was not far from winning it all. In hindsight, Anisimova says, she was not old enough to appreciate the significance of such an achievement. “I was obviously very young, and I didn’t have to deal with the highs and lows of the sport so much,” she says.The lows, it turned out, were around the corner. By 2022, the many stressors presented by professional tennis had penetrated the American player’s psyche. “I was just struggling with the lifestyle and just dealing with a lot of stress from it, and it was affecting me a lot on the court,” she says. “Especially towards the end of the year. I think it was taking away from a lot of the joy that I was feeling when I came to training or came to tournaments. It just really wasn’t working for me.”For months, Anisimova tried to play through her discomfort and it took a long time for her to understand that she could no longer continue. Finally, she decided that it was time to step away from the sport. “I was obviously privileged and able to take a break,” she says. “I know not many people are able to take a break from their career or their life. So, of course, I’m very grateful that I had the opportunity to do that. If I wasn’t going to be ready to come back, or if my body wasn’t going to be able to handle it, I knew that I would have to figure out something else to do. But I don’t think pushing through it was an option for me at that point.”View image in fullscreenAmanda Anisimova shows her joy after defeating Simona Halep in the quarter-finals of the 2019 French Open. She then went down in three sets in the semis.Photograph: Charles Platiau/ReutersIn lieu of her daily work on court, Anisimova took holidays she had never previously considered and spent time with friends and family, time she normally would not be able to spare. For a semester, Anisimova studied at Florida’s Nova Southeastern University in person after previously conducting her undergraduate degree – business with psychology – remotely. She also took up painting, which became a refuge from her own thoughts and she eventually chose to donate the art she created to charitable causes addressing mental health, hunger and child abuse.After months without even picking up a racket, by the end of 2023 Anisimova had found her way back to tennis. She slowly worked to regain her match fitness before returning at the beginning of 2024: “I think that I refreshed my mind and I took the time that I needed,” she says.In a sport that teaches its subjects to never slow down, Anisimova’s decision to step away from the tour has provided a necessary example for other players with similar issues. Anisimova, for her part, is appreciative of colleaguessuch as Naomi Osakawho have also drawn attention to the importance of prioritising mental health. She believes that her generation has a greater grasp on how to directly tackle these issues.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Maybe they had to push through a lot more things. At the end of the day, it’s not very healthy long-term, and I think it’s very important being true to yourself and how you feel because that’s what contributes to happiness.”View image in fullscreenAmanda Anisimova celebrates winning the Qatar Open in mid-February – her first WTA 1000 title.Photograph: Hussein Sayed/APThis may not have been the goal when she opted to step back, but by taking care of herself mentally, Anisimova has scaled new heights on the court. This year, she took a significant step forward in her career by winning her first WTA 1000 title at the Qatar Open in Doha. As Roland Garros shifts into focus, Anisimova will return to compete in the city that defined the first part of her career, six years on from her breakthrough run in Paris. Now ranked at a career high of No 16, this will mark her first grand slam tournament as a top-20 player.Still, Anisimova is more proud of her growth, and how she has navigated her numerous challenges, than any result. No on-court achievement is as significant as the lesson the past two years have taught her to trust her own convictions rather than simply following how things have always been done.Explore more on these topicsFrench Open 2025French OpenTennisinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Though the president has called the $Trump token “The Greatest of them all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”, nearly half the gala’s guests suffered losses from purchasing it, according to a Guardian analysis of their public cryptocurrency wallets.The attendees are winners of the US president’smeme coincompetition. Last month, Trump announced that the 220 crypto wallets with the largest holdings of $Trump between 23 April and 12 May would win a ticket to a private dinner at the Trump National golf club. The top 25 holders would also be invited to a “Private VIP Reception” with the president beforehand. The news caused the coin tospikemore than 50%.Buyers were ranked by their “time-weighted” holdings, which reached 11.3m coins – worth approximately $148m in total as of 12 May. Snapping up the coin propelled entrants to the top of the leaderboard. However, the Guardian’s analysis of crypto wallets on the Solana blockchain suggests that many have been burned along the way.Top buyers of Trump-sponsored crypto win exclusive dinner with presidentRead moreOf the 220 winners, 95 – some 43% – have suffered a net loss from purchasing $Trump since the coin’s January launch, a combined $8.95m, according to trading history and portfolios as of 21 May.A contestant under the username “GAnt” appears to have endured the biggest losses. Despite placing fourth on the leaderboard, buying the tokens has led to a $1.06m shortfall. Similarly, user “Meow” is down $621,000, despite achieving VIP status.This aligns with a broader trend: it’s believed that 764,000 wallets – mostly belonging to small holders – have lost money on $Trump, according to data from the cryptocurrency and blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis. Meanwhile, just 58 wallets have made more than $10m each on their purchases of the coin, per Chainalysis. The cryptocurrency is trading 68% below its all-time high when it peakedthe day before the president’s inauguration.About 40% of the gala attendees own less than one $Trump token. Among them are buyers who purchased the coin during its initial days of hype and then dumped it when the price hit its zenith. User “UVIL”, for example, profited more than $7m from the president’s coin, followed by “boop” and “Woo”, both earning more than $2m, respectively, according to the Guardian’s analysis. Dinner ticket winners shelled out between $55,000 and $37.7m to attend, with the price of one seat averaging out to $1m,according to datafrom the blockchain analytics company Nansen published by NBC.Attendees are thus not necessarily current owners of the Trump coins, but “people who pumped and dumped them”, said James Angel, a professor of financial regulation at Georgetown University. “It just shows that, when you elect a clown, you get a circus.”The coin definitely benefits the Trump family business, and it’s yet another way for [the president] to cash in on celebrityJames Angel, Georgetown UniversityThe Guardian’s calculations assume transfers in and out of wallets were sales at market prices from the time, although this is not possible to prove for all transactions.A presidential schemeThe Trump administration is not directly involved in administering $Trump. However, the president may profit from token sales and trading fees. Trump-affiliated entities – notably CIC Digital LLC and Fight Fight Fight LLC – issued the coin and own 80% of its supply, which will be gradually unlocked throughout his term. These entities also made $320m in trading fees as of 6 May, according to data from Chainalysis,publishedby CNBC.The Trump Organization did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The president lauding high-risk and opaque assets coincides with a wider easing of financial regulation. Until recently, the Securities and Exchange Commission viewed most cryptocurrencies as securities, not commodities. However, under new leadership, the regulator issuedguidancestating that meme coins are “akin to collectibles” and thus “neither meme coin purchasers nor holders are protected by the federal securities laws.” On that view, $Trump sales are not subject to the same disclosures required of stocks or bonds, nor would the president’s affiliates be considered unregistered issuers of securities.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Topping the leaderboard is Justin Sun, a Chinese-born crypto billionaire who founded the Tron blockchain. Sun waschargedin 2023 with market manipulation and offering unregistered securities, but the SECdroppedthe case in February.Trump’s cryptocurrency endeavor caps a political career filled with conflicts of interestRead moreCompanies with strategic policy incentives have also spent heavily to reach Trump. A cross-border logistics firm called Freight Technologies bought $20m worth of tokens, calling it “an effective way to advocate for fair, balanced, and free trade between Mexico and the US”, according to astatement. Adding to that is GD Culture Group, a small tech company that operates an e-commerce business on TikTok. GD, which has a Chinese subsidiary, announced announced a plan to purchase up to $300m worth of $Trump, the New York Timesreported, but did not specify whether that spending had begun.“The coin definitely benefits the Trump family business, and it’s yet another way for [the president] to cash in on celebrity,” says Angel. “But the real question is: is this in the best interest of the United States of America?”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpCryptocurrenciesnewsShareReuse this content"

Laerke said aid groups were facing significant challenges distributing the aid because of insecurity, the risk of looting and coordination issues with Israeli authorities.However, the Palestinian Red Crescent said on Thursday that Palestinians in Gaza had yet to receive aid deliveries that had crossed over the border and that sending so few trucks was an “invitation for killing” because of the risk of mobbing.View image in fullscreenTrucks with humanitarian aid for Gaza wait at Israel’s Kerem Shalom crossing on 22 May.Photograph: Atef Safadi/EPA“I can prove that nobody has received [aid]. No civilian has received anything yet. In fact, say most of these trucks are still in Kerem Shalom at the border, inspected, but not into Gaza,” Younis al-Khatib, the president of the Palestine Red Crescent society, told reporters.“It’s very hard to hide the rush or the looting that will happen,” he added.Malnutrition is spreading in Gaza, medics and aid workers in the devastated Palestinian territory have warned for months, with aid distribution being hindered by displacement, bakeries operated by the UN World Food Programme shut due to a lack of cooking gas, and soaring prices for the limited amount of food available in shops and markets.“In the last couple of days we lost 29 children,” the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority health minister, Majed Abu Ramadan, told reporters, describing them as “starvation-related deaths”. He later clarified that the total included elderly people as well as children.1:24Aid trucks trickle into Gaza while airstrikes continue – video reportThe Palestinian Authority has partial control over the West Bank, which has been occupied by Israel since 1967, but Hamas has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007.Earlier this month,the IPC estimatedthat nearly 71,000 children under the age of five are expected to be “acutely malnourished”, with 14,100 cases expected to be severe over the next 11 months.Israel imposed the blockade on all supplies in March, saying Hamas was seizing deliveries for its fighters – a charge the group denies. Earlier this month, a global hunger monitor said that half a million people in the Gaza Strip face starvation.Abu Ramadan, who was mayor of Gaza City from 2005 to 2008, said that only seven or eight hospitals out of Gaza’s 36 were partially functioning, and that more than 90% of medical stocks were now at zero due to the blockade.“My information is that very few shipments went inside Gaza – 90 to 100 truckloads and in the south and mid zones.” Asked if there were any medical supplies among them, he said: “As far as I know … it’s only flour for bakeries.”UN agencies have said that the amount of aid entering Gaza falls far short of what is required to ease the crisis.Umm Talal al-Masri, 53, a displaced Palestinian in Gaza City, described the situation as “unbearable”.Hossam Abu Aida, 38, said: “I am tormented for my children.” He told AFP: “For them, I fear hunger and disease more than I do Israeli bombardment.”AFP footage showed bags of recently delivered flour at a bakery in the central city of Deir el-Balah, where workers and a host of machines began kneading, shaping, baking and packaging stack after stack of pita bread.The UN humanitarian aid organisation for children, Unicef, says more than 9,000 children have been treated for malnutrition in Gaza this year, and food security experts say tens of thousands of cases are expected in the coming year.Experts also warn the territory could plunge into famine if Israel does not stop its military campaign and fully lift its blockade, but the World Health Organization said last week that people are already starving.New data shared with the Guardian by the US-based Project Hope, which focuses on healthcare, one of the few humanitarian organisations still operating health clinics in Gaza, ‘‘found that malnutrition among children, pregnant and lactating women has surged amid the almost three-month aid blockade, with some clinics reporting up to 42% of pregnant women and 34% of lactating mothers being diagnosed as malnourished”.“Children are also increasingly affected,” according to a statement from Hope. “Our teams on the ground report that more and more families are relying on our clinics for nutritional supplements and that children visiting Project Hope clinics have gone for weeks only consuming high-energy biscuits and ready-to-use therapeutic food – items given to malnourished patients for short-term survival needs, rather than sustained nourishment.”Ghadeer, a nurse with Project Hope in Gaza, said: “The number of malnutrition cases has skyrocketed. Two months ago, malnutrition cases did not exceed 50 cases per day. Now, we’re seeing about 200 cases per day. Many of the children we see haven’t eaten real food in weeks – only the nutritional biscuits we distribute. They’re losing weight, becoming withdrawn, and getting sick more easily. We are doing everything we can, but we’re seeing the consequences of extreme hunger in an entire generation. Without more food and aid coming in, I fear for their future.”Meanwhile, plumes of smoke rose Thursday over the northern Gaza Strip where Israel’s military urged civilians to evacuate, as rescuers said Israeli strikes across the territory killed more than 50 people.Gaza’s civil defence agency said there had been “52 martyrs and dozens injured as a result of airstrikes carried out by the occupation” across the territory.The intensified Israeli offensive has drawn criticism, with EU foreign ministers agreeing on Tuesday to review the bloc’s cooperation accord with Israel.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsraelIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Requests or audits were made against the association, at least eight independent media outlets, and at least 20 journalists and their family members, including Cheng and her parents, she said at a press conference on Wednesday.Cheng said the tax department had told one journalist that they had to pay a profit tax for a company they did not run, and had cited a registration number that did not exist. Another company was told it was being audited for profits made during the year before it was even founded. One journalist had their income “assessed” as double the amount they had actually earned, and was issued a demand for prepayment of tax on the “under-reported” income.“Does the average news worker have the resources to hire an auditor to handle it?” Cheng asked. “We are concerned that tax investigations will put a financial and mental strain on media workers, disrupt our reporting and prevent us from focusing our journalistic work.”Hong Kong journalists harassed in ‘systemic and organised attack’Read moreAmong the media outlets listed as targets were InMedia HK and the English-language Hong Kong Free Press (HKFP), and the latter’s founder, Tom Grundy.HKFP said it had been “randomly selected” for a seven-year audit in 2024, and that the IRD had twice requested “hold sums”, which were later reduced to zero after the outlet objected.“HKFP has always met its tax obligations, paid IRD demands immediately, and ensured meticulous record-keeping since our 2015 inception,” it said.“The delays involved, and wide scope of these inspections, raise questions about the burden on the taxpayer and tax office resources … Recent scrutiny has diverted resources, manpower and funds away from journalism as we face a fourth year of financial deficit.”In a statement on X, Grundy said the outlet had “expected this kind of thing years ago”, and had been “obsessive” in its record keeping and financial transparency.“I’m having to act as a one-man compliance department instead of a journalist,” he said about the 15 month-long process so far.Citing IRD figures, Grundy said the chance of being “randomly” selected for an IRD audit was about 0.123%. “The probability drops much further when considering almost all independent media outlets were coincidentally, simultaneously selected.”Aleksandra Bielakowska, advocacy manager at Reporters Without Borders Asia-Pacific, said Hong Kong and Chinese authorities were doing everything in their power “to close remaining media outlets … and make sure there’s only one narrative coming from the Chinese Communist party. If they can’t put people in jail they’ll pressure them and their families to dissuade – or even prevent – them from reporting on the ground,” she told the Guardian.Hong Kong’s media have come under increasing pressureand persecution since the government crackdown on the pro-democracy movement ushered in a Beijing-designed national security law.Several outlets have been forced to close or relocate, including Apple Daily, whose founder, Jimmy Lai, is on trial for alleged offences under the NSL, and Stand News, whose two former editors werejailed for sedition last year.The Stand News sentencing came just weeks after the HKJA revealeda campaign of “systemic and organised” harassment of journalists and outlets, many of which Cheng said on Wednesday were also among those questioned by the tax authorities.The harassment included death threats and threatening and defamatory complaint letters being sent to reporters’ families and their employers, landlords and neighbours.In the latest Reporters Without Borders’ World Press Freedom Index, Hong Kong ranked 140 out of 180 countries, down from 80 in 2021.The IRD said it did not comment on individual cases but “the industry or background of a taxpayer has no bearing on such reviews”.Additional research by Lillian YangExplore more on these topicsHong KongChinaPress freedomAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

He looked out of his window to see the ship’s bow.“I went to the window and was quite astonished to see a big ship,” Helberg told the Guardian. “I had to bend my neck to see the top of it. It was so unreal.”View image in fullscreenJohan Helberg in front of the boat.Photograph: Joanne FielderThere were 16 crew members, among them Norwegians, Lithuanians, Ukrainians and Russians, on board the Cyprus-registered ship. There were no reports of injuries or oil spills. Police are investigating the incident and have identified one suspect on board the boat.“Normally ships turn left or right into the fjord. But this went straight ahead,” Helberg, who has lived in the house for 25 years, added. “It was very close to the house.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jan Langhaug/EPAPer Christian Stokke, a spokesperson for Trøndelag police district, told NRK: “There is one person on board the boat who has been identified as a suspect.”Police have interviewed the crew and are working on several theories, including technical failure and human error.The shipping company, North Sea Container Line (NCL), said the shipmate had been named a suspect but that it was a routine police procedure.NCL’s chief executive, Bente Hetland, said there was “no reason to believe this was intentional”.“Incidents like this should not happen, and we have started an investigation into the causes. Today, we are relieved that there were no injuries, and our main focus is on the people near the ship and our crew,” she added.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jan Langhaug/EPAThe ship remained stuck aground on Thursday after the first attempt to remove it was unsuccessful.

The discharges peaked in 2015 when 703kg of uranium was discharged, according to the documents.Raw uranium rock mined from all over the world is brought to the Springfields Fuels factory in Lea Town, a small village roughly five miles fromPreston, where the rock is treated and purified to create uranium fuel rods.According tothe factory’s website, it has supplied several million fuel elements to reactors in 11 different countries.The discharge point for the uranium releases is located within the Ribble estuary marine conservation zone – and about 800m upstream of the Ribble estuary, which isone of the most protected sitesin the country, classified as a site of special scientific interest, a special protection area (SPA) and a Ramsar site (a wetland designated as being of international importance).The government’s latestRadioactivity in Food and the Environment report, published in November 2024, notes that in 2023 the total dose of radiation from Springfields Fuels was approximately 4% of the dose limit that is set to protect members of the public from radiation.However, Dr Ian Fairlile, an independent consultant on radioactivity in the environment, who was a scientific secretary to the UK government’s committee examining radiation risks of internal emitters, said that in terms of radioactivity, the discharges from Springfields Fuels were a “very large amount”.“I’m concerned at this high level. It’s worrying”, he said, referring specifically to the 2015 discharge.In a2009 assessment, the Environment Agency concluded that the total dose rate of radioactivity for the Ribble and Alt estuaries SPA was “significantly in excess” of the agreed threshold of 40 microgray/h, below which regulators have agreed there would be no adverse effect to the integrity of a protected site. The report found the calculated total dose rate for the worst affected organism in the estuary was more than 10 times higher than this threshold, with discharges of radionuclides from the Springfields Fuels site to blame.As a result, amore detailed assessmentwas undertaken. In this latter report, it was concluded that based on new permitted discharge limits, which had been lowered due to planned operational changes at Springfields Fuels, the dose rates to wildlife were below the agreed threshold and therefore there was no adverse effect on the integrity of the protected site.Under the site’s current environmental permit, there is no limit on the weight of uranium discharges, which in itself has raised eyebrows. Instead, the uranium discharge is limited in terms of its radioactivity, with an annual limit of 0.04 terabecquerels. Prior to this, the discharge limit in terms of radioactivity was 0.1 terabecquerels.A terabecquerel is a unit of radioactivity equal to 1tn becquerels. One becquerel represents a rate of radioactive decay equal to one radioactive decay per second.Despite this tighter limit having been agreed six years ago, experts have raised concerns over the continued authorised discharges from the site.Fairlile specifically questioned the Environment Agency’s modelling of how this discharge level could be classified as safe. “This is a very high level. The Environment Agency’s risk modelling might be unreliable. Which would make its discharge limits unsafe”, he said.The Environment Agency said its processes for assessing impacts to habitats were “robust and follow international best practice, including the use of a tiered assessment approach”.Dr Patrick Byrne, a reader in hydrology and environmental pollution at Liverpool John Moores University, said the 703kg of uranium discharged in 2015 was an “exceptionally high volume”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The researchers described this as a “significant anomaly”.The UK is looking to expand its nuclear fuel production capabilities,including at Springfields Fuels. This is in order to increase energy security and reduce reliance on Russian fuel, and todeliver on a targetof 24GW of new nuclear capacity by 2050.Springfield Fuels did not respond to repeated requests for comment. An Environment Agency spokesperson said: “The Environment Agency strictly regulates Springfields Fuels through robust environmental permits that control radioactive discharges, ensuring they pose no unacceptable risk to people or the environment. These permits are based on international best practice and are routinely reviewed, including detailed habitat assessments. Discharge limits have been progressively reduced over time, and monitoring by both the operator and the Environment Agency confirms no cause for concern.”Explore more on these topicsNuclear wasteNuclear powerEnergyWastePrestonNorth of EnglandEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

As human-induced climate breakdown continues to raise global temperatures, the frequency of marine heatwaves is increasing.“This is unprecedented because it is happening so early in the year,” said Dr Manuela Truebano, from the school of biological and marine sciences at the University of Plymouth. “To see these temperature rises around UK waters at this time of year is quite sobering. Each time it happens we use the word ‘unprecedented’, and I am very concerned at the increase in prevalence and intensity of these marine heatwave events.”Temperatures in the sea off the south coast ofDevon, Cornwall and Ireland have risen by between 2C and 4C above average temperatures for this time of year.Dr Dan Smale, of the Marine Biological Association, said the usual springtime water temperatures would be 11C-12C, but the waters were now at absolute temperatures of 15C-16C.The UK is increasingly being hit by marine heatwaves, with sea temperatures in June 2023 reaching their highest levels since records began. At the time the warmingwas labelled as “unheard of”.Truebano said the rise in sea temperatures so early in the spring was even more concerning. The marine heatwave began in March and has continued for almost two months. If the sea temperatures continue to rise into the summer months there are fears of mass die-offs of fish and other marine life.Marine biologists say the impacts of the spring marine heatwave could be profound, including changes in the reproductive patterns of plankton, which in turn could lead to reductions in fish numbers later in the year.Smale said: “It is a concern that these warming events are happening more and more in the UK and Ireland. Traditionally UK waters have not been affected, but these events are starting to happen more frequently and the associated temperatures are increasing.“If this continues through the summer we would expect to see widespread biological impacts. This is a significant warming event.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

A2019 study foundthe number of heatwave days rose by more than 50% in the 30 years to 2016, compared with the period from 1925-54. Scientists said at the time the heat destroyed swaths of sea life “like wildfires take out huge areas of forest”.Dr Jonathan Tinker, a marine climate scientist at the Met Office, said: “With projections suggesting UK summer sea temperaturescould rise by up to 2.5C by 2050, such events are likely to become more frequent, intense and longer-lasting. Marine heatwaves offer a glimpse into how changing ocean conditions could shape future weather conditions.”Explore more on these topicsMarine lifeOceansClimate crisisFishDevonCornwallIrelandnewsShareReuse this content"

They fly out at night in search of food, eating abouthalf their body weightin insects.Little is known about these foraging flights, so Victoria’sArthur Rylah Institute trackedbats from the Portland maternity cave 350km west of Melbourne, to see where they went.In summer-autumn, some bats flew from Portland to the Naracoorte maternity caves in South Australia or to Victoria’s Warrnambool maternity caves – about 156km and 97km away, respectively – in a single night. The bats mostly returned on subsequent nights via a second direct, single-night flight.View image in fullscreenSouthern bent-wing bats are about 5cm long with distinctive puffy brown fur and roundish heads.Photograph: Lindy LumsdenThose vast distances were “pretty amazing for a bat that’s less than the size of a mouse”, said wildlife ecology scientist Amanda Bush from the Arthur Rylah Institute.Glossy black cockatoos could be pushed towards extinction in Victoria if burns go ahead, experts warnRead moreTo put this in perspective, the average person commutes16km to workin Australia, usually with the help of a vehicle.To collect the data, researchers fitted miniature GPS trackers on to 39 adult bats in September 2023 and another 69 trackers in February 2024. They managed to retrieve 47 trackers (and their onboard data) by re-trapping bats and searching cave floors for transmitters that had fallen off.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email“Once the VHF signal on the trackers died, they were sometimes difficult to find among piles of bat guano, but we’d spot them by seeing their small aerials,” Bush said.The bats flew further from their roosts during summer-autumn, with an average nightly commute of 36km. They often headed inland, moving through forests and open farmland.Bats visited a wide range of habitats, including eucalypt and pine forests, roadsides, windbreaks, open farm land, coastal scrub and urban areas.The distances involved were “incredible”, said University of Melbourne bat expert, associate prof Lisa Godinho, who was not involved in the research.View image in fullscreenEcologists have mapped the foraging flights of southern bent-wing bats during summer-autumn from Portland in southern Victoria to maternity caves in Warrnambool and the Naracoorte caves in South Australia.Composite: Victoria Department of Energy, Environment and Climate Action“We know that their heart beats at about 1,000 beats-a-minute when they’re flying,” she said.Southern bent-wing bats are “quite adorable”, Godinho said, measuring about 5cm long, with distinctive puffy brown fur and roundish heads.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But while caves are critical to their survival, it is also important to understand what other parts of the landscape they rely on.Bat flights in spring were shorter, and focused on coastal areas. The largest distance recorded in spring was 78km from their roost, while the average was 12km.Shorter flights likely related to pregnant females, Godinho said. “It’s energetically so expensive to go a long way. If there’s enough resources close to the maternity roost, then you would stay in that area.”View image in fullscreenBat flights in spring were shorter and focused on coastal areas.Composite: Victoria Department of Energy, Environment and Climate ActionIn summer-autumn, the bats would bulk up before winter, when fewer insects were available, and the mammals relied on “torpor” – dropping their body temperature and metabolic rate – to conserve energy.“Realising that they travel this far through the landscape in order to find resources, raises the question – is that normal? Or has the fragmentation and degradation of the landscape meant that they are now having to travel that far in order to find what they need?” Godinho said.Southern bent-wing bats once numbered in the hundreds of thousands, but today there arefewer than 45,000. Protecting maternity sites and key foraging habitat has been identified asa priority actionfor the critically endangered species.Deakin University research fellow Dr Amanda Lo Cascio agreed the distances travelled were a “long way for a little bat”.Lo Cascio said southern bent-wing bats were good flyers and flew quite fast, using sound – or echolocation – to navigate, similar to whales and dolphins.Knowing where and how far they travelled at night was especially important for assessing proposed developments in their flight paths and habitats, and considering the threats they might be exposed to, she said.Explore more on these topicsWildlifeAustralian climate and environment in focusAnimalsShareReuse this content"

The plastic she collected from a public waste site would be sold for some money that saved her children from begging.Today, dressed in a dark green jacket monogrammed with the acronym Swach (solid waste collection and handling) over a colourful sari, the 53-year-old is one among an organised group of waste collectors and climate educators who teach residents in urban Pune how to segregate and manage waste, based on a PPPP – a pro-poor private public partnership.“Even though we were earning money and running our homes by collecting and selling recyclable waste in the past, our job was not valued and we were not respected for the work we did,” Sawant says as she pushes a loaded four-wheeled metal cart up a gentle slope. “People called us thieves and restricted our access to some areas, and the police frequently harassed us.”Swach was set up in 2005 by a trade union of waste pickers,Kagad Kach Patra Kashtakari Panchayat(KKPKP), which was not in favour of contractor-run private models and envisioned a scheme that enhanced waste collectors’ work instead of displacing them.Lakshmi Narayan, one of the co-founders of Swach and KKPKP, says: “Contractor models typically end up hiring males and displacing the people who traditionally did the work. We strongly felt that a person who has been doing the work for so long brings in the knowledge, experience and intelligence to handle the material in a particular way, and should be the first claimant of that work, and she should then also have the first right of refusal. We wanted a PPPP – a pro-poor private public partnership.”These kind of partnerships are contracts between the state or local authority and a group of private individuals that aim toprovide a public servicewhile simultaneously alleviating poverty.Rehabilitating the waste workers by teaching them a new skill such as embroidery, and taking them away from their work of waste collection, segregation and sale was not the long-term solution, Narayan says. “The waste sector generates a large number of jobs not just in Pune but across the world, and the waste collectors feed into a multibillion-dollar industry which comprises scrap dealers, waste transporters, recyclers and reprocessors, and then the material goes back into the industry. There is also a whole economy that’s dependent on them.”Through detailed discussions with waste pickers, KKPKP realised that they were diverting a significant amount of waste from the landfill. Segregation at source, plus recycling material recovered from the waste, was contributing to climate change mitigation by minimising landfill waste, reducing greenhouse gas (particularly methane) emissions, lowering the demand for scarce raw materials and saving taxpayers money by reducing solid waste management costs.Of the waste generated by the city, Swach sorts and recycles about 227 tonnes a day (82,891 tonnes a year) that is diverted away from landfills. Swach estimates that in doing so it saves the city £10m that would have been needed for processing, transportation and human resources. The waste sector is the third-largest source of anthropogenic methane emissions, one of the most potent of greenhouse gases, and SwacH calculates that its work saves100,000 tonnes of CO2every year.A just green transitionIn negotiations over a global plastics treaty in Busan, South Korea, last year, the chair’stexthighlighted that countries should take measures to “promote a just transition for plastic waste management workers, especially waste pickers and other informal workers”.Narayan says: “We have argued that waste collection itself is green work but it’s not necessarily decent work. And there has to be a way to make it decent.” Narayan says the Swach model helped transition the work of waste collectors from the informal sector, in which they spent their whole day at public bins and roadsides in tattered clothes, to a more formalised setup, where they began wearing a uniform and started speaking directly to residents.Rani Shivsharan, a waste picker and board member of Swach, says: “We did not know how to talk to people, since we had never been included in society. We wouldn’t have dared to talk in front of even two people, but now we can fearlessly articulate our demands and thoughts with conviction in front of an audience of 500.”View image in fullscreenMore than 70% of Swach waste collectors are women.Photograph: Swach Cooperative, PuneToday, Swach has more than 3,850 self-reliant waste picker members, who provide daily doorstep waste collection services to citizens of Pune who pay a small monthly fee. Under the PPPP, each member is a shareholder and earns about 16,000 rupees (£140) a month.“As a part of Swach, we were able to get ID cards and benefits such as health and education funds,” says Vidya Naiknaware, a Swach member since 2005 who is also on the board. “Several waste collectors across the state do not have these facilities; it is time to ensure they also get these benefits. They should be empowered, like we were because of Swach, and they should also be given first priority to work in the waste sector.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

After a long delay, the city’s civic body, Pune Municipal Corporation, finally renewed Swach’s contract for a five-year term this year.“We had to repeatedly nudge them, we conducted protests with close to 1,000 women, and the contract was done finally,” says Suman More, a waste picker and chair of the cooperative.Naiknaware says: “Despite all the environmental and climate change benefits due to our services, why do we have to fight for a contract? Why doesn’t the PMC make this a permanent part of the waste management system?”More than 70% of Swach waste collectors are women, a conscious decision while forming the cooperative. In the city, waste collection was the only work available for some women and their families. Owing to their caste, they were not allowed into certain houses, so they couldn’t even do domestic work, Narayan says. “This is the one job that was left to them when they had nothing – neither capital, nor education, nor tools of trade. So they decided to collect waste and make a living off it.”Sawant, like many, migrated to Pune with her husband and children; with no work or land, she began collecting plastic from a public dump site to sell for money in a desperate attempt to save her children from beggary. Since that difficult beginning, Sawant has used her leadership skills to uplift other women like her, for which she was made a board member of Swach. “Today we can sit like equals on a chair only because of Swach,” she says.Waste pickers perceive this transition into Swach as a form of upward mobility, security, tenure, and an improvement in their conditions of work, which came about because they were a part of the discussion and negotiation for what the new work could look like.“If they perceive that this work therefore needs to be protected for them and others should not enter the space, we strongly agree,” Narayan says. “Swach is designed to protect the rights of the original people doing the work and allowing entrants from other castes and gender, ie males, to enter only once there is the first right of refusal exercised by a traditional, what we call erstwhile, waste picker.”This is an abridged version of a pieceoriginally published by Mongabay.Explore more on these topicsWasteThe alternativesRecyclingIndiaSouth and central AsiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Ministers said the total cost of the deal would be £3.4bn​, on the basis that the value of the payments would decrease with inflation.Speaking from the UK’s military headquarters, Starmer said there was “no alternative” to this agreement and defended its cost, saying it was “part and parcel of using Britain’s reach to keep us safe at home”. He said it was less than the cost of running one aircraft carrier for a year.Downing Street said the deal was a “legal necessity” and backed by the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, which are part of an intelligence-sharing partnership with the UK. In 2021 a UN courtgave an advisory opinionthat the UK did not have rightful sovereignty over the Chagos archipelago.View image in fullscreenThe cost of leasing Diego Garcia, revealed for the first time on Thursday, is £101m a year.Photograph: APSome inside government and the Labour party had privately attacked the agreement by asking why the UK was spending billions on it amid cost pressures.No 10 is said to have been concerned about the backlash to finalising the deal amidwidespread consternation over cutsto winter fuel payments and disability benefits. MPs and campaigners have said those cuts contributed to Labour’s heavy losses in the local elections in England this month.There have also been fears that the base will become vulnerable to interference from hostile states such as China, which has good relations with Mauritius. In response the government said there was “robust provisions” to keep adversaries out, including a 24-nautical mile buffer zone where nothing can be built without UK consent.Starmer said that by attacking the deal, the Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, and the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, were “in that column alongside Russia, China and Iran, rather than the column that has the UK and its allies in it”.Priti Patel, the shadow foreign secretary, accused Starmer of having “slandered the Chagossian community” by lumping opponents of the deal with hostile states. “He has resorted to baseless and disgusting slurs – whilst he himself hands control of Chagos to a country that is actually cosying up with Russia and China,” she said.The Chagossians do not speak with one voice on the future of the islands. Some have expressed support for the deal to hand sovereignty over them to Mauritius, while others are staunchly against it.Peter Lamb, the Labour MP for Crawley, West Sussex, which is home to about 4,000 Chagossians, criticised the deal in the Commons. He said it did not secure their right to return to their homeland and asked “what should I tell my Chagossian constituents, when they ask the moral basis upon which the UK is ignoring their right to self-determination while we fight for it in Ukraine for Ukrainians?”John Healey, the defence secretary, said the UK would finance a £40m trust fund for Mauritius to support the Chagossian people.Plans to complete the agreement were almost scuppered by a legal challenge in the early hours of Thursday. The prime minister had been due to attend a virtual event with the Mauritian government when a high court judge granted an injunction brought against the Foreign Office by a British Chagossian at 2.25am on Thursday.Overnight Mr Justice Goose granted “interim relief” to Bertrice Pompe, who was born on Diego Garcia and had previously taken legal action against the agreement.But hours later Mr Justice Chamberlain discharged the injunction, ruling that “the public interest and the interests of the United Kingdom would be substantially prejudiced by the grant or continuance of interim relief”.The court was told by Harriet Mathews, the Foreign Office’s director general for Africa, the Americas and Overseas Territories, that the delay had “caused harm to the UK’s reputation”.View image in fullscreenBertrice Pompe, left, with Bernadette Dugasse outside London’s high court, said: ‘We are British citizens … We don’t want to give our rights to Mauritius, we are not Mauritian.’Photograph: Suzanne Plunkett/ReutersSpeaking outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London after the injunction was discharged, Pompe said it was “a very, very sad day … We are British citizens, yet our right doesn’t count. We don’t want to give our rights to Mauritius, we are not Mauritians.”Starmer said the last-minute legal challenge had been “a good thing” because it had forced a court to come down conclusively on the government’s side.MapNo 10 said last month that Donald Trump hadsigned off the dealafter a meeting with Starmer in the White House in February where theUS president saidhe had “a feeling it’s going to work out very well”.The news of the government’s intention to green-light the deal came a day after Starmer announced a U-turn on the winter fuel allowance. Hetold the Commons on Wednesdaythat he wanted to “ensure that as we go forward, more pensioners are eligible for winter fuel payments”. The Guardianrevealed earlier this monththat Downing Street was rethinking the policy.Before February, there had beenconcerns in governmentthat Trump would block the Chagos Islands agreement after a backlash from some senior US Republicans.Senior figures in the Trump administration including Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, had criticised the proposals last year because of Mauritius’srelationship with China. Farage, the Reform UK leader, repeatedly claimed that Trump would reject the proposal once he turned his attention to it, but this did not materialise.Explore more on these topicsChagos IslandsForeign, Commonwealth and Development OfficeMauritiusKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

To every Labour MP reading the leaked memo in theDaily Telegraphsetting out the deputy prime minister’s alternative tax-raising measures, it felt like firing the starting gun on a race to succeed Keir Starmer as leader.It has infuriated Starmer loyalists because of long memories of the breakdown in relations afterLabourlost the Hartlepool byelection just a year into Starmer’s leadership, when he considered quitting and allies of Rayner encouraged her to stand against him. Starmer then attempted to demote her, leading to a fierce standoff and Rayner emerging with a clutch of new job titles.Relations have somewhat healed since then, but there is a feeling now that the deputy prime minister is once again seeming to try to capitalise on the party’s misfortunes – an allegation considered deeply unfair by those close to her.There is no doubt this memo setting out new ways ofraising taxes on wealthy peopleas well as a proposal to clamp down on benefits for migrants is a way of trying to show her broader appeal. “She’s trying to put clear water between her and Keir,” one senior source said.Sources close to Rayner say the suggestions made in the letters before the spring statement are par for the course, intended to be helpful ideas in Rayner’s capacity as deputy prime minister, for which she has her own mandate.They insist they were not documents intended to be leaked to show she has diverged from Starmer and Rachel Reeves on the economy, arguing that the Telegraph would not be their chosen vehicle were that the case.But plenty in No 10 and the Treasury see this as obvious manoeuvres. “Sorry but this is not normal,” one said.Supporters of Rayner have quietly been conducting unauthorised focus groups to find out how she would fare in the event of a leadership campaign. They say the results show she fares well with voters in terms of authenticity and compassion. What she needs to show is that she is a serious politician.Whether or not a Rayner ally was responsible for leaking the memo to the Telegraph, some close to her believe it will have helped. “We want to prove she’s serious; this is a serious memo,” said one.Others disagree. One Labour source joked that the policies looked as if they had been generated by ChatGPT.View image in fullscreenMany Labour figures believe the next leadership contest would come down to Angela Rayner against the health secretary, Wes Streeting.Photograph: Jon Super/APFor those who would like to see more bold thinking, Rayner’s challenge from the left within the cabinet is a good thing. Should Reeves follow any of these measures in the October budget, in which everyone expects taxes to rise, then Rayner can claim credit. If Reeves does not, Rayner has a credible argument that different choices could have been made.But there is little in the memo that argues for anything as bold as some MPs on the left have been pushing for, such as a big overhaul of the tax system.“I think all this does at the moment is help Keir,” said one MP who has been critical of the leadership. “Who is an alternative, given no one has any ideas? The question isn’t what candidate but why? This is more than a [communications] problem. It’s existential.”The deputy prime minister is by far the grassroots’ favourite for the top job and would have the sweep of trade union backing. Her popularity with members is significantly higher than that of her most obvious rival,Wes Streeting.Rayner urged Reeves to consider wealth tax rises before spring statementRead moreThose MPs who would like to see a woman succeed Starmer but have doubts about Rayner admit they have no obvious candidate. Reeves and Bridget Phillipson no longer have the widespread admiration they had in opposition.It is no secret that a significant contingent of cabinet ministers and MPs – far beyond the usual suspects on the left of the party – would like to see a radical economic reset after this month’s local election results.Even the Labour Growth Group, a contingent of loyalist MPs once mockingly called “the provisional wing of the Treasury”, have decried the current strategy as “stuck in an economic doom loop”.Some close to Rayner say she has been bruised by the scrutiny of her family during the row over the sale of her former council house. But they admit that should the opportunity arise, she would be almost certain to put herself forward for leader.“She is the de facto leader of the soft left,” said one. “She pretty much won’t have a choice.”Rayner is not the only one positioning herself for a future leadership bid. Many Labour figures believe the next leadership contest is likely to come down to her against Streeting, who is far to the right.Labour MPs point out that Streeting has been diligent in courting the ranks of new backbenchers. Despite his high-profile government position as health secretary, sources say he recently hosted a karaoke evening with backbenchers where he bought drinks, and he constantly checks in on MPs’ angst on the WhatsApp groups and in the tea rooms.“The next leadership will be either Wes or Angela,” said one Labour figure. “It will be head versus heart.”Explore more on these topicsAngela RaynerLabourLabour party leadershipKeir StarmerWes StreetinganalysisShareReuse this content"

Similarly, in 2014 less than 1% of local authorities in England had 10 or more vape shops, rising to 28% in 2024.The study, conducted by researchers atHealth Equity North, looked at Ordnance Survey data to track how amenities had changed between 2014 and 2024. The amenities were divided into those seen as “health promoting”, such as pharmacies, libraries and supermarkets, and “health reducing” such as vape shops, bookmakers, takeaways and alcohol-only outlets.They found a stark decline in healthier amenities, with unhealthy alternatives taking their place. Takeaway shops were up by almost a quarter (24%) across England, while the number of banks and building societies decreased by 40%, and supermarkets by 10%.The report found there were stark regional divides across England regarding high-street amenities, with twice as many vape shops in the north of England. The number of takeaways in the north of England rose by a third (31%), compared with a rise of 18% in the south.There were three times as many vape shops in deprived areas compared with the least deprived ones. Deprived areas also had 25 times more pawnbrokers and more than three times as many bookmakers.Dr Eman Zied Abozied, research associate at Newcastle University Population Sciences Institute, said the study showed that high streets were becoming “less healthy and welcoming places to visit”.“The disappearance of amenities such as supermarkets, banks, pharmacies and public toilets particularly affects groups such as women, children and the elderly,” she said. “But what we’re seeing impacts all of us. The deterioration of our high streets makes our centres feel less safe, less inviting, and ultimately makes us feel more disconnected as communities.”She added: “It is important that we act now to reverse this decline. If we involve local communities in making decisions about their high streets, we can make our high streets and towns more accessible and healthy for everyone.”Prof Clare Bambra, an academic co-director atHealthEquity North and professor of public health at Newcastle University, said: “Over the last decade, our high streets have been hit by a devastating succession of shocks – from the impact of austerity to the Covid-19 pandemic. They’ve also been hollowed out by changing spending habits, and the rising cost of living.“This trend has disproportionately affected the most deprived places in our country. The northern high street now has fewer places to go to buy essentials, as well as fewer supermarkets, public toilets and other amenities and resources. The north has twice as many vape shops as the south, as well as more takeaway outlets and bookmakers.“You should be able to walk down a high street, and feel the uniqueness, culture and identity of that community. Through innovative design, better public transport, and measures that promote people over cars, we can rethink these spaces so they become ‘go-to’s’ rather than ‘ghost towns’.”A government spokesperson said:“For years high streets have been starved of investment despite their potential to thrive, but we are taking decisive action to turn the tide through our Plan for Change.“Councils and local leaders have powers to tackle persistently vacant properties in city, town and village centres by putting the leases up for auction to help restrict the types of businesses that fill those lots.“We are driving regeneration and growth with £1.5billion through the Plan for Neighbourhoods to boost high streets, and we’re bringing empty shops back to life through our high street rental auctions.”Local authorities with the most vape shops per 10,000 people in 2024 in EnglandCity of London, London: 4.6Blackburn with Darwen, north-west: 1.7Preston, north-west: 1.6Blackpool, north-west: 1.2Bolton, north-west: 1.2Lincoln, East Midlands: 1.2Thanet, south-east: 1.2Chesterfield, East Midlands: 1.1Hyndburn, north-west: 1.1Derbyshire Dales, East Midlands: 1Explore more on these topicsCommunitiesInequalityHealthVapingGamblingPovertyEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

His debut mixtape Demotape/Vega was nominated for the Mercury prize, and Who Am I, his debut album, features collaborators such as Fred Again.Irish singer-songwriter Orla Gartland won best song musically and lyrically for her spartan ballad Mine, a devastatingly honest song that examines longstanding trauma and how Gartland relearned intimacy.She beat one of the biggest British songs of the year in that category, Messy by Lola Young, as well as competition from Raye, Laura Marling and Fontaines DC. Young picked up the rising star award, though, after the morose and sweary Messy spent four weeks at UK No 1 and became a global smash.Best contemporary song was awarded to the relatively little-heard Circumnavigating Georgia by Sans Soucis, who beat Jade’s pop smash Angel of My Dreams as well as rap tracks by Pa Salieu, Ghetts and Bashy.Sans Soucis is the artist name of Giulia Grispino, an Italian-Congolese artist who relocated to London as a young adult. Circumnavigating Georgia, the title track of her second album, is a dreamy yet pointed ballad with ambient backing, as Grispino considers love and changing selfhood.In the screen composition categories, Raffertie won best original film score for his work on Demi Moore body horror The Substance, and Vince Pope won best television soundtrack for True Detective: Night Country.There was an indie triumph in the best original video game score category, given to John Konsolakis for his symphonic work for homegrown Scottish game Farewell North, in which you play a border collie traversing a landscape inspired by the Scottish Highlands.The award for most performed work was given to Myles Smith for his huge, heartfelt hit Stargazing, which has been ubiquitous on radio and streaming.The Ivors Academy also handed out a series of honorary awards. U2 became the first Irish act to be named Academy Fellows, while the icon award was given toRobbie Williamsin the week he announced his latest album, Britpop. The visionary award was given to Self Esteem, after the recent release of her third studio album A Complicated Woman, and the special international award was given to Brandon Flowers, frontman of the Killers.The classic lineup of British indie bandBloc Party– Kele Okereke, Russell Lissack, Gordon Moakes and Matt Tong – were given the award for outstanding song collection, recognising a career that stretches back to their enduringly popular 2005 debut album Silent Alarm.Ivors Academy chief executive Roberto Neri acknowledged the challenges faced by songwriters as he hailed the winners. “Whether it’s fair pay, safe working environments or ensuring meaningful opt-in consent in the age of AI, the Ivors Academy exists to protect, empower and celebrate the most vital creative force in the music industry,” he said.2025 Ivor Novello winners in fullBest album:Who Am I, written and performed by BerwynBest contemporary song: Circumnavigating Georgia, written and performed by Sans SoucisBest song musically and lyrically: Mine, written and performed by Orla GartlandMost performed work: Stargazing, written by Peter Fenn, Jesse Fink and Myles Smith, and performed by Myles SmithRising star award: Lola YoungBest original fim score: The Substance, composed by RaffertieBest original video game score: Farewell North, composed by John KonsolakisBest television soundtrack: True Detective: Night Country, composed by Vince PopeAcademy fellowship: Bono, the Edge, Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen Jr for U2Outstanding song collection: Kele Okereke, Russell Lissack, Gordon Moakes and Matt Tong for Bloc PartyIcon award: Robbie WilliamsSongwriter of the year: Charli xcxSpecial international award: Brandon FlowersVisionary award: Self EsteemExplore more on these topicsIvor Novello awardsPop and rockAwards and prizesIrelandU2Charli xcxThe KillersnewsShareReuse this content"

In it Noem said: “I am writing to inform you that effective immediately, Harvard University’s Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification is revoked.”“The revocation of your Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification means that Harvard is prohibited from having any aliens on F- or J-nonimmigrant status for the 2025-2026 academic school year. This decertification also means that existing aliens on F- or J- nonimmigrant status must transfer to another university in order to maintain their nonimmigrant status,” Noem continued.Trump administration piles pressure on Harvard with $450m more in cutsRead moreNoem justified the decision by saying: “This action should not surprise you and is the unfortunate result of Harvard’s failure to comply with simple reporting requirements … Consequences must follow to send a clear signal to Harvard and all universities that want to enjoy the privilege of enrolling foreign students, that theTrump administrationwill enforce the law and root out the evils of anti-Americanism and antisemitism in society and campuses.”The former governor of South Dakota alsoaccusedHarvard of “fostering violence, antisemitism and coordinating with the Chinese Communist party on its campus”.In a separate press release, the homeland security department said: “Secretary Noem is following through on her promise to protect students and prohibit terrorist sympathizers from receiving benefits from the US government.”A Harvard spokesperson called the government’s action “unlawful” in a statement to the Guardian on Thursday.“We are fully committed to maintaining Harvard’s ability to host our international students and scholars, who hail from more than 140 countries and enrich the university – and this nation – immeasurably,” the spokesperson said.“We are working quickly to provide guidance and support to members of our community. This retaliatory action threatens serious harm to the Harvard community and our country, and undermines Harvard’s academic and research mission.”Pippa Norris, an author and Paul F McGuire lecturer in comparative politics at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, told the Guardian on Thursday that Trump “is basically cutting off international knowledge to American students, he is reducing soft power, and therefore weakening America … And for me personally, it’s going to mean tremendous problems in terms of teaching.”Norris said “about 90%” of her students are international, so if she “can no longer recruit international students, then the demand and participants, etc, is going to go down”.She continued: “Imagine that you’ve come, you’ve spent a lot of money and resources to come to Harvard, and you’ve got in, and your second or third year of the undergraduate degree, or the second year of your master’s degree, and [they] say: ‘Well, I’m sorry, you know, you’re not going to be able to study here next year.’ I mean, it’s devastating.”Leo Gerdén, an international student from Sweden, called the announcement “devastating” in the university newspaperHarvard Crimson.“Every tool available they should use to try and change this. It could be all the legal resources suing the Trump administration, whatever they can use the endowment to, whatever they can use their political network in Congress,” Gerdén said, adding: “This should be, by far, priority number one.”The university currently hosts nearly 6,800 international students, with many being on F-1 or J-1 visas,according touniversity records. International students make up about 27% of the university’s population.The latest decision from the homeland security department comes amidgrowing tensionsbetween federal officials and Harvard over the Trump administration’s claims that the university has implemented inadequate responses to antisemitism on its campus.The Trump administrationterminateda further $450m in grants to the university in May, following anearlier cancellationof $2.2bn in federal funding.A Trump-appointed antisemitism taskforce haspointed to“just how radical Harvard has become” as nationwide anti-war protesters – including students – demonstrated against Israel’s deadly onslaught on Gaza, which has killed at least 53,000 Palestinians in the last year and a half.The Trump administration has alsoorderedthe university to dismantle its diversity, equity and inclusion programming, restrict student protests and disclose admission details to federal officials.The Trump-Harvard showdown is the latest front in a long conservative war against academiaRead moreIn response to the federal cuts, the university – with an endowment of more than $53bn – filed alawsuitagainst the Trump administration.Harvard’s president, Alan Garber,saidin April that “no government – regardless of which party is in power – should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue”.Garber alsosaid: “The university will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights … The administration’s prescription goes beyond the power of the federal government. It violates Harvard’s first amendment rights and exceeds the statutory limits of the government’s authority under Title VI. And it threatens our values as a private institution devoted to the pursuit, production and dissemination of knowledge.”Of how this will affect Harvard’s future, Norris said: “Why would any further international students apply to America, not just Harvard, if they can’t know that they’ve got a guaranteed place?“[This halt is] going to benefit Oxford and Cambridge and many other academic institutions, because of course, the best of the brightest could apply wherever they would.

Ive and Altman are worth backing, given the products they have overseen, but observers say they have set themselves an ambitious goal – one made all the more difficult by the legacy of Ive’s time at Apple.“It really will have to be amazing to prise people away from today’s screen-based devices,” says Martha Bennett, an analyst at Forrester Research.Bennett points to the failure of AI hardware devices such as Humane’s defunct AI “pin” – a small, wearable AI assistant thatreceived poor reviews– as an example of how the duo have a “steep hill to climb”. Ive described the Humane pin and the equally small-scale Rabbit R1 device as “very poor products”.So what was the prototype that Altman was testing? He has told employees thatOpenAIplans to build 100m AI “companions” that will be part of users’ everyday life, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday.The product will be “unobtrusive” and capable of being fully aware of a user’s surroundings and life, the paper report added, and it will be a third core device that someone will have on their desk after a MacBook Pro and aniPhone. The device is neither a phone nor a pair of glasses; Altman said Ive had been sceptical about building something to be worn on the body, according to the WSJ.The video indicated that the fruits of the io deal – a complex arrangement whereby Ive’s LoveFrom design company assumes design and creative oversight of OpenAI and io – will emerge next year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The initiative was shut down in August.A spokesperson for the FTC declined to comment.Media Matters and the World Federation of Advertisers did not immediately respond to a request for comment.An investigative demand is not proof of wrongdoing, and not all investigations result in the FTC taking enforcement action.Advertisingspending on X is set to increase in 2025 for the first time since Musk bought it in 2022, research firm Emarketer said in March, but it remains below its pre-Musk level. The Tesla CEO was a major donor to Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign and runs his initiative to slash the federal workforce.Last year, X sued the World Federation of Advertisers and a group of major brands in federal court in Texas, accusing them of illegally conspiring to curtail ad spending.The group has asked a judge to dismiss the lawsuit, contending that advertisers chose other platforms based on their concerns about X’s commitment to brand safety.Media Matters and X are battling each other in federal courts in Texas and California.X sued Media Matters in 2023, accusing the organization of defaming it in an article that said ads for major brands had appeared next to posts on X that touted far-right extremist content.Media Matters has denied the allegations, and sued X, accusing it of abusive, costly and meritless lawsuits to punish the group for its reporting on advertising on X after Musk purchased the site.The organization has said defending against X’s claims has cost it millions of dollars.Explore more on these topicsUS newsElon MuskXAdvertisingnewsShareReuse this content"

But a surprising number of pictures at this year’s festival side with the locally rooted over cosmopolitan elitesPhilip Oltermann, European culture editorThu 22 May 2025 10.58 EDTLast modified on Thu 22 May 2025 12.50 EDTShareIfDonald Trumpreally wants to save Hollywood, maybe he needs to venture outside his comfort zone and watch more European art house cinema.TheCannes film festival, which closes on Saturday, is in many ways the very definition of the “globalism” that the American president’s Maga movement despises. Walk past the queues snaking alongside the Palais des Festivals and you hear languages and accents from every corner of the globe. The Marché du Film, where industry professionals strike their deals, is brimming with smart people from all over the world beckoning US producers with irresistible tax incentives – resulting in the kind of movies “produced in foreign lands” that the US president earlier this month proposed punishing with 100% tariffs. At the opening gala, Cannes gave Trump arch-enemy Robert De Niro a platform to rally the world of cinema against the US president, “without violence, but with great passion and determination”.View image in fullscreenAmélie Bonnin’s Partir un jour.Photograph: Courtesy: Cannes film festivalBut then you sit down in a dark screening room at the Palais, the piano strains of Camille Saint-Saëns’ Aquarius trickle over the Cannes trailer, and that distinction is not so clear any more. In French director Amélie Bonnin’s opening film Partir un Jour, driven-but-stressed celebrity chef Cécile is preparing for the opening of her new haute cuisine diner in Paris when news reaches her of the ill health of her father, who runs a run-of-the-mill roadside restaurant called Pit Stop out in the sticks. Cécile’s father ribs his daughter about her disdain for the unsophisticated palates of the “yokels”, but it’s apparent from the outset that the film’s sympathies lie a lorry-ride away from France’s cosmopolitan centre.If at the heart of the culture war waged by Trump and his populist allies in Europe runs a divide between locally rooted “somewheres” and cosmopolitan “anywheres”, Partir un Jour is very much a “somewhere film”. It ultimately rejects shiso-flavoured lobster, roquefort panna cotta and Michelin stars in favour of boeuf bourguignon, hotdogs and Michelin tyres. At Cannes, it turned out to be less of a duff note than the beginning of a theme.Everywhere you looked, there were stories with a very specific sense of place: of people who are stuck in remote locations (Palme d’Or-buzzy The Sound of Falling by German newcomer Mascha Schilinski, Scottish auteur Lynne Ramsay’s Die, My Love) or return to them (French director’s Dominik Moll’s yellow-vests drama Dossier 137).The thrill of big-city living was rarely glimpsed on any of the festival’s many screens. Turkish-German director Fatih Akin, who burst on the international scene 20 years ago with explosive urban drama Head-On, came to the Riviera with Amrum, a film set entirely on a remote North Sea island at the end of the second world war. Even Spanish director Oliver Laxe’s techno-infused mystery drama Sirât is not set in a Barcelona night club but a desert rave. The left-behinds? They were not so much ignored as put centre-stage and armed with automatic rifles in “elevated horror” director Ari Aster’s Eddington, a Covid satire so even-handed in its mockery of pandemic follies that it has earned criticism of striving for“Maga compatibility”.A more lenient view would be that film-makers should have no truck with the binaries conjured up by politicians in the first place, because art at its best dissolves them anyway. Some of the most interesting films at Cannes were somewhere-anywhere films, rooted in a place but allowed to grow outwards. Finnish film-maker Lauri-Matti Parppei’s A Light That Never Goes Out, about a prodigy flautist who returns to his coastal family home after suffering a breakdown, sets out like Bonnin’s but turns a familiar plot on its head: in rural Rauma, protagonist Pauli finds meaning not in folksy simplicity but in joining an experimental noise-core band.Akin’s Amrum prods the eternal German subject ofHeimat(“homeland”) and comes up with unusual answers. What makes someonebelongto Amrum, wonders the film’s child protagonist at one point. His schoolmates reckon it requires one to be born there, while his Nazi mother believes it runs in the blood. But the island’s oldest inhabitants tell him that’s all nonsense: real Amrumers, they reckon, are those who leave the island at the first opportunity.View image in fullscreenImogen Poots in The Chronology of Water.Photograph: Courtesy: Cannes film festival“Anywhere” films at Cannes were few and far between, but it’s perhaps no coincidence that those that fit the tag were the ones with most box office potential: Christopher McQuarrie’s eighth instalment of the globe-racing Mission Impossible franchise, and Wes Anderson’s latest all-star ensemble piece The Phoenician Scheme, whose shady industrialist protagonist Zsa-Zsa Korda (Benicio del Toro) doesn’t even need a passport, because “I live anywhere”.They are anywhere films in terms of their production: M:I 8’s big action set-pieces were filmed in London, Norway and thin airover South Africa, while The Phoenician Scheme is set in the fictional Middle Eastern-looking country of Phoenicia but was shot entirely in a studio in Babelsberg, outside Berlin, Germany. That may be expected of escapist films tilted at the box office, but also applied to two art-house productions with Hollywood involvement: Jennifer Lawrence-starring Die, My Love and Kristen Stewart’s directorial debut The Chronology of Water are set in Montana, California, Texas and Oregon – and filmed in Canada, Latvia and Malta.These are clearly the kind of “movies made in foreign lands” that Trump wants to see the back of. Yet over the course of the festival the consensus gradually shifted to the assumption that tariffs won’t be the way it’s done, because it would be unworkable. As Anderson asked sarcastically when questioned about the presidential film tariffs: “Can you hold up the movie in customs?”“Most people think it will just lead to the US copying the British model,” said Andreas Pense, a German lawyer who advises international film projects. The UK has by far been the most successful country in Europe at attracting American films, paying out £553m in tax relief to film companies in 2022-23. “But the US would have to cough up an insane amount of money, and getting that approved won’t be easy,” Pense added. “American productions are just more expensive.”View image in fullscreenJennifer Lawrence in Lynne Ramsay’s Die, My Love.Photograph: OkashaSome European countries with a presence at Cannes sounded surprisingly optimistic about standing their ground in a tax-incentive arms race with the US. Hungary, for example, does not just offer 30% in rebates to foreign producers making films in the central European state, but can also provide crews that are experienced and cheaper than those in the US, because unions pull much less weight in its cinematic sector than in the US. American productions being filmed outside Budapest this year include cold war spy drama Ponies, featuring Emilia Clarke and Haley Lu Richardson, and alien invasion comedy Alpha Gang, starring Cate Blanchett and Channing Tatum. Its trump card, Hungarian film professionals say, is that Budapest can impersonate anywhere in the world: Paris, Buenos Aires, Moscow, even London and New York. If you are making an anywhere film, what’s to stop you?Perhaps the US president should take a leaf out of the rulebook of Dogme 95, the notorious Danish avant garde film-making movement. In Cannes, a group of Nordic five film-makers launched a reboot of the self-restricting school of cinema that brought forth Lars von Trier and Thomas Vinterberg. They retained only one rule from the original 1995 manifesto: “The film must be shot where the narrative takes place.”A post on Truth Social, an executive order that binds all American directors to making American films set in America, and Hollywood’s problems would be solved in one stroke. Next up: work out whether anyone would still want to watch those films.Explore more on these topicsCannes film festivalFestivalsDonald TrumpfeaturesShareReuse this content"

During production, the screenwriters of Jurassic Park (David Koepp) and Chinatown (Robert Towne) sent in duelling script pages for director Brian De Palma and producer Tom Cruise to wrestle over. The magnificent outcome is an intense tango between the modern blockbuster and a classic film noir, circling each other warily, and beautifully, like noMission: Impossiblethat would follow. De Palma’s original is a sexy wrong-man thriller, a Hitchcockian affair that comes disguised as an action-heavy corporate product (or maybe the mask is worn the other way around?). In it, Cruise’s coiled IMF agent, framed for the murder of his entire team and surrounded by slippery allies, is constantly trying to play it cool through the plot’s knotty parlor games, all while feeling the noose tightening around him. If Cruise’s career up to this point was all about often leaving his relaxed boyish middle-American charm on the surface, Mission: Impossible pushed him to try on layers – not just the latex ones – while also pulling off those incredible high-wire stunts, which would only escalate but never improve on the hair-raising tension the first time out.Radheyan SimonpillaiMission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning review – world-saving Tom Cruise signs off with wildly entertaining adventureRead moreMission: Impossible 2By film two, Ethan Hunt is still sort of a blank-slate action man – but John Woo’s take on M:I stands out simply by having the highest iconic-moment-per-minute ratio in the entire series. Cruise first appears on the screen free-soloing a mountain and takes delivery of his mission in the form of a set of rocket-delivered exploding sunglasses: then it’s straight into the motorbike duels, rubber masks and capoeira kicks, with barely a pause for breath. There is a scene in this film whereTom Cruiseflawlessly impersonates a man who is three inches taller than him. There is a stunt where Dougray Scott was encouraged,by Cruise, to put his entire weight on a knife mere millimetres above the megastar’s eyeball, just for a cool closeup. The soundtrack is by Hans Zimmer andLimp Bizkit. It might be silly, and Thandiwe Newton described the shoot as “a nightmare”, but no other Impossible is as rewatchable, let alone as fun.Joel SnapeMission: Impossible IIIIt’s almost impossible to overstate the importance of Mission: Impossible III. For the franchise it was key (the previous John Woo-directed installment remains a baffling mess), but for Cruise himself it was absolutely vital. The film was released right at his nadir. One year earlier, he had gone off the rails in public – leaping on Oprah’s couch, lambasting interviewers for being glib for asking questions about Scientology – and he was three months away from being temporarily sacked from Paramount by its boss, Sumner Redstone. But if Mission: Impossible III delivered, he’d still have a career left to salvage. Luckily it did. Later outings might have outdone it in terms of scale and spectacle, but M:I III was responsible for laying the table for those films. This was the first film where Ethan Hunt was an actual person, not just a smirking mannequin. It was also where we first met Benji, Simon Pegg’s superlative sidekick. The stunts had a pleasingly smashmouth quality (check out the way that Cruise is awkwardly flung against a car during an explosion). What’s more, in Philip Seymour Hoffman, we had the most intense villain of the franchise. Mission: Impossible III is a great film, but the most perfect thing about it is that it arrived just when Tom Cruise needed it most.Stuart HeritageMission: Impossible – Ghost ProtocolThere isn’t really a bad Mission: Impossible sequel, a compliment one would be hard pressed paying to the majority of eight-film-strong franchises (the second, which many would pick, still possesses an aggressively, Limp Bizkit-y year 2000 charm for me). But the one that most effectively packages all of the expected elements is the fourth instalment, Ghost Protocol, which set the perfect blueprint for the latter chapters. Brad Bird might not have been the most stylish of Mission directors (De Palma he is not) but, with a background in animation, there’s both a buoyancy and a clarity to the unrelenting action, delivering some of the most thrillingly staged and paced action sequences in the series (has there been anything more exciting than Cruise climbing the Burj Khalifa?). There’s also something hilariously demented about Cruise responding to quibbles over his age or longevity in the role by offering us two potential replacements in Josh Holloway and Jeremy Renner and then killing one and emasculating the other. King behaviour, honestly.Benjamin LeeMission: Impossible – Rogue NationNearly 10 years after the release of Rogue Nation, it might look less like a highlight than a series turning point, when it switched from accidental director anthology to a long-term collaboration between writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and Tom Cruise. Rogue Nation was the first of four McQuarrie-directed Missions, and the practical, Cruise-endangering stunt work that became a series trademark was, by its nature, repeatedly topped by subsequent instalments. The opening, which merely has Cruise actually hanging on to the side of a real plane as it takes off, camera fixed on him to assure us that it’s not an illusion, now seems downright quaint. But as a spy caper featuring stunts (the airplane opener), break-ins (a spectacularly tricky underwater data breach during which Cruise’s Ethan Hunt literally dies), noir-ish intrigue (the gorgeous sequence at the Vienna Opera House and the shadowy climax recall both Hitchcock and The Third Man), and sheer blockbuster much-ness (the underwater break-in leads to a car chase which leads to a motorcycle chase), Rogue Nation is the series operating at top level. After many personnel shifts, it establishes a core team of Cruise, Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames and a stunning Rebecca Ferguson that will power much of the series going forward, and adds in a little extra Jeremy Renner, as a treat. The sequels are a lot of fun with plenty of indelible moments but the truth is, McQuarrie nailed it in one.Jesse HassengerMission: Impossible – FalloutSome people may cherish Mission: Impossible – Fallout for the glimpse it offers of Ethan’s longing for ex-wife Julia (Michelle Monaghan). But for most of us, the film’s appeal lies in the way it builds its terrifying vertical action sequences from a series of electric ups and downs in Paris and London to take the world to the brink of destruction as Ethan thrashes about in a chopper in Kashmir. Writer-director Christopher McQuarrie provides the kind of plot twists that would satisfy a silent serial without losing focus on Ethan’s route through the moral murk. The European road chases, stunts and perilous parkour have a dash of gritty style, even flashes of lightning, as the camera whips past landmark architecture, while a bathroom fight scene against bright white tile is amusingly inventive – plus there’s noir-chic in the low-lit scenes where expositions and betrayals unfold. But the film is best when it loses its cool, with Ethan trying to intercept the detonator to a nuclear bomb, via a monstrously improbable, breath-stoppingly tense helicopter battle in the mountains.Pamela HutchinsonMission: Impossible – Dead ReckoningThe penultimate Mission: Impossible is the best franchise instalment because it has the best stunt. But, as its Oscar nominations suggest (visual effects and sound design – the only two ever earned by the series), it is a stunt fuelled not just by Tom Cruise’s kamikaze bravado but by good ol’ VFX and some incredible metal groaning on the soundtrack. It’s the film’s climax. We’re on a gorgeous, posh, blue-and-gold runaway steam train. There’s the obligatory knife fight on the roof and a precisely timed leap to liberty by the baddie, but that’s just the start. A viaduct ahead is blown up, and – just in time – Cruise and Hayley Atwell manage to disengage the engine, which crashes spectacularly into a ravine, per Back to the Future III. They did actually crash a steam train for this, in Derbyshire, where itcaused a bit of a stir. But then –then!– our hero and heroine must leap through the next few carriages as they, too, grindingly slide off the edge of the track and hang for a few moments before the couplers fail and the valley awaits. There’s the kitchen car (soup, peppers, gas hob), the dining carriage (crockery, flames, chairs) and, most perilous of all, the cocktail bar (grand piano). It’s like The Poseidon Adventure in super-speed miniature, a Buster Keaton upside-down nightmare and the most fabulous thing ever.Catherine ShoardExplore more on these topicsMission: ImpossibleTom CruiseMission: Impossible - Rogue NationMission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part OneAction and adventure filmsThrillersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This is a story about the randomness of life in the big city, a melodramatic convulsion of grief, rage and pain which has a TV soap feel to its succession of escalating crises. Like Leila’s Brothers, it is about the entitlement of Iran’s menfolk, and how a man – however shiftless, casual and low-status – can somehow pull rank on a woman in the marriage market.Payman Maadi (from Asghar Farhadi’s A Separation) plays Hamid, an ambulance driver in his late 40s with a certain roguish ladies-man charm whose unmarried status raises eyebrows among some of his acquaintances, but who is now engaged to Mahnaz (Parinaz Izadyar). She is a smart, hardworking hospital nurse who is widowed and lives with her sister Mehri (Soha Niasti) and mum (Fereshteh Sadre Orafaee), and her two kids. Teen son Aliyar (Sinan Mohebi) is always in trouble at school and has a breezy way of sweet-talking his mother into forgiving him and younger sister Neda (Arshida Dorostkar).Hamid is not exactly a catch, but behaves implicitly as if Mahnaz’s two children mean that he is the one being a saint. He insists that the children are absent from the house when his parents come round, and that all their things are hidden away as Mahnaz’s future parents-in-law don’t know about them and might stop the marriage. Mahnaz, against her better judgment, parks the children with the grumpy father of her late husband. The meeting with Hamid’s parents goes ahead and terrible events are set in train including one which is, perhaps bafflingly, never shown on camera and its perpetrator never shown explaining it or discussing it – though an enigma is possibly the point.Maadi’s performance coolly conveys how slippery an individual Hamid is: accustomed to being adored for his supposedly endearing way with a gallant remark, but shrill and self-pitying when challenged on anything. He is running a shabby, corrupt little scam: allowing people to sleep in the ambulances when they are not being used, for an exploitative cash payment. And there are signs that Hamid has a roving eye and he is still (instinctively) hitting on other women.From this tense situation (in which the game is patriarchally rigged against Mahnaz in ways that she couldn’t dream of) a catastrophe occurs – in fact a double catastrophe – which sends Mahnaz into a rage-filled confrontation with every single man in her life, including the choleric schoolteacher Mr Samkhanian (Maziar Seyyedi) who expelled Aliyar against his colleague’s advice. The tragic and startling events emerge in a movie whose storytelling style is otherwise very low-key, and which gives an almost bizarre and unexpected quality to all the heartbreaking emotional pain; this is the unexpectedness of real life, perhaps.Izadyar’s full-throttle performance shows how anguish has made her a kind of ghost, haunting a world that she had hoped to occupy as a modestly contended human being. It is a little overwrought, though carried by the forthright performances.Woman and Child screened at theCannes film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsIranWorld cinemaCannes film festivalMiddle East and north AfricaFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

With icy provocation, Israel’s ruling classes are presented as decadent and indifferent to the slaughter and suffering of Gaza. But the film is also in some ways a sympathetic study of a people haunted by the antisemitic butchery of7 October.It is inspired by the activist group Civic Front, which after 7 October released a new version of Haim Gouri’s classic song Hareut, or Fellowship, with jarring new lyrics calling for wholesale extermination in Gaza. A fictional version of this song features here, with lyrics about attacking the bearers of the swastika (as in the original) but also presents its audience with slick equivalence: the “Nazi” gotcha-comparison is levelled atIsraelin a way that it isn’t at other countries. There is an odious Russian fintech bro here, commissioning jingoistic, nationalistic music; the suggested equivalence between Putin and Israel is presented without subtlety, although subtlety is maybe beside the point. One fourth-wall breaking scene has one man list the people who are supposedly anti-Israel: the BBC, CNN, the New York Times – and then turn furiously and directly to the camera: “… and you too are anti-Israel!”Y (Ariel Bronz) is a musician and composer married to Yasmin (Efrat Dor) whose family’s money and connections promise a comfortable future for them both and their year-old baby in Tel Aviv. They are enjoying an almost frantic high life of partying, booze and drugs, amid people who want to affirm their reality, to show the world and each other that they are not to be cowed by terrorism and by those who want what they wanted before 7 October – an end to the state of Israel.But Y is traumatised by the recent death of his mother and the reality of the family’s cramped conditions in a tiny flat. He composes a new, aggressively anti-Gaza song, apparently with the patronage of a wealthy Russian (played by Aleksei Serebyakov) and, brought to the edge of some profound emotional breakdown by the strain of processing the agony of 7 October and – perhaps – by the suspicion that the response is futile vengeance, Y abandons his family and heads off to reconnect with his old lover Leah (Naama Preis). Leah, a translator with access to restricted official documents, can give him the authentic details about the 7 October atrocity – details that Y simultaneously fears and demands. And he is seized with a desire to scream his poem, cruelly or cathartically, from Golani Hill, otherwise known as the Hill of Love, which overlooksGazaCity itself.As before with Lapid, there are brilliant, showy set-pieces: the opening party scene is a marvel of extremity and nightmarish jaded sensuality. The point is evidently to suggest their heartlessness and solipsism – although this approach is not as powerful as the more plausibly real scenes showing Y with Leah. As one character says: “You are devastated by what it is to live in Gaza, but you don’t know what it is to be Israeli.” It is a paradox within which this film lives.Yes screened at theCannes film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmCannes film festivalIsraelIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestinian territoriesDrama filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Here’s hoping for a second seasonLucy ManganThu 22 May 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 22 May 2025 05.58 EDTShareAre you ready for some fun? Don’t you deserve it? I think we all do – life’s awful – so I gladly present to you Sirens, which isThe White Lotusmeets all the good series that Nicole Kidman has been in, with just a dash ofRyan Murphy-esque campto make it all go with an especially zingy swing! Welcome!It is a tale of two sisters and a superrich villain whose cult-like lifestyle threatens to come between them. Older sister Devon (Meghann Fahy – yes, ofWhite Lotusfame, taking a much meatier part this time and running with it) is a semi-functioning alcoholic who is caring for their increasingly difficult father while working a minimum wage job at the local falafel joint and banging her married boss on the side. When she sends little sister Simone (House of the Dragon’s Milly Alcock and astonishing child actor inTim Minchin’s heartbreaking comedy Upright) a plea for help when their father is diagnosed with dementia, Simone responds by sending an edible arrangement (or fancy fruit basket, if you’re British). Devon duly sets off on the long journey to her sister’s new place of employ with the clear aim of ramming said fruit arrangement up her arse and asking questions later.What she finds when she gets there, however, requires all fruit/arse-ramming plans to be put on hold and older-sister instincts to take over. Simone is the live-in PA to socialite and raptor conservationist Michaela Kell, played byJulianne Mooreat her best and most unsettling. Michaela – or Kiki, as Simone is delighted to be allowed to call her – is married to hedge fund billionaire Peter (Kevin Bacon) and has a tribe of acolytes; Devon immediately pegs her as a cult leader who has Simone in thrall. She starts a campaign to save her sister from Michaela, from her boyfriend (Peter’s flaky best friend Ethan, played by Glenn Howerton), from the lure of the lifestyle she is enjoying, and the even more gilded one she serves, and from forgetting who she is and where she came from.All this while Devon must also deal with unwanted visits from her boss and dad, the staff that hate Simone for her high-handed ways, a local police force that is in Michaela’s pocket (which allows for a sterling repeated comic turn from Only Murders in the Building’s Catherine Cohen as Devon’s companion in the drunk tank), and maintain a new, fragile sobriety.A plot unfurls that is wholly addictive, endlessly entertaining and utterly preposterous. But it is kept from spinning out of control (and from becoming mindless froth) by the sisters’ gradually revealed history and the deepening dynamics in their relationship, and their relationships with other characters, including Michaela and Peter. Until by about midway, you realise you may have been wrongfooted all along.View image in fullscreenGlenn Howerton as Ethan, Milly Alcock as Simone and Meghann Fahy as Devon in Sirens.Photograph: Courtesy of NetflixWithout ever losing its wit or bounce, Sirens becomes a study in family, class and all sorts of other power struggles, the endless possibilities for good and ill that wealth brings, and the legacies of childhood trauma. It’s also pretty good on the price of sacrifice and how close you should stand to large windows when there are recently released falcons flying about, and to cliff edges when you are a male character in a miniseries named after a group of mythological women said to lure sailors to their doom. Though the name, too, is at least partly a misdirection.By the end of its narratively and emotionally tight-packed five episodes – no streamer’s bloat here – Sirens has gained undoubted heft. You can see how and why it attracted actors of such high calibre. Adapted for the screen by Molly Smith Metzler from her own play Elemeno Pea, with Colin McKenna and Bekah Brunstetter, it fits the new form perfectly, but still has enough theatricality to allow most of the leads at least a minor monologue in which to flex their muscles and fly.It is a rare bird in one more way, too. Its finale manages to satisfy what I suspect will rapidly become a very loyal audience, while leaving open the possibility of a second series – which, for the first time in a long time, I find myself hoping will be forthcoming. Let the good times roll.Sirens is on Netflix now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionJulianne MooreKevin BaconreviewsShareReuse this content"

It sounds not unlike the once futuristic ident of a long-defunct TV channel. The first words you hear Lætita Sadier and backing vocalist Marie Merlet sing – their voices winding around each other in a sweet-but-sad melody, over the tight, mid-tempo rhythm of Aerial Troubles – are “the numbing is not working any more / An unfillable hole, an insatiable state of consumption (systemic) / assigned trajectory (extortion).”View image in fullscreenStereolab: Instant Holograms on Metal Film.To which, of course, the seasoned Stereolab fan might break into a contented smile of recognition and sigh “mais naturellement”. A retro-futurist aesthetic; tight, hypnotic grooves derived from the motorikkrautrock of Neu!; vintage synthesiser tones and vocals that entwine around each other; lyrics that take a dim Marxist/situationist-influenced view of modern life: this is very much what Stereolab spent the 90s and early 00s dealing in, during a career in which they occupied their own space slightly apart from everything else.They were a product of the low-rent London indie scene documented in former drummer Joe Dilworth’s 2024 book Everything, All at Once Forever, but sounded nothing like any of its other participants. The closest they came to mainstream success – a couple of Top 20 albums, a lot of radio play for their 1994 single Ping Pong – was during the Britpop era, but they clearly had almost nothing in common with Britpop. Aspects of their sound or aesthetic chimed variously with post-rock, the easy listening revival, leftfield electronica, and the curious 90s midlands underground scene that begat Pram, Broadcast and Plone, but Stereolab never quite fitted with any of them.No one familiar with their back catalogue is going to play Instant Holograms on Metal Film and wonder aloud at who it’s by. It’s all very Stereolab, from the song titles – Colour Television, Electrified Teenybop! and Vermona F Transistor – to its sound, which is impressively eclectic without really shifting outside the admittedly wide-ranging palette of styles they deployed in their initial incarnation. Immortal Hands shifts from jazzy sunshine pop to drum-machine-driven funk; a hint of drum’n’bass lurks around the agitated rhythm of Transmuted Matter; the bouncy keyboard riff of Esemplastic Creeping Eruption seems to have been transplanted into the song from a lost 70s kids’ show.Stereolab: Melodie Is a Wound – videoPerhaps more importantly, anyone familiar with their back catalogue should be delighted to learn that Instant Holograms on Metal Film offers a very strong example of Stereolab doing what they do. The criticism that frequently dogged them was that there was something arid and dispassionate about their collaging of recherche musical influences and political theory: it was terribly clever rather than heartfelt. But for all Sadier’s cool detachment, there’s a warmth and brightness to the sound and the yé-yé and easy listening-derived melodies. The instrumental Electrified Teenybop! feels gleeful enough to deserve its exclamation mark; the flute-adorned Flashes from Everywhere is a breezy joy. It never sounds like people conducting an experiment so much as a reconvened band genuinely enjoying working together. Amid the album’s references to the death of modernity and Deleuze and Guttari’s Anti-Oedipus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia, you could read the lyrics of Esemplastic Creeping Eruption, with their talk of “reconciliations”, leaving “the realm of oppositions” and the “bountiful tap” of creativity as being about nothing more complicated than reforming the band.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

Perhaps that’s because they were always at one remove from everything else – it doesn’t evoke a specific past era – or perhaps because Stereolab have exerted at least some influence over pop since their initial split, hailed as an inspiration by everyone from Deerhoof to Tyler, the Creator, the latter claiming “they shaped my sound”. (There also exists a video online in which Pharrell Williams describes why their 1997 track The Flower Called Nowhere is the best music to be fellated to in dispiriting detail, but the less said about that the better.)Or perhaps it’s because Sadier’s lyrics feel less marginal or left-field than they once did. You really didn’t get a lot of Marxist-influenced critiques of late-stage capitalism during Britpop: today, the notion that an addiction to growth might pose an existential threat to humanity has been mainstreamed. Likewise the rise of social media has made rather a lot of situationism’s ideas about spectacle seem more pertinent than ever. “The goal is to manipulate / Heavy hands to intimidate / Snuff out the very idea of clarity / Strangle your longing for truth and trust,” sings Sadier on Melodie Is a Wound. On the one hand, that’s very much Stereolab being Stereolab. On the other: she can say that again.This week Alexis listened toParade – Picking FlowersEerily atmospheric, occasionally discordant, ultimately rather beautiful, touching on post-rock, jazz and acoustic singer-songwriter modes along the way: a strange, and fascinating debut by the London band.Explore more on these topicsMusicAlexis Petridis's album of the weekIndiePop and rockElectronic musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

With their world upended and nowhere to live, the couple decided there was only one course of action: to walk.Their plan was to follow the South West Coast Path, a hiking trail taking them from Minehead in Somerset, along the northern coasts of Devon and Cornwall, around Land’s End and Lizard Point, then back along Cornwall’s south coast, south Devon and ending in Poole in Dorset. The 630-mile walk, taking in secluded beaches and coves, wild moorland and quiet hamlets and coastal towns, is equivalent to climbing Mount Everest four times over. Armed with the essentials – clothes, a tent, sleeping bags, endless packets of dried noodles – they would be “sleeping wild, living wild, working our way through every painful action that had brought us here, to this moment”.Their journey is documented in Raynor’s award-winning The Salt Path, her lyrical memoir from 2018 that sold more than 2m copies in English, and a film adaptation of which arrives in cinemas this month featuring Gillian Anderson and Jason Isaacs. The audiobook is narrated by Raynor, whose quietly despairing tone in the early chapters gradually evolves into cautious optimism. While they endure hardship and self-doubt during their journey, there are moments of levity too. Taking in the wild splendour of their surroundings, the pair get a fresh perspective on all life has thrown at them and resolve to live in the present.Available via Penguin Audio, 9hr 1minFurther listeningGreen DotMadeleine Gray, Weidenfeld and Nicholson, 8hr 42minSacha Simon reads this Fleabag-esque novel about a young woman embarking on an unwise affair with a married colleague.Broken LightJoanne Harris, Orion, 12hr 47minThe Chocolat author’s tale of a menopausal woman who rediscovers dormant powers is read by Imogen Stubbs.Explore more on these topicsAudiobooksAudiobook of the weekAutobiography and memoirTravel writingFictionreviewsShareReuse this content"

That was the process that led to the final versions of works such as Mémoriale, Anthèmes and …explosante-fixe…, and to the pair of substantial pieces that are played with fabulous precision and incisiveness on this disc.View image in fullscreenBoulez: Éclat/Multiples.Éclat/Multiples, completed in 1981, began life in 1965 as Éclat, a kit-like eight-minute exploration of the sound world Boulez had first created for the central movements of his masterpiece Pli selon Pli, and which he then expanded to a work for 25 instruments. For Sur Incises, which grew by stages through the mid 1990s, the starting point was a solo-piano piece, Incises, while the final work uses trios of pianos, harps and percussionists to create a seductive world of mysterious trills and decaying resonances and sudden outbursts of frantic activity. It’s clear from the sketches for Éclat/Multiples that Boulez intended to extend it beyond the 28-minute version that is played today, and this disc includes an extra four minutes of music never recorded before; there may be yet more to come in the future, but in the meantime these are fine accounts of two of Boulez’s most significant works.One track available onBandcampExplore more on these topicsClassical musicalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

Over the following year or so,Yunchan Lim’srecitals in Europe and afirst disc for Decca (of the Chopin Études), together with recordings that documented his performances in the competition, of Liszt’s Transcendental Études in his semi-final recital, andRachmaninov’sThird Concerto in the final, confirmed that the reports had been no exaggeration: he is the real thing, a once-in-a-generation talent. Now Decca has reissued the Fort Worth concerto performance, but with the sound significantly cleaned up and rebalanced, and the wonder of Lim’s playing if anything enhanced. What is immediately striking is the sheer confidence and poise of everything he does, and the overriding sense that there is never any doubt about the direction in which this majestic concerto should be taken; it’s hard to believe that this is the performance of an 18-year-old.View image in fullscreenYunchan Lim: Rachmaninov Piano Concerto No 3.Needless to say, every technical challenge in the keyboard writing seems to be effortlessly negotiated, yet the brilliance is never an end in itself; it is always part of a bigger picture, without ever diminishing the thrill of such astonishing command, so that the way the unadorned melodic lines of the slow movement are phrased becomes just as telling as the way in which the densest flurries of notes are negotiated. Just perhaps in the finale, when Lim can seem too headstrong for his own good, does his performance betray his age; otherwise it deserves a place alongside the finest versions of this concerto on disc, from those by Rachmaninov himself and Vladimir Horowitz to Martha Argerich and Vladimir Ashkenazy. Despite Decca’s remastering, though, the sound is by no means perfect; some orchestral detail remains too distant, and the string sound is sometimes scrawny and undernourished. Normally such shortcomings might preclude a five-star recommendation, but Lim’s playing is so astonishing it’s almost irrelevant.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

She describes this as the “deep sense of wrongness” that can infiltrate our lives when we realise we are complicit in something seriously bad.The first time I experienced this in relation to climate change, I was changing my baby’s nappy soon after one of the worst Australian wildfire seasons on record in 2020. The nappy featured a smiling cartoon koala on the front. I immediately recalled the scene of a singed, parched koala being fed water from a plastic bottle by a human as it fled the inferno. A disposable nappy takes up to 500 years to decompose. I felt disgust and despair at the degree of consumption, waste and exploitation that even a modest lifestyle in a high-income country seems to entail.From smartphones to food, our daily lives leave a bitter trail of harm. Some become painfully preoccupied with these realisations; others, avoidant and numb – an even more psychologically injurious strategy. I oscillate somewhere between these two positions, which is to say, I am in dire need of some moral first aid. In No Straight Road Takes You There,a constellation of essays with interlinked themes, Solnit provides just that.From a meditation on an antique violin as a symbol of sustainability, to reminding us that radical ideas move from the fringes to the mainstream, this collection of her best work teems with vitality, forming an antidote to political paralysis and despondency. Solnit is a prolific, omnivorous and brilliant writer and this book makes apparent her intellectual wingspan. There is great variety here – one chapter is even titled “In Praise of the Meander” – but two bright threads run through the whole: the importance of hope, and the power of storytelling.Hope is no casual platitude here. Nor is it merely a more pleasant state of mind than despair. Rather, Solnit sees it as a more accurate mindset, since nobody is an oracle, and history is full of surprises. Uncertainty is the most rational position to embrace, and unlike optimism or pessimism, it does not entrench us in complacency or inaction. Climate doomers are particularly pernicious, Solnit observes, propagating misery and incorrect narratives about how screwed we all are, “like bringing poison to the potluck”. Above all they are guilty of failing to use their imagination.At heart, Solnit is a storyteller. “Every crisis,” she writes, “is in part a storytelling crisis.” The powerful are those who decide which stories are heard and which are silenced. People who tell stories well – like Donald Trump – captivate millions. Citing the non-violent resistance that led to the fall of eastern bloc regimes in the 1970s and 1980s, Solnit sees radical ideas as acorns, campaigns as saplings and the final results – changes in the law, policy, or land ownership – as mighty oaks. “The most important territory to take is in the imagination. Once you create a new idea of what is possible and acceptable, the seeds are planted; once it becomes what the majority believes, you’ve created the conditions in which winning happens.”Solnit urges us to imagine a radically different future. She quotes Mary Wollstonecraft’s hope in 1792 that the divine right of husbands might be as contested as the divine right of kings, and footnotes this with Ursula Le Guin’s hope in 2014 that the seemingly inescapable stranglehold of capitalism will one day yield, just as did the divine right of kings. Solnit herself is strikingly unafraid to wish for more. One of her specific visions is for a world in which people do not rape, not because they fear punishment, but because the very desire to commit rape has withered away.The book’s signoff, a “credo”,has something of the sermon to it. In a world where tyranny is on the ascent and shareholder profits are worshipped like the golden calf, this is a comfort. Solnit is like a seasoned boxing coach tending to the spiritually and politically exhausted citizen flopped in the corner. She mops our brows and offers us motivation. “They want you to feel powerless and to surrender,” she writes. “You are not giving up, and neither am I … The pain you feel is because of what you love.” Grieve, yes. Scream with fury, sure. But also, keep going. “There is no alternative to persevering, and that does not require you to feel good. You can keep on walking whether it’s sunny or raining.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

And those facts, raw and precise, are shattering: Vincent died in 2017, aged 16. James died in 2024, aged 19. Vincent, we learn, loved baking and knitting, and did not live long enough to graduate high school. James, a brilliant linguist studying at Princeton, where Li teaches creative writing, took his last Japanese class on a Friday. “Facts, with their logic, meaning, and weight, are what I hold on to,” she writes. Things in Nature Merely Grow is by necessity profoundly sad, but in the act of sharing details of the “abyss” she now inhabits, Li has created something both inclusive and humane.Language, of course, is vital to this project. Having emigrated from China to the US in 1996 to study immunology at the University of Iowa, Li moved to the creative writing programme and was taught by Marilynne Robinson, among others. After that, her literary ascent was rapid. She received accolades for her nonfiction and novels, includingThe Vagrants,set in post-Mao China, and her short story collectionWednesday’s Child. Choosing to write and publish in English was a “crucial decision”, she wrote. She banished Chinese with determination and now thinks and writes only in English. For Li, linguistic choices are always significant: “Where else can my mind live but in words?”Society prefers grieving mothers to act a certain wayIn the aftermath of Vincent’s death, Li publishedWhere Reasons End,a novel that takes the form of an intense, sparring conversation between a mother and son after his death. She wrote it to feel her way to “unanswerable questions”, having found little to console her in the existing literature of grief. But writing to – or for – James is a different matter. “It will have to be done through thinking,” she concludes, and even then, it will be “an approximation of understanding”.James, with his gentle smile and understated sense of humour, is depicted as a brilliant, autistic, self-contained, somewhat unreachable person who “thought hard: deeply, philosophically, and privately”. Months before his death, he reread Albert Camus’ play Caligula “a bit obsessively”, and watched English, Spanish and Japanese productions of it online. Now, with hindsight, Li homes in on a particular line: “Men die; and they are not happy.” She repeats this phrase, considering it a possible key to James’s thoughts.Li understands that nobody can know the precise reasons a person chooses suicide but, still, she circles back towards the same thoughts: did James “back himself into a corner” through his readings of Camus’ The Myth of Sisyphus and Caligula? Was the decision he made connected to Vincent’s death? Trying to comprehend, Li experiments with painful variants of the refrain: “Children die, and they are not happy”; “Children die, and parents go on living”.This cannot be a conventional memoir, but Li takes us back to her childhood, and to her own mother who plays cruel, psychologically damaging tricks on her. Glimpses of the abuse she endured explain why being “orphaned” from her native language and from China were, in fact, vital acts of self-preservation. The story shifts briefly to Li’s own period of suicidal depression, depicted in her 2017 memoir,Dear Friend, from My Life I Write to You in Your Life, and the correlations and questions remain unanswerable.What Li tells us is so terribly, “epically” sad that it can only be conveyed through a restrained and astringent English. The effect does not distance the reader, though; instead, there is an almost unbearable intimacy. Alongside references to Euclidean geometry and Shakespeare’s King John are domestic details that remind us that Vincent and James were boys, in a loving family, on the way to becoming young men: Pokémon, socks, pancakes, phone passwords, the family dog Quintus (the fifth one). These fragments of life before, imbued with everyday love, are achingly poignant.Society prefers grieving mothers to act a certain way. Literature, too. “Those mothers in the Greek and Shakespearean tragedies voiced their sorrows at a higher pitch than mine,” Li writes. She is aware that her instinct to use intellect to navigate grief can arouse suspicion, hostility even. Towards the end of the book, Li addresses the treatment she receives from the Chinese media, whose message is, terrifyingly, that “a traitor deserves to be punished”. She insists that she is not angry, but anger is evident nonetheless. Not at her sons: for them there is love and respect. But towards her mother and China, both epitomising cruelty and shunning. And there is rightful indignation at hurtful and insensitive things people say to the grieving; this book should be read not least to gain an understanding of how to speak to a bereaved person. Instances of thoughtlessness are offset, thankfully, by stories of immense kindness from lifelong friends, such as editor Brigid Hughes, and the writer Elizabeth McCracken.Grieving is not a useful word for Li because it implies an end point, a release from the loss. There is no redemptive moment of healing here; things in nature merely grow, they are not automatically resolved, wounds are not neatly sutured. But growing is life and Li is, and always will be, a mother. Her book is a meditation on living and radical acceptance that has the potential to offer deep solace; comfort from the abyss.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Lili is a co-production between the New York-based game studio iNK Stories (creator of1979 Revolution: Black Friday, about a photojournalist in Iran) and the Royal Shakespeare Company, and it’s been turning heads with its eye-catching translocation of Macbeth to modern-day Iran.“It’s been such an incredible coup to have it as the first video game experience at Cannes,” says iNK Stories co-founder Vassiliki Khonsari. “People have gone in saying, I’m not familiar playing games, so I may just try it out for five minutes. […] But then once they’re in, there is this growing sense of empowerment that people from the film world are feeling.”The Cannes festival’s Immersive Competition began in 2024, although the lineup doesn’t usually feature traditional video games.“VR films and projection mapping is the thrust of it,” says iNK Stories’ other co-founder, Vassiliki’s husband Navid Khonsari. But Lili weaves live-action footage with video game mechanics in a similar way to a game such asTelling LiesorImmortality. Its lead, Zar Amir Ebrahimi, won best actress at Cannes three years ago.Lili focuses on the story of LadyMacbeth, here cast as the ambitious wife of an upwardly mobile officer in the Basij (a paramilitary volunteer militia within the Islamic Revolutionary Guard in Iran). As in the play, she plots a murder to secure her husband’s rise. “I think that the narrative of Lady Macbeth is that she’s manipulative, and that’s exactly what got us interested,” says Navid.“The social limitations based on her gender forced her to try to attain whatever leadership role she can,” he continues. “If she was a man, she would have been one of the greatest kings that country would have ever experienced, but because she was a woman she had to work within the structure that was there for her. And I think this is the same thing that we have with our Lili character: because of society, she’s limited to how high she can rise.”The player is cast as a member of the Hecate Web, a group of hackers who stand in for Macbeth’s witches, and you begin by accessing Lili’s phone and computer, watching her on CCTV cameras inside her home. The oppression of surveillance and censorship is a key theme. At one point Lili tries to access a YouTube makeup tutorial, only to be blocked by the state’s firewall. The fact that the player takes on an uncomfortable voyeuristic role is intentional. “We’re all part of the problem when it comes to surveillance, when it comes to looking at each other, spying on each other,” says Navid.View image in fullscreen‘She’s suffocating in the various layers of masks that she must put on’ … Zar Amir Ebrahimi in Lili.Photograph: Ellie SmithYou can bypass it to give her access, however, prompting a memorable scene in which she wraps her head in clingfilm before applying eyeliner and lipstick. “That is her ritual, applying makeup in a world that she cannot do that [in], without her husband knowing or anyone else knowing,” says Vassiliki. “We love it as this sort of allegory, that she’s suffocating in the world and in the various layers of masks that she must put on herself … our Lady Macbeth, our Lili, has an awakening, and all of those tools that we’ve used to hack her become tools that we actually give her to help her take the system down from within.”Lili is scheduled for release in late 2026, and the RSC’s Sarah Ellis says that it might well be turned into a play at some point in the future. Navid says there are already plans for a film version, using some of the same footage shot for the game – a reminder that the boundaries between the worlds of gaming, movies and theatre are increasingly porous. This is unlikely to be the last time the RSC is involved in games.“I was always interested in games, and the convergence of games and theatre in particular,” says Ellis, who originally approached iNK with the idea for this collaboration. “We’ve worked with some of the best Shakespeare scholars … Professor Emma Smith from Oxford has been an absolute keystone in the dramaturgy of this work,” says Ellis. Smith has said that if Shakespeare were alive today, he’d be writing for games, and Ellis agrees: “He was an innovator.”Explore more on these topicsGamesCannes film festivalFestivalsIranMacbethfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But the present moment – of dangerously disputed truths and lies – is an especially pertinent moment to revisit Miller’s analogy between accusations of witchcraft and McCarthyist terror.This production is faithful to the original 17th-century setting, amid the heat and panic of the Salem witch trials. There is period dress: bonnets for women, pointed hats for men and ribbons for the judges, along with a range of broad British accents for these original American pilgrims. But director Ola Ince brings a quietly radical touch in the form of humour – more absurdist than comic, with accusations of flying girls and demon possession taking on preposterous tones. The men, mostly the judges of the last two acts, appear bumbling, like yokels arguing over the fate of their chattel at a country fair. Deputy Governor Danforth (Gareth Snook) is particularly clownish, though no less awful for it.A few songs by composer Renell Shaw give the town’s girls and women a greater voice in an otherwise dutiful revival which flies in the first half but slows to a trudge by the third act. Maybe because of the laughter, there is also less creepiness to the band of girls who accuse the adults of satanism, and less terror to the court scenes, too. You see the panicked calculation in Tituba (Sarah Merrifield)’s original, forced “confession” but you do not feel her visceral fear. The note of absurdism makes it less terrifying, more ridiculous.View image in fullscreenHeat and panic … Gavin Drea as John Proctor in The Crucible.Photograph: Marc BrennerAbuse, witch-hunts and hangings: why Arthur Miller’s masterpiece The Crucible still haunts usRead moreStill, there is some fine acting from Gavin Drea as John Proctor and Hannah Saxby as his sometime lover, Abigail Williams, who burns with the young, single-minded passion of the spurned. The showdowns in court, with the judges and those between John and Elizabeth Proctor (the a played compellingly by Phoebe Pryce), come weighted with emotion and tragedy. It is also painful to see Mary Warren (Bethany Wooding) as she tries to explain the peer pressure that made her lie in court and be disbelieved by the men around her.Amelia Jane Hankin’sset design has a Quaker bareness, pious and unadorned, with wooden bedsteads and big kitchen tables. There is an almost painterly quality to some scenes with a top window on the stage featuring a tableau of the accused: women standing as still as statues, waiting for their fate to be decided by the men in power.It is a shame the pace slows to such a degree (performed at three hours on press night). Even so, discretely powerful scenes go some way to bringing the tension back, and as the first Miller play to be staged at the Globe it is a powerfully pertinent choice.AtShakespeare’s Globe, London, from 23 May to 12 JulyExplore more on these topicsTheatreArthur MillerShakespeare's GlobereviewsShareReuse this content"

As the star plays a police therapist in new Netflix thriller Dept Q, she explains why today’s young female actors leave her in aweThu 22 May 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 22 May 2025 04.52 EDTShareOne of the good things about playing a therapist, saysKelly Macdonaldwith a laugh, is that you get to sit down a lot. There’s a fun scene in the new Netflix thriller Dept. Q in which her character, Dr Rachel Irving, weary of her client DCI Carl Morck, plants herself down behind her desk to eat her packed lunch in front of him. Morck may be the kind of troubled detective we’re used to seeing in police dramas, but Irving isn’t a typical therapist. She’s blunt, antagonistic even. It’s a “shitty” job working with police officers, she tells him. Another time she describes him as “doolally”, which in my experience is not something a typical therapist would say; Macdonald, who has had therapy, “but not regularly”, may agree.In the show – adapted from novels by the Danish author Jussi Adler-Olsen and brought to the screen by Scott Frank, who was also behind the Netflix hit The Queen’s Gambit – Morck is made to see Irving after he survives a shooting. Brilliant but sidelined, Morck is tasked with reviewing cold cases, and moved to a shabby basement office that becomes known as Department Q. The first case for his small crew of misfit detectives is the disappearance of a lawyer four years earlier, who everyone thinks is probably dead. The truth, it soon emerges, is absolutely terrifying.Did Macdonald think she’d be playing a police officer on the show – a role she has played in Line of Duty,Giri/Haji, and Black Mirror? “No. They specifically told me what it was going to be. But I think I’ve played a therapist before as well.” We’re speaking over Zoom; Macdonald is in Los Angeles where she is filming Lanterns, an HBO adaptation of the Green Lantern comics in which – is this right? – she plays a detective. “I don’t actually, I play a sheriff. Very different.” She laughs. “I wear a hat and everything.”Macdonald, now 49, has been there since January, and it’s hard being away from her two sons, 12 and 17, though they’ve been out to see her and she gets home to Glasgow whenever she can. “The guilt never gets easier,” she says. “I think that’s just a working mum thing – you never feel like you’re doing either thing as well as you should be. They understand what I’m doing and where I am, and we’ve got technology at least, so we can see each other’s faces.” She follows them on their phones, “to see where they are, like a sneak, checking up on them. I was doing that a few weeks ago and I zoomed out, and suddenly it was just the Earth, and they were there and I was here. I know this, but it really did something to my brain. Because it’s far.”Not to make assumptions about boys, but presumably they’re more impressed by her work in Lanterns, or her role in Star Wars: Skeleton Crew, than, say, Gosford Park? “We don’t really discuss it too much,” she says. “I did show one of them the prop green lantern. It doesn’t feel like I’m doing a comic thing – it’s a drama.”View image in fullscreenTV juggernaut … Macdonald alongside Vicky McClure in Line of Duty.Photograph: Steffan Hill/APOne day they will surely be impressed that their mother was a 90s icon. Macdonald’s debut was in Trainspotting, playing Diane, the sassy (underage) teenager Ewan McGregor’s Renton gets involved with. Macdonald’s parents divorced when she was a child and she grew up in Glasgow with her mother and brother. She didn’t do much drama at school but she loved films and TV – even adverts stuck in her mind, and she would act them out. Macdonald remembers one summer when she was obsessed with the western musical Calamity Jane, and would go out to see which other kids were around her estate, and try to get them to act out scenes from it. None of them knew it, she says with a smile. “Other kids weren’t so interested.”Acting, for Macdonald, “was my form of play. I was always pretending, and it was pretty private, like in my bedroom.” She was reminded of it recently because her older son is doing exams; Macdonald did fairly well at English because she would learn dialogue in her room. She wanted to be an actor but didn’t really have much of a plan (a theme, it becomes apparent, throughout her life). Then someone gave her a flyer for open auditions forwhat would become Trainspotting.View image in fullscreenTeen star … with Ewan McGregor in Trainspotting.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyShe was 18 and working in a restaurant. As she progressed through the stages towards getting the part, it was “excruciating” she remembers. “Especially when Ewan McGregor was in the room. He says he couldn’t even see what I looked like because I was holding my script covering my face.” In hindsight, she says she can see Trainspotting and its stars were part of a British boom. “At the time I didn’t feel special, I didn’t feel part of a …” She pauses. A picture of an old magazine cover came up online recently, and she clicked on it. “It was, like, Cool Britannia or something. And I was in it. That’s really funny today, it’s very nice.”Did she not go to celeb parties? Hang out with Liam Gallagher and Kate Moss? “I might have gone out with Kate Moss once,” she says, her face crinkling at the effort of dredging her memory. She didn’t really hang out with actors and wasn’t part of a “scene” – she still isn’t. She does remember going to premieres of films she wasn’t in. “I can’t imagine doing that now,” she says with a laugh. “I barely want to go to my own.” Her life in Glasgow – her home town, and that of her former husband, the Travis bassist Dougie Payne – is “pretty boring”, she says. “I’m surrounded by boys and animals. I have a very low-key life, it suits me.” She misses it when away. “I need to go and nest.”Was it a deliberate choice to create a down-to-earth life? She never did the Hollywood hustling thing, and doesn’t do social media. “I’m a pretty patient person and every now and then a great script does come along, luckily, and I get the opportunity to be a part of something.” It’s not that she isn’t ambitious. “I want to do good stuff and work with good people, I just don’t know what the thing is until it comes up, and that’s kind of the way it’s always been.”View image in fullscreenGangster squad … with Steve Buscemi in Boardwalk Empire.Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/AlamyMacdonald has done great work, and worked with great people – four years in the HBO series Boardwalk Empire, a role in No Country for Old Men, some lovely Brit films such as The Girl in the Café Nanny McPhee, and Swallows and Amazons, not to mention the TV juggernaut that was Line of Duty. With years of acclaim and experience behind her, it was fun to be in the 2017 Trainspotting sequel and not feel intimidated the way she did on the first one. “I’d seen Ewan at various points in the interim, and it was just really nice to feel like I was with a peer, rather than someone way beyond my sphere. We got to hang out and I wasn’t hiding in the toilets.”Even so, Macdonald still sometimes feels a little like she did back then. “I mean, aspects have got easier, but when they say ‘action’, it immediately feels like it always did that first time. Like you forget how to walk, really simple things.” She laughs. “I basically want to please my bosses. I want to please the director. If you get through the first day, it gets better after that.” She meets younger women, “and I just am so impressed by them”, she says. “They are unapologetic, and will correct you if you’re down on yourself about something small and piffling. But that’s just the way I was brought up, to be self-deprecating, and they’re having none of it.

Most of my working life, I’m in a room on my own learning lines, which is how I used to play.” It can feel like a slog when it’s not working for her. “But I know when it’s a good one, because I’m quite happy to be back in that room.”Dept.

She’s just getting cold feet, but I know she won’t regret itMy best friend Kady and I are planning a backpacking trip around south-east Asia in a few months and I have proposed the idea of us getting matching tattoos. Kady was initially keen, but now she is saying we should make up our minds when we are out there. I’d rather plan it in advance.We’re both 20, and I think we’ll look back on them when we’re older and remember what a fun life we’ve lived.Tattoosare a reminder of a particular time, and I want to cherish our youth.I’ve found a cool tattoo parlour in northern Thailand, where we’ll be staying. I’ve seen videos of people having great experiences there and the tattoo artist is really talented.I think Kady is worried about what other people think, including her parents. She was on board with the idea when I first proposed it a few months ago, but now she’s told them and they’ve got in her head. They told her that a tattoo will ruin her job opportunities later in life, but that’s rubbish. No one will even be able to see it at work. Tattoos aren’t as taboo as they were 20 years ago, and we both think that they look good.Tattoos are a reminder of a particular time, and I want to cherish our youthIt’s not like I want to get a random tattoo. I’m quite creative and have already started sketching ideas that represent who Kady and I are. We met at a swim club when we were five, so my design features water and other elements. It isn’t huge, it’s only about 20cm long. I already have four small tattoos on my arms and torso and love the idea of adding more.I’m not trying to force Kady to do something she doesn’t want to do, I’m just trying to encourage her to live her best life and go through with a plan that we’ve had for a while. I think matching tattoos will cement our friendship. I know she won’t regret it as we’ve been speaking about it for ages. She’s just getting cold feet because her parents know.I’m definitely more adventurous than Kady and don’t care what other people think as much as she does. I am really excited for this trip – I want to look back on this period of our lives and feel like we made the most of it.The defence: KadyWhat if I grow to hate it or want it removed? We don’t need matching tattoos to show we’re best friendsI was initially on board with the tattoo plan, but then I told my parents and they freaked out. I think it’s because no one in my family has a tattoo. They think they are “common”, which I know is classist. My dad also said that no one will employ me if I get one – which is a total overreaction in my opinion – and my mum is worried about the hygiene in the tattoo parlours in Thailand.All of that has got in my head a bit. I’m still keen, I just don’t want to commit to it right now. The trip isn’t for a while, so what’s the rush? I really like the design Marnie has done for us, and I think it’s cute that she wants to get matching ones. Cementing our friendship for life is a nice idea, but a part of me also wonders if I’ll regret it in the years to come. Obviously we’ll always be friends, but what if I grow to hate the design or just want it removed?There’s a lot to consider. I’d also rather just wait and see how I feel once I start travelling. I want to go with the vibe of the trip and also see the tattoo parlour in person, get a feel for what the artist is like and how clean it is before I fully commit.It’s my first one, I think it’s a bigger deal for meMarnie is the kind of person who likes everything to be planned well in advance, whereas I’m more go with the flow. I don’t think getting a tattoo should be scheduled too far in advance. We need to get the feel of the place and tweak the designs based on what they will look like on our bodies. We can only do that on the day we turn up, so I don’t see the point in debating it too much now.I’ve always wanted a tattoo and Marnie isn’t pressuring me. It was actually my idea initially, but Marnie has really run with it. I could definitely go ahead with a tattoo in the summer, but because it’s my first one, I think it’s a bigger deal for me.We’re travelling for six weeks around Vietnam and Thailand, so I want to have a good trip with Marnie – that’s my priority. Making special memories with my best friend is really important to me, but I don’t think it’s necessary to get a tattoo to show how close we are.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

It feels like all the decisions have been made by her, but holidays should be shared and spontaneous. She is ignoring Kady’s ambivalence towards tattoos and not accepting other ways of bonding as friends.Howard, 71Marnie is placing more importance on the symbolism of the tattoo than on their actual friendship. There’s no harm in having the design ready, but pressuring Kady to commit before she’s ready isn’t friendship. Marnie should focus on understanding Kady’s concerns instead of trying to rush her to agree.Tom, 37This is a personal decision which Kady is right not to commit to if she’s still on the fence. Marnie is excited and wants to plan it out, but she should back off – what’s the rush? Also, keeping a fresh tattoo clean and in good nick is tricky at the best of times, let alone when backpacking and staying in hostels.Elspeth, 25Getting a tattoo is a big deal, so Kady should be sure it’s what she really wants – and 20cm is a big tattoo! If Marnie wants a tattoo to remember their holiday then good for her, but Kady shouldn’t feel pressured to decide now.Iwan, 35This is a personal decision, and if Kady isn’t sure then she doesn’t need to commit right now. The most important thing is that they are going on the trip of a lifetime – if it feels right to get a tattoo while they’re away, then Kady can go for it.Abigail, 38Now you be the judgeIn our online poll, tell us: should Kady recommit to getting a tatoo?The poll closes on Wednesday 28 May at 10am BSTLast week’s resultsWe asked whetherLila should stop using boyfriend’s earphones.88%of you said yes –Lila is guilty12%of you said no –Lila is not guiltyExplore more on these topicsLife and styleYou be the judgeRelationshipsFamilyTattoosfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here are 10 of the best lower-ABV beveragesThinking about moderating your drinking? Sip smarter with our pick of the best mid-strength drinks, from crisp wines to award-winning pilsners (and even vodka)I tried 60 low- and no-alcohol drinks: here are my favourite beers, wines and spiritsJoanne GouldThu 22 May 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 22 May 2025 05.01 EDTShareThe Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.These days, there are plenty ofbrilliant low- and no-alcohol optionsfor when you want to stay off the sauce. But what if you’re wanting to enjoy a “real” drink – just minus the negative effects? Step up to the stage, mid-strength drinks.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.For the uninitiated, mid-strength beers, wines and spirits occupy the space between the (very) low and no sector – which covers 0-1.2% alcohol by volume (ABV) drinks, whatever the beverage – and your standard alcoholic options. Expect to see beers and ciders around the 2-3% mark, wines at 6-9% and spirits at 15-20%, but there are variations on this, particularly with wine.So why have mid-strength beverages become a thing? Laura Willoughby, founder of the mindful drinking organisation Club Soda, says: “Ultimately, moderation does not have to be a binary choice between drinking and not drinking. The goal is to encourage a more intentional drinking culture – not just when we choose to abstain from alcohol, but also when we choose to enjoy it.”The past decade has seen the trend for mindful drinking gathering pace, with people turning to “zebra striping” (alternating between alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks) and “coasting” (drinking lower ABV drinks for longer) as they become more conscious of their health and wellness. More recently, areport by KAM Insights (paid for)showed that all age groups under 55 are drinking alcohol less frequently, and 70% of 25- to 34-year-olds are actively looking for ways to lower their alcohol consumption.And there are positives to be had by switching to mid-strength drinks, besides the avoidance of the fuzzy head the morning after. Tim Lawton, drinks expert at Dry Drinker, says: “Many cite reduced-calorie counts as a key draw. Others use mid-strength wines as a step between full-strength and non-alcoholic options – it’s relatively common for people to opt for lower alcohol consumption if they’re not ready to go entirely alcohol-free.”So, whether you’re looking for mid-strength drinks for long, lazy summer drinking, are actively trying to reduce your alcohol intake, or are just curious about what’s out there, I’ve rounded up a selection of beverages that have less alcohol but all the flavour of the standard versions. I tested 40 mid-strength drinks – including wines, beers, cocktail cans and various spirits – to bring you this list of genuinely great-tasting tipples to enjoy. To qualify, drinks had to be lower in alcohol than the category norm, and taste as good as the standard version. The competition was stiff, particularly with wines and beers, so it’s well worth exploring the category for yourself.The best mid-strength beers, wines and spirits in 2025Best mid-strength lager:Small Beer lagerView image in fullscreen£2.25 for 350ml at the Whisky Exchange£13.20 for 6 x 350ml at MajesticWith so many fantastic alcohol-free and mid-strength beers around, I found it difficult to pick just one drink. But I kept coming back to this Great Taste award-winning pilsner-style lager, with its crisp, lightly citrus flavour. Brewed in south London at a B-Corp certified brewery, it’s a very civilised 2.1% with lower sugars and calories as a result. It’s a super-refreshing all-rounder that will keep you well-watered over a long, lazy picnic.Best mid-strength spirit:Quarter Proof Three Grain Spirit DrinkView image in fullscreen£24.99 for 70cl at AmazonVodka might not be the first thing to come to mind in the mid-strength drinks sphere, but why not? If your go-to tipple is a vodka, soda and lime, or if you like to begin your evening mixing an after-work martini, then a lower-alcohol version could be a great option. Made from UK barley, rye and wheat, Quarter Proof is distilled and blended at 15% for a light and smooth taste that’s perfect in all manner of vodka-based cocktails. It also makes a mean vodka martini: up the olive brine or lemon and vermouth, and serve ice-cold.Best mid-strength rose:Kamina roseView image in fullscreen£7.99 for 75cl at Click N DrinkThis pale pink, partially de-alcoholised rose from South Africa has everything you want in an easy-drinking summer wine. It’s bursting with berry flavours, while a hint of zest keeps it fresh and stops it from falling into sweeter rose territory. Bright and well-balanced, it goes brilliantly with salads, picky bits and barbecued foods. TheKamina merlotis also very good.Best mid-strength full-bodied white wine:19 Crimes mid-strength chardView image in fullscreen£8 for 75cl at Sainsbury’s£8 for 75cl at AmazonFrench sauvignon not your thing? Then why not consider this lighter take on the classic Australian chardonnay? 19 Crimes’ full-flavoured, round, buttery wine has all the expected flavours of the grape, but with only 7% alcohol. It’s bold and sunny with pronounced stone fruit, and is begging to be enjoyed well-chilled with a Sunday roast.Best mid-strength light-bodied white wine:6Percent white sauvignon blancView image in fullscreen£12.99 for 75cl at 6Percent6Percent founders Gabriella and Russell Lamb launched this range having become frustrated by having to limit themselves to just a few glasses of wine, but being disappointed with 0.5% alternatives. Not surprisingly – the clue’s in the name – this sauvignon blanc is 6%, and offers the perfect balance of flavour and body. It’s lighter than your usual, but not detrimentally so. Dry, elegant and still clearly French sauv blanc, it’s perfect for a weeknight glass in the garden and only 53 calories a go.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

This bottle from McGuigan was certainly a nice surprise: the characteristic peppery, spicy shiraz flavours work well at 7%, while the powerful black fruity flavours provide plenty of interest and roundness to counteract any potential “thinness” from the de-alcoholisation. Far better than I’d expected, and I’ll be buying it regularly.Best mid-strength light-bodied red wine:Sandridge Barton Don’t Feed the Ponies BillyView image in fullscreen£21.50 for 75cl at Sandridge Barton£25 at DelliFor something very different, this delightful low-intervention light red from Devon’s Dart valley is fun, fruity and fresh. Its name references the wild horses on Dartmoor, and 25p from every sale goes to the Dartmoor Preservation Association. Made using three grape varieties (pinot noir précoce, madeleine angevine and pinot noir), this is one for natural wine fans who have a taste for the unexpected. Here, crushed cranberries and sour cherries come to the fore, while its hue is a near-transparent raspberry that hints at the lower 9% volume. Drink lightly chilled and with an open mind.Best mid-strengthcider:Maison Sassy Cidre RoseView image in fullscreen£4 for 75cl at Majestic£5.50 for 75cl at WaitroseThere were some strong contenders in the mid-strength cider field, but Maison Sassy pipped the competition to the post with its irresistibly crisp and juicy apple- and strawberry-packed Cidre Rose. Made in Normandy using 18 varieties of apples, it’s crunchy, tart, juicy, sweet and fresh – it’s like diving headfirst into a French orchard, and I love it. It’s 3%, but I’d drink it at any volume.Best mid-strength cocktail:Nio Cocktails Negroni NextView image in fullscreen£19.50 for 3 x 100ml at Nio CocktailsNio’s range of lower-alcohol cocktails impressed, and arriving in the same clever packaging, are the new Negroni Next, Cosmopolitan Next, Margarita Next and White Lady Next. Using a mix of 0% spirits and standard alcoholic ingredients, you can enjoy all the convenience of a premade cocktail, but with less alcohol. The negroni is a triumph, with 0% Tanqueray blending nicely with great-quality vermouth, Campari and bitters for that tart, aromatic cocktail you’d expect, at just 10.8%.I tried 40 tinned drinks: here are my favourite canned cocktails, wines and seltzers for sunny daysRead moreBest mid-strength mixed drink:Reef Orange & Passion FruitView image in fullscreen£18 for 6 x 70cl at Good Time InI don’t think I’ve had a Reef since 2005, but it’s worth revisiting this noughties tipple if you’re looking for a more moderate fruity, boozy drink that comes in at 3.4%, when most fruity boozy drinks are 5%. The tangy, tropical Orange & Passion Fruit tastes just as sweetly exotic as it used to: drink it straight from the fridge on a hot day or mixed into a party punch that won’t see everyone falling over too early.Joanne Gould is afood, drink and lifestyle writer with a decade of experience.

Customers are very likely to have spotted themillefoglielong before seeing it typed up on the paper menu, though, because it will be sitting near the front door, either on the dessert trolley or zinc bar.Named because the concertina puff of the pastry looks like a thousand (mille) leaves (foglie), La Torricella prepares a millefoglie that is more or less the size of a vinyl LP, its three rings of pastry sandwiched with a mixture of custard and whipped cream, otherwise known as diplomat cream. The layers of preparation make it a special-occasion dessert – in fact, La Torricella makes millefoglie only when a large enough group requests one. The rest of the room, however, then benefits from someone else’s celebration, because the kitchen might as well make two while they’re at it. Or at least I think that’s how it works.Inspired by La Torricella, and also by every millefeuille and cream slice I have ever eaten, I have wanted to include a version of millefoglie in this column since the beginning. Ten years on, however, I am still nowhere near mastering real puff pastry or unsupported pastry cream. A friend suggested I write about a version using rough puff (Jane Grigson’s version) and pastry cream supported by cornflour – a millefoglie with bike stabilisers, if you like. I am not going to lie, however, because making both the pastry and cream still caused me anxiety, which was, I promise, then offset by immense joy.The wonderful thing about millefoglie is that, even if things haven’t gone exactly to plan, and however the pastry, custard and cream come together, it will still taste good. And remember, if all else fails, you can treat the elements like Eton mess. In fact, a mess has its benefits, because cutting a beautiful rectangle can be a nightmare; use a pointy knife to perforate the pastry top like a postage stamp, then try cutting your thousand leaves.Millefoglie(puff pastry and cream sandwich cake)Serves4-6250g plain flour220g very cold butter, diced1 tsp salt2 tsp lemon juice500ml whole milk, warmed1 whole egg plus 3 yolks80g caster sugar65g cornflour150ml double creamIcing sugar, for dustingWash a bowl so it is very cold, then dry. Put the flour in the bowl, add three cubes of the butter and rub together so the mix resembles fine breadcrumbs. Add the salt, then toss through the remaining cubes of butter. Add 125ml iced water and the lemon juice, and bring the dough together into a scraggy mass.Working on a floured board, shape the dough into a 10cm x 20cm rectangle and flour the top. Use a floured rolling pin to roll out the rectangle to double its original size, then fold in both ends so they meet in the middle and fold again over the central divide, so the pastry now looks a bit like a book. Rotate the book and repeat the process, extending, folding in the ends and turning the pastry back into a book. Wrap and chill for an hour.Meanwhile, working in a pan off the heat, beat the whole egg, egg yolks, sugar, cornflour and a few tablespoons of the warmed milk to make a thick paste. Put the pan on a low heat and add the rest of the warmed milk, whisking constantly until the crema is thick. Take off the heat, tip into a bowl and leave to cool. Beat the cream until it’s thick, then chill.Working on a floured surface, roll the dough into a 25cm x 20cm rectangle, then cut it into three even strips. If possible, chill the strips, then arrange them side by side on a baking tray lined with greaseproof paper and prick all over. Bake in a 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 oven for 30 minutes, until golden, then remove and leave to cool completely. Meanwhile, fold the whipped cream into the crema.Put one of the pastry strips on a plate, then spread or pipe a layer of the cream mix on top. Lay a second pastry strip on top, cover with of the cream mix, then top with the last strip of pastry and dust with icing sugar.This article was amended on 22 May 2025 to correct the spelling of Jane Grigson’s surname.Explore more on these topicsBakingA kitchen in RomeFoodItalian food and drinkCakePastryDessertEggsrecipesShareReuse this content"

I’m so sorry that you’re here.’Illustration: Glenn Harvey/GuardianIn January, the comedian Ashley Bez posted an Instagramvideoof herself, trying to describe a heavy mood in the air. “How come everything feels all …?” she says, trailing off and grimacing exaggeratedly into the camera.Digital anthropologist Rahaf Harfoush saw the video, and got it immediately.“Welcome to the hypernormalization club,” Harfoush said in aresponse video. “I’m so sorry that you’re here.”“Hypernormalization” is a heady, $10 word, but it captures the weird, dire atmosphere of the US in 2025.First articulated in 2005 by scholar Alexei Yurchak to describe the civilian experience in Soviet Russia, hypernormalization describes life in a society where two main things are happening.The first is people seeing that governing systems and institutions are broken. And the second is that, for reasons including a lack of effective leadership and an inability to imagine how to disrupt the status quo, people carry on with their lives as normal despite systemic dysfunction – give or take a heavy load of fear, dread, denial and dissociation.“What you are feeling is the disconnect between seeing that systems are failing, that things aren’t working … and yet the institutions and the people in power just are, like, ignoring it and pretending everything is going to go on the way that it has,” Harfoush says in her video.Within 48 hours, Harfoush’s video accrued millions of views. (It currently has slightly fewer than 9m.) It spread in “mom groups, friend chat circles, political subreddits, coupon communities, and even dog-walking groups”, Harfoush tells me, along with variations of: “Oh, so that’s what I’ve been feeling!” and “people tagging their friends with notes like: ‘We were just talking about this!’”View image in fullscreen‘People carry on with their lives as normal despite systemic dysfunction.’Illustration: Glenn Harvey/GuardianWhy hypernormalization is relevant in the USThe increasing instability of the US’s democratic norms has prompted these references to hypernormalization.Donald Trump is dismantling government checks and balances in an apparent advance toward a “unitary executive” doctrine that would grant him near-unlimited authority, driving the US toward autocracy. Billionaire tech moguls like Elon Musk arehelpingthe government consolidate power and aggressivelyreducethe federal workforce. Institutions like theNational Institutes of Health, theCenters for Disease Control and Preventionand theFood and Drug Administration, which help keep Americans healthy and informed, are being haphazardly diminished.Globally, once-in-a-lifetime climate disasters, war and the lingering trauma of Covid continue to unfold, while an explosion of generative AI threatens to destabilize how people think, make a living and relate to each other.It’s reading an article about hunger and genocide, only to scroll down to a quiz about: ‘What Pop-Tart are you?Rahaf Harfoush, digital anthropologistFor many in the US, Trump 2.0is havingadevastatingeffect ondailylife. For others, the routines of life continue, albeit threaded with mind-altering horrors: scrolling past an AI-generatedcartoonof Ice officers arresting immigrants before dinner, or hearing about starving Palestinian families while on a school run.Hypernormalization captures this juxtaposition of the dysfunctional and mundane.It’s “the visceral sense of waking up in an alternate timeline with a deep, bodily knowing that something isn’t right – but having no clear idea how to fix it”, Harfoush tells me. “It’s reading an article about childhood hunger and genocide, only to scroll down to a carefree listicle highlighting the best-dressed celebrities or a whimsical quiz about: ‘What Pop-Tart are you?’”In his 2016 documentary HyperNormalisation, the British film-maker Adam Curtis argued that Yurchak’s critique of late-Soviet life applies neatly to the west’s decades-long slide into authoritarianism, something more Americans are now confronting head-on.“Donald Trump is not something new,” Curtis tells me, calling him “the final pantomime product” of the US government, where the powerful are abandoning any pretense of common, inclusiveidealsand instead using their positions tosettle scores,reward loyaltyandhollow outinstitutions for personal or political gains.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’Trump’s US is “just like Yeltsin in Russia in the 1990s – promising a new kind of democracy, but in reality allowing the oligarchs to loot and distort the society”, says Curtis.Why the concept of hypernormalization is usefulWitnessing large-scale systems slowly unravel in real time can be profoundly surreal and frightening. The hypernormalization framework offers a way to understand what we’re feeling and why.Harfoush created her video “to reassure others that they’re not alone” and that “they aren’t misinterpreting the situation or imagining things”. Understanding hypernormalization “made me feel less isolated”, she says. “It’s difficult to act when you’re uncertain if you’re perceiving reality clearly, but once you know the truth, you can channel that clarity into meaningful action and, ideally, drive positive change.”Naming an experience can be a form of psychological relief. “The worst thing in the world is to feel that you’re the only one who feels this way and that you are going quietly mad and everyone else is in denial,” says Caroline Hickman, a psychotherapist and instructor at the University of Bath specializing in climate anxiety. “That terrifies people. It traumatizes people.”People who feel the “wrongness” of current conditions acutely may be experiencing some depression and anxiety, but those feelings can be quite rational – not a symptom of poor mental health, alarmism or a lack of proper perspective, Hickman says.“What we’re really scared of is that the people in power have not got our back and they don’t give a shit about whether we survive or not,” she says.View image in fullscreen‘The hypernormalization framework offers a way to understand what we’re feeling and why.’Illustration: Glenn Harvey/GuardianMarielle Greguski, 32, a New York City-based retail worker and content creator,posted abouteveryday life feeling “inconsequential” in the face of political crisis. Greguski says the outcome of the 2024 election reminded her that she lives in a “bubble” of progressive values, and that “there’s the other half of people that are not feeling the same energy and frustration and fear”.To Greguski, the US’s failings are not only partisan but moral – like theracism and bigotrythat Trump’s second term has brought out of the shadows andinto policy.Greguski is currently planning a wedding. It’s hard to compartmentalize “constant cruelty, things that don’t make sense”, she says. “Sometimes I’ll be like: ‘I have to put aside X amount of money for the wedding next year,’ and then I’m like: ‘Will this country exist as we know it next year?’ It really is crazy.”The effects of hypernormalizationConfronting systemic collapse can be so disorienting, overwhelming and even humiliating, that many tune it out or find themselves in a state of freeze.Greguski likens this feeling to sleep paralysis: “basically a waking nightmare where you’re like: ‘I’m here, I’m aware, but I’m so scared and I can’t move.’”In his 1955 book They Thought They Were Free: The Germans, 1933–45, journalist Milton Mayer described a similar state of freeze in German citizens during the rise of the Nazi party: “You don’t want to act, or even talk, alone; you don’t want to ‘go out of your way to make trouble.’ Why not? – Well, you are not in the habit of doing it. And it is not just fear, fear of standing alone, that restrains you; it is also genuine uncertainty.”“People don’t shut down because they don’t feel anything,” says Hickman. “They shut down because they feel too much.” Understanding this overwhelm is an important first step in resisting inaction – it helps us see fear as a trap.Curtis points out that governments may intentionally keep their citizens in a vulnerable state of dread and confusion as “a brilliant way of managing a highly febrile and anxious society”, he says.When we feel powerless in the face of bigger problems, we “turn to the only thing that we do have the power over, to try and change for the better”, says Curtis – meaning, typically, ourselves. Anxiety and fear can trap us, leading us to spend more time trying to feel better in small, personal ways, like entertainment and self-care, and less time on activism and community engagement.View image in fullscreen‘People don’t shut down because they don’t feel anything. They shut down because they feel too much.’Illustration: Glenn Harvey/GuardianHow to overcome hypernormalizationProgressive commentators have urgently called for moral clarity and mobilization in response to changes like the cuts to USAID funding, which has resulted in an estimated103 deaths per houracross the globe; thedismantling of the CDC; and Robert F Kennedy’scampaign against vaccine science.“Where is the outrage?”asksthe Nation’s Gregg Gonsalves. “Too many lives are at stake to rest in this bizarre moment of frozen agitation.”“I don’t know if there’s a massive shift toward racism as much as an expanded indifference toward it,” the historian Robin DG Kelleysaidin a February interview with New York Magazine. “People are just kind of like: ‘Well, what can we do?’”Experts say action can break the spell. “Being active politically, in whatever way, I think helps reduce apocalyptic gloom,” says Betsy Hartmann, an activist, scholar and author ofThe America Syndrome, which explores the importance of resisting apocalyptic thinking.Greguski and a co-worker have been helping distribute multilingual information about legal rights and helpline numbers, to be used in the event of Ice raids.“It’s easy to feel like: ‘Oh, I’m in community because I’m on TikTok,’” she says. But genuine community is about “getting outside and talking to your neighbor and knowing that there’s someone out there that can help you if something really bad goes down,” she says.Being active politically, in whatever way, I think helps reduce apocalyptic gloomBetsy Hartmann, author of The America Syndrome“You’re actually out there talking to people, working with people and realizing there are so many good people in the world, too, and maybe feeling less isolated than before,” says Hartmann.“But I also think we need a broader vision,” Hartmann notes. She suggests looking to resistance efforts against authoritarianism in countries like Turkey, Hungary and India. “How might we be in international solidarity? What lessons can we learn in terms of rebuilding sophisticated, complex government infrastructure that’s been hacked away at by people like Elon Musk and his minions in a more socially just and sustainable way?”“We are in a period now when it’s absolutely essential to protest,” says Hartmann, citing the Harvard professor Erica Chenoweth, who argues that just3.5%of a population engaging in peaceful protest can hold back authoritarian movements.Is ‘chic’ political? In Trump 2.0, the word stands for conservative femininityRead moreWhat makes dysfunction so dangerous is that we might simply learn to live with it. But understanding hypernormalization gives us language – and permission – to recognize when systems are failing, and clarifies the risk of not taking action when we can.In 2014, Ursula Le Guin accepted the National Book Foundation’s Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters, saying: “We live in capitalism. Its power seems inescapable. So did the divine right of kings. Any human power can be resisted and changed by human beings. Resistance and change often begin in art, and very often in our art, the art of words.”Harfoush reflects on this quote often. It underscores the fact that “this world we’ve created is ultimately a choice”, she says. “It doesn’t have to be like this.”We have the research, technologies and wisdom to create better, more sustainable systems.“But meaningful change requires collective awakening and decisive action,” says Harfoush. “And we need to start now.”"

But a stay at Slimbridge wetlands centre learning to identify  bird song helped me connect with natureCaroline ButterwickThu 22 May 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 22 May 2025 05.27 EDTShareSilhouettes dart across a lake and the pale morning sky. Avocets screech high-pitched cries, defending their eggs from a squawking crow that circles above, while a barnacle goose with a barking call flies overhead.There are 12 of us watching and listening on a dawn chorus workshop at the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust (WWT) Slimbridge centre in Gloucestershire. Being partially sighted, birding has felt out of reach for me. But this morning is about identifying birdsong, and I’m curious as to whether this will help me feel a deeper connection with nature.Slimbridge mapOur guide, Martin, points out the birds he can see and hear. It helps me understand the scene: those silhouettes I see aren’t just miscellaneous birds flying around, but the drama of the avocets swooping together to scare off the crow, the stories taking place in nature. Immediately, I feel a clearer understanding.We wander the wetlands centre, past ponds and down tree-lined paths, regularly pausing to listen. Martin draws our attention to each bird, helping us attune to the unique notes: how a goldfinch’s songtinkles, how areed warblersings continuously in a way that sounds almost mechanical. The chiffchaff’s onomatopoeic call sticks out. When Martin highlights the soft hoot of a woodpigeon, its sound reminds me of warm summer nights, hearing the comforting coo from my garden.View image in fullscreenCaroline Butterwick at the Slimbridge wetlands centreLater, WWT volunteer Dot shows me around the reserve, and she too seems attuned to birdsong. Spurred on by the morning’s session, I ask how to improve my bird listening skills, admitting that I’ve always struggled with identifying wildlife. As we gaze at the Severn estuary from the accessible observation tower, she assures me it takes time, and to practise picking out the ones I now know.As we wander, there is the regular honking of geese, brash and beautiful. Greylags with ungainly goslings trailing behind regularly cross the paths, now busy with families enjoying a warm spring day.Slimbridge was the first ofWWT’s 10 UK sites, and was founded by Peter Scott, son of Antarctic explorer Robert, in 1946. I’m staying in Warblers’ Meadow for the weekend, the site’s recently opened accommodation comprising five shepherd’s huts stationed in a pasture. Our hut, Reed Warbler, has soothing earthy tones, with a comfy double bed, shower room, kitchenette and sofa area, and a wooden deck where I sit in the evenings, listening to the birds.As I listen to birds the rest of the weekend, I realise I’ve started to unpick threads of a tapestry of songThe centre also offers canoe safaris (£10 for an hour), and it feels like exploring a secret space as my husband and I traverse the waterways enclosed by trees, paddling past the occasional bemused duck. We aren’t naturals: we bump into reed banks, and navigate without much grace around other canoes, my husband giving instructions on which way to paddle. It’s relaxing hearing the breeze in the reeds, smelling the damp earth and trees, and feeling the rhythmic tug of water against the paddle.View image in fullscreenCanoe safaris feel like exploring a secret space.Photograph: Ben Langdon Photography/WWTSlimbridge is a good base for exploring the Cotswolds and surrounding countryside, and one evening, we drive to the nearby town of Dursley and enjoy a delicious curry at theEverestNepalese and Indian restaurant. The next day, we head to Uley, where we tuck into a Sunday lunch of mushroom wellington at the 17th-centuryOld Crown Inn.I ask the barman the best way to reachUley Bury, an iron age hillfort, and he points us in the direction of the church opposite, where we follow a narrow path and then upwards through fields and woodland, the verdant swell of countryside around us. We pause on the hillside, and listen. “Those are blackbirds,” my husband says. “And I just heard a woodpigeon,” I add, smiling.This trip reminds me of the sensory joys of the outdoors – of the syrupy scent of wildflowers, the sun on my skin, and hearing a bird and now recognising its songThe ascent isn’t too difficult, my husband pointing out tree roots and loose rocks. Descending is harder for me with a lack of depth perception. At one point, we realise there’s a drop to one side, the path steep and uneven.“I’m going to have to shimmy this bit,” I say as I carefully lower myself and ungracefully, with my hands and feet on the ground, manoeuvre myself down the path until it evens out. It reminds me how my interactions with the outdoors are so influenced by my sight – that I have learned to do things differently. Still, I enjoy our walk with its gentle breeze, the green all around, and, of course, the birdsong.Gentleis the word I find myself using throughout the weekend. Although we do lots, I feel soothed, my anxious mind calmed by being immersed in nature.View image in fullscreenThe goldfinch’s song has a ‘tinkling’ quality.Photograph: Phillip Cull/AlamyI never felt out of place in the dawn chorus workshop. Sound was our shared experience. There were moments when someone pointed to a distant bird I couldn’t see, but I didn’t feel I was missing out. As I listen to birds the rest of the weekend, I realise I’ve started to unpick threads of a tapestry of song – to notice the distinct notes, the cadence and tone of each bird. I still have a lot to learn, but it seems more achievable.As my husband and I sit outside our shepherd’s hut, sipping coffee, we listen. “Is that a chiffchaff?” he says. “I think it is.” “Who’d have thought there would be so much joy in hearing a chiffchaff and knowing that’s what it is.”I can feel cut off from nature as a disabled person. But we all have our own route into nature, our own way of connection. This trip reminds me of the sensory joys of the outdoors – of the syrupy scent of wildflowers, the sun on my skin, and hearing a bird and now recognising its song.Accommodation andactivities provided by WWT.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Can you hear it? That sound of the horticultural industry exhaling? We are at the end of theChelsea flower show, AKA Gardening Christmas. Designers, contractors, nurseries, growers and gardeners have been beetling away building things, attending things, observing things from a distance and generally finding the whole event a delicious, exhausting, engaging, controversial affair.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Perhaps you pore over it on the telly, perhaps you brave the queues and the floral-dressed crowds, perhaps you ignore it entirely, but Chelsea does set the metronome and the bellwether for gardening trends that, like Anne Hathaway’s infamous cerulean sweater in The Devil Wears Prada, filter down to what we do in our own gardens several seasons later. Corten steel, Mediterranean planting, the rise of the wildflower, outdoor kitchens: all were spotted first at Chelsea.This year has a surprisingly canine focus, with Monty Don – usually busy hosting the BBC coverage, or swapping the press tent for the plush of the velvet banquettes in theNewt hospitalitysuite – designing the RHS and BBC Radio 2Dog Garden. When this was announced last autumn, it was proclaimed the show’s first dog-friendly garden (which is not true: Jo Thompsonmade oneback in 2012).Nevertheless, the focus onmaking beautiful gardens that are practical for our furry friendsis something designers traditionally overlook; one once told me the worst part of the job was having to dodge dog poo while doing a recce on a new site.Diverse lawns are more hardy for pets, as well as offering many new things for them to sniffThree years after Lulu Urquhart and Adam Hunt set tongues (not tails) wagging with theirbest-in-show-winning rewilded garden, “weedy” lawns are firmly back on the agenda.Don’s creation, which was made by a team headed by Jamie Butterworth, features dandelions, clover and daisies, all meticulously transported from RHS Garden Wisley. Diverse lawns are more hardy for the needs of pet ownership, as well as offering many new things to sniff. But clover is especially good because it remains green during periods of drought and the onslaught of dog pee, whereas grass will yellow. You can add some in by making bare patches with a rake (if your dog hasn’t made some already) and sowing over with white clover – now is the perfect time.Obviously, you’ll want to avoid planting what is toxic to dogs – among the varieties to avoid are azaleas, autumn crocus and lilies. But dog-friendly gardens will actively include forgiving, clump-forming plants that don’t mind a bit of a bash. Rosemary puts up with such things, as do roses (which have thorns), as well as hardy geraniums,Alchemillamollis.Active diggers may benefit from a designated area in which to dig, not unlike a sandpit for small children, which can be shielded with greenery or hidden inside a raised bed. Whether your dog will choose to dig there over a flowerbed is a matter beyond my horticultural knowledge.Explore more on these topicsGardening adviceChelsea flower showPetsGardensDogsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He has also recently filed paperwork to run as a Democratic candidate for a congressional House seat in Arizona.The 48-year-old did not provide specific details about why he believed Musk was being targeted by Russian operatives, but said it involved individuals he believed were being “placed” in Musk’s inner circle at the time and were gaining influence with him.“Those efforts were intense and they were ongoing,” he said. “I can’t go into too much more detail.”Musk,the world’s richest man, was not under investigation and was not suspected of wrongdoing, Buma said.Reporting by the Wall Street Journal indicates that Buma was not the only person who was concerned about individuals who were gaining access to Musk at that time.View image in fullscreenElon Musk speaks at an America Pac town hall before the Wisconsin supreme court election, on 30 March.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesAJuly 2022 articlereported that Jared Birchall, who serves as Musk’s wealth manager, had “cornered” his boss to discuss his concerns about a then new adviser to the Tesla CEO named Igor Kurganov, a Russian-born ex-professional gambler. Birchall reportedly saw Kurganov as a “newcomer who suddenly had immense influence on what to do with Musk’s money”.The Journal described how Kurganov had spent time sleeping in Musk’s home during the pandemic, and that Musk reportedly told Birchall he was considering leaving Kurganov in charge of his charitable giving. Musk’s personal fortune was worth about $230bn at the time. The Journal said it was basing its reporting on more than a dozen people close to Musk, Birchall and Kurganov.The newspaper also reported at the time that Birchall had learned that an FBI agent had been making preliminary inquiries into Kurganov as part of his job “to watch for foreign interference in US companies”, citing people familiar with the matter.Kurganov had not been accused of wrongdoing, the Journal reported, and he did not provide a comment to the newspaper at the time.The Guardian is not aware of Kurganov being named as a foreign agent, and he has no known connections to Russia, other than having been born there. Efforts to reach him directly did not elicit a response. The Guardian also reached out to Kurganov’s wife, Liv Boeree, a professional poker player. She said in an emailed statement: “My husband’s only connection to Russia is that he was pushed out of his Mum’s vagina on its soil.”In his interview with the Guardian, Buma said he did not have direct dealings with Musk. He said he tried to convey his concerns to another agent, who was described as an FBI liaison to SpaceX, but claimed the other agent was not responsive.Birchall, the Wall Street Journal reported, asked Musk to remove Kurganov from his post at Musk’s private foundation in May 2022, which Musk then agreed to do.The FBI’s national press office did not respond to a request for comment. The Guardian also reached out to the FBI’s Los Angeles field office, which declined to comment.Musk did not respond to an emailed request for comment. The Guardian attempted to call and send messages to Birchall via WhatsApp but he did not respond.Buma’s new claims follow earlier reporting byBusiness Insiderandthe Atlanticabout Buma’s relationship with another prominent billionaire, Peter Thiel, who reportedly became a source for the FBI in 2021. Buma, it has previously been reported, was Thiel’s handler. It is not clear whether Thiel has maintained a source relationship with the FBI.Thiel and Musk have a long history together. The two bothspent their early years in South Africa. Thiel founded PayPal, the online payment company where Musk also served as CEO before he was reportedly ousted by Thiel and his allies. The two are believed to be on good terms, with Thiel crediting Musk’s support for Trump with helping other Silicon Valley leaders support the US president in the run-up to last year’s presidential election.In his interview with the Guardian, Buma said Thiel had been “receptive to collaboration [with the FBI] and threat briefings”.View image in fullscreenPeter Thiel speaks at the Republican national convention on 21 July 2016 in Cleveland, Ohio.Photograph: Joe Raedle/Getty Images“The purpose of the briefings was to educate [Thiel] about what to look out for, what a targeting looks like, what it’s like to be bumped by a foreign intelligence agent, and then what to do when that’s done,” Buma said. “He essentially confirmed and provided helpful information to help us identify the nodes through which these outreaches have occurred.”Thiel did not respond to a request for comment.Buma has been a controversial figure inside the FBI since he filed his first internal complaint in the bureau in January 2022. An FBI affidavit, filed on 18 March in the US district court in California in connection to his arrest, describes him as working in various capacities over his 15-year career at the bureau, where from 2013 to 2022 he focused on counterintelligence and counterproliferation matters. Until December 2022, the FBI has said, his responsibilities included managing “confidential human sources”. Buma has described himself as specializing for a decade in public corruption and Russian foreign counterintelligence operations, a role that he said led the FBI to train him to speak and read Russian.In January 2019, a tip from one of Buma’s sources led to the FBI’s first inquiry into possible tax evasion by Joe Biden’s son Hunter, who was a director at the Ukrainian company Burisma. Hunter Biden pleaded guilty in 2024 to federal tax evasion charges connected to his foreign business deals. He was later pardoned by his father, the then president Joe Biden, who in a statement said he believed his son had been “selectively and unfairly prosecuted”.Buma was also involved in an FBI investigation into possibly illegal lobbying and campaign violations involving Rudy Giuliani, the former prosecutor, mayor of New York and personal attorney to Donald Trump. Giuliani’s home and officewere raided in 2021in connection to FBI suspicions around his dealings with Ukrainian figures, but all of the investigations wereultimately droppedand Giuliani was never charged with any crime as a result of the inquiry.Buma began seeking whistleblower protection, both inside the FBI and later in Congress, beginning in 2022, when he began to report what he called “highly suspicious suppression of investigations and intelligence gathering” in matters related to the Russian intelligence service. At the heart of his allegations, which were submitted to the Senate judiciary committee in a 22-page statement, was Buma’s contention that investigations into Giuliani had been quashed and that he had faced internal FBI retaliation, which he said led to the suppression of his intelligence reporting.It also led, Buma said, to his diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder on 25 October 2023. At that time, he began to take unpaid leave from the FBI.View image in fullscreenBuma has been involved in investigations of Hunter Biden and Rudy Giuliani during his career at the FBI.Photograph: Matt Martian/The GuardianWeeks later, on 13 November 2023, federal law enforcement officials raided Buma’s home, according to the FBI affidavit filed in March 2025. The affidavit claimed that agents found “numerous” FBI documents, including a compilation of emails, in that search. But Buma was not arrested at that time. He remained on unpaid leave from the FBI until he submitted a resignation letter on 16 March 2025.The FBI affidavit also alleged that Buma began emailing chapters of a book draft to associates between October and December 2023, including information that the FBI said was subject to restrictions. The FBI has alleged that Buma sent messages to individuals at that time that discussed his involvement in press reports about confidential human sources. Buma has denied wrongdoing.Even as the FBI officer was facing scrutiny, so was Elon Musk. The Wall Street Journal reported on 25 October 2024 that Musk, who had emerged as an important supporter of Donald Trump’s re-election campaign, had been“in regular contact” with Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, since late 2022.The report cited several current and former US, European and Russian officials and said the conversations touched on personal topics, business and geopolitical tensions. The Journal report also noted that the contacts raised potential national security concerns, given Musk’s security clearance connected to SpaceX, which has billions of dollars in contracts with the Pentagon, and Musk’s access to classified information.Musk did not respond to the Journal’s request for comment at the time but posted a comment on X following the story’s publication, including one tweet that said: “Welp, the Swamp’s ‘Trump is Hitler’ didn’t work. Might as well give ‘Elon is a Russian agent’ a whirl.”Musk has had a high-profile role at the White House since Trump’s November 2024 election victory as the unofficial head of the so-called “department of government efficiency”, or Doge, which has overseen the firing of thousands of federal workers and an attempted dismantling of federal agencies. Among a myriad of controversies over Doge’s actions was an official whistleblower complaint by a member of the IT department at the National Labor Relations Board, whose disclosure was detailed in a15 April 2025 report by NPR. The whistleblower, Daniel Berulis, grew alarmed when technical staff members noticed a spike in sensitive data leaving the NLRB after Doge engineers were granted access to the data, followed by what was described as “suspicious log-in attempts” from an IP address in Russia.NPR said Berulis’s account was corroborated by internal documentation that was reviewed by 11 technical experts across other government agencies and the private sector. The report added that Doge’s access to data was a “widespread concern”.View image in fullscreenThe J Edgar Hoover building, the FBI’s headquarters, in Washington DC.Photograph: Kent Nishimura/Getty ImagesThe NLRB has denied that the agency granted Doge access and said it had determined that no breach of agency systems occurred.Buma was arrested on 17 March 2025, just weeks after Trump’s new director of the FBI, Kash Patel, had been confirmed in his role. Buma said he was at Kennedy airport awaiting a flight to the UK, where he planned to have a meeting with the HarperCollins publisher Arabella Pike, when he was suddenly surrounded by agents. He was released on bail the next day.The bail included a restriction that he refrain from excessive use of alcohol. This restriction appears to arise from an October 2023 text message reviewed by the FBI. Buma denies drinking excessively.His meeting with Pike was canceled by the publisher after his arrest, according to a screenshot of a text message seen by the Guardian. Pike did not respond to a request for comment.Buma was arraigned in Los Angeles weeks after his arrest, on 1 May, and charged with a single misdemeanor. US prosecutors have claimed Buma “knowingly published, divulged, disclosed, and made known” the identity and personal identifying information of an individual who was a confidential FBI source.Buma told the Guardian he believed this was related to the news report that publicly identified Thiel as an FBI source. He denied any involvement in the matter and has pleaded not guilty."

As well as sanctions and an arms embargo, that should include an announcement on the recognition of a Palestinian state – which has already been endorsed in asymbolic Commons motion in 2014by 11 members of the current cabinet – to revive the moribund peace process.A key element must be to put pressure on the Americans, who alone have the power to persuade the Israeli government to stop the carnage. While Benjamin Netanyahu has hitherto had Donald Trump’s backing, he will no doubt be aware that the capricious US president, fixated on the bottom line and now distracted byprojecting his gold obsession into outer spacewith his Golden Dome missile defence system, could turn on a dime.Netanyahu has described the crisis as existential for Israel. In one sense, he is right. As well as obliterating Palestinians and condemning the remaining hostages to death, he has turned Israel into a pariah state and embarked on a self-destructive course that risks the moral and physical integrity of Israel.Anyone who has the best interests of both the Palestinian and Israeli people at heart must surely support all actions aimed at an immediate end to the war, the return of the hostages and the full resumption of humanitarian aid toGaza.Dr Anthony IsaacsLondonYour report of the foreign secretary’s announcements to parliament states that a “future bilateral strategic roadmap” will be reviewed (UK suspends trade talks with Israel and attacks ‘repellent’ extremism, 20 May). The 2030 roadmap for UK-Israel bilateral relations was in factsignedin March 2023. This provides the framework for the prospective trade agreements that are now under review, but also outlines the many areas in which the two countries already partner. This includes defence and security, science, technology and health.There is also the promise of cooperation on culture, arts, education, climate change, gender and development. The UK government has also committed to “tackling the disproportionate focus on Israel in the UN and other international bodies”.That the roadmap is not in the future but determining relations in the present is evident from the extremely delayed and limited response of the British government in condemning the actions of its Israeli partners. The roadmap must now be suspended in its entirety.Emma SangsterLondonDavid Lammy’s words are not enough – we need concrete actions. His government is stillauthorising arms export licenceswith end users in Israel,potentially violatinginternational law. It has not yet sanctioned the Israeli ministers Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir, whose language demonstrates the intention to commit genocide, and it is ignoring the pleas of the 600,000 who I joined in a demonstration in London last Saturday on behalf of Palestinians to end Israel’s occupation and the starving of civilians, and to stop this terrible war. Moreover, we who demonstrate face hostile policing, arrests and prosecutions, clogging up our already overburdened courts, wasting taxpayers’ money.Margaret OwenLondonOwen Jones has been consistently devastating in his writing about Gaza (A moment of judgment has come at last: not just for Netanyahu but for his enablers, 20 May). He does not shy away from the horrors perpetrated day after day. The weakness and hypocrisy of politicians is exposed in every word he writes. His anger is my anger and that of so many.

It seems that it is theLabourparty, which I have supported all my life (though sometimes reluctantly), that has become alien.Jenni DaichesSouth Queensferry, EdinburghIs it cynical to ask whether the payment of a £1,000-a-yearhealth surchargewhile on a time-limited residence permit played a role in the decision to extend the qualifying period for “indefinite leave to remain” from five to 10 years? After all, these surcharges contributed £1.7bn to Britain’s health departments in 2023-24 alone, according to a research briefing in the House of Commons library. Nice little earner.Yvonne BearneKingsteignton, DevonIf the prime minister believes it is OK to require all arriving workers or students and their adult dependents to have good English, he would presumably also support the idea that all British emigrants should have a good standard of the language of the country they are moving to.

Accidents are now the second leading cause of death for under‑40s. These are not random tragedies; they are systemic failures.Currently there is no government plan to address this issue and responsibility is fragmented across many departments. RoSPA is calling for a national accident prevention strategy to get the UK back on track. Accidents cost theNHS£6bn annually and result in 29 million lost working days – 10 times more than strikes. A coordinated, cross-government approach would save lives, ease pressure on the NHS and support economic growth. We cannot continue to ignore a crisis that is both avoidable and escalating.Other nations have shown that strategic, data-led prevention policies can dramatically reduce accidental harm. The UK must follow suit by appointing a dedicated minister to lead a cross-departmental response.

The statement did not mention China, but “nonmarket policies” typically refer to that country’s export subsidies and currency policies that the Trump administration says give it an advantage in international trade.The high-profile gathering of officials from the US, Canada, the UK, Japan, Germany, France and Italy appeared to be more congenial thanan earlier meeting of G7 foreign ministers in March. That meeting, also in Canada, occurred as Donald Trump was in the middle of threatening stiff tariffs on Canada andsuggestingit could become the 51st state.US treasury secretary Scott Bessent told AFP: “I don’t think there were any major disagreements, I thought the meeting went great.”German finance minister Lars Klingbeil told reporters it was crucial to “resolve the current trade disputes as quickly as possible,” as tariffs had placed “a heavy burden on the global economy”.“Our hand is extended,” Klingbeil added.French finance minister Eric Lombard said: “The atmosphere was warm … We don’t agree on everything, but we talked about everything.”The G7 statement did not mention the US tariffs, which have disrupted global trade and supply chains and added economic uncertainty.Champagne downplayed the lack of communique language on tariffs, but said ministers “were not skating around” the issue and discussed the effects during the meeting.Canadais seeking a deal to eliminate Trump’s 25% tariffs on many goods, including steel and aluminium.“We’re trying to enhance growth and stability. And obviously tariffs are something in that context that you can’t avoid discussing,” Champagne said.The Chinese embassy in Ottawa said it could not immediately comment on the G7 statement.The G7 finance chiefs also condemned what they called Russia’s “continued brutal war” against Ukraine and said that if efforts to achieve a ceasefire failed, they would explore all possible options, including “further ramping up sanctions.”The description of the Ukraine war was watered down from the prior G7 statement issued in October, before Trump’s re-election, calling it an “illegal, unjustifiable, and unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine”.Trump has diminished US support for Ukraine and has made statements suggesting that Kyiv was to blame for the conflict as he tries to coax Russia into peace talks.Diplomatic efforts to end the conflict have accelerated in recent weeks, with Russian and Ukrainian officials holding their first face-to-face talks in more than three years last week in Istanbul.But the Kremlin said on Thursday that new peace talks with Ukraine had “yet to be agreed,” disputing reports the two nations would soon hold negotiations at the Vatican.The finance meeting sets the stage for a G7 leaders summit June 15-17 in the nearby mountain resort area of Kananaskis. Trump will attend the summit, the White House confirmed on Thursday.Reuters, Agence France-Presse and Associated Press contributed to this articleExplore more on these topicsG7ChinaInternational tradeGlobal economyCanadaJapanGermanynewsShareReuse this content"

No date has been set for a vote there, but it is expected to pass without resistance in the conservative chamber packed with agribusiness lobby supporters.The initiative proposes overhauling Brazil’s rigorous environmental licensing procedures to make the system simpler and more efficient. But it has been condemned by climate activists and policymakers as a historical setback that ignores the reality of theclimate crisisand flies in the face of Brazil’s commitments to combatting climate change.“It’s like getting rid of the brakes in a moving vehicle,” said Natalie Unterstell, the president of the Instituto Talanoa climate policy thinktank. She said the bill jeopardises Brazil’s commitments of eradicating deforestation by 2030 and reaching net zero by 2050.The proposed legislation would allow some projects to renew permits through a self-declaration process and loosen requirements for high-impact ventures such as mining, allowing potentially harmful developments to move forward without serious considerations of their impacts on things like water reservoirs, deforestation or local communities.Bibles, bullets and beef: Amazon cowboy culture at odds with Brazil’s climate goalsRead more“Most licensing procedures will become a push of a button without an environmental study or environmental impact assessment,” said Suely Araújo, the public policy coordinator at the Climate Observatory network of NGOs.The Socio-Environmental Institute (ISA), a civil society organisation, said the proposal would dismantle a system of environmental protections that was built over decades, and do away with conditions that require companies to adopt prevention, mitigation and compensation measures, thus increasing the risk of destruction and conflict in rural areas.TheISA calculatedthat the approval of the law would directly threaten more than 3,000 protected areas, including land occupied by Indigenous people andAfro-descendantquilombolacommunities, and put 18m hectares (44.5m acres) of forest at risk. “The bill represents a collapse foretold,” the ISA said.The bill’s progress through congress has attracted particular dismay as Brazil is preparing to host the Cop30 climate conference in the Amazon in November. The government has said that it wants this year’s summit to be one of action, but this attempt to dismantle environmental protections undermines the country’s credibility, said Unterstell.“It sends the wrong signal at the wrong time,” she said.Environment minister Marina Silvadescribedthe approval of the bill as a “death blow” to Brazil’s climate efforts, but other members ofLuiz Inacio Lula da Silva’s government had previously expressed support for the measure, saying it would help attract investment.Although Lula has been successful in reducing deforestation, which fell by 32% across the country last year according toMapBiomas, he has disappointed the climate movement in other areas, particularly with his stance on oil exploration.One of the amendments introduced by the senate would notably speed up permits for projects deemed a government priority. Pro-oil senators hope this could benefit controversialexploration projects near the mouth of the Amazon river, a new oil frontier where the state-controlled oil company Petrobras has so far been unsuccessful in its endeavour to obtain drilling permits from the environmental watchdog Ibama.Explore more on these topicsBrazilAmericasClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

A ruling by the inter-American court of human rights could open way for reparationsSupported byAbout this contentDan Collynsin LimaThu 22 May 2025 11.09 EDTLast modified on Thu 22 May 2025 11.11 EDTShareThe case of a forced sterilisation carried out inPeruin the 1990s will be heard by an international court on Thursday, 28 years after the procedure – one of many thousands – resulted in a woman’s death.Celia Ramos was 34 when she died in 1997, 19 days after surgery for a tubal ligation caused respiratory failure. The mother of three was “harassed” into accepting the procedure, which was part of a nationwide family planning programme.The mass sterilisation of hundreds of thousands of largely poor, rural and Indigenous women in the 1990s is regarded as one of the country’s most flagrant and widespread violations of human rights under thelate former president Alberto Fujimori, but neither the leader nor his health ministers have ever been prosecuted for the campaign, which lasted years.In 2024, theUN committee on the elimination of discriminationagainst women urged Peru to compensatewomen who were forcibly sterilised in the 1990s, ruling that the state policy could constitute a “crime against humanity”.Marisela Monzón Ramos, 38, was just 10 years old when her mother died. The eldest of Ramos’s three daughters, she was in Guatemala City for Thursday’s hearing at the inter-American court of human rights.View image in fullscreenMarisiela Monzon Ramos, the daughter of Celia Ramos, who died in 1997 after being forcibly sterilised, says the case is a ‘huge step’ for her family.Photograph: Paolo Aguilar/EPA“This is a huge step for us, considering the years of struggle. It has been nearly three decades since my mother died,” she told the Guardian before the hearing.“[This hearing] gives us the opportunity that we have not had in our country.‘It’s the first time I’ve woven in 27 years’: Peruvian women revive arts lost to trauma of forced sterilisationsRead more“We are looking for justice. The Peruvian state should be held responsible for the death of our mother, who was completely healthy,” she said.While this is the first case of a forced sterilisation in Peru to reach the inter-American court, the Celia Ramos case is representative of thousands of others, says Carmen Cecilia Martínez, an associate director at the Center for Reproductive Rights.“The court’s decision could force the Peruvian state to make reparations to the victims of this case and open the way to justice for others,” she said.Demus, a Peruvian NGO for women’s rights, presented the Celia Ramos case to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) in 2010. Eleven years later, an IACHR report declared that the Peruvian state was responsible for the violation of Ramos’ rights and recommended the adoption of measures of reparation and non-repetition. However, as Peru made no progress in complying with the recommendations, the commission sent the case to the inter-American court in June 2023. The legal representation was bolstered by the regionalCenter for Justice and International Law(Cejil) and theCenter for Reproductive Rights, which joined in the same year.View image in fullscreenA photograph from the 2014 corruption trial of late former president Alberto Fujimori.Photograph: Martín Mejía/APMartínez says successive health ministers under Fujimori turned the forced sterilisations into public policy, offering financial incentives to medical workers for each woman who was subjected to the procedure.“The objective was very clear: to recruit women from poor areas, Indigenous, rural peasant women and eliminate their reproductive capacity, violating, among other rights, their right to reproductive autonomy,” Martínez said.The legal team’s hope, she explained, is for the court to declare the policy a crime against humanity, which would eliminate any statute of limitations on opening investigations.“There is a very clear causal link between the violation of [Ramos’s] informed consent and her death,” Martínez said.Monzón, a biologist, says the whole family, who lived in Peru’s northern Piura region, were left “devastated” by her mother’s death. “Our life was cut short,” she said. She and her younger sister recall how nurses repeatedly put pressure on their mother, who initially refused the procedure.“She was a young woman, a very joyful woman, full of life,” she said. “She was a complete mother, a devoted wife, a lady who took care to be attentive for the good of all the beings she loved.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentWomen's rights and gender equalityReproductive rightsIndigenous peoplesPeruAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Requests or audits were made against the association, at least eight independent media outlets, and at least 20 journalists and their family members, including Cheng and her parents, she said at a press conference on Wednesday.Cheng said the tax department had told one journalist that they had to pay a profit tax for a company they did not run, and had cited a registration number that did not exist. Another company was told it was being audited for profits made during the year before it was even founded. One journalist had their income “assessed” as double the amount they had actually earned, and was issued a demand for prepayment of tax on the “under-reported” income.“Does the average news worker have the resources to hire an auditor to handle it?” Cheng asked. “We are concerned that tax investigations will put a financial and mental strain on media workers, disrupt our reporting and prevent us from focusing our journalistic work.”Hong Kong journalists harassed in ‘systemic and organised attack’Read moreAmong the media outlets listed as targets were InMedia HK and the English-language Hong Kong Free Press (HKFP), and the latter’s founder, Tom Grundy.HKFP said it had been “randomly selected” for a seven-year audit in 2024, and that the IRD had twice requested “hold sums”, which were later reduced to zero after the outlet objected.“HKFP has always met its tax obligations, paid IRD demands immediately, and ensured meticulous record-keeping since our 2015 inception,” it said.“The delays involved, and wide scope of these inspections, raise questions about the burden on the taxpayer and tax office resources … Recent scrutiny has diverted resources, manpower and funds away from journalism as we face a fourth year of financial deficit.”In a statement on X, Grundy said the outlet had “expected this kind of thing years ago”, and had been “obsessive” in its record keeping and financial transparency.“I’m having to act as a one-man compliance department instead of a journalist,” he said about the 15 month-long process so far.Citing IRD figures, Grundy said the chance of being “randomly” selected for an IRD audit was about 0.123%. “The probability drops much further when considering almost all independent media outlets were coincidentally, simultaneously selected.”Aleksandra Bielakowska, advocacy manager at Reporters Without Borders Asia-Pacific, said Hong Kong and Chinese authorities were doing everything in their power “to close remaining media outlets … and make sure there’s only one narrative coming from the Chinese Communist party. If they can’t put people in jail they’ll pressure them and their families to dissuade – or even prevent – them from reporting on the ground,” she told the Guardian.Hong Kong’s media have come under increasing pressureand persecution since the government crackdown on the pro-democracy movement ushered in a Beijing-designed national security law.Several outlets have been forced to close or relocate, including Apple Daily, whose founder, Jimmy Lai, is on trial for alleged offences under the NSL, and Stand News, whose two former editors werejailed for sedition last year.The Stand News sentencing came just weeks after the HKJA revealeda campaign of “systemic and organised” harassment of journalists and outlets, many of which Cheng said on Wednesday were also among those questioned by the tax authorities.The harassment included death threats and threatening and defamatory complaint letters being sent to reporters’ families and their employers, landlords and neighbours.In the latest Reporters Without Borders’ World Press Freedom Index, Hong Kong ranked 140 out of 180 countries, down from 80 in 2021.The IRD said it did not comment on individual cases but “the industry or background of a taxpayer has no bearing on such reviews”.Additional research by Lillian YangExplore more on these topicsHong KongChinaPress freedomAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The tipping caused damage to sections of the hull, the state-run KCNA news agency said on Thursday.“Kim Jong-un made [a] stern assessment, saying that it was a serious accident and criminal act caused by absolute carelessness, irresponsibility … and could not be tolerated,” KCNA reported.Kim ordered the ship restored before a key meeting of the ruling Workers’ party next month, KCNA added. The accident had “brought the dignity and self-respect of our state to a collapse”.Blaming “inexperienced command and operational carelessness” during the launch, the news agency said the incident left “some sections of the warship’s bottom crushed”. Officials found responsible for the debacle would be “dealt with at the plenary meeting of the party central committee” in June, Kim said.Delays, edits, and no Son Heung-min: how North Korea watches the Premier LeagueRead moreSouth Korea’s military said the vessel was lying on its side in the water.In a report issued last week on preparations for the launch, US-based 38 North said it appeared the ship would be side-launched from the quay, a method not previously observed inNorth Korea. “The use of this launch method could be one of necessity, as the quay where the ship is being built does not have an incline,” the 38 North report said. Commercial satellite imagery of the shipyard the day before the launch showed the destroyer positioned on the quay with support vessels by its side.View image in fullscreenA satellite image of the destroyer before the launch in Chongjin.Photograph: Planet Labs PBC/APThe ship was the second 5,000-tonne destroyer-class vessel – the biggest in the North Korean fleet – to have been launched in recent weeks.

Ahn Chan-il, a North Korean defector who runs the World Institute for North Korea Studies, pointed out that Chongjin is conveniently close to the Russian port of Vladivostok.View image in fullscreenA satellite image shows a blue tarpaulin covering the destroyer after the failed launch.Photograph: Planet Labs PBC/AP“It’s also likely that the projected timeline for the vessel – including when assembly would be completed and the ship launched – was shared with the Russian side,” Ahn said. “It appears the dock was hastily constructed, and multiple issues may have arisen during the shipbuilding process.”While the usually secretive North has previously disclosed failed satellite launches and the destruction caused by natural disasters, some analysts said the regime had been surprisingly quick to report Wednesday’s incident.“It shows again Kim Jong-un’s ruling style of cutting off negative rumours from spreading and controlling officials more forcefully by being open about it rather than hiding it,” said Cheong Seong-chang at the Sejong Institute in Seoul.While much of Kim’s focus has been on missile development and forging closer ties with Russia, he inspected a project to build a nuclear-powered submarine in March and said “radically” boosting the navy was a key part of the North’s defences.He called for the modernisation of the country’s surface and underwater naval forces, including the development of warships.Explore more on these topicsNorth KoreaKim Jong-unAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The upgrades were later extended to 96 schools.This week’s 2025-26budget papersrevealed 28 of the schools would be waiting for the promised capital works – which included new gymnasiums, performing arts and science centres and new learning spaces – until at least 2027, after the next state election.Last year’s 2024-25 budget allocated $227m to deliver promised capital upgrades at 25 of the schools, with the rest allocated funding in previous budgets. It pushed funding for the further 29 schools into this year’s budget.Tuesday’s budget papersconfirmed just one of the 29 projects would be completed by October 2026, with the rest languishing until 2027 at the earliest.The budget,the first delivered by the new treasurer, Jaclyn Symes, included $1.5bn to deliver new schools, upgrades and maintenance, as part of the state government’s promise to build 100 new schools across Victoria by 2026.Promised school upgrades impacted by delaysIn total, just five of the 96 promised upgrades had been completed and 11 were in construction, almost three years after their announcement. The rest remained in the design or planning stage, the Victorian School Building Authority (VSBA) website showed.For St Kilda Primary school, this year’s budget was yet another disappointment, seven years after the state government delivered $10.5m to upgrade the campus. As part of the upgrade, its hall was demolished in 2020 to make way for new capital works.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailOne parent, Caroline Thornton, has been lobbying with more than 200 families and students to draw attention to the funding need. Some 440 students have no indoor space for assemblies or physical education.“St Kilda Primary is the largest school in the area with no facilities to accommodate … inclement weather, and nowhere to hold events,” she said. “The state government promised a replacement hall, but this part of the school’s master plan remains unfunded.”Victoria state budget 2025: treasurer uses public service cuts and GST windfall to fund cash splashRead moreVictoria’s shadow minister for education, Jess Wilson, said Labor had “broken its promise to deliver these desperately needed projects by November 2026”.“The Allan Labor government has put a go-slow on these upgrades and the needs of students on pause as it scrambles to pay Victoria’s more than one million dollar an hour interest bill,” she said.But Victoria’s education minister, Ben Carroll, said the Liberals were “lying to Victorians” and the budget had delivered funding on “every promised school upgrade”.“Our priority is – and has always been – that every child, no matter where they live, has access to a world-class education for free in a Victorian government school backed by full and fair funding,” he said.Meanwhile, environment groups say nature and biodiversity has been short-changed by the Victorian budget.Environment Victoria welcomed new money for efficient electric hot water and home insulation, but raised concerns about the lack of support for nature or threatened species.Nature campaigner Greg Foyster said: “If the government wants to invest in the great outdoors for the longer term, we need to see a massive increase in funding for parks and reserves, biodiversity programs and saving threatened species.“The Parliamentary Inquiry into Ecosystem Decline recommended increasing funding for parks and reserves to 1% of gross state product. One percent doesn’t seem too much to ask to ensure the survival of all the animals, plants, wetlands, forests and special places in Victoria, but the current funding is pitifully small.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That’s no way to treat the agency responsible for looking after the places millions of Victorians love and rely on,” said VNPA’s executive director, Matt Ruchel.On Tuesday, the environment minister, Steve Dimopoulos, said in a statement: “We’re taking care of our native wildlife and environment while making sure Victorian families can continue to enjoy our amazing zoos and our incredible great outdoors for less.”But the minister did not respond to questions about cuts to environment.Victorian Labor faces continued pressure over recent revelations by the Age that$2.4bn in funding for state schools was quietly delayedin last year’s 2024-25 budget, pushing back its commitment to fully fund public schools by three years to 2031.It places Victoria three years behind Queensland, which has committed to reach 75% of the Schooling Resource Standard (SRS) by 2028, and six years behind New South Wales, which is due to reach the benchmark this year.Speaking on ABC Melbourne on Wednesday, the premier, Jacinta Allan, was asked if it was fair forGonski fundingto be delayed by three years.Victoria state budget 2025 winners and losers: families, health and public transport benefit as net debt climbsRead more“We are working through the terms of the agreement with the federal government,” she said.“Because what’s not OK is that in the past government schools have not been funded as fairly as non-government schools.”A spokesperson for the federal education minister, Jason Clare, said anagreement had been reached with Victoriato increase the commonwealth funding share to 25% of the SRS by 2034 and, in return, Victoria must reach and maintain the remaining 75%.But when it did so was up to them.“The minister will not be negotiating this bilateral agreement through the media.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian educationVictorian politicsVictorianewsShareReuse this content"

The NSW premier, Chris Minns, told reporters on Thursday “we’re seeing levels of rise in local tributaries, creeks [and] rivers that we haven’t seen since 1920”.“Many people would have never seen this level of inundation or flooding in their communities,” Minns said.On Thursday evening, NSW police northern regions commander David Waddell announced the third reported death in the floods, which have been brought on by three consecutive days of rain.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailHe said the woman, who has yet to be formally identified, was located in Brooklana, west of Coffs Harbour. Her family has been informed.NSW floods: these maps show the full extent of record-breaking rainfallRead morePolice earlier said a body, believed to be that of a man in his 30s missing since Wednesday night, was found near Rosewood on Thursday morning. The body of a 63-year-old man was found on Wednesday at a home affected by flood waters on North Moto Road at Moto.The 60-year-old woman had travelled with a police officer towards Coffs Harbour at 7pm on Wednesday night until they reached flood waters at Caramba Road. The officer was in a BMW sedan and could not continue. The woman was in a 4WD and decided to continue after the officer checked the water levels, Wardell said.The woman called 30 minutes later saying she was in trouble near Brooklana, but could not be located after a search. Her vehicle was found on Thursday.Waddell pleaded with people not to enter the flood waters.“It is a really dangerous, once-in-a-lifetime event, and there’s been some tragedy surrounding this death, obviously, the police officer who spoke the woman is very traumatised, and we’re wrapping support services around him.”A man who failed to come home after walking near a flooded road at Nymboida remains missing.Although there were thousands of emergency service workers in the field, Minns said “the number of houses that have been inundated and the number of communities that have been isolated, far exceed the amount of boats, the amount of helicopters, amount of trucks that any government can provide”.There were 2,500 personnel, including 2,200 SES workers, in the field, the NSW emergency services minister, Jihad Dib, said.View image in fullscreenFlooding in Smithtown on the banks of the Macleay River.Photograph: Gavin PartridgeThe Bureau of Meteorology’s Steve Bernasconi on Thursday afternoon said dangerous flooding would continue, with the mid-north coast experiencing intense rainfall for the third consecutive day.Heavy rainfall was expected around the southern Hunter, Blue Mountains and Southern Highlands later on Thursday.“There is a reprieve from the rainfall, though, for the mid-north coast sometime tomorrow as the system does contract south towards the Victorian border on Friday,” Bernasconi said.“That does not mean that the flood risk for this area is abating at the same rate with possible rises from the rainfall and downstream flooding [are] still being measured and being experienced.”The SES said on Thursday afternoon there were 149 active warnings, including 37 emergency warnings, and 48,000 people were isolated by flood waters.The SES said there had been 600 flood rescues and more than 4,600 calls for assistance. Emergency workers were continuing to assist people trapped by flood waters in Glenthorne, with helicopters, boats, and ground crews deployed.The disaster has affected essential services such as telecommunications.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Towns underwater. Farmers in NSW are facing ‘absolute devastation’Read moreThe NSW SES assistant commissioner, Dean Storey, said flood rescues teams, including 500 rescue boats and nine helicopters were active between the Hunter and Coffs Harbour, and more assistance was on the way.Major flooding was occurring on the Manning, Paterson, Hastings, Williams, Nambucca and Macleay rivers.“Although rainfall may be reprieving in some areas, we haven’t seen the end of renewed river rises in northern NSW and people should not become complacent,” he said.“More emergency warnings will likely be issued, and if you are asked to leave, please do so. Our volunteers and partner agencies are working around the clock, prioritising rescues and getting help to those who need it most, but we want people to leave if they’re asked to do so.”There are 15 evacuation centres open, including at Dungog, Gloucester, Taree, Wingham, Kempsey, Coffs Harbour and Port Macquarie.Lauren Edwards, the deputy mayor of the Port Macquarie-Hastings council told Guardian Australia several evacuation warnings had been issued for communities in the local government area, including in some low-lying parts of Port Macquarie such as Settlement Point.She said roads had been cut off and Short Street, one of the main streets in the heart of the coastal city, had been inundated.“It’s still unfolding here but unfortunately we have started to see the levels [of the Hastings River] come up to major flooding,” Edwards said.“There’s definitely a lot of evacuation orders now. SES has issued them for a range of locations now, more streets will close, the main northern street into Port Macquarie, the Hastings River Drive is cut off.“And of course our local government area is on both sides of the Hastings river so clearly we have communities quite affected now.”Mark Graham, a resident of Coffs Harbour, described persistent rainfall through “many, many hours of the night on Wednesday” on the back of months of saturated conditions. By Thursday afternoon he said several commercial premises and roads in the area had been inundated.The federal emergency management minister, Kristy McBain, said the commonwealth had activated the disaster recovery allowance for the Kempsey, Port Macquarie, Dungog and MidCoast council areas.McBain said climate change was driving more frequent disasters around the world.Evacuation centres have been opened at:Dungog RSL ClubClub GloucesterClub TareeManning Point Bowling ClubWingham RSLBulahdelah Golf ClubTuncurry Beach Bowling ClubKempsey ShowgroundPanthers Port MacquarieCoffs Harbour ClubSawtell RSL ClubNambucca RSL ClubOld Bar Bowling ClubWauchope ShowgroundCoopernook HallAustralian Associated Press contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsNew South WalesFloodingNatural disastersExtreme weathernewsShareReuse this content"

He looked out of his window to see the ship’s bow.“I went to the window and was quite astonished to see a big ship,” Helberg told the Guardian. “I had to bend my neck to see the top of it. It was so unreal.”View image in fullscreenJohan Helberg in front of the boat.Photograph: Joanne FielderThere were 16 crew members, among them Norwegians, Lithuanians, Ukrainians and Russians, on board the Cyprus-registered ship. There were no reports of injuries or oil spills. Police are investigating the incident and have identified one suspect on board the boat.“Normally ships turn left or right into the fjord. But this went straight ahead,” Helberg, who has lived in the house for 25 years, added. “It was very close to the house.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jan Langhaug/EPAPer Christian Stokke, a spokesperson for Trøndelag police district, told NRK: “There is one person on board the boat who has been identified as a suspect.”Police have interviewed the crew and are working on several theories, including technical failure and human error.The shipping company, North Sea Container Line (NCL), said the shipmate had been named a suspect but that it was a routine police procedure.NCL’s chief executive, Bente Hetland, said there was “no reason to believe this was intentional”.“Incidents like this should not happen, and we have started an investigation into the causes. Today, we are relieved that there were no injuries, and our main focus is on the people near the ship and our crew,” she added.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jan Langhaug/EPAThe ship remained stuck aground on Thursday after the first attempt to remove it was unsuccessful.

The individuals were later identified using images and videos published on social media.A court in Valladolid convicted the fans and sentenced them to one year in prison and fines of up to €1,620 (£1,364). The prison sentences were suspended on the condition that the defendants do not commit further offences and refrain from entering stadiums hosting official national competitions for the next three years.The ruling was hailed byLa Liga, which described it as an “unprecedented milestone in the fight against racism in sports in Spain”.Previously, courts had considered racist chants to be an offence against moral integrity, with race as an aggravating factor. “The fact that this ruling explicitly refers to hate crimes associated with racist insults reinforces the message that intolerance has no place in football,” it saidin a statementon Wednesday.The view was echoed by Real Madrid. In recent months, courts in Spain had handed down sentences over racist abuse at stadiums in Valencia, Palma de Mallorca, as well as Vallecas Stadium in Madrid, the clubsaid in a statement. The ruling from Valladolid, however, felt different. “On this occasion, the hate crime convictions represent a unique recognition of the offensive nature of these behaviours.”Vinícius, 24, has long been at theforefront of fightingracism in La Liga after being subjected to racist abuse at more than 10 Spanish grounds. Last year he laid bare the tollexactedby years of racist insults, saying the abuse was chipping away at his desire to play.In recent months his efforts have yielded progress. Late last year police in Spainarrested four menaccused of coordinating an online hate campaign against him. In 2023, four peoplewere arrestedover accusations of hanging an effigy of Vinícius from a Madrid bridge.In November he again addressed his fight against racism, describing it as a continuing battle that he was happy to take on,but addingthat he “can’t fight all that Black people have been suffering” alone.Luka Modric will leaveReal Madridafter the Club World Cup. The 39-year-old, who joined in 2012, has played almost 600 games for the club and won nearly 30 trophies, including a record six Champions League titles and four La Liga trophies.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was announced in response to Russia’s full-scale invasion ofUkrainein 2022 and is scheduled to reach full operational capacity by 2027.Merz said: “Together with our partners, we are determined to defend the alliance territory against any aggression. The security of our Baltic allies is also our security.”The deployment, unprecedented for the Bundeswehr, is aimed at shoring up the defence of Lithuania and its fellow Baltic republicsEstoniaand Latvia, former Soviet states that have become Nato and EU members and fear a Russian attack.At a news conference in Vilnius with Lithuania’s president,Gitanas Nausėda, Merz said “Russia’s aggressive revisionism” seeking to redraw the European map created grave security risks for the entire continent, not only Ukraine.View image in fullscreenFriedrich Merz takes part in a ceremony with members of Germany's 45th Armoured Brigade (Panzerbrigade 45) in Vilnius.Photograph: Paulius Peleckis/Getty ImagesMerz, the first chancellor to have served in the Bundeswehr, said: “We stand firmly by Ukraine but we also stand together as Europeans as a whole and we play, whenever possible, as a team with the US.”In the buildup to aNatosummit next month in The Hague, Merz said the alliance must “sustainably strengthen European defence capabilities and our defence industry must expand its capabilities – it has to produce more for Europe and produce more in Europe”.Nausėda thanked Merz for Germany’s show of support with the new combat unit formed at the request of Lithuania, which with its 2.9 million inhabitants borders Russia’s Kaliningrad exclave and Moscow-allied Belarus.He said: “We understand the threat and believe that we can face up to the threat with our allies,” noting that Lithuania planned to reach a new Nato goal of spending 5% of gross domestic product on defence by next year.Merz said Germany, as Europe’s biggest economy, would reach the same benchmark by 2032 based on a calculation of 3.5% of GDP for military procurement and 1.5% for infrastructure of military relevance including roads, bridges and ports.Merz’s muscular rhetoric has been welcomed by European partners as a continuation and expansion of theZeitenwende(turning point) in defence policy set out by his predecessor Olaf Scholz.View image in fullscreenMembers of the public look on during the ceremony in Vilnius on Thursday.Photograph: Alexander Koerner/Getty ImagesWhile Scholz’s centre-left-led government created a€100bn (£84bn) special fundto buy defence equipment and eventually met a Nato commitment of defence spending of 2% of GDP, Merz has moved torelease the constitutional debt braketo allow far more military investment.In his first significant speech to parliament last week, Merz vowed after years of neglect to build up Europe’s “strongest conventional army”.

In January, the Bundestag passed legislation to make the prospect more attractive, including more flexible working hours and increased allowances and overtime pay.Before Merz’s visit, Lithuania’s defence minister, Dovilė Šakalienė, told Germany’s Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper how crucial plausible deterrence towardRussiawas, sharing Pistorius’s assessment that Russia could be in a position to attack a Nato state within five years.She said: “Every Lithuanian knows: if the Russians come, no one will be spared.”Explore more on these topicsGermanyLithuaniaRussiaFriedrich MerzUkraineDonald TrumpNatonewsShareReuse this content"

As human-induced climate breakdown continues to raise global temperatures, the frequency of marine heatwaves is increasing.“This is unprecedented because it is happening so early in the year,” said Dr Manuela Truebano, from the school of biological and marine sciences at the University of Plymouth. “To see these temperature rises around UK waters at this time of year is quite sobering. Each time it happens we use the word ‘unprecedented’, and I am very concerned at the increase in prevalence and intensity of these marine heatwave events.”Temperatures in the sea off the south coast ofDevon, Cornwall and Ireland have risen by between 2C and 4C above average temperatures for this time of year.Dr Dan Smale, of the Marine Biological Association, said the usual springtime water temperatures would be 11C-12C, but the waters were now at absolute temperatures of 15C-16C.The UK is increasingly being hit by marine heatwaves, with sea temperatures in June 2023 reaching their highest levels since records began. At the time the warmingwas labelled as “unheard of”.Truebano said the rise in sea temperatures so early in the spring was even more concerning. The marine heatwave began in March and has continued for almost two months. If the sea temperatures continue to rise into the summer months there are fears of mass die-offs of fish and other marine life.Marine biologists say the impacts of the spring marine heatwave could be profound, including changes in the reproductive patterns of plankton, which in turn could lead to reductions in fish numbers later in the year.Smale said: “It is a concern that these warming events are happening more and more in the UK and Ireland. Traditionally UK waters have not been affected, but these events are starting to happen more frequently and the associated temperatures are increasing.“If this continues through the summer we would expect to see widespread biological impacts. This is a significant warming event.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

A2019 study foundthe number of heatwave days rose by more than 50% in the 30 years to 2016, compared with the period from 1925-54. Scientists said at the time the heat destroyed swaths of sea life “like wildfires take out huge areas of forest”.Dr Jonathan Tinker, a marine climate scientist at the Met Office, said: “With projections suggesting UK summer sea temperaturescould rise by up to 2.5C by 2050, such events are likely to become more frequent, intense and longer-lasting. Marine heatwaves offer a glimpse into how changing ocean conditions could shape future weather conditions.”Explore more on these topicsMarine lifeOceansClimate crisisFishDevonCornwallIrelandnewsShareReuse this content"

He visited the day after he was added to the UK sanctions list for “threatening, perpetrating, promoting and supporting acts of aggression and violence against Palestinian individuals”.The settlers set up a basic shelter next to a sheep enclosure with a small herd, which formed the base for a campaign of intimidation that began immediately.“I haven’t slept since they came, and the children are terrified,” said Ahmad Sulaiman, a 58-year-old father of eleven whose home was closest to the outpost.Born just a stone’s throw away, he had spent his life in Mughayyir al-Deir, but by Thursday he was packing to leave, although the family did not know where they would go.“The settlers told me: ‘This is our home’,” said Sulaiman. “There is nothing I can do. They have guns and other weapons.”Map of West BankThe intended deterrent effect of the UK sanctions was not visible at Mughayyir al-Deir, where settlers expanded their campaign of intimidation in the days after the British announcement, and the only public response from Israeli officials was a visit in support of the settlers.Zvi Sukkot, a member of the Knesset and the far-right Religious Zionist party, was filmed by activists as he left the illegal outpost. During a debate on Israel’s Channel 12 last week Sukkot said: “Everyone has got used to the idea that we can kill 100 Gazans in one night during a war and nobody in the world cares.”The hills nearby are surrounded by the burned remains of Palestinian villages, whose residents were forced out by campaigns run from similar Israeli outposts. But setting up such a short distance from the Palestinians being targeted is unprecedented.Yonatan Mizrachi, the co-director of Settlement Watch, part of the campaign group Peace Now, said settler outposts had been getting nearer to Palestinian communities since the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel, “but I don’t remember any others that were established so close”.“It shows the settlers’ lack of fear, and the understanding that they can do what they like; they can just set up in the Palestinian community. And they didn’t come to be good neighbours,” Mizrachi added.Sabah was indicted by Israeli authorities in September for his role in an attack on a school in Mu’arrajat East, where settlers targeted teachers, a 13-year-old pupil and the principal, who was hospitalised.Shai Parnes, a spokesperson for the Israeli human rights group B’tselem, said: “Israeli policy to take as much land as possible hasn’t changed. But what has been changing under this current government is the total impunity for soldiers and settlers.“They used to hide their faces or attack at night, everything is happening much more brutal and violent and it is happening in broad daylight. They are really proud about what they’re doing, sometimes even uploading the assaults themselves to social media.”Forced displacement began before the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel and the subsequent ongoing Gaza war, but hasintensifiedsince then. Around 1,200 Palestinians, nearly half of them children, have been forced to leave 20 communities, according to figures from B’tselem.It is a second displacement for families such as Sulaiman’s, who lived near what is now the Israeli city of Be’er Sheva until 1948. They were forced out in the nakba, or catastrophe, in which about 700,000 Palestinians were expelled from their homes in 1948 after the creation of Israel.View image in fullscreenAhmad Sulaiman says he hasn’t slept since the settlers arrivedPhotograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The GuardianIsrael’s military occupation of the West Bank began in 1967. Around 500,000 Jewish Israelis live in settlements there, all illegal under international law. Dozens of small makeshift outposts are also illegal under Israeli law – like the one set up in Mughayyir al-Deir – but authorities rarely try to remove them.Ben Pazi set up his own farm in the area east of Ramallah in 2018 and has been involved in attacks and land grabs in the area for many years, according to the British and US governments.Most use a combination of attacks on people, destruction of property and deployment of herds of sheep and goats to graze land where Palestinians have fed their flocks for decades.The US state department said in 2024, when sanctions were imposed on Ben Pazi under the Biden administration: “Ben Pazi has expelled Palestinian shepherds from hundreds of acres of land. In August 2023, settlers including Ben Pazi attacked Palestinians near the village of Wadi as-Seeq.” Donald Trump lifted those sanctions.Ben Pazi’s violence attracted the attention of Israel’s military commander for the region, Maj Gen Yehuda Fuchs, who issued an administrative order barring Ben Pazi from entering the West Bank in late 2023.Ben Pazi’s role in the campaign to force Palestinians out of Mughayyir al-Deir was unclear. He hung up when the Guardian called to ask for comment, and did not respond to further messages. The Guardian was unable to contact Sabah.Ben Pazi was a regular visitor to the new outpost, spending several hours there on at least three days this week, according to several Israeli activists who recognised him from work in the region.On one visit he was photographed greeting an unidentified man wearing a military-style uniform. A spokesperson for the Israeli military said the country’s armed forces did not authorise or organise the forced displacement of Mughayyir al-Deir.“The alleged evacuation was neither conducted by [IDF troops ] nor carried out with their approval,” a spokesperson said. Asked why the military did not remove the illegal outpost, they said any demolition would be a political decision.“Enforcement against unlawful construction in the area is undertaken in accordance with the priorities set by the political echelon and is carried out under its authorisation,” the spokesperson said.Ben Pazi drove a group of settlers and equipment to the edge of the village, where they started erecting a fence around land where Palestinians had lived and farmed for decades.Parnes, of B’tselem, said: “The international community have so much more to do in terms of directing steps towards the Israeli government.“What is happening is not just about a violent threat in this place or that; it’s all part of a well-defended and subsidised policy run by the government.”Explore more on these topicsIsraelWest BankPalestinian territoriesIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Israel has repeatedly said it will attack Iran’s nuclear sites, whileDonald Trumphas said the US will do so if the talks break down.View image in fullscreenA copy of the Iranian daily newspaper Javan featuring Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, and the US special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff.Photograph: Abedin Taherkenareh/EPAIn a letter to the UN, Araghchi said: “Iran strongly warns against any adventurism by the Zionist regime of Israel and will decisively respond to any threat or unlawful act by this regime.”He said Iran would view Washington as a “participant” in any such attack, and Tehran would have to adopt “special measures” to protect its nuclear sites and material from any attacks or sabotage. Araghchi said the UN nuclear inspectorate, the IAEA, would only be subsequently informed of such steps.An adviser to Iran’s supreme leader said in April that Tehran could suspend cooperation with the UN nuclear inspectors or transfer enriched material to safe and undisclosed locations.In a separate statement released on Thursday, Iran’s Revolutionary Guards said Israel would receive a “devastating and decisive response” if it attacked Iran.Alimohammad Naini , the guards’ spokesperson, said: “They are trying to frighten us with war but are miscalculating as they are unaware of the powerful popular and military support the Islamic Republic can muster in war conditions.”Iran’s supreme leader,Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said on Tuesday that US demands for Tehran to stop refining uranium were “excessive and outrageous”, his most unequivocal statement that Iran will not abandon the capacity to enrich. But he said he did not expect the talks with the US to succeed.The US special envoy, Steve Witkoff, has insisted that Washington’s red line is that Iran must end all uranium enrichment. In the 2015 deal with six world powers,from which Trump withdrew in 2018, Iran had been allowed to enrich to 3.67% purity, sufficient for producing fuel for commercial nuclear power plants.Iran has since enriched to 60%, bringing it close to the purity required to make a nuclear bomb. Araghchi initially said the US public demand for zero enrichment was not being repeated in private discussions, but the issue appears to have become the central battleground of the talks. The US says zero enrichment is the only way to end the risk of Iran acquiring a nuclear bomb and has suggested Tehran follows the model of the United Arab Emirates that imports uranium for its single civil nuclear program.But Iran says it has a right to enrich under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and argues there is no reason for it to be treated differently to other states.Explaining Iran’s determination to enrich domestically, as opposed to import, Ellie Geranmayeh of the European Council on Foreign Relations said: “Iran really does feel that it has paid a huge cost for its right to enrich on its own soil. It has not only paid billions in actually setting up the infrastructure, but it has paid billions in sanctions that were imposed on it and the loss of oil sales.“Iranian officials believe they have paid with blood, in reference to scientists that have been assassinated throughout the course of the last few decades working on this programme. This programme and the right for enrichment for civil nuclear purposes, has now become an issue of national pride.”Explore more on these topicsIranNuclear weaponsIsraelDonald TrumpAyatollah Ali KhameneiUnited NationsMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Laerke said aid groups were facing significant challenges distributing the aid because of insecurity, the risk of looting and coordination issues with Israeli authorities.However, the Palestinian Red Crescent said on Thursday that Palestinians in Gaza had yet to receive aid deliveries that had crossed over the border and that sending so few trucks was an “invitation for killing” because of the risk of mobbing.View image in fullscreenTrucks with humanitarian aid for Gaza wait at Israel’s Kerem Shalom crossing on 22 May.Photograph: Atef Safadi/EPA“I can prove that nobody has received [aid]. No civilian has received anything yet. In fact, say most of these trucks are still in Kerem Shalom at the border, inspected, but not into Gaza,” Younis al-Khatib, the president of the Palestine Red Crescent society, told reporters.“It’s very hard to hide the rush or the looting that will happen,” he added.Malnutrition is spreading in Gaza, medics and aid workers in the devastated Palestinian territory have warned for months, with aid distribution being hindered by displacement, bakeries operated by the UN World Food Programme shut due to a lack of cooking gas, and soaring prices for the limited amount of food available in shops and markets.“In the last couple of days we lost 29 children,” the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority health minister, Majed Abu Ramadan, told reporters, describing them as “starvation-related deaths”. He later clarified that the total included elderly people as well as children.1:24Aid trucks trickle into Gaza while airstrikes continue – video reportThe Palestinian Authority has partial control over the West Bank, which has been occupied by Israel since 1967, but Hamas has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007.Earlier this month,the IPC estimatedthat nearly 71,000 children under the age of five are expected to be “acutely malnourished”, with 14,100 cases expected to be severe over the next 11 months.Israel imposed the blockade on all supplies in March, saying Hamas was seizing deliveries for its fighters – a charge the group denies. Earlier this month, a global hunger monitor said that half a million people in the Gaza Strip face starvation.Abu Ramadan, who was mayor of Gaza City from 2005 to 2008, said that only seven or eight hospitals out of Gaza’s 36 were partially functioning, and that more than 90% of medical stocks were now at zero due to the blockade.“My information is that very few shipments went inside Gaza – 90 to 100 truckloads and in the south and mid zones.” Asked if there were any medical supplies among them, he said: “As far as I know … it’s only flour for bakeries.”UN agencies have said that the amount of aid entering Gaza falls far short of what is required to ease the crisis.Umm Talal al-Masri, 53, a displaced Palestinian in Gaza City, described the situation as “unbearable”.Hossam Abu Aida, 38, said: “I am tormented for my children.” He told AFP: “For them, I fear hunger and disease more than I do Israeli bombardment.”AFP footage showed bags of recently delivered flour at a bakery in the central city of Deir el-Balah, where workers and a host of machines began kneading, shaping, baking and packaging stack after stack of pita bread.The UN humanitarian aid organisation for children, Unicef, says more than 9,000 children have been treated for malnutrition in Gaza this year, and food security experts say tens of thousands of cases are expected in the coming year.Experts also warn the territory could plunge into famine if Israel does not stop its military campaign and fully lift its blockade, but the World Health Organization said last week that people are already starving.New data shared with the Guardian by the US-based Project Hope, which focuses on healthcare, one of the few humanitarian organisations still operating health clinics in Gaza, ‘‘found that malnutrition among children, pregnant and lactating women has surged amid the almost three-month aid blockade, with some clinics reporting up to 42% of pregnant women and 34% of lactating mothers being diagnosed as malnourished”.“Children are also increasingly affected,” according to a statement from Hope. “Our teams on the ground report that more and more families are relying on our clinics for nutritional supplements and that children visiting Project Hope clinics have gone for weeks only consuming high-energy biscuits and ready-to-use therapeutic food – items given to malnourished patients for short-term survival needs, rather than sustained nourishment.”Ghadeer, a nurse with Project Hope in Gaza, said: “The number of malnutrition cases has skyrocketed. Two months ago, malnutrition cases did not exceed 50 cases per day. Now, we’re seeing about 200 cases per day. Many of the children we see haven’t eaten real food in weeks – only the nutritional biscuits we distribute. They’re losing weight, becoming withdrawn, and getting sick more easily. We are doing everything we can, but we’re seeing the consequences of extreme hunger in an entire generation. Without more food and aid coming in, I fear for their future.”Meanwhile, plumes of smoke rose Thursday over the northern Gaza Strip where Israel’s military urged civilians to evacuate, as rescuers said Israeli strikes across the territory killed more than 50 people.Gaza’s civil defence agency said there had been “52 martyrs and dozens injured as a result of airstrikes carried out by the occupation” across the territory.The intensified Israeli offensive has drawn criticism, with EU foreign ministers agreeing on Tuesday to review the bloc’s cooperation accord with Israel.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsraelIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

They said the event sold out in 90 seconds, with 2,000 people on the waiting list.Ó hAnnaidh arrived on stage at 9pm with tape over his mouth.He said: “There’s a reason where what’s happened to me, happened before Glastonbury. There’s a reason they’re trying to fucking stop me speaking at Glastonbury in front of the UK.”Naoise Ó Cairealláin, 30, who performs under the name Móglaí Bap, said: “This is our first gig back after [Coachella]. They want to stop what we’re doing, because they want us to stop protesting.”“There’s 60,000 plus dead in Gaza right now. That’s the real story, it’s not about us,” he added.During their Coachella set on 18 April, the band led the crowd in chants of “free, free Palestine” and displayed various messages on the stage’s screens including: “Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people.”Ó hAnnaidh said on Thursday: “The reason that we are being witch-hunted here is because we at Coachella spoke about this about the genocide.“We’re not the fucking story here, they’re using us as a scapegoat not to talk about the real fucking issue.”The poster for Thursday’s surprise concert featured a recent quote from the former Sex Pistols frontman John Lydon, who said the trio “need a bloody good kneecapping” in response to the controversy around them.Last month, counter-terrorism police assessed footage of the band from November 2023 which appeared to show one person of them saying: “The only good Tory is a dead Tory. Kill your local MP.”Brendan Cox, the husband of MP Jo Cox, and Katie Amess, the daughter of MP David Amess, who were both murdered, criticised the trio’s comments.In a statement, the band said: “To the Amess and Cox families, we send our heartfelt apologies, we never intended to cause you hurt,” adding that the clip had been taking out of context.The band has been removed from several festival lineups, including scheduled German appearances at Hurricane festival and Southside festival.They were also axed from the Eden Project in Cornwall and Plymouth Pavilions.MPs have continued to call for them to be removed from the line-ups of TRNSMT, Glastonbury and other upcoming events. However, there were no announcements of further cancellations after the news of Ó hAnnaidh being charged.The group from Belfast, who rap in the Irish language, have a headline slot at Wide Awake Festival in Brockwell Park, south London, on Friday night.The band said they would vehemently contest what they called a politically motivated charge in a statement before the concert.“A charge not serious enough to even warrant their crown court, instead a court that doesn’t have a jury. What’s the objective? To restrict our ability to travel. To prevent us speaking to young people across the world. To silence voices of compassion. To prosecute artists who dare speak out.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Similarly, in 2014 less than 1% of local authorities in England had 10 or more vape shops, rising to 28% in 2024.The study, conducted by researchers atHealth Equity North, looked at Ordnance Survey data to track how amenities had changed between 2014 and 2024. The amenities were divided into those seen as “health promoting”, such as pharmacies, libraries and supermarkets, and “health reducing” such as vape shops, bookmakers, takeaways and alcohol-only outlets.They found a stark decline in healthier amenities, with unhealthy alternatives taking their place. Takeaway shops were up by almost a quarter (24%) across England, while the number of banks and building societies decreased by 40%, and supermarkets by 10%.The report found there were stark regional divides across England regarding high-street amenities, with twice as many vape shops in the north of England. The number of takeaways in the north of England rose by a third (31%), compared with a rise of 18% in the south.There were three times as many vape shops in deprived areas compared with the least deprived ones. Deprived areas also had 25 times more pawnbrokers and more than three times as many bookmakers.Dr Eman Zied Abozied, research associate at Newcastle University Population Sciences Institute, said the study showed that high streets were becoming “less healthy and welcoming places to visit”.“The disappearance of amenities such as supermarkets, banks, pharmacies and public toilets particularly affects groups such as women, children and the elderly,” she said. “But what we’re seeing impacts all of us. The deterioration of our high streets makes our centres feel less safe, less inviting, and ultimately makes us feel more disconnected as communities.”She added: “It is important that we act now to reverse this decline. If we involve local communities in making decisions about their high streets, we can make our high streets and towns more accessible and healthy for everyone.”Prof Clare Bambra, an academic co-director atHealthEquity North and professor of public health at Newcastle University, said: “Over the last decade, our high streets have been hit by a devastating succession of shocks – from the impact of austerity to the Covid-19 pandemic. They’ve also been hollowed out by changing spending habits, and the rising cost of living.“This trend has disproportionately affected the most deprived places in our country. The northern high street now has fewer places to go to buy essentials, as well as fewer supermarkets, public toilets and other amenities and resources. The north has twice as many vape shops as the south, as well as more takeaway outlets and bookmakers.“You should be able to walk down a high street, and feel the uniqueness, culture and identity of that community. Through innovative design, better public transport, and measures that promote people over cars, we can rethink these spaces so they become ‘go-to’s’ rather than ‘ghost towns’.”A government spokesperson said:“For years high streets have been starved of investment despite their potential to thrive, but we are taking decisive action to turn the tide through our Plan for Change.“Councils and local leaders have powers to tackle persistently vacant properties in city, town and village centres by putting the leases up for auction to help restrict the types of businesses that fill those lots.“We are driving regeneration and growth with £1.5billion through the Plan for Neighbourhoods to boost high streets, and we’re bringing empty shops back to life through our high street rental auctions.”Local authorities with the most vape shops per 10,000 people in 2024 in EnglandCity of London, London: 4.6Blackburn with Darwen, north-west: 1.7Preston, north-west: 1.6Blackpool, north-west: 1.2Bolton, north-west: 1.2Lincoln, East Midlands: 1.2Thanet, south-east: 1.2Chesterfield, East Midlands: 1.1Hyndburn, north-west: 1.1Derbyshire Dales, East Midlands: 1Explore more on these topicsCommunitiesInequalityHealthVapingGamblingPovertyEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The information provided since the session establishes that Karen Kneller omitted important information that would have provided a more accurate account of how the CCRC handled the Henley report.“As a result of our concerns regarding the performance of the CCRC and the unpersuasive evidence Karen Kneller provided to the committee, we no longer feel that it is tenable for her to continue as chief executive of the CCRC.”The committee also deemed justifications given by Kneller for her attendance atexpensive training courses in Franceusing public money to be unsatisfactory.The CCRC had “deteriorated significantly” and required root and branch reform, the report found. Criticisms included the current lack of a chair, for which it said the Ministry of Justice bore some responsibility; the CCRC’s struggle to secure a sufficient number of commissioners; and the move to fully remote working, which “is out of step with the rest of the public sector and seems unsuited to the nature of their work”.The committee said that while Henley’s review focused on one case, it had “significant implications for the CCRC’s overall approach to its casework. The mistakes made in relation to Andrew Malkinson’s application should have been taken as evidence of systemic problems within the CCRC.”Slaughter said: “For an organisation that is designed to identify failures within the criminal justice system, the CCRC’s leadership has shown a remarkable inability to learn from its own mistakes.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Falconer said the CCRC was “generally regarded as useless”.A CCRC spokesperson said it noted the committee’s recommendations, adding: “We look forward to an announcement on the appointment of an interim chair and to working with them in an organisation deeply committed to finding, investigating and referring potential miscarriages of justice.”Explore more on these topicsCriminal Cases Review CommissionUK criminal justiceEnglandWalesNorthern IrelandHouse of CommonsnewsShareReuse this content"

This feedback highlights the positive impact of our ongoing efforts.“We are committed to reviewing the specific issues raised by the Which? panel and will continue to strive for enhancements across all sites.

To every Labour MP reading the leaked memo in theDaily Telegraphsetting out the deputy prime minister’s alternative tax-raising measures, it felt like firing the starting gun on a race to succeed Keir Starmer as leader.It has infuriated Starmer loyalists because of long memories of the breakdown in relations afterLabourlost the Hartlepool byelection just a year into Starmer’s leadership, when he considered quitting and allies of Rayner encouraged her to stand against him. Starmer then attempted to demote her, leading to a fierce standoff and Rayner emerging with a clutch of new job titles.Relations have somewhat healed since then, but there is a feeling now that the deputy prime minister is once again seeming to try to capitalise on the party’s misfortunes – an allegation considered deeply unfair by those close to her.There is no doubt this memo setting out new ways ofraising taxes on wealthy peopleas well as a proposal to clamp down on benefits for migrants is a way of trying to show her broader appeal. “She’s trying to put clear water between her and Keir,” one senior source said.Sources close to Rayner say the suggestions made in the letters before the spring statement are par for the course, intended to be helpful ideas in Rayner’s capacity as deputy prime minister, for which she has her own mandate.They insist they were not documents intended to be leaked to show she has diverged from Starmer and Rachel Reeves on the economy, arguing that the Telegraph would not be their chosen vehicle were that the case.But plenty in No 10 and the Treasury see this as obvious manoeuvres. “Sorry but this is not normal,” one said.Supporters of Rayner have quietly been conducting unauthorised focus groups to find out how she would fare in the event of a leadership campaign. They say the results show she fares well with voters in terms of authenticity and compassion. What she needs to show is that she is a serious politician.Whether or not a Rayner ally was responsible for leaking the memo to the Telegraph, some close to her believe it will have helped. “We want to prove she’s serious; this is a serious memo,” said one.Others disagree. One Labour source joked that the policies looked as if they had been generated by ChatGPT.View image in fullscreenMany Labour figures believe the next leadership contest would come down to Angela Rayner against the health secretary, Wes Streeting.Photograph: Jon Super/APFor those who would like to see more bold thinking, Rayner’s challenge from the left within the cabinet is a good thing. Should Reeves follow any of these measures in the October budget, in which everyone expects taxes to rise, then Rayner can claim credit. If Reeves does not, Rayner has a credible argument that different choices could have been made.But there is little in the memo that argues for anything as bold as some MPs on the left have been pushing for, such as a big overhaul of the tax system.“I think all this does at the moment is help Keir,” said one MP who has been critical of the leadership. “Who is an alternative, given no one has any ideas? The question isn’t what candidate but why? This is more than a [communications] problem. It’s existential.”The deputy prime minister is by far the grassroots’ favourite for the top job and would have the sweep of trade union backing. Her popularity with members is significantly higher than that of her most obvious rival,Wes Streeting.Rayner urged Reeves to consider wealth tax rises before spring statementRead moreThose MPs who would like to see a woman succeed Starmer but have doubts about Rayner admit they have no obvious candidate. Reeves and Bridget Phillipson no longer have the widespread admiration they had in opposition.It is no secret that a significant contingent of cabinet ministers and MPs – far beyond the usual suspects on the left of the party – would like to see a radical economic reset after this month’s local election results.Even the Labour Growth Group, a contingent of loyalist MPs once mockingly called “the provisional wing of the Treasury”, have decried the current strategy as “stuck in an economic doom loop”.Some close to Rayner say she has been bruised by the scrutiny of her family during the row over the sale of her former council house. But they admit that should the opportunity arise, she would be almost certain to put herself forward for leader.“She is the de facto leader of the soft left,” said one. “She pretty much won’t have a choice.”Rayner is not the only one positioning herself for a future leadership bid. Many Labour figures believe the next leadership contest is likely to come down to her against Streeting, who is far to the right.Labour MPs point out that Streeting has been diligent in courting the ranks of new backbenchers. Despite his high-profile government position as health secretary, sources say he recently hosted a karaoke evening with backbenchers where he bought drinks, and he constantly checks in on MPs’ angst on the WhatsApp groups and in the tea rooms.“The next leadership will be either Wes or Angela,” said one Labour figure. “It will be head versus heart.”Explore more on these topicsAngela RaynerLabourLabour party leadershipKeir StarmerWes StreetinganalysisShareReuse this content"

Although their decision is not binding, the FDA usually takes their advice.Currently, the US has three Covid-19 vaccines approved – Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Novavax.Typically, the FDA advisory committee would recommend formulations for shots and whether they should be approved, with a separate advisory committee at the CDC creating recommendations for who should get the shots. Trump administration officials took the unusual step of announcing a policy change rather than seeking independent guidance from its own expert committees first.Prassad joined the FDA after the longtime vaccine headPeter Marks quit, citing Kennedy’s refusal to accept information that did not comport with his long-held opinions questioning vaccine safety.According to the CDC, the LP.8.1 strain, a subvariant of the JN.1 strain, accounted for 70% of total cases in the US over a two-week period that ended on 10 May.Covid-19 evolved less than in previous years, CDC microbiologist and immunologist Natalie Thornburg told the advisory committee. Most viruses currently circulating are descendants of the JN.1 virus variant, she said, though there is potential for that to be replaced. Wastewater in South Africa detected a new variant dubbed BA.3.2, which could indicate a shift in the virus. However, very few sequences of that variant have been identified globally.Government experts presenting to the committee emphasized that Covid-19 was still causing a significant number of deaths in the US. Hospitalization rates have declined overall since 2021-2022 but are highest among people older than 65 and children younger than six months old.Since October of last year, an estimated 30,000 to 50,000 people have died from the virus and between 260,000 and 430,000 have been hospitalized, according todata from the CDC.“When you add up those cumulative rates over a 12-month period, Covid-19 is still causing an enormous burden on the US health system,” said Ruth Link-Gelles, an epidemiologist with the CDC.Overall, almost all people in the US have experienced a Covid infection, meaning nearly everyone has some level of infection-induced immunity when vaccine efficacy was measured, but that immunity is believed to wane over time.Vaccine-induced immunity, in this context, should be viewed as an “added benefit”, according to a CDC epidemiologist presenting to the committee.Vaccine effectiveness could not be estimated for 2024-25 in children because of the low level of coverage and relatively low level of disease compared with earlier seasons. Last season had a lower overall rate of Covid hospitalization among children – though the youngest children notably had the worst hospitalization rates.Explore more on these topicsUS healthcareCoronavirusTrump administrationVaccines and immunisationnewsShareReuse this content"

Though the president has called the $Trump token “The Greatest of them all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”, nearly half the gala’s guests suffered losses from purchasing it, according to a Guardian analysis of their public cryptocurrency wallets.The attendees are winners of the US president’smeme coincompetition. Last month, Trump announced that the 220 crypto wallets with the largest holdings of $Trump between 23 April and 12 May would win a ticket to a private dinner at the Trump National golf club. The top 25 holders would also be invited to a “Private VIP Reception” with the president beforehand. The news caused the coin tospikemore than 50%.Buyers were ranked by their “time-weighted” holdings, which reached 11.3m coins – worth approximately $148m in total as of 12 May. Snapping up the coin propelled entrants to the top of the leaderboard. However, the Guardian’s analysis of crypto wallets on the Solana blockchain suggests that many have been burned along the way.Top buyers of Trump-sponsored crypto win exclusive dinner with presidentRead moreOf the 220 winners, 95 – some 43% – have suffered a net loss from purchasing $Trump since the coin’s January launch, a combined $8.95m, according to trading history and portfolios as of 21 May.A contestant under the username “GAnt” appears to have endured the biggest losses. Despite placing fourth on the leaderboard, buying the tokens has led to a $1.06m shortfall. Similarly, user “Meow” is down $621,000, despite achieving VIP status.This aligns with a broader trend: it’s believed that 764,000 wallets – mostly belonging to small holders – have lost money on $Trump, according to data from the cryptocurrency and blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis. Meanwhile, just 58 wallets have made more than $10m each on their purchases of the coin, per Chainalysis. The cryptocurrency is trading 68% below its all-time high when it peakedthe day before the president’s inauguration.About 40% of the gala attendees own less than one $Trump token. Among them are buyers who purchased the coin during its initial days of hype and then dumped it when the price hit its zenith. User “UVIL”, for example, profited more than $7m from the president’s coin, followed by “boop” and “Woo”, both earning more than $2m, respectively, according to the Guardian’s analysis. Dinner ticket winners shelled out between $55,000 and $37.7m to attend, with the price of one seat averaging out to $1m,according to datafrom the blockchain analytics company Nansen published by NBC.Attendees are thus not necessarily current owners of the Trump coins, but “people who pumped and dumped them”, said James Angel, a professor of financial regulation at Georgetown University. “It just shows that, when you elect a clown, you get a circus.”The coin definitely benefits the Trump family business, and it’s yet another way for [the president] to cash in on celebrityJames Angel, Georgetown UniversityThe Guardian’s calculations assume transfers in and out of wallets were sales at market prices from the time, although this is not possible to prove for all transactions.A presidential schemeThe Trump administration is not directly involved in administering $Trump. However, the president may profit from token sales and trading fees. Trump-affiliated entities – notably CIC Digital LLC and Fight Fight Fight LLC – issued the coin and own 80% of its supply, which will be gradually unlocked throughout his term. These entities also made $320m in trading fees as of 6 May, according to data from Chainalysis,publishedby CNBC.The Trump Organization did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The president lauding high-risk and opaque assets coincides with a wider easing of financial regulation. Until recently, the Securities and Exchange Commission viewed most cryptocurrencies as securities, not commodities. However, under new leadership, the regulator issuedguidancestating that meme coins are “akin to collectibles” and thus “neither meme coin purchasers nor holders are protected by the federal securities laws.” On that view, $Trump sales are not subject to the same disclosures required of stocks or bonds, nor would the president’s affiliates be considered unregistered issuers of securities.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Topping the leaderboard is Justin Sun, a Chinese-born crypto billionaire who founded the Tron blockchain. Sun waschargedin 2023 with market manipulation and offering unregistered securities, but the SECdroppedthe case in February.Trump’s cryptocurrency endeavor caps a political career filled with conflicts of interestRead moreCompanies with strategic policy incentives have also spent heavily to reach Trump. A cross-border logistics firm called Freight Technologies bought $20m worth of tokens, calling it “an effective way to advocate for fair, balanced, and free trade between Mexico and the US”, according to astatement. Adding to that is GD Culture Group, a small tech company that operates an e-commerce business on TikTok. GD, which has a Chinese subsidiary, announced announced a plan to purchase up to $300m worth of $Trump, the New York Timesreported, but did not specify whether that spending had begun.“The coin definitely benefits the Trump family business, and it’s yet another way for [the president] to cash in on celebrity,” says Angel. “But the real question is: is this in the best interest of the United States of America?”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpCryptocurrenciesnewsShareReuse this content"

Vehicles across the country are cleaner, more efficient and electric in greater numbers because of it.But that could all change ifDonald Trumpand hisRepublicanallies manage to revoke the state’s ability to set its own, stricter emissions standards amid a White House crusade to combat climate-friendly policies.The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)sets and updatesits own federal standards for all states on smog and emissions from cars and trucks, which the Biden administration made even stricter last year, saying they will save American drivers thousands in fuel costs and maintenance over the life of a vehicle.But for decades, California has beengranted the abilityto make those rules even stricter to help address some of theworst smog and air quality issuesin the nation, which are linked to ahost of health effectsthat disproportionately affect people of color.On Wednesday, the Senate voted to reverse the waivers, in move that prompted fury from Democrats who call it a “nuclear” option, calling it an unprecedented, and illegal, use of the statute. The Government Accountability Office and the Senate parliamentarian have agreed, saying EPA waivers are not subject to the review law.The House approved similar resolutions earlier this month. The resolutions now go to the White House, where Trump is expected to sign them.“This move will harm public health and deteriorate air quality for millions of children and people across the country,” said senators Alex Padilla, Sheldon Whitehouse and the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, in a statement.“This Senate vote is illegal. Republicans went around their own parliamentarian to defy decades of precedent. We won’t stand by as Trump Republicans make America smoggy again,” California’s governor,Gavin Newsom, said in a statement on Thursday. “We’re going to fight this unconstitutional attack on California in court.”Kathy Harris, the director of clean vehicles at the Natural Resources Defense Council, emphasized California’s ability to mandate strict emissions standards for cars, trucks and buses had existed for nearly 60 years, noting the state had been granted more than 75 waivers under Republican and Democratic presidents.Among the waivers include rules to increase the share of electric vehicles each year among all new car and truck sales, as well as mandates that auto companies introduce progressively cleaner vehicles.She described the waivers as a “quadruple win”, benefiting public health, air quality, drivers’ pockets and the economy as a whole.“These waivers are not new or novel,” Harris said in an interview. “California has historically been innovators in systems to help produce cleaner air and stymying California’s ability is a direct attack on our ability to limit pollution and health harming pollutants in the air.”View image in fullscreenGavin Newsom, the governor of California.Photograph: Rich Pedroncelli/APShe added revoking the waivers would immediately lead to an increase in pollution on the nation’s roadways.More thana dozen statesfollow California’s lead on emissions standards, according to the California air resources board. The standards now cover nearly 40% of new light-duty vehicle registrations and more than a quarter of heavy-duty vehicles like trucks across the entire US.Automakers have largely followed California’s emissions standards as well so they can continue to sell cars there, as the state equates to thefourth-largest economyon the planet.Newsom upped the ante in the nation’s environmental future in 2020, declaring his state would ban the sale of all new gas-powered vehicles by 2035. Eleven states have also joined California’s plan to ban the sale of new gasoline-powered cars by the 2035 deadline, a reality thathas spookedmajor car companies.Joe Biden’s administrationapproved the plan at the end of his term. Trump, however – a vehement opponent to many of the nation’s climate efforts – has vowed to see them reversed.“California has imposed the most ridiculous car regulations anywhere in the world, with mandates to move to all electric cars,” Trump said during his campaign last year. “I will terminate that.”Newsom on Wednesday cast the battle as a nail in the coffin for the American car industry and decades of public health advancements.“The United States Senate has a choice: cede American car-industry dominance to China and clog the lungs of our children, or follow decades of precedent and uphold the clean-air policies that Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon fought so hard for,” he challengedRepublicansin a statement. “Will you side with China or America?”The Senate’s decision may have sweeping effects far beyond the state’s borders.Harris said she recently pulled up pictures of what air quality looked like in cities around the country in the 1960s before the Clean Air Act, the seminal environmental law that regulates the nation’s air quality, was in effect. She described normal levels of smog in California as blanketing the statesimilar to the apocalyptic clouds of wildfire smokethat have descended during recent fire seasons.The American Lung Association also found last month thatLos Angeles remained the country’s smoggiest cityfor the 25th time in 26 years of tracking, despite decades of improvements in air quality.“I think we have forgotten about what our air used to look like,” Harris said. “We take it for granted because it’s a policy that’s been around for so long we don’t really recognize those direct benefits.“There is still a long way to go, we have not succeeded in fully cleaning up our air yet,” she added. “These types of policies help ensure we are moving in a positive direction.”Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaWest CoastUS politicsGavin NewsomDonald TrumpRepublicansnewsShareReuse this content"

Ive and Altman are worth backing, given the products they have overseen, but observers say they have set themselves an ambitious goal – one made all the more difficult by the legacy of Ive’s time at Apple.“It really will have to be amazing to prise people away from today’s screen-based devices,” says Martha Bennett, an analyst at Forrester Research.Bennett points to the failure of AI hardware devices such as Humane’s defunct AI “pin” – a small, wearable AI assistant thatreceived poor reviews– as an example of how the duo have a “steep hill to climb”. Ive described the Humane pin and the equally small-scale Rabbit R1 device as “very poor products”.So what was the prototype that Altman was testing? He has told employees thatOpenAIplans to build 100m AI “companions” that will be part of users’ everyday life, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday.The product will be “unobtrusive” and capable of being fully aware of a user’s surroundings and life, the paper report added, and it will be a third core device that someone will have on their desk after a MacBook Pro and aniPhone. The device is neither a phone nor a pair of glasses; Altman said Ive had been sceptical about building something to be worn on the body, according to the WSJ.The video indicated that the fruits of the io deal – a complex arrangement whereby Ive’s LoveFrom design company assumes design and creative oversight of OpenAI and io – will emerge next year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The paper also takes into account the energy consumption of chips used by other companies, such as Broadcom.The IEA estimates that all data centres – excluding mining for cryptocurrencies – consumed 415 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity last year. De Vries-Gao argues in his research that AI could already account for 20% of that total.He said a number of variables came into his calculations, such as the energy efficiency of a datacentre and electricity consumption related to cooling systems for servers handling an AI system’s busy workloads. Datacentres are the central nervous system of AI technology, with their high energy demands making sustainability a key concern in the development and use of artificial intelligence systems.By the end of 2025, De Vries-Gao estimates, energy consumption by AI systems could approach up to 49% of total datacentre power consumption, again excluding crypto mining. AI consumption could reach 23 gigawatts (GW), the research estimates, twice the total energy consumption of the Netherlands.bar chartHowever, De Vries-Gao said a number of factors could lead to a slowdown in hardware demand, such as waning demand for applications such as ChatGPT. Another issue could be geopolitical tensions resulting in constraints on producing AI hardware, such as export controls. De Vries-Gao cites the example of barriers on Chinese access to chips, which contributed to the release of theDeepSeek R1AI model that reportedly used fewer chips.“These innovations can reduce the computational and energy costs of AI,” said de Vries.But he said any efficiency gains could encourage even more AI use. Multiple countries attempting to build their own AI systems – a trend known as “sovereign AI” – could also increase hardware demand. De Vries-Gao also pointed to a US datacentre startup, Crusoe Energy, securing 4.5GW of gas-powered energy capacity for its infrastructure, with theChatGPTdeveloper OpenAI among the potential customers through its Stargate joint venture.“There are early indications that these [Stargate] datacentres could exacerbate dependence on fossil fuels,” writes De Vries-Gao.On Thursday OpenAI announced the launch of a Stargate project in the United Arab Emirates, the first outside the US.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The EU AI Act requires AI companies to disclose the energy consumption behind training a model but not for day-to-day use.Prof Adam Sobey, the mission director for sustainability at the UK’s Alan Turing Institute, an AI research body, said more transparency was needed on how much energy is consumed by artificial intelligence systems, and how much they could save by helping to make carbon-emitting industries such as transport and energy more efficient.Sobey said: “I suspect that we don’t need many very good use cases [of AI] to offset the energy being used on the front end.”Explore more on these topicsGreen economyArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingEnergyChatGPTnewsShareReuse this content"

Trials showed the drugs can help people lose significant amounts of weight, withmany seeking private prescriptions.US-listed WeightWatchers, which once boasted TV talkshow host Oprah Winfrey as one of its top shareholders, has seen its shares lose 82% of their value so far this year.Winfrey, who had been the public face for the diet company since 2015, announced in February last year she wasleaving WW and giving away all her shares, shortly after she revealed that her recent weight-loss was due to taking anti-obesity drugs.Obesity experts have called on the NHS toaccelerate the use of weight-loss jabsto tackle the obesity crisis, which is linked to numerous long-term conditions including cancer, heart disease, dementia and diabetes, and also puts a huge strain on the health service.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As such, his first and only chance to work with his team for an extended period of time before the start of the 2026 World Cup will present all kinds of challenges.Pochettino is, in effect, playing a game of chess without several of his key pieces. He will just have to imagine how they fit into the larger strategy later on.Pochettino names predecessor’s son in USMNT squad as Pulisic steps backRead moreStar Milan forward and captain Christian Pulisic asked to sit the tournament out in order to take his first extended rest since the summer of 2023. If Pulisic plays 48 more minutes in Milan’s Serie A season finale against Monza on Saturday, he will have surpassed hiscareer highof 3,589, which he set only last season.Fulham full-back Antonee Robinson, likewise, will sit out the summer after dragging his battered body through the last few months of the Premier League season, mostly skipping practices and saving himself for the games. Robinson has already posted his fourth straight season of at least 3,000 minutes.“I think it is the best decision in that case to give a rest,” Pochettino said in a press conference on Thursday. “When you assess all the circumstances, not only for Christian but for different players, [it is] the best decision thinking for the principal objective, which is the World Cup.”Also absent fromthe 27-man preliminary Gold Cup rosterare four regulars involved in the Club World Cup, to be held in the United States, and which supersedes national team duty during a time of year typically reserved for international soccer. Juventus players Weston McKennie and Tim Weah and Borussia Dortmund’s Gio Reyna will be with their clubs, rather than their nation. Club América winger Alex Zendejas, who was long overdue for a look under Pochettino on account of his strong form in Liga MX, will instead be tied up by aClub World Cup play-in gameagainst LAFC for the final berth at the tournament.These difficulties in roster construction are something of a parable for the overscheduling and overuse of the modern player, forcing the national team head coach to consider how his decisions this summer will contribute to his players’ fitness a year from now.‘July BBQ written all over it’: Do US Soccer’s new kits hit the mark?Read more“The demands today are so high, the level that they need to perform and the demand in all the areas are affecting the physical condition and the mental,” said Pochettino. “It’s a big season, a long season, traveling, playing competing Wednesdays, Sundays. We need to consider 10, 11 months of competing.”But he insisted that there is opportunity in these absences for a team who have long had much of their starting lineup written in Sharpie, having settled into an ossified hierarchy after a promising pack of young players was anointed as a golden generation.“It’s true that it’s possible to miss an opportunity to have all the players that maybe you have in your head thinking in one year,” Pochettino said. “But at the same time, it’s so exciting to see different players, young players, players that are going to make their debut in the national team – people that maybe can challenge different names that everyone considers are maybe going to the World Cup.”An influx of fresh players will hope to aid in the correction of the national team’s recent course. The US lookeddismal and uninterestedin their March outing in the Concacaf Nations League, recording consecutive losses to Panama and Canada in a tournament they had previously won three straight times. “We need to send a signal to our fans [about] the team that we want to be in the next year before the World Cup,” Pochettino said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Pochettino has dropped several experienced players in striker Josh Sargent, midfielder Tanner Tessmann and defenders Cameron Carter-Vickers and Joe Scally. Midfielder Yunus Musah is away from the team dealing with a personal issue after a disappointing campaign with Milan.The US men’s national team aren’t just underachievers; they’re unlikeable | Beau DureRead moreWhile much of that turnover was forced on him, Pochettino is also messaging a demand for more professionalism.“What we want to create in our national team is people desperate to come but desperate to come toperform,” he said. “We only have time to train one, two, three times; play; compete. One, two recoveries, and play. And then go home and maybe wait two months to be all together [again]. If you want to arrive to the camp, and you want to spend a nice time, play golf, go for a dinner, visit my family, visit my friends – and that is the culture we want to create? No, no, no, no, no. What we want to do is be focused and spend all my focus and energy on the national team. We need to create this culture about winning and to chase our aim. If we want to be good in one year’s time, we need to think that today is the most important day.”In the last World Cup cycle, the USMNT cultivated and celebrated an intense closeness. The team, it seemed, got along famously and it led to an admirable performance in Qatar. Now, Pochettino would like to see more intensity among positional rivals, a realization that every camp might be any player’s last.With several jobs in the starting lineup vacant this summer, the US hopes to gain in mentality what it is losing in talent.Leander Schaerlaeckens is at work on a book about the United States men’s national soccer team, out in 2026.

The seven-time world champion was speaking after a private screening of the forthcoming film F1: The Movie, held on Wednesday night in Monte Carlo, on which he was a producer and an adviser.“At the beginning you see all the different logos for the different production houses and my one comes out, which I worked on for so long, which is Dawn Apollo and it was just amazing to see that,” he said. “This has gone in very high. Couldn’t go any higher for my first movie but we will be producing more movies in the coming years. I’ve got three concepts that I’m writing. But I’m going to write with a writer.Red Bull confident Verstappen’s Imola win will be a turning point in F1 seasonRead more“I’ve got these concepts, at least two of them will be animations and one of them we’re in the phase of the first part of a script already, so it’s exciting. Then there will be documentaries, there will be TV series at some stage, but mostly movies. I love movies.”In Monaco before this weekend’s grand prix, Hamilton also admitted he had been concerned about the reaction of his fellow drivers when they were shown the film for the first time at the private screening.“Yesterday all the drivers are there. I sat in the middle and I was nervous. Everyone is seeing it for the first time,” he said. “It was great to look around and see some of the reactions. Particularly the drivers, you know. I really care what the drivers think and I wanted them to think highly of it.“I mentioned to them afterwards, you know I welcome your honest opinions about it.

All the drivers apart from Verstappen and Aston Martin’s Lance Stroll did go to the screening. Verstappen said he informed F1 in advance he wanted time with his family.“I just wanted to spend more time at home,” said Verstappen, who has just had a baby with his partner, Kelly Piquet. “It was just my private time and I prefer to spend that private time at home, especially because inFormula Oneyou’re away from home so much already.“Wanting to spend more time at home on days like that is pretty normal.

While Tottenham face an awkward calculation – weighing up whether the delirium of a first European trophy in 41 years offsets their worst league season in terms of proportion of games lost – for Manchester United the equation is far starker.Ruben Amorim will only play in one way. He is committed absolutely, uncompromisingly, irrevocably to the 3-4-2-1. Liverpool considered him, looked at their squad, realised the two things did not go together, appointed Arne Slot and won the league. Manchester United looked at their squad, flinched at the horror, and seem to have reasoned it was such a mess that it was impossible to find a manager whose philosophy would fit. There wasa dissenting voice, Dan Ashworth, but at the court of Sir Jim Ratcliffe, reasoned doubts are as unwelcome as a free lunch.Spurs prevail with Mourinho blueprint and ultra pragmatism in baffling final | Jonathan WilsonRead moreThis is where Ratcliffe deserves credit. Where nobody else could see a pattern, he found one. It turns out this squad does have a unifying theme, and the appointment of Amorim uncovered it: what linked this disparate group of players, cobbled together under five permanent managers over 11 years, is that none of them can play 3-4-2-1.TheEuropa League finalwas a mesmerisingly dreadful game of football. An average of 52 seconds elapsed between every pass Tottenham completed, and yet they still won with relative ease. Almost every one of the handful of chances United made – notably the Rasmus Højlund effort cleared off the line by Micky van de Ven and the second-half header Bruno Fernandes put wide – was the result of a Spurs error.Amad Diallo offered some invention in the first half but faded in the second. There was one little burst from Alejandro Garnacho. And that was it. With 72% possession, United were left to rely on individual inspiration from young forwards and Tottenham mistakes.It turned outEuropa Leagueform – United were unbeaten in European competition until Wednesday – was deceptive. Casemiro and Harry Maguire may thrive when there is a little more time on the ball, but up against Premier League opposition again, they struggled as they have all season.View image in fullscreenBruno Fernandes (centre) and Rasmus Højlund were unable to find inspiration in Bilbao.Photograph: Phil Duncan/Every Second Media/ShutterstockThe mind inevitably goes back to a comment Fernandes made after United had narrowlybeaten Ipswich in February: Amorim, he said, had been shocked by how good a newly promoted side threatened by relegation could be. There are no Estrela Amadoras or Gil Vicentes in English football; the Premier League is relentlessly demanding in a way no other competition in the world is. The league may have clear financial stratifications but its wealth means the level even at the bottom end is, by global standards, extremely high. Which is, if course, how United and Spurs ended up in the Europa League final in the first place.And so United are faced with a dilemma. If they persist with Amorim, the squad will need a complete and total overhaul. Of the team who played in Bilbao, how many could be of use in a 3-4-2-1? Lenny Yoro and Patrick Dorgu, probably. Diallo, perhaps. Mason Mount and Fernandes, maybe, although neither offered much evidence on Wednesday night.That level of makeover will require hundreds of millions of pounds that United simply do not have. The way Ratcliffe has been speaking, there would not have been vast sums available even if United had been in the Champions League. Without any European football at all, budgets will be tight. And besides, which self-respecting player now would want to join United?The only reason to go to Old Trafford is for the surge players get when they leave: Scott McTominay will win Serie A if Napoli beat Cagliari on Friday; Marcus Rashford has been rejuvenated at Aston Villa; Antony can’t stop scoring brilliant goals for Real Betis and either he orJadon Sanchowill lift the Conference League next week. The contrast with Kobbie Mainoo, young goalscoring hero oflast season’s FA Cup finaltransformed into peripheral figure, is unavoidable.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That option is no longer available to them. This will be a long, slow rebuild. Barring astonishing public funding, a new stadium that might increase revenues will itself be a drain on resources.So the question United now face is clear: do they place their faith in Amorim, slowly build a squad that can play his way, accepting many of their first-choice signings may no longer be available to them, or do they make the switch and turn to a more flexible manager who may be able to elevate this squad.The problem there is that almost nobody seems to want to stay. Amorim and Fernandes both said that they would be prepared to leaveif it is in the best interests of the club, the manager even offering to go without a payoff, which does not seem like the most complicated diplomatic code to crack. Garnachodescribed the season as “shit”and hinted he would be open to offers and Luke Shaw said every player had to ask themselves whether they really want to be there. Frankly, why would anybody?For United, the question is how much they believe in Amorim. Because if he is going to fix things, it is not going to be quick.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedRuben AmorimEuropa LeagueFootball tacticsJim RatcliffecommentShareReuse this content"

In the early going of his time with the Mets, Soto has been the subject of a handful of viral stories, ranging from the mundaneto the bizarre. None of them have been positive. Last Sunday, Soto did not hustle out of the box on a ground ball up the middle, and his casual trot to first base cost him a chance at an infield hit, in the eighth inning of a tied game against the crosstown rival Yankees. The very next night, Soto jogged out of the box on a fly ball at Fenway Park that he thought was a home run. It was not, and another news cycle about Soto’s effort followed. “I think I’ve been hustling pretty hard,” he told reporters.Elsewhere, rumors flew around the internet last week that Soto had an arrangement with the Mets to fly to road games on a private plane, separate from his teammates.That was made up; Soto flies with his teammates, just like every other player in the league. Michael Kay, a broadcaster for the Yankees – who Soto ditched for the Mets in free agency after one year – added fuel to the fire on his radio show. Kay, citing conversations with “people on the Mets side” of the rivalry (Grimace?),saidthat Soto had been “very, very glum around the clubhouse” in Queens. He had wanted to remain a Yankee, Kay said, before family pushed back and urged him to sign with the Mets. (Nobody has substantiated any of Kay’s reporting.)Soto’s results in the batter’s box have induced a bit of anxiety, too. In mid-April, Soto was so downtrodden that Mets fans greeted him for a run-of-the-mill at-bat with a standing ovation, hoping their support would lift him up. How bad had Soto been to that point? Well, his adjusted on-base plus slugging percentage (OPS+) was 118, meaning he was “only” 18% better than the league average hitter to date. In Soto’s career up to this year, his adjusted OPS was60%better than average.Pete Rose returns to the Hall conversation as baseball embraces his original sinRead moreFor Soto, those few weeks of being a well above-average hitter rather than a great one must have been like torture. Even now, Soto’s OPS+ of 134 through Tuesday’s game has not quieted much of the anxiety around him. Soto’s first 49 games haven’t felt like a fairytale, even as the Mets have raced to one of the best records in baseball (their form, and batting, have slumped in the last week). But perhaps anyone feeling tense about Soto should take a wider lens: Soto’s first seven weeks with the Mets have been good, not great, but he had dozens of less productive spans over his first seven big league seasons. 2025 hasn’t even been his slowest start by OPS; that was 2022, when Soto posted a .795 OPS (compared to this year’s .815) over the season’s first 48 games.And what did Soto do that year? Well, what he does every year: He made the National League All-Star team and won a Silver Slugger in the outfield, putting up a typically elite year split between the Washington Nationals and San Diego Padres. In other words, the solution to any anxieties about Soto’s opening stint as a Met is simple: Everyone should just calm down for a few months. As the club’s owner, Steve Cohen,posted this week on X: “Welcome to the ups and downs of a baseball season.”View image in fullscreenJuan Soto is greeted by home fans on his return to Yankee Stadium.Photograph: Sarah Stier/Getty ImagesSoto has damned himself to a lifetime of enormous expectations, and he has 765m reasons to suck it up and deal with it. But Soto has been so consistently good for so long – and is still so young – that he is graded on an outrageous curve. Soto posted at least an OPS+ of 140 in each of his first seven big league seasons, something that only Albert Pujols and Ted Williams have done while qualifying for the batting title in each of those years. (Soto missed qualification by a few at-bats as a teenager in 2018.)It isn’t just that Soto delivers year in and year out, but that his 26-year-old body and his approach to hitting make it seem so implausible that he would ever struggle. Soto has never played fewer than 150 games in a full major league season, save for his rookie year (when he was a midseason callup) and the shortened 2020 campaign. Soto has a slugger’s frame but not such a big one that he looks like he is likely to break down anytime soon. And so little of his success at the plate owes to luck or variance. Soto may have the keenest eye for pitches of any hitter who has ever lived. Plate discipline isn’t just about letting unfavorable pitches go, but about destroying meaty ones, and Soto has mastered both of those skills.And, indeed, a look under the hood suggests that Soto will soon revert back to his normal, elite self, instead of being the merely very good hitter he has been so far as a Met. Soto’s batted-ball statistics,tracked in Statcast, look a lot like they do every year: He’s hitting the ball hard, laying off balls better than practically anyone else, and holding a top-five walk-to-strikeout ratio in Major League Baseball.Soto is also playing in New York, an atmosphere for athletes only a little less hostile than the surface of Venus. The rumors and behindbacks that have circulated around him are also part of playing in the city, where the slightest dip in form will be endlessly debated in the press. That wasn’t really a problem when Soto was with the Yankees and everything was going well. But now he is struggling a little, all while walking away from a team who are not used to being jilted, and signing a contract worth nearly $1bn. It would be understandable if he’s feeling the pressure a little, all while adjusting to a new clubhouse and teammates.Does that mean any concern about Soto is fantastical? Certainly not. He has looked uncharacteristically unsure of himself at times at the plate this season – on Wednesday against the Red Sox he struck out twice in his first two bats without offering a swing, his excellent eye seeming to desert him.While he’s nowhere near there yet, even the greatest hitters will eventually decline, and Soto won’t be an exception. His defense in right field has drawn mixed reviews from various metrics during his career. This year, numbers place Soto somewhere between “very bad” and a bit below average in the field. He’sdead lastamong right fielders in Outs Above Average and has posted a Defensive Runs Saved total of negative-1. Yankees fans surely enjoyed Sotofailing to get to a sinking fly balloff Aaron Judge’s bat last weekend. It’s possible that as Soto ages further into his contract, his defense will become a more substantial liability and cut into his value.That’s not likely to be a major 2025 problem, however, and it speaks to Soto’s excellence that a solid start by almost anyone else’s standards has prompted doubts. The Mets are just a shade behind the Philadelphia Phillies in the NL East, and their early success has come despite a handful of difficulties – an injured starting rotation, a slow start for now-rounding-into-form closer Edwin Díaz, and Soto not yet operating to his usual standard. Soto is only 2% of the way into his 15-year contract. It’s just a matter of time until he shows why the Mets invested their future in him.Explore more on these topicsNew York MetsMLBBaseballUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A home game against relegated Leicester looks to offer the perfect opportunity but the closing stretch has been tough for Andoni Iraola’s side, with the past 12 league games producing only two victories. Remarkably, a three-game league form table puts Leicester in fourth after home wins over Southampton and Ipswich either side of a 2-2 draw at Nottingham Forest. Perhaps this won’t be the walkover most are expecting, and there could be a wistful feeling in the air at the Vitality on Sunday afternoon. No one can deny it has been a strong season but what a party it might have been. With Dean Huijsenoff to Real Madridand Milos Kerkez linked heavily with the champions, Liverpool, how many of the goodbyes on the traditional end-of-season lap of honour will be permanent?David TindallBournemouth v Leicester, Sunday 4pm (all times BST)View image in fullscreenDean Huijsen will join Real Madrid this summer and Milos Kerkez could also depart Bournemouth.Photograph: Graham Hunt/ProSports/Shutterstock2A role for Rodri at Fulham?It is unlikely Manchester City’s season would have been so underwhelming had Rodri not suffered that serious knee injury against Arsenal. Pep Guardiola’s side have suffered without the assurance provided by the best midfielder in the league. No one has been able to step up in his absence. Opponents have run through City, leaving them in danger of missing out on Champions League qualification. They need a result against Fulham on the final day and Guardiola has problems in midfield before the trip to Craven Cottage. Mateo Kovacic is suspended after his red card against Bournemouth, so how does Guardiola adjust? He used Bernardo Silva and Kevin De Bruyne in deeper roles in the FA Cup final but that seems like an unsuitable solution for a tricky away game. Is this a moment for Nico González, short on Premier League experience, or the wily but ageing Ilkay Gündogan? Maybe it is time for Rodri. The Spaniard made a late cameo off the bench against Bournemouth, but putting him in the starting XI now would be a risk given his lack of football. Rodri may not be ready to start, but Guardiola may need him to make a big impact off the bench.Jacob SteinbergFulham v Manchester City, Sunday 4pm3Potter stares down a tough summerA tough sell of a match for neutrals, with Ipswich’s relegation long sealed and West Ham’s campaign raising few cheers once relegation was avoided. There is, though, public affection at stake, particularly for Graham Potter, who has remained something of a stranger to Hammers fans. Four wins in 18 matches since taking charge is the worst return since Avram Grant took the club down in the 2010-11 season. Potter’s downbeat persona has been mirrored by passive performances from his team and his record is now worse than that of Julen Lopetegui, the manager he replaced in January. Winning atManchester United, a result that used to make up for an indifferent season, has provided no fig leaf. Lose at Ipswich, who have won once at Portman Road in the league all season, and Potter faces a summer of doubts. Kieran McKenna, despite Ipswich’s struggles, retains the club hierarchy’s faith and will be looking for a positive send-off down the chute to the Championship.John BrewinIpswich v West Ham, Sunday 4pm4A party in every corner of AnfieldFew would have predicted Crystal Palace’s visit as the precursor to the 2025 Community Shield back in August, but unexpected silverware ensures all sections of Anfield will be in full-on party mode on the final day. Liverpool can hardly deny they have been on the beach since wrapping up the title four weeks ago. They have been merrily advertising the fact all over social media, popping in for two defeats and a draw in between their jollies to Ibiza and Dubai. Wayne Lineker’s new mate, Arne Slot, can hardly complain at the downturn. It is difficult to imagine Oliver Glasner hanging out with Gary’s playboy brother and there were no signs of a hangover when Crystal Palace surfed an FA Cup-winning waveagainst Wolves on Tuesday. The main event comes after the final whistle, of course, when Liverpool get to lift the league championship trophy in front of their own supporters for the first time in 35 years. But what reception awaits Trent Alexander-Arnold this time?Andy HunterLiverpool vCrystal Palace, Sunday 4pmView image in fullscreenLiverpool and Crystal Palace fans have a game to get through at Anfield before the serious business of trophy parades can begin.Photograph: Nick Potts/PA5United’s new dawn still in the distanceThe good news for Ruben Amorim is that he retains Manchester United’s backing despite overseeing Wednesday’s pathetic 1-0 Europa League final defeat to Tottenham. The bad tidings are these: his team may not yet have hit rock bottom as Sunday’s visitors,Aston Villa, are a formidable proposition who arrive firmly in the hunt for a Champions League place. A 19th league defeat of the season, and an ignominious finish in 17th place, are very much possible. Given the club’s dismal transfer market record over a decade or more, the beleaguered Portuguese coach could be about to endure a long summer. The darkest hour is supposedly before dawn but it may only be 3am at Old Trafford.Jamie JacksonManchester United v Aston Villa, Sunday 4pm6Pickford fired up by Black Cat loyaltiesMight Jordan Pickford prove a one-man human barrier blocking Newcastle’s route to the Champions League? Much as he loves life atEverton, the England goalkeeper will always adore Sunderland, the club he supported as a boy and where he began his career. Newcastle fans routinely barrack Sunderland old boys but their dislike of Pickford not only elevates such rivalry to a new level, but often seems to bring the best out in a keeper boasting high-calibre footwork his Newcastle counterpart Nick Pope must envy. Should Pickford’s saves send Eddie Howe’s side to the Europa League next season, he will revel in being the toast of Wearside. If Everton’s outfielders may not be quite as motivated, David Moyes has fashioned an obdurate side and Howe will be hoping that Alexander Isak overcomes groin trouble in time to start. If so, it could be a case of Sweden striker v England goalkeeper.Louise TaylorNewcastle v Everton, Sunday 4pmskip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sunday is far more important to club and manager than next Wednesday’s Conference League final against Real Betis in Wroclaw. Nottingham Forest are still fighting for a Champions League spot and the City Ground will be baying for blood, which will ask severe questions of a visiting unit that wilted under similar conditionsat Newcastle. The Chelsea ownership can ill-afford to be absent from the Champions League for three successive seasons, no matter what other continental baubles might be collected, and despite their presence in the summer’s Fifa Club World Cup bonanza. Forest can still make it into the top five and have nothing to lose. That, and the looming, occasionally provocative presence of the owner, Evangelos Marinakis, makes them a prospect to fear for any shrinking violets.JBNottingham Forest v Chelsea, Sunday 4pmView image in fullscreenEnzo Maresca’s first season as Chelsea manager may be defined by Sunday’s result at the City Ground.Photograph: Paul Childs/Action Images/Reuters8Saints audition for promotion challengeSt Mary’s hosts the most meaningless of all the weekend’s meaningless games.Southamptonwill finish bottom regardless, and barring an improbable drubbing that damages Arsenal’s net goal difference, Mikel Arteta’s side have the runners-up slot in the bag. The big talking point for Saints fans is the impending appointment of Will Still as manager, who could be in situ by Sunday. The highly regarded 32-year-old coach has a fondness for high pressing, intelligent running and fast transitions, none of which have been in great evidence this season, though Still should be able to get a better tune out of Southampton’s players than Ivan Juric and his more uncompromising “death metal” football. An outing against the second-best team in England offers a useful audition for those who fancy getting stuck into a promotion challenge next term after this wasted season.Tom DaviesSouthampton vArsenal, Sunday 4pm9Brighton should prosper at Spurs partyExpect an air of cognitive dissonance at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Sunday as Spurs mark their probable lowest finish of the Premier League era with a post-Europa League party. Festivities will inevitably be accompanied by speculation that this might still be Ange Postecoglou’s last match in charge. That will not be influenced by the result and performance here, which don’t greatly matter. Brighton, by contrast, still entertain hopes of joining Spurs in European competition next season. A point here will secure eighth place for Fabian Hürzeler’s side, which might secure a Conference League place depending on aconvoluted combination of other results, including next Wednesday’s Conference League final between Chelsea and Betis. Brighton were excellent against Liverpool on Monday and will arrive in north London in good form and spirits. As we have seen this week, they are simply a better team than Spurs and should wrap up that top-eight place here.TDTottenham v Brighton, Sunday 4pmView image in fullscreenBrighton could end up celebrating European football next season if they spoil Spurs’ party.Photograph: Daniel Hambury/EPA10Wolves have found bite but what next?After 19 games of thisPremier Leagueseason, Wolves were in a perilous position. They had managed only 16 points and were a point and a place above the drop zone. But since the halfway mark their transformation has been notable. Talk of relegation vanished a long time ago. The second-half-of-the-season table shows Wolves in a fairly healthy 13th. They have totted up the same number of wins as Arsenal and Nottingham Forest (eight) and their points tally (25) in that period is on a par with mid-table sides like Fulham and Bournemouth. The decision to bring in Vítor Pereira after the 2-1 home loss to Ipswich in December has been fully justified and across March and April they secured a club record six Premier League wins a row. The team has wobbled since but victory over Brentford on Sunday will complete a satisfactory campaign. What happens next is uncertain, though. Can Wolves become a team good enough to challenge for a European spot or will next season prove sticky again, with their star attacker Matheus Cunha set to move on and other prize assets, such as Rayan Aït-Nouri, linked with moves away?DTWolves vBrentford, Sunday 4pmPosTeamPGDPts1Liverpool3745832Arsenal3734713Man City3726684Newcastle3722665Chelsea3720666Aston Villa379667Nottm Forest3713658Brighton374589Brentford3795510Fulham3725411AFC Bournemouth37105312Crystal Palace3705213Everton37-34514Wolverhampton37-154115West Ham37-184016Man Utd37-123917Tottenham Hotspur3723818Leicester37-452519Ipswich37-442220Southampton37-5912Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTen things to look out for this weekendBournemouthManchester CityWest Ham UnitedLiverpoolEvertonChelseafeaturesShareReuse this content"

But who is this left-field thinker who dispatched his young goalkeepers to undergo professional boxing training, spend hours performing acrobatics on trampolines and talk intensely to sports psychologists? Régis Le Bris eventually became Lorient’s first-team manager in 2022 but, after a promising opening season, the Breton team were relegated from Ligue 1 last spring. No matter; a month on from that chat with Meslier in North Yorkshire,Sunderlandnamed Le Bris as their head coach and, now, the 49-year-old is preparing to lead the club out at Wembley on Saturday.Along the way the self-confessed “average” Rennes defender turned academically inclined youth coach – he holds a doctorate in human physiology and biomechanics and a psychology diploma – has delighted in trampling on convention. Unusually, a man who began learning English in 2022 arrived on Wearside alone and was happy to work with Sunderland’s coaching staff. He lives near his Newcastle counterpart Eddie Howe, and a host of north-east footballers, in an upmarket area of Northumberland but that is about as conventional as Le Bris gets. Part of those doctorate studies involved compiling a dissertation on new ways of using oxygen to revive fatigued and distressed athletes. Whatever happens on Saturday his sometimes unorthodox tactical methodology has breathed new life into Sunderland.View image in fullscreenRégis Le Bris has delighted in trampling on convention.Photograph: PA Images/AlamyWhat’s trigonometry got to do with it?Although Le Bris adapts formations, personnel and tactics to the opposition, his philosophy is underpinned by a belief that the game is a form of trigonometry. “Triangles are the basis of everything we do,” says a coach whose often counterattacking winger-propelled gameplans tend to be heavily dependent on triangular passing interactions between full-backs, wingers and No 8s. As the forward Eliezer Mayenda says: “It’s all about finding the right triangles.” During Le Bris’s teenage years in the western Breton village of Pont-l’Abbé, he devoted his spare time to completing an in-depth analysis of Arsène Wenger’s tactics as Monaco’s manager. As an adult, he spent holidays touring clubs across Spain and England – Arsenal, Chelsea, Crystal Palace, Everton and Leeds included – to watch their coaches. “He’s not someone who shouts at you,” the Sunderland striker Wilson Isidor says, “but he makes you understand things really, really thoroughly.” The winger Patrick Roberts agrees. “He’s efficient,” he says. “He’s brought us new ideas and he’s capable of changing our play depending on the opponent. He’s modern.”How come they’re so young?With a median age of 22.4 Sunderland have, on average, fielded the Championship’s youngest starting XIs this season. A squad notable for the absence of outfield players over 30 ranks as one of Europe’s most youthful and is often heavily reliant on the much-coveted midfield skills of the 19-year-old Jobe Bellingham and 17-year-old Chris Rigg. It is part of a strategy devised by Kristjaan Speakman, Sunderland’s sporting director, involving the fusion of promising youngsters from the highly regarded academy with raw, often flawed, young talent acquired relatively cheaply from across Europe. There is no squeamishness about buying to sell. Last season’s star winger Jack Clarke joined Ipswich for £15m last summer, and another winger, the 19-year-old Tommy Watson, will sign for Brighton for £10m this summer. Bellingham was bought from Birmingham for £1.5m but could be poised to join Borussia Dortmund for £25m. Clarke’s replacement has been the excellent Romaine Mundle, a former Tottenham youth player recruited from Standard Liège for £1m. Le Bris’s two main strikers, Isidor, a £5m purchase from Zenit St Petersburg, and Mayenda, £1m from Sochaux, have appreciated considerably in value. Whether this strategy could continue working in the Premier League remains to be seen but Sunderland’s owner, the 27-year-old Swiss-French billionaire Kyril Louis-Dreyfus, is on a mission to run the club as a sustainable business.Could they possibly survive in the top tier?It helps that Le Bris, unlike some recently promoted managers (see Russell Martin at Southampton), is not a slave to positional-style, play-it-out-from-the-back football. Sunderland overcame Coventry in the playoff semi-final courtesy of about 25% possession and an ultra-low block so winning ugly poses few problems. Nonetheless, a significant investment in higher-calibre players would appear essential if immediate relegation were to be avoided. The infrastructure – a 49,000-capacity stadium and Premier League-standard training facility – is in place but commercial revenues are about a third of those commanded by Leeds, the Championship winners, and require significant boosting. Potential investors are thought to be waiting in the wings, with Louis-Dreyfus believed to be ready to invite them on to the board should promotion be secured.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

No matter that the Roma loanee playmaker was largely deployed out of position on the left wing, Le Fée underlined why Le Bris persuaded Speakman to relax club recruitment rules to be reunited with his former Lorient protege in January. Should Sunderland win promotion, a 25-year-old who revels as a No 10 will automatically see his loan morph into a £20m transfer. Much may hinge on whether the recently hamstrung Mundle is fit to start wide on the left at Wembley.Explore more on these topicsSunderlandChampionshipfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It shows Dean Windass, somehow larger than life even with his back turned to the camera, standing with arms aloft on the balcony ofHull CityHall and inhaling the adulation of thousands. Two days earlier he had, at the age of 39, scored a winner for the ages at Wembley and sent his boyhood club to the Premier League. He could not have caught the ball any more sweetly after Fraizer Campbell had chipped it across; it was no hardship that, even then, he knew it would follow him for ever.“It changed my life,” Windass says, sitting in his living room on a quiet May morning. “I scored 234 goals and everyone only talks about that one.” To this day he swears a scorcher at Wycombe in 1992-93, “volleyed in with my left foot from 950 million yards”, was superior to his museum piece from 2008. But he is synonymous with the playoffs now; they are his thing, a sporting event he still anticipates like few others, and when we meet he correctly predicts Sheffield United will meet Sunderland in Saturday’s Championship final.That is the uncomplicated side to Windass, who happily describes himself as “the most boring man you’ve ever seen in your life” during weeknights watching football, soaps or documentaries. In the public eye he was always a showman: a bustling menace on the pitch and pantomime villain when playing to the gallery of a goading opposition support. “It spurred me on,” he says. “I got ‘You fat bastard’ and loved it. The bigger the stage I played on, the better I performed. Some people can’t handle it but I thrived on it.”View image in fullscreenDean Windass scores the goal at Wembley in 2008 that took Hull into the Premier League.Photograph: Clive Rose/Getty ImagesBeneath the bravado there was plenty more swirling away: Windass has been candid about his post-career struggles, which may have been caused by a combination of unresolved childhood issues and the degradation of two decades’ day-to-day structure. He made two suicide attempts and spent 26 days in rehab for alcohol dependency; he was made bankrupt through debts to HM Revenue and Customs incurred via a film investment scheme that stung numerous ex-pros. Windass never shrank from any of that and has tried to help others experiencing mental health difficulties.On top of these problems it hardly feels fair that last yearWindass was diagnosed with stage two dementia, an early phase of the syndrome. John Stiles, the son of England’s 1966 hero Nobby, is a friend from the after-dinner speaking circuit and asked him to take a diagnostic scan. Windass took some persuading but, after learning more about Stiles’ work withFootball Families for Justice, which is campaigning for families of former players affected by brain injuries to receive proper financial support, agreed to be examined. Nobby Stiles died with dementia in October 2020.“I went into it with my eyes wide open,” Windass says. He had not sensed any problems at the time, bar what he deemed standard bouts of forgetfulness. “I decided to get the scan because I thought it would be worth it even to help one family. And that it might be my family in five or 10 years’ time. I was a guinea pig, I didn’t feel ill and wasn’t bad at the time.”Over a Zoom call that his fiancee, Kerry, also attended he was told the scan had found a shade on his brain. He says the consultant told him a career of heading footballs was likely to have contributed. At the time he was 55. “They’ve said I could be like this for half a decade, a decade, or it could deteriorate,” he says. “I’m not happy about it; I wish they’d said I was all clear and then we wouldn’t be having this conversation now. But look, I could go out and get run over by a bus tomorrow.”View image in fullscreenDean Windass says of his dementia diagnosis: ‘I tried having a bit of fun with it as that’s my character.’Photograph: Ian Hodgson/ANL/ShutterstockHis diagnosis was revealed in January when the former Manchester United defender David May, a friend of Windass and Stiles, was given the green light to announce it on television. Until then Windass had elected not to spread the news. His older son Josh, who plays for Sheffield Wednesday, found out while having coffee with his teammate Barry Bannan. It turned out Bannan’s father had just heard May’s announcement.Windass put on the face everyone else knew. “I tried having a bit of fun with it as that’s my character,” he says. “The next day I walked in my local pub and everyone’s going: ‘My God, are you all right, are you OK?’ I went: ‘Yeah, I’m fine thank you, but I’ve forgotten my wallet!’ That was the best way for me to deal with it.”The more serious element is that he knows trickier days will come. Windass goes about his daily business with few hitches but Kerry already manages much of his schedule and the load on her will eventually increase. She runs a successful beauty business in Hull but a partner can quickly come to feel lonely. “Nobody asked if Kerry was all right,” Windass says. “People come to her salon asking if I’m OK, but she’s the one who has to look after me.” It is why he sits squarely behind Football Families for Justice’s campaign for added support. Nobby Stiles’ care costs ran to £125,000; an initial fund of £1m set up by the Professional Footballers’ Association in 2023 was described by John last month as “not fit for purpose”.There is a growing consensus that much more will be required, and quickly. Windass agrees. “Nobby’s had to sell his World Cup medal to go in a home and should never have been in that position,” he says. While unwilling to directly criticise the PFA, listing the ways in which it has helped him through a range of difficulties, he hopes the level of assistance available can be greatly enhanced.This month, two days before this interview, Windass’s former Hull colleague Andy Payton revealed his own dementia diagnosis at the age of 57. After his Zoom call, Windass had been urging those in his circle to take the scan. He estimates 10 to 15 have done so. “We were playing a charity game, Burnley legends against Bradford legends,” he says. “Andy came up to me and went: ‘I’ve gone and had that scan.’ I found out the other day; I’ve texted him. I tell all the ex-players I hang round with to go for it, because you never know the outcome.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He was quick, I set up a few for him. Andy wasn’t really renowned for heading the ball on matchdays but he’d do it in training and that’s what happened.”Windass looks back at half a lifetime of daily drills, head thrusting towards balls being flung across the training pitch, in which the notion of adverse consequences barely registered.“When I got the diagnosis they asked me how many footballs I headed,” he says. “It’s not the fact of matchday, it was those crossing and finishing drills every day. Or for centre-halves, heading it as far as they could. After every session I’d do some finishing, head it in or volley it if they cross it in. I thought nothing of it. You couldn’t think about dementia then, but now we can. So let’s see if we can stop it at source now and reduce the damage.”A restriction on heading in training is, he believes, more important than imposing a blanket ban. In 2021 the Premier League introduced recommendations that players head the balla maximum of 10 times per session, one session a week, but the level of adherence is unclear. “I’m not saying stop heading it in games,” he says. “If the ball comes across in front of 50,000 on a Saturday I’m not saying: ‘I can’t head this or I’ll get dementia.’ In a charity game, if the ball was stood up in the box I’d head it, it’s instinct. But you can stop those drills in training.”The stories, memories and admissions flow during a lunchtime with Windass. Even more of them are contained in his new book,Beyond the final whistle, which deals unflinchingly with the problems that sent him to the edge. “People always say you want to forget about your past and move forwards, but you go back to where it starts and it feels quite raw,” he says. “I’m an emotional person and I still get down sometimes.”He works with his close friend Mark Crossley, the former Nottingham Forest keeper, and other retired players to raise money for a range of good causes through the charityWalking’s Brilliant. The group have walked long distances, scaled the three peaks, and the idea is to help one another in the process. “I didn’t realise how many ex-players have struggled with mental health,” Windass says. “It comes out when we’re walking. I’ve played against all these lads and I’m thinking: ‘Why are you on this walk?’View image in fullscreenDean Windass wants to encourage people to talk about mental health problems. ‘Nobody spoke about it in my day and it nearly cost me,’ he says.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian“If I spoke out about it in the changing room when I was playing, it’d be: ‘What’s wrong with you? Grow a pair of bollocks.’ Nobody spoke about it in my day and it nearly cost me. So when I got through it, I thought I need to tell people to talk.”People stop Windass in the street to thank him for the videos he releases on social media, through which he has offered practical tips on how to get through a bad day. “I want to shed light on my experiences and help the public,” he says. On walks through Hull he will buy food for the homeless or offer a lift to somebody waiting for a bus. Life has dealt Windass inconceivable highs and devastating lows; more of both may follow, but through the turbulence he has found a happy state of being.“I’m very honoured to have had the career I did, and the friends I have who care about me,” he says. “You’ve been in bad places and think nobody loves you or cares.” As he speaks, that picture of a jubilant crowd whose dreams he had just made true is visible in the hallway.In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

The BBC and Sky share the rights to show the Women’s Super League, while TNT Sports and Channel 4 have secured a new deal to broadcast the Women’s FA Cup, while ITV also cover the England women’s team’s matches – joined by the BBC for major tournaments. Additionally, every WSL 2 match is available live on YouTube next term.Such a wide range of different subscriptions being required by supporters wanting to watch every match live may be a concern for some fans in terms of the cost, although it is also understood there will be some free-to-air coverage of the Women’s Champions League in the UK too.For the past four seasons, Dazn has shown the Women’s Champions League live across Europe and some matches in the UK have additionally been picked up by TNT Sports. Dazn said: “Dazn is proud to have delivered transformative growth as the global rights holder for the Women’s Champions League. Showing every match for free over the last four seasons we have grown the competitions visibility, driving a 71% increase in total watch time.”Disney+ is understood to have made a hugely competitive offer, not only financially but in terms of the quality of their production, in their extensive plans for their coverage. The organisation reportedly has around 125 million subscribers globally.The deal was agreed by UC3, a new joint venture organised between Uefa and the European Club Association, meaning that club representatives have been involved in the discussions around the broadcast rights deal. The agency Two Circles were commissioned to work on the deal.The news comes ahead of this year’s final, between Arsenal and Barcelona, which is taking place in Lisbon on Saturday and will be Dazn’s last game as rightsholders. Barcelona are bidding to win the European title for the third consecutive year after eliminating Chelsea in the semi-finals. Arsenal are in their first final since lifting the trophy in 2007.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is relatively similar to to the recently-revamped men’s Champions League format, albeit smaller in terms of the number of teams. The women’s event will switch from a 16-team group stage to now having a league phase, expanded to include 18 teams, where teams will be ranked in one league table, before a playoff round and then the more traditional knockout phase.Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester United have earned the European spots for next term from the WSL as the top three with the latter starting their qualifying campaign in August.

There had been reports of the trio being left out but the announcement still came as a shock. France are one of the favourites for the European Championship in Switzerland but have been drawn in a tough group with England, the Netherlands and Wales.Disney+ to enter women’s football market with Champions League rightsRead more“These are tough choices,” Bonadei said. “They are difficult to make and difficult to announce to the players. It’s a decision that’s hard to hear, hard to understand and almost impossible for them to accept because they’re legendary players for the French team.“I didn’t make this decision on the spur of the moment. You’d think, given the timing, that this is crazy but it’s not. As Einstein said: ‘Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result.’ I want different results for this team so I have gone with a different selection.”France have never won a major tournament and were eliminated by Brazil in the quarter-finals of last summer’s Olympics in Paris. Renard, Le Sommer and Dali were all in that squad. Bonadei refused to confirm whether they were definitely out for the Euros but did say: “It’s something I’ve been thinking about since the start of the season. When I announced that everyone had a chance, that no one was indispensable, in my mind it wasn’t just about giving young players a chance but also players who had suffered psychologically after the Olympic Games and making sure that everyone was involved.”Le Sommer and Renard have partly paid for their lack of playing time over the last few national team gatherings. The forward Le Sommer, who has 200 caps and was due to be honoured in Nancy before the game against Switzerland on 30 June, played only 27 minutes in the past four France games. Renard missed three of those through injury, with her former Lyon teammate Griedge Mbock shining alongside Maëlle Lakrar against Ada Hegerberg’s Norway.“Things happened naturally, with a mix of generations in the first few games and we racked up four wins from four Nations League matches. In those four games the playing time for these players was fairly limited. My thoughts were refined, in consultation with my staff, so I made my decision,” Bonadei said. He called each of them on Tuesday before Thursday’s announcement, something he does not normally do.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I’ll be talking to them at the start of the training camp.” Grace Geyoro, Sakina Karchaoui, Sandie Toletti, Pauline Peyraud-Magnin and Mbock are among those players who have taken the armband with Selma Bacha and Lakrar also mentioned as possible future captains.Explore more on these topicsFrance women's football teamWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

Let’s make this a day to remember for everyone involved.”Liverpool reported an “increase in the use of pyrotechnics, including flares, smoke bombs and fireworks in recent weeks” and said a three-year-old child had been among the burn victims after the Spurs match. Pyrotechnics generally burn at temperatures between 700C and 2,500C and can cause burns from direct contact or from being in close proximity.Nathan Askew, chief nurse at Alder Hey Children’s NHS Foundation Trust, said: “We know that Monday will be a fantastic day for all Liverpool fans, but over the past few years we have seen several children and young people who have needed hospital treatment after using pyrotechnics or flares.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Ghana midfielder has been one of Arsenal’s best players as they finished as Premier League runners-up for a third season in succession. Arteta has won only the 2020 FA Cup during his five seasons in charge.Jorginho and Kieran Tierney are expected to leave at the end of their contracts this summer. Arsenal remain confident of completing thesigning of the midfielder Martín Zubimendifrom Real Sociedad despite late interest from Real Madrid, and Arteta said he hoped Partey would remain.“Yes,” he said. “I think consistency-wise it’s been his best season. The way he’s played, performed, his availability, has been exceptional and he’s a really important player for us.”Asked whether the return of Kai Havertz from a hamstring injury ahead of schedule had changed the approach for the summer transfer window, the Arsenal manager said: “What is clear as well with the amount of injuries that we had in the front line [is] that we need a goal threat and we need the firepower out there. Understanding that the context can change tomorrow and we cannot rely just on the numbers that we had before. And we have to add goals, we have to add creativity, we have to add numbers and that will be in different positions.”Arsenal have been linked with a move for Madrid’s Rodrygo after the Spanish side stepped up attempts to sign Athletic Bilbao’s Nico Williams, who has also long been coveted by Arteta. Viktor Gyökeres of Sporting and Benjamin Sesko are among potential targets to provide support to Havertz and Gabriel Jesus, who sustained a season-ending knee injury in January.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The seven-times Premier League champion has had a miserable campaign and came into the final weekly night having to win to stay in contention for the playoffs.But Van Gerwen fell at the first hurdle, losing 6-2 to Nathan Aspinall, whose victory guaranteed him a top-four spot and completed the lineup for next week’s playoffs at the O2 in London.It is only the second time in 13 years that Van Gerwen, who has won the competition more than any other player, has not made the finals night. His exit is another stark reminder that he is no longer at the top of the sport, sitting well below Littler and Luke Humphries.View image in fullscreenLuke Littler poses with the trophy after victory in the final on night 16 of the Premier League Darts in Sheffield.Photograph: Nigel French/PAThat duo met in a fifth final of the campaign as their enduring rivalry continues to dominate the sport and Littler came out on top, with a 6-3 success. It was his sixth nightly win and he claimed a piece of history by posting a record points haul of 45; a new high in this format of the competition.“For myself, this is just the warm-up,” Littler said. “It’s been tough, it’s a tough format but I’ve got myself through. I’m happy to be top. I’m ready for the semi-final, it’s the O2, I have won a semi-final before, I’m looking forward to it.”The latest instalment of their matchup could well prove to be a dress rehearsal for next week’s playoff final, with both players favourites to get through their semi-finals.Littler will play Gerwyn Price after the Welshman threw away a 4-1 lead to lose 6-5 against Chris Dobey, which meant he slipped to fourth place. Aspinall knew that victory would book his place in the top four for the third time in his career and he delivered a fine performance against the struggling Van Gerwen. That set up a semi-final against Humphries while Dobey, Rob Cross and Stephen Bunting join Van Gerwen in exiting the tournament.Explore more on these topicsDartsMichael van GerwenLuke LittlernewsShareReuse this content"

Throughout my career, from when I was very young until now, I’ve always been made a better player by people around me doing well and forcing me to be better.”There were times when it was not clear that Crawley was surrounded by particularly good players, as Zimbabwe toiled in the field with little by way of reward or inspiration. After frolicking through the day at 5.65 runs an over England were 498 for three at stumps, just eight away from the all-time record for the most runs in the opening day of a Test they set in Rawalpindi in 2022, after Crawley and Ben Duckett put on 231 for the opening wicket, just two short of the personal best they set on that same day in Pakistan. Only once in the last 50 years has any other pair of English openers scored more.Crawley’s recent past had been filled with much less encouraging statistics. In his previous 10 Test innings he had averaged 11.3 with a high score of 29 and a low in New Zealand at the end of last year that lasted four weeks and involved being repeatedly hunted and humbled by Matt Henry, who dismissed him six times in six attempts and took a total of 33 balls to do it. And while he had enjoyed some success in his early-season appearances for Kent – scoring three half-centuries, one of them unbeaten – in the first innings of those games he had scored one, none, one and six.“I actually felt in good touch before the New Zealand series,” he said. “I got a couple of weird dismissals and a couple of decent balls and before you know it I’d had a terrible, terrible time. That’s the nature of the beast in Test cricket. But I feel like I found some rhythm in the last few weeks and things like that don’t really bother me. Like, good days and bad days. I try to forget them as quickly as possible and be as present as possible.”Zimbabwe go into day two hoping it will be possible for all their players to be present. Shortly after lunch their opening bowler Richard Ngarava pulled up while gently jogging around the outfield, doubling over in pain and variously feeling his back and his right hamstring before climbing gingerly into an electric buggy, dragging his left leg aboard with his right arm. He eventually returned, albeit looking far from comfortable, having apparently suffered nothing more serious than a back spasm and the hope is that he will be able to bowl on Friday. “We’ll reassess tonight and then in the morning we’ll have a look,” said Charl Langeveldt, Zimbabwe’s bowling coach.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It means the club has failed to qualify for next season’s lucrative Uefa Champions League, Europe’s top-tier football competition.Manchester United shares fell by nearly 8% in early trading on Thursday, their steepest drop in more than eight months, but later pared back losses to 6.7%. The stock, which has lost about a fifth of its value this year, had hit its highest level in 11 weeks hours before the game.Shareholders will be hugely disappointed that the Premier League club has missed out on the lucrative place in next season’s Champions League. Participationleads toearnings from tickets, broadcast money, and sponsor bonusesestimated at more than £100m.The defeat means United will not play in European competition at all next season, which will damage the club’s revenues and profits for 2025-26 as arebuild of its squadgets under way. It alsoplans to build a new £2bn, 100,000-seat stadiumthat would be the largest in the UK.United’s former first-team coach René Meulensteen had called it a “crossroads moment” after “the most disastrous season”. The club is languishing in 16th place in the Premier League, just above Spurs, and is heading for its lowest finish in the table in 50 years.Following the 2005 takeover by the Glazers, the majority owners, United is more than £1bn in debt, leading to hefty interest payments every year. The club reported a loss of £113m last year (compared with £26m for Spurs), which took United’s total pre-tax losses to £300m over the past three years.It has taken tough actions such as cutting jobs, increasing members’ match-day ticket prices to £66 with no reductions for seniors or children, raising parking charges for disabled fans and scrapping the steward-of-the-match £50 award.The minority owner Ratcliffe decidedin February tocut about 200 more jobsto help the club avoid going bust.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Turner held off Mads Pedersen (Lidl-Trek), winner of three stages in this year’s race so far, for the last step on the podium.A small crash in the peloton with around one kilometre left neutralised the times for the overall standings, allowing the general classification contenders to sit up. Del Toro leads by 33sec from his UAE Team Emirates teammate Juan Ayuso, with the Bahrain-Victorious rider Antonio Tiberi third.“I’d been waiting for this victory!” Kooij said. “In the previous two sprints, things didn’t go as planned. But today, everything went smoothly and I’m really happy. Only Wout can do such a long lead-out.“I had incredible support; my teammates were amazing, the whole team did a fantastic job,” the 23-year-old added. “We didn’t want to be too far back going into the final corner. I managed to jump on to Casper [Van Uden]’s wheel and then get around him.”Friday’s stage runs 180km from Rovigo to Vicenza in the Veneto region, and is mostly flat before rolling climbs in the final third and a climb to the finish line in the final kilometre.Explore more on these topicsGiro d'ItaliaCyclingnewsShareReuse this content"

A person’s hormone levels appear fine, but their function isn’t.”In their new paper,Harm reduction in the Enhanced Games: Can performance enhancing drugs be safe?, the University of Birmingham academics also warn of the potential dangers of taking testosterone for the heart.They write that it has been linked with “serious cardiovascular conditions such as dyslipidemia, myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, atherosclerosis, cardiomyopathy and left ventricular hypertrophy as well as significantly higher coronary artery plaque volume and reduced ejection fraction … compared to non-using controls.”“With testosterone, there are a bunch of adverse side effects,” said Chandler. “But symptoms like acne, shrinking testicles or the development of man boobs are obvious, and can be managed or will fade once you’ve stopped using. But the risks to cardiovascular function is probably the most serious issue, because it’s hidden and harder for people to track what is happening.”“With reduced ejection fraction, the heart has to work really hard to pump blood around the body,” he added. “And if you don’t take steps to mitigate that, it’s probably going to end up with a heart attack. And while some people are fine a year after they stop using testosterone, other people really aren’t.”The paper also points to studies showing “evidence of a range of psychiatric conditions including depression, anxiety and mania that appear to be significantly more prevalent amongst steroid users than the general population”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionDr Dan Turner, the Enhanced Games’ director of athlete safety and performance, has insisted that with proper monitoring the risks of taking banned drugs can be minimised. “It’s not the use of these substances that’s inherently dangerous,” he says. “It’s the misuse of these substances.”However, Boardley disagrees. “They’re giving the impression that this can be done safely, because it is medically supervised,” he said. “That’s just not right. It’s incorrect and misleading.“Some of the evidence of the adverse effects is only starting to come through after 10-20 years of people using these substances. So monitoring something in the very short term is not going to give any information about some of the more harmful effects.”Boardley added: “Often one of the hidden dangers is the likelihood of developing a dependency on anabolic steroids. When you stop using, it has very serious effects on your mood state, because your body’s own production of testosterone stops, which then encourages people to then restart.”The warning came as Wada also issued a statement attacking the organisers and warning of the dangers to athletes.“Wada condemns the Enhanced Games as a dangerous and irresponsible concept,” it said. “It has become clear from the event’s launch in Las Vegas that a focus of the organizers is to sell their products and to play down the associated risks. Inducing elite athletes to use their profiles to promote the use of prohibited and potentially dangerous substances is harmful, in particular for young athletes.”Explore more on these topicsDrugs in sportnewsShareReuse this content"

Pulisic, the US’s best player and often the team’s captain, is coming offthe best club season of his careerwith Milan. However, that season has involved him playing 49 games in all competitions so far, with that total likely to reach 50 for the second consecutive year with an appearance in Milan’s Serie A finale v Monza. An extended break over this summer would be Pulisic’s first since 2023.“Christian and his team approached the federation and the coaching staff about the possibility of stepping back this summer, given the amount of matches he has played in the past two years at both the club and international level with very little break,” US Soccer sporting director Matt Crocker said in a statement. “After thoughtful discussions and careful consideration, we made the collective decision that this is the right moment for him to get the rest he needs. The objective is to ensure he’s fully prepared to perform at the highest level next season.”Even with Coppa Italia loss, Christian Pulisic has had the best-ever season by an American man in EuropeRead moreRobinson, meanwhile, is also coming off aheavy workload, playing full 90s in the vast majority of Fulham’s games this season, in which he provided 10 assists from left-back. He announced on Instagram in March that he has been dealing with tendinopathy, an overuse injury, for most of the last part of the season.“We were waiting until the end to decide” US head coach Mauricio Pochettino said in a press conference with reporters on Thursday. “Last week he visited specialists. I am not a doctor to explain the issue he has. He has not trained too much in the last few months, only competing [in games].”Pochettino said Sargent’s exclusion was a “football decision,” while adding that Musah approached the federation and said he needed to withdraw from the summer tournament due to personal reasons.Another Berhalter with the USIn place of the above are a collection of newcomers and less-experienced players that will seek to make an impression on Pochettino in the United States’ final tournament competition before next year’s World Cup on home soil. In terms of name recognition, the biggest among the inclusions is Sebastian Berhalter, the son of former US head coach Gregg Berhalter. The younger Berhalter has enjoyed a fine start to the MLS season,helping the Vancouver Whitecapsto an MLS-best start along with a run to the Concacaf Champions Cup final.Also included are Orlando City’s standout right-back Alex Freeman (son of former Green Bay Packers wide receiver Antonio Freeman), FC Köln striker Damion Downs, and Philadelphia Union midfielder Quinn Sullivan.

Average attendance is as high as ever, and sponsors are flockingin record amountsto capitalize on the presence of global stars such as Lionel Messi, and the general growth of soccer in the US.Yet not all is well. Fan frustration continues to mount on a variety of issues. Media exposure is declining in the wake of a 10-year, $2.5bn media rights deal with Apple. Competition is mounting in the form of the USL, which plans to start a Division I league andinstitute promotion and relegationfor the first time in the modern era of US soccer. And the possibility of a switch to the international fall-to-spring calendar has left supporters of northern clubs bewildered.Many of the challengesMLSfaces are born of its successes and rooted in the environment of the North American sports market, in which business interests more often than not reign supreme.But as MLS prepares to shape its future, commissioner Don Garber and his fellow executives would do well to look toJapan, where their J League counterparts have charted a different path to relevance in a country similarly reluctant to accept soccer.An increasingly multicultural Japan have qualified for the 2026 World CupRead moreDevelopment firstThe 1994 World Cup was in some ways the genesis of both leagues: MLS was established as a condition for the US hosting the tournament, while the J League’s 1992 founding came as Japan sought to improve its playing level and qualify for the World Cup for the first time (they eventually did so for the 1998 edition).But while MLS started with 10 brand-new franchises under a single entity system, the J League’s Original 10 were almost entirely established company teams that professionalized and adapted home town identities, representing the league’s desire for each club to establish strong local relationships.“I think what we’ve done better than the US is developing players,” J League chairman Yoshikazu Nonomura told the Guardian on 15 May – coincidentally, the anniversary of the league’s inaugural kickoff in 1993. “We’ve looked at how to get kids to play and create a professional pathway, and that’s something that local clubs, schools and the Japanese soccer community have worked very hard to accomplish.”Those efforts have borne fruit: Japan have appeared in every men’s World Cup since 1998 andwere the first non-host to qualifyfor the 2026 edition in North America. The J League has expanded from 10 teams to 60 across three divisions since its formation, but lags far behind its European and pan-American peers when it comes to broadcast and sponsorship revenues as well as transfer-related income.“Our challenge now is figuring out how to expand our business side,” Nonomura said. “MLS has done really well as a business, but now they’re figuring outhow to build the base [of its developmental pyramid]. I think we both have an opportunity to succeed.”View image in fullscreenAndrés Iniesta brought an influx of attention to Vissel Kobe and the J League.Photograph: Jiji Press/EPAPost-Messi roadmapIf the attention surrounding Messi’s journey with Inter Miami feels familiar to Japanese soccer insiders, it’s because the J League has been down this path before with another Barcelona legend, after the arrival of Andrés Iniesta at Vissel Kobe in 2018.The former Spain captain’s arrival sparked a wave of global interest in Japanese soccer and higher attendances across the country, even as Vissel – who had also signed German star Lukas Podolski and would later bring on David Villa –struggledto achieve consistent results on the pitch.While the Covic-19 pandemic meant the J League was unable to capitalize on 2019’s record attendance it has successfully rebuilt its crowds despite the lack of a replacement superstar – something Nonomura chalks up to increased media investments that have seen domestic exposure quadruple in the post-Iniesta era, particularly in areas with second and third-division clubs that lack the top flight’s resources.A core of that strategy has been to increase the number of games shown on television. That required negotiations with streaming service Dazn, the J League’s official broadcaster since 2017, and like Apple a company that primarily deals in digital streaming. Today, J League games appear on Dazn as well as regional public broadcasters.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Free ticket giveaways geared to first-time viewers have paid dividends, with 30% of such recipients for games at Tokyo’s National Stadium going on to attend additional matches during the 2023 season, according to the league.“I think National Stadium games allow for a balance between European and American atmospheres,” Nonomura said. “Behind the goals there’s a lot of excitement, but elsewhere in the stadium it’s more relaxed and fans are enjoying themselves.”View image in fullscreenYoshikazu Nonomura thinks the J League can learn a thing or two from MLS’s business practices.Photograph: Dan Orlowitz/The GuardianFans as stakeholdersNext year the J League, which has always played through the summer, will undergo a dramatic transformation as it transitions to a fall-spring format. Like those who support MLSmaking a similar move, the hope is that the switch will benefit clubs by aligning their transfer windows with Europe and protecting players from the country’s sweltering summer weather.After two decades of resisting pressure from the Japan Football Association to make the switch, league officials began deliberating anew in 2023, kicking off a transparent, year-long process, complete with monthly media briefings and a listening tour that saw Nonomura visit clubs in snowy northern regions that would be most affected. In the end, just one team voted against the move.“It was because we’d been debating this for 20 years – the idea that the calendar had to change in order for the league to grow – that we felt it was necessary to share this information with as many people as possible,” Nonomura said. “And I think that because we made that effort, the number of people against the move decreased.”MLS Year 30: A league at a philosophical crossroads as World Cups loomRead moreIf MLS does go forward with the switch, Nonomura believes, they’ll have an advantage in terms of the amount of funding they can invest toward the transition. But he insists that fans should be a part of the conversation.“I like that in the US you can take on new challenges quickly, but when it comes to very weighty matters [the discussion] shouldn’t remain within the league,” he said. “If you believe that fans and supporters are important stakeholders, I think you need to tell them what’s being discussed and what you’re aiming to achieve.”Establishing that trust is something Nonomura focused on in his nine years as president of Hokkaido Consadole Sapporo, the J League’s northernmost club and among its best-known abroad thanks to the signings of Southeast Asian stars such as Le Cong Vinh and Chanathip Songkrasin.“In order to win you need enthusiasm from your fans, and in that sense they’re like club staff. When we were in the J2, we’d go to Sapporo Dome and present our financial situation and say, ‘This is what our revenue looks like now, but to raise it over the next five years we need your support to help win games,’ and that’s how we built our base. In that sense, to grow the J League it’s very important that our fans be aligned with the direction we want to take.”View image in fullscreenInter Miami played a friendly against Vissel Kobe in the 2024 preseason.Photograph: Naoki Nishimura/USA Today SportsTogether in the top fiveThough he admits that he is “envious” of MLS’s financial power, Nonomura sees a future in which both the North American circuit and the J League can stand together among the best leagues in the world.“[MLS] is refreshing because it’s a different approach to traditional soccer culture like promotion/relegation and a focus on building up grassroots,” he said. “It’s motivating, in a way. But I’m sure they look at what we’re doing in Japan and see things they’re envious about.“I think if we maintain a good relationship and continue to grow, right now the top five leagues are in Europe, but one day maybe it will be three from Europe, plus [MLS] and the J League.”One gap that the J League hopes to narrow with MLS in the next few years is in the boardroom: The league established Sports Human Capital, its own business school, in 2016 under then-chair Mitsuru Murai.Nonomura himself – a former player, TV commentator, club president and now chair – is emblematic of how Japanese soccer has raised its initial crop of sporting executives nearly from scratch, in contrast to MLS’s ability to draw from deep ranks of talent across the American sports business landscape, including Garber, who was once the senior VP of NFL International.“The league’s reached adulthood, but there’s lots of ways we can still grow,” Nonomura said. “After all, I’m 53, and there were so many things I didn’t understand at 32 that I do now.”Explore more on these topicsJapanMLSUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Pacers now hold a 1-0 lead in the best-of-seven-games series for a trip to the NBA finals after pulling off one of the most improbable finishes in playoff history.New York led 119-105 with under three minutes remaining in the fourth quarter, seemingly in complete command. According to ESPN Research, theirwin probabilitywas 99.7%. Jalen Brunson had returned from foul trouble and was attacking the goal with the bite, balance and GPS in the paint of a peakAllen Iverson. Karl-Anthony Towns was stretching the floor and punishing mismatches. A sold-out Garden crowd of 19,812 was in full throat and primed to spill outside into the rain-soaked celebrations that werealready popping off along Seventh Avenue. Instead, it was brought to a church-like hush as the Knicks unraveled completely, outscored 31-14 in the final 2:51 of regulation and overtime.Aaron Nesmith sparked the Pacers’ fightback with a barrage of three-pointers, burying five in the final three and a half minutes of the fourth quarter. He finished with 30 points on 8-of-9 shooting from beyond the arc, including back-to-back makes and a pair of free throws after the Knicks fouled him intentionally so he couldn’t tie the game with another.“It’s unreal,” said Nesmith, a fifth-year swingman who averaged 12.0 points per game in the regular season. “It’s probably the best feeling in the world for me. I love it when that basket feels like an ocean and anything you toss up, you feel like it’s going to go in. It’s so much fun.”View image in fullscreenNew York’s Jalen Brunson, left, scored a game-high 43 points in the Knicks’ Game 1 loss.Photograph: Jesse D Garrabrant/NBAE/Getty ImagesEven with Nesmith’s late heroics, Indiana still trailed by a pair in the final seconds. Haliburton recovered from a loose dribble, stepped back near the three-point line and launched a high-arcing jumper right before the horn. It bounced high off the back rim, hung in the air for what felt like an eternity before dropping cleanly through the cylinder. He immediately sprinted to the celebrity-dotted sideline near midcourt and flashed a choke gesture, a direct nod toMiller’s infamous 1994 tauntaimed at Spike Lee.Video replay confirmed Haliburton’s toe was on the line. The basket counted for two, tying the game at 125 and forcing the five-minute extra frame.Indiana’s Andrew Nembhard then came alive in a back-and-forth overtime period with a three-pointer followed by two go-ahead layups, the second giving the Pacers a 136-135 lead with 26.7 seconds left. A deflected pass off Brunson’s fingertips turned the ball back over to Indiana, and former Knick Obi Toppin slammed home a breakaway dunk with 10.9 seconds remaining to seal the win, the Pacers’ fourth comeback from 15 points or more down in these playoffs.Anatomy of a comeback“I’m so proud of the resilience of this group, we’ve shown it all year,” Haliburton said. “We’ve had to win in so many different, random, unique ways and today we just kept going, kept fighting, and man, that’s fun.”It wasn’tMiller’s eight points in 8.9 secondsto silence the Garden in the 1995 Eastern Conference semi-finals. It was somehow worse. And not just because Miller had a courtside seat for the carnage while commentating on the game for TNT. “Defensively, we let off the gas. The intensity and physicality weren’t there,” the Knicks’ Josh Hart confessed. “Offensively, we were playing slower, and more stagnant. It looked like we were playing not to lose.”Haliburton finished with 31 points and 11 assists. Nembhard added 15 points, including seven in overtime. Pascal Siakam scored 17, and Myles Turner contributed 14. The Pacers shot 57.1% from the field and 17-of-30 from deep, surviving New York’s fourth-quarter surge – including 14 unanswered points as Brunson sat with five fouls – and executing flawlessly down the stretch.It was a collapse of historic proportions for New York, who appeared to have the game in hand after a 19-3 run midway through the fourth that opened a 111-94 lead. Since play-by-play tracking began in 1997-98, teams leading by 14 or more points with less than 2:45 remaining in regulation had been 994-0. The Knicks are now the one-in-a-thousand outlier.The incandescent Brunson poured in 43 points and five assists but was hampered by foul trouble for much of the fourth quarter. Towns, who had struggled mightily from deep in the previous round against Boston, responded with 35 points and 12 rebounds, including 4-of-8 from three. OG Anunoby and Mikal Bridges each added 16 points while the Knicks shot a blistering 53% from the field – only to spit the bit when it mattered most.Instead the night belonged to Haliburton, who is no stranger to the role of Garden heel. Last year the 25-year-old led the Pacersto a one-sided Game 7 winthat ended New York’s season in the second round, departing the arena in a hoodiedepicting Miller’s notorious gesture. But the visitors were quick to put Wednesday’s stunner behind them. “It’s a long series,” Indiana coach Rick Carlisle said. “We’re not going to get too excited about this. We’ve got things to clean up. They got things to clean up. Game 2 is going to be another war.”The overtime classic on a soggy Wednesday night in Manhattan marked the first Eastern Conference finals game at Madison Square Garden in 25 years – and, fittingly, another white-knuckle installment in one of the NBA’s most storied playoff rivalries. The Knicks have now reached the conference finals four times since 1994. All four times, the opponent has been Indiana. New York won those meetings in 1994 and 1999. The Pacers answered in 2000 – and now again in 2024, with another devastating blow on enemy hardwood. They say everything old is new again:Knicks v Hicksis back.Game 2 is Friday night at the Garden. New York will have to regroup fast. The Pacers, after stealing home-court advantage in spectacular fashion, are already penning the next chapter of a rivalry that refuses to fade.“In the playoffs, when you win, it’s the best thing ever. When you lose, it’s the worst thing ever,” Brunson said. “The best way to deal with all that is to stay level-headed and making sure we have each other’s backs.”Explore more on these topicsNBANew York KnicksIndiana PacersBasketballUS sportsShareReuse this content"

The franchiseannouncedthat Irsay passed away peacefully in his sleep on Tuesday afternoon.“We are devastated to announce our beloved Owner & CEO, Jim Irsay, passed away peacefully in his sleep,” Colts chief operating officer Pete Ward said in a statement. “Jim’s dedication and passion for theIndianapolis Colts, in addition to his generosity, commitment to the community, and most importantly, his love for his family were unsurpassed.”Irsay, who took over full control of the team in 1997 following the death of his father Robert Irsay, presided over the most successful era in Colts history. Under his leadership, the team drafted quarterback Peyton Manning in 1998, ushering in more than a decade of dominance that included eight division titles and a victory in Super Bowl XLI.pic.twitter.com/TZg4kMpdAj— Indianapolis Colts (@Colts)May 21, 2025Born into football royalty, Jim Irsay grew up around the game and began working with the Colts as a teenager, handling everything from equipment to front-office duties. He became the NFL’s youngest general manager in 1984, the year the team relocated from Baltimore to Indianapolis. He later assumed day-to-day control of the franchise in 1995 when his father suffered a stroke.Beyond the gridiron, Irsay was known for his colorful personality, deep love of music and philanthropic spirit. He amassed a world famous collection of music memorabilia and frequently shared it with the public through tours and performances with his band. His charitable contributions benefited countless individuals and organizations across Indiana and the US, from mental health initiatives to support for underserved communities.“Simply put, he wanted to make the world a better place and that philosophy never wavered,” Ward said. “Jim will be deeply missed by his family, the Colts organization, and fans everywhere.”Over 38 years under Irsay’s involvement with the franchise from 1984 through 2024, the Colts went 316-294-1 in the regular season and 13-16 in the playoffs.“We were deeply saddened to learn of Jim Irsay’s passing today,” NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement. “Jim was a friend, and a man deeply committed to his family, the game, the Colts, and the Indianapolis community. He spent his life and career in the National Football League. Starting as a teenager as a Colts’ ballboy, he learned every position in the organization before assuming leadership of the Colts approximately 30 years ago. Jim’s Colts won the Super Bowl, hosted another and built Lucas Oil Stadium.”Goodell noted Irsay’s participation in league operations as the active chairman of the legislative committee and a member of the finance committee.“He led with integrity, passion and care for the Colts’ players, coaches and staff, and his courageous work in support of mental health will be a lasting legacy,” Goodell said in the statement. “Outside of football, he was a talented musician and built an extraordinary collection of historical and musical artifacts that he shared with people across the country.“On behalf of the entire NFL, I extend my heartfelt condolences to Jim’s daughters and their families, and to his many friends throughout the NFL.”In February 2024, Irsay took to social media to reveal that his health was improving after he was hospitalized for a severe respiratory illness.“On the mend. Grateful for all the messages of love and support,” Irsay wrote on Twitter.The Colts released a statement on 9 January 2024, saying Irsay was undergoing treatment for the illness.On 8 December 2023, per a police report, Irsay, then 64, wasfound unresponsive in his homein Carmel, Indiana, prompting emergency personnel to administer Narcan, which is commonly used to reverse the effects of an opioid overdose.Irsay revealed during a November 2023 interview on HBO’s Real Sports With Bryant Gumbel that he had battled addiction and nearly died from a previous overdose. He said he had been to rehab “at least 15 times”.He publicly credited Alcoholics Anonymous for positively impacting his life and that organization’s 12-step program has “literally saved hundreds of thousands or millions of lives”, Irsay told ESPN in 2024.Irsay is survived by his daughters Carlie Irsay-Gordon, Casey Foyt and Kalen Jackson; his ex-wife, Meg Coyle; and 10 grandchildren.The Colts have not announced succession plans, but Irsay’s daughters – already active in team operations – are expected to continue his legacy.Explore more on these topicsIndianapolis ColtsNFLUS sportsShareReuse this content"

The paper also takes into account the energy consumption of chips used by other companies, such as Broadcom.The IEA estimates that all data centres – excluding mining for cryptocurrencies – consumed 415 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity last year. De Vries-Gao argues in his research that AI could already account for 20% of that total.He said a number of variables came into his calculations, such as the energy efficiency of a datacentre and electricity consumption related to cooling systems for servers handling an AI system’s busy workloads. Datacentres are the central nervous system of AI technology, with their high energy demands making sustainability a key concern in the development and use of artificial intelligence systems.By the end of 2025, De Vries-Gao estimates, energy consumption by AI systems could approach up to 49% of total datacentre power consumption, again excluding crypto mining. AI consumption could reach 23 gigawatts (GW), the research estimates, twice the total energy consumption of the Netherlands.bar chartHowever, De Vries-Gao said a number of factors could lead to a slowdown in hardware demand, such as waning demand for applications such as ChatGPT. Another issue could be geopolitical tensions resulting in constraints on producing AI hardware, such as export controls. De Vries-Gao cites the example of barriers on Chinese access to chips, which contributed to the release of theDeepSeek R1AI model that reportedly used fewer chips.“These innovations can reduce the computational and energy costs of AI,” said de Vries.But he said any efficiency gains could encourage even more AI use. Multiple countries attempting to build their own AI systems – a trend known as “sovereign AI” – could also increase hardware demand. De Vries-Gao also pointed to a US datacentre startup, Crusoe Energy, securing 4.5GW of gas-powered energy capacity for its infrastructure, with theChatGPTdeveloper OpenAI among the potential customers through its Stargate joint venture.“There are early indications that these [Stargate] datacentres could exacerbate dependence on fossil fuels,” writes De Vries-Gao.On Thursday OpenAI announced the launch of a Stargate project in the United Arab Emirates, the first outside the US.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The EU AI Act requires AI companies to disclose the energy consumption behind training a model but not for day-to-day use.Prof Adam Sobey, the mission director for sustainability at the UK’s Alan Turing Institute, an AI research body, said more transparency was needed on how much energy is consumed by artificial intelligence systems, and how much they could save by helping to make carbon-emitting industries such as transport and energy more efficient.Sobey said: “I suspect that we don’t need many very good use cases [of AI] to offset the energy being used on the front end.”Explore more on these topicsGreen economyArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingEnergyChatGPTnewsShareReuse this content"

But it won’t have shelves stocked with products. This vast building will be a datacentre, believed to be earmarked for TikTok​, the Chinese-owned video-sharing app​, ​a​s part of a55bn reais (£7.3bn) project​to expand its global datacentre infrastructure​.As the demand for supercomputer facilities rises, fuelled by the AI boom,Brazil is attracting more and more tech companies. The choice of Caucaia is no accident. Several undersea cables carry data from the nearby capital of Ceará state, Fortaleza, to other continents. The closer to the cables, the greater the traffic capacity and the lower the latency, or response time, between two points on the internet network.Caucaia also hasPecém EPZ, a zone in which companies can produce goods and services for export with a range of tax benefits and simplified bureaucratic procedures.Yet Caucaia also suffers from extreme weather events, including droughts and heavy rains, according to data from the Digital Atlas of Disasters inBraziland the Integrated Disaster Information System.In 16 of the 21 years between 2003 and 2024, a state of emergency due to drought was declared in the city at least once. In 2019, almost 10,000 people were affected by water shortages, theDigital Atlas of Disasters shows. As reservoirs were depleted, the water became unfit for consumption, leading to crop losses and difficulty accessing basic food for the population.Datacentres use vast amounts of energy and water to cool their supercomputers. Nevertheless, public authorities are greenlighting their construction in cities that have persistently suffered from drought. Caucaia is not an isolated case.According to the Digital Disaster Atlas, five of the 22 datacentres planned are located in cities that have suffered recurring droughts and water shortages since 2003.So far, the Chinese social network has not been named in the permit applications in Caucaia. But in February, the state government’s chief of staff, Chagas Vieira, confirmedin an interviewwith a local radio station that it was in talks with a Chinese company, and representatives from TikTok and its parent company, ByteDance, have met seniorgovernment officials, including the vice-president and the development, industry, trade and services ministerGeraldo Alckmin.ByteDance has been approached for comment.View image in fullscreenA truck delivers water to Caucaia, a city that faces recurring issues with its drinking water supply.Photograph: Marília Camelo/The GuardianThe company officially responsible for the project is Casa dos Ventos, a Brazilian wind energy provider that has invested in the datacentre sector. The company’s founder and president, Mario Araripe,announced last yearthat he aimed to attract a large global tech company, such as Apple, Amazon, Google, Meta or Microsoft, to fill the place with its computers.Casa dos Ventos has already obtained one of the three necessary licences needed from the state of Ceará. According to the State Environmental Superintendence (Semace), the project received a licence for “water consumption of 30m³/day in a closed circuit, supplied by an artesian well”. Access to further details has been refused due to commercial confidentiality.Casa dos Ventos says it is “committed to transforming Porto do Pecém into a technology innovation and energy transition complex” with “the largest datacentre and green hydrogen project in the country, which will use renewable energy”.Projects that require substantial power, such as datacentres, must apply for special permission from the Brazilian government to operate. In 2024, at least seven of the 21 authorisations published by the ministry of mines and energy were related to datacentres.Casa dos Ventos is also responsible for another project for a datacentre under state review in Campo Redondo, Rio Grande do Norte, which has experienced drought for 14 of the last 21 years, analysis of data from the Digital Disaster Atlas shows. During a water shortage in 2022, the municipality requested federal support and water trucks were dispatched to meet demand.While residential users typically don’t use much of the water they withdraw, datacentres often use 60% to 80% of itShaolei Ren, UC RiversideA similar situation has occurred in Igaporã, Bahia, where a Brazilian renewables energy company, plans to build two datacentres. The city has declared a state of emergency due to drought and dry spells in 12 of the 22 years since 2003. In 2021, about 5,500 people were affected by water shortages in rural areas.There is no transparency on water consumption by datacentres under construction in these cities. Companies do not publish this information voluntarily, and the government refuses to release technical documentation for licensing, citing industrial secrecy.In early April, the National Electricity System Operator (ONS)rejectedCasa dos Ventos’s request for access to the grid, citing risks to grid stability. The ministry of mines and energy then asked for the calculations to be redone to explore possible grid adjustments.Big tech companies admit that they are consuming water in sensitive areas due to the demands of AI. In its 2024 sustainability report,Microsoft saidthat 42% of its water came from areas of “water stress”, andGoogle saidthe same year that 15% of its water use was in areas of “high water scarcity”.The large amounts of water used by datacentres keep computers and machines cool, preventing them from overheating. However, some is lost to evaporation, which can exacerbate the climate crisis in the regions where they are set up. As AI models improve, they need more processing power, which requires more energy and cooling.

This is more than half of the UK’s annual water consumption.However, according to Shaolei Ren, a researcher at UC Riverside and co-author of the article, there is an essential difference between withdrawal (the water taken out of the system) and consumption (water withdrawal that evaporates) regarding datacentres.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In other words, the water is lost.Datacentres can be cooled in two ways. One is air conditioning, a power-inefficient solution for extensive facilities.Wateris the second option.View image in fullscreenThe Nova Metrópole neighbourhood on the outskirts of Caucaia. In 2019, water became unfit for consumption in the city after reservoirs were depleted.Photograph: Marília Camelo/The GuardianOne technique is to use radiators with fans in a closed water circuit, where the water is recycled or reused, similar to the system in a car engine, but costs are high. Another option is cooling towers, which remove heat from hot water using evaporation, so the cold water can be pumped back into the system. The last method involves spraying water into the air to make it more humid and lower the temperature.But there are still some inefficiencies. “Both evaporation and spraying result in water loss,” says Emilio Francesquini, an associate professor at the Federal University of ABC.A small datacentre with a 1MW capacity consumes 25.5m litres of water yearly, losing 1% (255,000 litres) via evaporation.In Pecém, alternatives to water extraction would be seawater desalination or the purchase of recycled water from Fortaleza, says Francisco Assis de Souza Filho, a professor at the Federal University of Ceará.He says it is up to the state government, as part of the environmental licensing process, to grant a datacentre a water concession.Ronildo Mastroianni, a technical director at Esplar, an NGO that has worked in Ceará for 50 years, says a project that requires intensive water consumption in a semi-arid region does not make sense. “A small push is all it takes to become arid,” he says.Mastroianni cautions that these projects could result in permanent watershed changes. He warns of a weakeningcaatinga– a fragile ecosystem – and growing food insecurity due to water shortages in rural areas. No representatives from local non-governmental organisations or the dozens ofquilombolaand Indigenous communities were invited to discuss the project, he says.View image in fullscreenDue to water stress, many communities have cisterns to store water to ensure supply during times of scarcity.Photograph: Marília Camelo/The GuardianOther Latin American countries have also experienced a datacentre industry boom.Chile has 22 datacentres, 16 located in the greater Santiago area. In December, the government announced anational planfor 30 new projects, as the country is expected to move from a medium to a high level of water stress by 2040, with the likelihood ofa decrease in water availability.In Chile, the government and companies are facing a growing resistance. In 2019, Google announced plans fora second datacentrein Santiago, where the activist organisation Socio-Environmental Community Movement for Land and Water (Mosacat) estimated that the project would extract 7bn litres of water annually.Power struggle: will Brazil’s booming datacentre industry leave ordinary people in the dark?Read moreAfter a series of demonstrations, a Santiago court reviewed the project.

Ive and Altman are worth backing, given the products they have overseen, but observers say they have set themselves an ambitious goal – one made all the more difficult by the legacy of Ive’s time at Apple.“It really will have to be amazing to prise people away from today’s screen-based devices,” says Martha Bennett, an analyst at Forrester Research.Bennett points to the failure of AI hardware devices such as Humane’s defunct AI “pin” – a small, wearable AI assistant thatreceived poor reviews– as an example of how the duo have a “steep hill to climb”. Ive described the Humane pin and the equally small-scale Rabbit R1 device as “very poor products”.So what was the prototype that Altman was testing? He has told employees thatOpenAIplans to build 100m AI “companions” that will be part of users’ everyday life, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday.The product will be “unobtrusive” and capable of being fully aware of a user’s surroundings and life, the paper report added, and it will be a third core device that someone will have on their desk after a MacBook Pro and aniPhone. The device is neither a phone nor a pair of glasses; Altman said Ive had been sceptical about building something to be worn on the body, according to the WSJ.The video indicated that the fruits of the io deal – a complex arrangement whereby Ive’s LoveFrom design company assumes design and creative oversight of OpenAI and io – will emerge next year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Lili is a co-production between the New York-based game studio iNK Stories (creator of1979 Revolution: Black Friday, about a photojournalist in Iran) and the Royal Shakespeare Company, and it’s been turning heads with its eye-catching translocation of Macbeth to modern-day Iran.“It’s been such an incredible coup to have it as the first video game experience at Cannes,” says iNK Stories co-founder Vassiliki Khonsari. “People have gone in saying, I’m not familiar playing games, so I may just try it out for five minutes. […] But then once they’re in, there is this growing sense of empowerment that people from the film world are feeling.”The Cannes festival’s Immersive Competition began in 2024, although the lineup doesn’t usually feature traditional video games.“VR films and projection mapping is the thrust of it,” says iNK Stories’ other co-founder, Vassiliki’s husband Navid Khonsari. But Lili weaves live-action footage with video game mechanics in a similar way to a game such asTelling LiesorImmortality. Its lead, Zar Amir Ebrahimi, won best actress at Cannes three years ago.Lili focuses on the story of LadyMacbeth, here cast as the ambitious wife of an upwardly mobile officer in the Basij (a paramilitary volunteer militia within the Islamic Revolutionary Guard in Iran). As in the play, she plots a murder to secure her husband’s rise. “I think that the narrative of Lady Macbeth is that she’s manipulative, and that’s exactly what got us interested,” says Navid.“The social limitations based on her gender forced her to try to attain whatever leadership role she can,” he continues. “If she was a man, she would have been one of the greatest kings that country would have ever experienced, but because she was a woman she had to work within the structure that was there for her. And I think this is the same thing that we have with our Lili character: because of society, she’s limited to how high she can rise.”The player is cast as a member of the Hecate Web, a group of hackers who stand in for Macbeth’s witches, and you begin by accessing Lili’s phone and computer, watching her on CCTV cameras inside her home. The oppression of surveillance and censorship is a key theme. At one point Lili tries to access a YouTube makeup tutorial, only to be blocked by the state’s firewall. The fact that the player takes on an uncomfortable voyeuristic role is intentional. “We’re all part of the problem when it comes to surveillance, when it comes to looking at each other, spying on each other,” says Navid.View image in fullscreen‘She’s suffocating in the various layers of masks that she must put on’ … Zar Amir Ebrahimi in Lili.Photograph: Ellie SmithYou can bypass it to give her access, however, prompting a memorable scene in which she wraps her head in clingfilm before applying eyeliner and lipstick. “That is her ritual, applying makeup in a world that she cannot do that [in], without her husband knowing or anyone else knowing,” says Vassiliki. “We love it as this sort of allegory, that she’s suffocating in the world and in the various layers of masks that she must put on herself … our Lady Macbeth, our Lili, has an awakening, and all of those tools that we’ve used to hack her become tools that we actually give her to help her take the system down from within.”Lili is scheduled for release in late 2026, and the RSC’s Sarah Ellis says that it might well be turned into a play at some point in the future. Navid says there are already plans for a film version, using some of the same footage shot for the game – a reminder that the boundaries between the worlds of gaming, movies and theatre are increasingly porous. This is unlikely to be the last time the RSC is involved in games.“I was always interested in games, and the convergence of games and theatre in particular,” says Ellis, who originally approached iNK with the idea for this collaboration. “We’ve worked with some of the best Shakespeare scholars … Professor Emma Smith from Oxford has been an absolute keystone in the dramaturgy of this work,” says Ellis. Smith has said that if Shakespeare were alive today, he’d be writing for games, and Ellis agrees: “He was an innovator.”Explore more on these topicsGamesCannes film festivalFestivalsIranMacbethfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It reflects a massive war crime, as the international criminal court has alreadycharged, and arguablygenocide. But it in no sense justifies the murder of two young Israeli embassy workers in Washington by a man who thenchanted: “Free, free Palestine”. Nothing justifies violence against civilians.The killing of Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrimoccurredon Wednesday evening outside the Capital Jewish Museum, where the American Jewish Committee was hosting a reception for young diplomats. The suspect, identified as Elias Rodriguez of Chicago, was detained shortly after the shooting. His social media accounts indicated that he had been involved in pro-Palestinian activism.Beyond that, we don’t know exactly what motivated him, but he is likely to have acted in retaliation for Israeli atrocities in Gaza. That would be unequivocally wrong.That is not to deny the severity of what Israel is doing in Gaza. As the news spread of the killings in Washington, Israeli strikes in Gaza killedat least 86 people, according to Gaza’s health ministry. After an11-weektotal blockade of Gaza, Israel has begun to allow in a merepittanceof humanitarian aid. Even the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, described it as “minimal”, just enough to avoid problems with the US government. At least 29 children and elderly people have already died from “starvation-related” deaths in recent days, the Palestinian health ministersaid, warning that thousands more are at risk.To make matters worse, Netanyahu has expanded his war aims. No longer is he seeking only the release of Hamas’s hostages and its relinquishment of power. He now alsosaysthat Israel will not stop fighting untilDonald Trump’s grotesque plan to expel all Palestinians from Gaza is implemented – a massivewar crimeand likely crime against humanity.International humanitarian law, or the laws of war, donotapply to the gunman in Washington. That law is meant for governments and organized military forces. By all appearances the gunman was acting on his own. But the principles of international humanitarian law can help us to assess this crime.A basic premise of that law is that war crimes by one side never justify war crimes by the other. The duty to comply with international humanitarian law is absolute, notreciprocal.That same law mandates thatciviliansare never legitimate targets unless they take a direct part in hostilities. The two victims in Washington were doing no such thing. Lischinsky, was reported to be a research assistant in the political department at the Israeli embassy. Milgrim organized trips to Israel. Neither activity is remotely military in nature. These two young adults would be utterly inappropriate targets even in war, and needless to say, there is no war in Washington.Frustration at Israeli atrocities in Gaza is understandable. There seems to be nothing that the Israeli government can do that would stop Trump from continuing to arm and fund it. But endorsing murder because of the other side’s atrocities is a sure path to a bloodbath. Indeed, it was that war-crime logic that seems to have led the Israeli government, responding to Hamas’s murder and abduction of civilians on 7 October 2023, to have pursued its war in Gaza withlittle regardfor the lives of Palestinian civilians that it has killed in the tens of thousands.Difficult as it may be to accept, the proper response to Israeli war crimes is condemnation, prosecution and halting the arming and funding of these atrocities, but not acts of violence against civilians who are somehow associated with Israel or its government.But that is not a point the Israeli government seems to want to make. Having itself engaged in tit-for-tat killings, the Israeli government instead tried to profit from the disturbing episode by blaming its critics. Israel’s foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar,said: “The attack is the direct consequence of the virulent and toxic antisemitic rhetoric against Israel and Jewish communities around the world that has been going on since October 7.”What did you do during the genocide in Gaza? | Arwa MahdawiRead moreThat is wrong on two counts. First, there is no evidence that the gunman acted because of Israel’s critics as opposed to Israel’s conduct. Second, itcheapensthe concept of antisemitism to equate it with legitimate criticism of Israeli war crimes. Antisemitism is a real and growing problem, but if the concept is misused to deflect condemnation of Israeli atrocities, it weakens protection for Jews around the world.There are lessons to be drawn from this tragedy. Critics of the Israeli government’s atrocious conduct in Gaza should be clear that their focus is the authors: Netanyahu, the generals directing the slaughter, and the soldiers carrying it out, but not the Israeli people, not people who happen to work as civilians for the Israeli government, and not Jews.The Israeli government might also reconsider its policy of endless reprisals. Not that I am holding my breath in anticipation, but it is nice to think that the needless and unjustified killing of these two young embassy workers could prompt a rethinking of the government’s own callous treatment of Palestinian civilians, whose horrible and mounting death toll is also needless and unjustified.Kenneth Roth, former executive director of Human Rights Watch (1993-2022), is a visiting professor at Princeton’s School of Public and International Affairs.

It was when a reporter asked the US president what he wanted his counterpart to do about it. Mr Trumpreplied: “I don’t know.”Leaders enter the Oval Office uneasily, especially since the kicking administered toVolodymyr Zelenskyy. The South African president came armed with gratitude, two golf stars, a billionaire and compliments on the decor – and kept a cool head and a straight face as he was ambushed. Mr Ramaphosa later described it as “robust engagement”. But, in truth, it was a clash of two worlds rather than an interaction.On one side sat a political heavyweight who calmly asserted the facts; on the other, Mr Trump, espousing wild and inflammatory myths. One side wanted to do bilateral business; the other to pander to the grievances of his domestic base, many of whom doubtless relished the public scolding of an anti-apartheid veteran. No solution was proffered to the imaginary problem.The ruling African National Congress (ANC) has fallen far short in too many regards. Violent crime is rife. But the administration’s accusations invert reality. White South Africans are 7% of the population but stillown 72% of the land. Experts say that it is poor black people, not wealthier whites, who are disproportionately likely to be victims of violence. Yet as the scholar Nicky Falkof has written, white South Africans have become a “cautionary talefor the White far right [internationally] … central to the landscape and language of White supremacy”. Look where DEI gets you.Mr Trump aired complaints about the “large-scale killing” of white farmersin his first term, amplifying conspiracy theories thatoriginated in far-right forums. Since then, he has grown closer to the South African-born Elon Musk, who hasaccusedpoliticians there of “promoting white genocide”. The US has nowcut aidto South Africa, accusing the government of “unjust racial discrimination” and attacking its genocide case against Israel at the international court of justice. Washington hasexpelled the South African ambassadorand givenwhite Afrikaners asylumeven as it turns away those fleeing wars.Mr Trump’s divisive conspiracy theories and failed attempt to humiliate Mr Ramaphosa appear, ironically, to be fostering unity on foreign affairs within South African politics, where the ANC and its (white-led) coalition partner, the Democratic Alliance, have hadvery different histories and priorities. The US still accounts for a tenth of the country’s trade. South Africa must shore up itsauto sectorandagriculture, given its sky-highunemployment rate. But like other governments, Pretoria is salvaging what it can in US relations now, while looking ahead to diversifying its ties. Few expect Washingtonto renewduty-free trade arrangements for African states this autumn.Warming relations with other western countries is one option. But increasing closeness to China, already South Africa’s top trading partner, looks like an inevitability. Members of the Brics grouping see an opportunityto strengthen ties, though South Africa is discovering that expansiondoes not always mean greater influencefor its dominant players. Mr Trump is looking for kudos, free planes and red meat to throw to his base. Washington’s partners are increasingly looking elsewhere. It’s in US interests to show them respect and nurture longstanding relationships.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Trump’s budget bill offers the exact oppositeSteven GreenhouseThe ‘big, beautiful’ measure going through Congress would cut health, food and education benefits – and offer a huge boost to the richestThu 22 May 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 22 May 2025 12.44 EDTShareWithDonald Trumppushing hard to give big tax cuts to the rich and do huge favors for crypto billionaires, it was jarring to see a photo of aTrump aide carrying a signthat said: “President Trump’s Pro-Worker Priorities”. The aide was about to place the sign on Trump’s lectern; it mentioned such “pro-worker priorities” as ending federal taxes on tips and overtime pay: catchy, but scattershot policies that will help only a fraction of the nation’s workers.Not surprisingly, that sign made no mention of Trump’s many anti-worker policies that will do serious harm to millions of workers and their families. Trump’s “big, beautiful” budget bill, which is advancing in the House, includes thebiggest cuts ever to Medicaid, anearly 30% reductionin food assistance, and a$350bn cutin aid that helps working-class kids afford college. Trump has also pushed toend home-heating assistanceand to make it harder for millions of Americans to afford Obamacare. If that isn’t painful enough, GOP deficit hawks have vowed to torpedo the budget bill unless it includes even more cuts. Under the current Trump House bill, at least 13.7 million peoplewould lose health coverage– and the deficit hawks’ demands would increase that number.Even some prominent Republicans acknowledge that the Republican bill contains policies that will screw workers. Josh Hawley, a Republican senator from Missouri, slammed the Trump-GOP push to chop hundreds of billions of dollars from Medicaid. “These are working peopleand their children who need healthcare, and it’s just wrong to go and cut their healthcare when they’re trying to make ends meet, trying to help their kids,” Hawley said. He added: “No Republican should be supportingMedicaid benefit cuts.”To give a truer picture of what Trump is all about, that Trump aide should have also been carrying a sign that said: “President Trump’s Pro-Billionaire Priorities”. Those priorities are more ambitious and will cost far more than Trump’s “pro-worker priorities” – they include over a trillion dollars in tax cuts for the wealthy, stratagems to help crypto billionaires grow ever richer, andbig cuts to the IRS budgetto reduce the chances that the ultra-wealthy will get audited. To please his billionaire finance buddies, Trump has sought togut the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which was created to protect typical families from financial scams and extortionate banking practices. And let’s not forget the many ways Trump is helping tosteer more businesstoElon Musk, the world’s richest person and Trump’s biggest campaign contributor (to thetune of $270mbacking the president and other Republicans).The Center for American Progress points out that the Trump/Republican budget bill would, if implemented, “bethe largest transfer of wealthfrom the poor to the rich in a single law in US history”. Another progressive thinktank, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, notes that the budget billwould cut $1.1tnfrom food aid, Medicaid and other health programs while lavishing $1.1tn in tax cuts upon those earning over $500,000. Not only that, the 1m households earning over $1m a year would receive $105bn in tax cuts in 2027 – that’smore than the tax cutsgoing to the 127m households earning under $100,000.Republicans defend their painful program cuts as healthy, saying they will hold down the budget deficit. But there is of course a far less painful and more worker-friendly way to reduce the budget deficit: don’t extend the trillions in Trump tax cuts that overwhelmingly favor the rich.When Trump boasts about the “big, beautiful” bill, he talks only about the tax cuts, but never about howthe cuts in Medicaid and Snap(Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) will hurt millions of families. The Republican party consistently fails to note thatone in four small-business ownersand one in four veterans live in households that receive help from Snap, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program. Under the planned cuts to Snap,42 million people– includingone in five childrenin the US – could see their food assistance reduced.According to thePenn Wharton Budget model, when one factors in the Medicaid and Snap cuts along with the tax cuts, the Trump-House bill would cause Americans earning less than $17,000 a year to lose $1,030 on average in after-tax income starting in 2026. Households earning between $17,000 and $51,000 a year would lose around $700 on average. The very wealthy do far better. For those in the richest 0.1% – that is, households earning at least $4.3m a year – their after-tax income would jump by over $388,000.That doesn’t sound very pro-worker to me. It’s a perversion of the truth for Trump to boast of his pro-worker bona fides when he steadfastly refuses to push for the two things that would do most to lift workers’ living standards: push to raise workers’ pay and push to strengthen labor unions and worker bargaining power. Not only has Trump done nothing to increase the paltry $7.25-an-hour federal minimum wage, but he killed a Biden-era regulation that required federal contractors to pay their workersat least $17.75 an hour. Now many of those workers will see their pay sink to $13.30 an hour. What’s more, Trump has sought to sabotage unions, not strengthen them. He has movedto strip 1 million federal employeesof their right to bargain while also seeking tocripple the National Labor Relations Board, which protects workers’ ability to bargain for better pay and conditions.As for Trump’s call to end the tax on tips, that will help many restaurant servers and hotel housekeepers, but the Yale Budget Lab says that provision has a narrow scope and will helpless than 3% of all workers.Last year, candidate Trumpsaid: “As soon as I get to office, we will make housing much more affordable.” But second-term Trump is doing just the opposite. His budget calls for a devastating40% cut in rental assistancethat millions of Americans rely on to pay their monthly rent. Candidate Trump also said: “Your heating and air conditioning, electricity, gasoline –all can be cut down in half.” But for millions of Americans he is increasing that burden by pushing to end aprogram that helps six millionstruggling households afford to heat and cool their homes.Many blue-collar Americans are eager to send their kids to college, but Trump and House Republicans would make that harder.Around one in eight Americanshave federal student loans, which have been key to enabling millions of people to afford college. But Republicans want toeliminate subsidized loansfor undergraduates andincrease the minimum monthly paymentsthat low-income borrowers already have a hard time paying.Trump boasts he is pro-worker, but he is doing absolutely nothing to help with what many workers say are their biggest priorities: making housing more affordable, reducing the cost of childcare and healthcare, making it easier to send one’s kids to college, and bringing down prices. Billionaires can rejoice that Trump is capitulating to them and their priorities, but American workers shouldn’t be fooled into believing that Trump is addressing their needs.Steven Greenhouse is a journalist and author focusing on labor and the workplace, as well as economic and legal issuesExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionTrump administrationUS politicsRepublicansUS CongressHouse of RepresentativesWorkers' rightscommentShareReuse this content"

What started off as a series of pleasantries about golfbetween the US president and South African president Cyril Ramaphosa’s delegationquickly turned into a lecture – complete with a video screening and reams of printed-out news articles – about how a white genocide is supposedly under way in my home country.The delegation was largely successful in correcting that narrative. It emphasised that crime affects South Africans of all races and that white citizens are not specifically targeted. Zingiswa Losi, president of the Congress of South African Trade Unions, rightly pointed out that in rural areas, it is Black women who bear the brunt of violent crime.On the surface, this might all seem like a familiar conflict – one between Trump’s deluded and emboldened hard-right vision of the world and a country’s leadership trying its best to stick to the facts without aggrieving the beast too much (SouthAfricais still facing 30% tariffs, after all). But as an investigative journalist and researcher who focuses on land dispossession and reform in South Africa, to me the encounter looked different. All I could see was a missed opportunity.One spark for this ongoing showdown between the Maga movement in the US (allied with some white Afrikaners in South Africa) and the African National Congress (ANC) government has been the introduction of a land reform act that was passed in January. The law aims to address the inequalities of the white-minority-rule era by tackling an issue that has been ignored for too long in post-apartheid South Africa and lies at the root of many of our problems: land. To explain why, let me return to the subject of golf – a subject that feels all the more appropriate given that, at Trump’s request, Ramaphosa’s delegation included professional golfersErnie Els and Retief Goosen.1:12Donald Trump ambushes South Africa's president with video falsely claiming white genocide – videoI’ve written extensively about golf courses and golf estates. Take the suburb of Fourways in northern Johannesburg, which contains some of the most exclusive and luxurious golf estates in the country. With homes that sell for tens of millions of rands, these enclaves serve South Africa’s wealthy elite. Among their many amenities such as private lagoons, nature trails, sports fields and high-end restaurants, the most coveted is safety. In a city with high rates of car hijackings and home invasions, their surveillance systems, access control and electrified perimeter walls offer peace of mind that is a luxury in Johannesburg.Inside those walls lies a world largely insulated from the realities of South Africa – a world that is overwhelmingly white, even thoughmore than 80%of the South African population is Black.Before Fourways became a hub of luxury living, it was an agricultural region made up of farms and smallholdings. The land was seized in the 19th century by Afrikaner settlers who forced the original Black residents into labour tenancies. Stripped of land rights, those tenants could only stay on their ancestral land if they worked it for the settlers.In the 1980s, as apartheid began to falter and the prospect of democracy grew, many white landowners sold their farms to private developers and fled the area or the country. The labour tenants were left behind, only to be forcibly relocated to underresourced townships such as Alexandra and Soweto. They lost not just their homes and livelihoods but also family graves and burial plots that could not be moved.Some 30 years into democracy, the former labour tenants of Fourways, like the majority of South African land claimants, are still trapped in a backlogged, corrupted land-claims process with their hope dwindling that they’ll ever be granted compensation or restoration of their land rights.This is why it’s so tragic that Ramaphosa’s team has been framing the failure of land reform as proof of successful race relations. It’s as if they’re effectively saying: “Look – there can be no ‘white genocide’ in South Africa because white people own72% of farmland!” This is factually correct. However, our inability to redistribute land, and thus create a more equitable and sustainable South Africa, is not a marker of national unity. It is the ANC’s most glaring policy failure, one the government is only belatedly trying to fix with this controversial law.Trump ambushes South African president with video and false claims of anti-white racismRead moreThe crowded, impoverished townships where the state relocated Black South Africans under theGroup Areas Actremain among the most dangerous places in the country. Generations of South Africans have been cut off from the wealth-building power of land ownership. Here’s the key point: this economic exclusion, combined with mass unemployment, fuels the very crime that the delegation insisted affects everyone equally.I appreciate that it may not have been the right occasion and Trump was probably not a receptive audience for a nuanced conversation. Still, it saddens me to think of the resources poured into this mission to correct the damage being wrought by a malicious, white supremacist agenda in South Africa and the US. Meanwhile the historically dispossessed South Africans who need these resources most are left to flounder, overlooked as the true victims of the violence of the apartheid regime and the dark shadow it has cast over our young democracy.Most Black South Africans will never be able to afford to move to areas such as Fourways. They live in places the government once designated for removal, with limited access to jobs, safety or infrastructure. They are the ones most exposed to violent crime, not those living in fortified golf estates and large fortified farms.Zanele Mji is a writer, investigative journalist and podcaster based in Johannesburg, South AfricaExplore more on these topicsSouth AfricaOpinionRaceCyril RamaphosaDonald TrumpAfricacommentShareReuse this content"

Now that Gaza is flattened, turned into mass graves and rubble, people who have kept quiet for the past 19 months areslowly starting to speak up. Now that Israel and the US are not even trying to pretend that they aren’t intent on emptying Gaza andthe West Bankof Palestinians, of “taking control” of all of the land, some criticism has started to trickle in.Over in the UK, they’ve pulled out the “e” word. After 19 months of genocidal violence and almost three months of astarvation campaignthe UK has decided to describe the situation asegregious.The UK, along with France and Canada, has threatened – and I’m sure Israel’s leaders are quaking in their boots over this – that there might be a “concrete” response if the mass killing and starvation continues.Meanwhile, there’s been a slight shift in the media coverage. Instead of just parroting the Israeli government’s talking points,major media figures such as Piers Morganare starting to challenge Israeli spokespeople about why the international media has not been freely allowed into Gaza to see what is happening for themselves.All of this is too little, too late. It will not bring back littleHind Rajab, a five-year-old girl who was killed when 335 bullets were fired by Israeli soldiers into the car the terrified child was trapped in. Or the aid workers executed by Israel and buried in shallow graves.It will not rebuild the hospitals, kindergartens,IVF centersand universities that have been systematically levelled by Israel. It will not give kids in Gaza – thelargest cohortof child amputees in the world – their limbs back. It will not fix the long-term damage that malnutrition and almost two years of no schooling has done to a generation.The criticism we are seeing now is simply an exercise in ass-covering. Performative opposition, so that in the future, when the true scale of the slaughter inGazais clear, the politicians and media figures responsible for enabling and justifying this horror for 19 months can say: “Look! I said something! I didn’t just stand by!”And what will you say? When future generations read about Gaza with horror and wonder how the western world, with all its moral superiority, itsrule-based orderand its focus on international human rights law, allowed a livestreamed genocide to happen, what will you say? When future generations learn that, for 19 months, we woke up every morning to videos of children being burned alive – bombed with weapons that the US taxpayer helped pay for and the western world helped justify – will you be able to say that you spoke up?If you have stayed quiet until now, telling yourself that all this is just far too complicated for you to speak up about, it is not too late to raise your voiceA lot of ordinary people will be able to hold their head up high and say they were not silent; that they use whatever platforms or privilege they had.Logan Rozos, an NYU student who had his diploma withheld because he used his commencement speech to recognize “the atrocities currently happening inPalestine”, will be able to say he wasn’t quiet. The studentsexpelledfrom Columbia University for protesting will be able to say they put their futures on the line in the name of justice. Actors like Melissa Barrera, who wasfired from Scream 7over her pro-Palestine posts, will be able to say that she prioritized integrity over her career.The people with real power, however, will not be able to say the same; they will not be able to wash the blood from their hands. It seems likely that all this horror will eventually be pinned on Benjamin Netanyahu while others try to absolve themselves of blame. But this isn’t just Netanyahu’s genocide. This is the Biden-Harris genocide; the Trump-Vance genocide; the Keir Starmer and David Lammy genocide. It is Microsoft CEOSatya Nadella’sgenocide. This is the mainstream media’s genocide. The list goes on.We would not be where we are today were it not for the systematic dehumanization of Palestinians by the western media and the suppression of pro-Palestinian speech. We would not be here if western reporters and Joe Biden hadn’t manufactured consent for the genocide by repeating the incendiary lie that Hamas hadbeheaded babies. We would not be here if the Biden administration had actually worked towards a ceasefire instead oflying about their effortsand giving Israelcarte blancheto do whatever it liked. Eventually history will judge all these people.But perhaps that is wishful thinking. Perhaps I am being naive in thinking that, even if all the Palestinians are sent off to exile inLibyaand Gaza is turned into a Trump-branded resort, there will ever be a reckoning. After all, how many Americans or Europeans really know about theNakba? How many people know about Israel’s “Cast Thy Bread” operation in 1948 where the drinking water in Palestinian villages was poisoned? How many Americans know aboutRachel Corrie, the young non-violent activist from Washington who was killed by an Israeli bulldozer while she tried to save Palestinian homes in Gaza from destruction in 2003?The Guardian view on the calls to save Gaza: Palestinians need deeds, not words | EditorialRead moreEver since the Nakba, Palestinian voices have been actively suppressed and Israeli atrocities have been minimized. (One Palestinian writer I know had a piece about mapping in Palestine pulled from a very prestigious US magazine several years ago after they refused to remove discussion of the Nakba.) You will have heard of every atrocity committed by a Palestinian, however. You will have been told over and over again that all this started on 7 October 2023.It is too late for real justice in Gaza now. We can never bring back the dead children. We can’t erase what has happened. But it is not too late for accountability. The atrocities must be documented. The dead in Gaza must be properly counted so we know how many people have been murdered. The media must stop parroting the official death figure of more than 55,000 people being dead without putting this into context and noting that when you account for indirect deaths from starvation, disease, or cold, the real number of deaths is probablyenormously higher.If you have stayed quiet until now, telling yourself that all this is just far too complicated for you to speak up about, it is not too late to raise your voice. What is happening in Gaza is different from the horrors happening in Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo because, if you are in the west,it is happening in your name.It is happening with your tax money and with the help of your leaders. If you are in the US, your elected representatives have delivered astanding ovationfor this genocide. We are all complicit. Although some of us are far more complicit than others.So, again, think about what you want to say to future generations when they ask what you did at this very moment. Silence is not neutrality. And your silence will not be forgotten.

But social media has given it a whole new dimension, and powerful people now have an army of rabid fans ready to do that work for them.That’s exactly what’s happening to the singer and actor Halle Bailey, after she was granted a domestic violence restraining order against her child’s father, the YouTuber and Twitch streamer Darryl Dwayne Granberry Jr, known as DDG. Once the news broke, fans jumped to his defence, ramping up an existing campaign of trolling and harassment, where she’s been accused of everything frominfidelityduring their relationship to keeping their child from him after it was over – the latter a narrative that DDG himself hashelped fuel.The Jay-Z allegation once again reveals a culture of impunity in hip-hop | Tayo BeroRead moreSince news of therestraining orderbroke last week, we’ve gotten some details of the physical, verbal and financial abuse that Bailey alleges, including photos of injuries submitted as evidence. In that time, even more accounts have spawned, claiming that Bailey islyingabout the alleged attack, and was herself abusive to DDG. Those criticizing her range from faceless troll accounts tomajorTwitch streamers with hundreds of thousands of followers, and even Twitter/X communities including one where DDGhimselfis a moderator.If this doesn’t feel like deja vu then you’re not paying attention. Just last year, hundreds of X, Instagram, TikTok and YouTube accounts popped up dedicated to keeping public sentiment about theAmber Heard and Johnny Depp trialfirmly in his favor. Heard was accused of being unhinged and, of course, said to be abusive herself. From people making fun of her testimony to memes about her crying on the stand going viral, there was no regard for her humanity or even the horrifying things she alleged happened to her – and it hasn’t stopped.Jennifer Hough, a Black woman who accusedNicki Minaj’s current husband, Kenneth Petty, of raping her when they were minors, has also felt the fury of a toxic fandom. Petty wasconvicted of attempted rapein the incident after a plea deal. When he was arrested in 2020 for failing to register as a sex offender, Minaj’s notoriouslyhateful“Barbz” got to work trying to discredit Hough, sometimesparrotingrumors that Minaj herself had started.With DDG though, this isn’t just your average social media fan; these are the children of the streaming age, a generation whose experience of fandom means being constantly and staunchly engaged with their favourite streamers – staying glued to their screens, watching every waking moment of these people’s lives, and forming twisted parasocial bonds with them.And did I forget to mention that all of this is happening against the grimy backdrop of themanosphere? Young men online are more misogynistic than ever, and the internet’s culture around hating women has gone from fringe forums to becoming a broad social movement where rather than being shamed, men are applauded for sharing their most violent, hateful thoughts about women.The patriarchy demands loyalty and requires that its beneficiaries pay their dues in acts of hatred. That means that anyone who doesn’t join in the bullying or speaks up for women is automatically deemed a traitor and punished accordingly. To be a prominent man online today can mean either falling in line with misogyny or risking mockery and ostracization.Diddy’s lawyers are banking on the ‘mutual abuse’ defence. Newsflash: it’s not a thing | Tayo BeroRead moreThe Houston rapper Slim Thug was called everything but a child of God forsimply believingMegan Thee Stallionwhen she said she was shot by Tory Lanez, and DDG justcalled outSoulja Boy (who wasfound liable for assaulthimself last month) for standing up for Bailey.Still, there’s a different kind of loyalty that’s being weaponized here, whereBlackmen specifically (and women for that matter) are being asked to protect their own, even when they cause harm. There’s no doubt that Black men are unfairly targeted by the criminal justice system, and continue to be stereotyped as violent. But there are Black men who abuse, disregard and disrespect women that they are in intimate relationships with. Both things can be true. And that delicate balance is often exploited to help cast abusive men as victims of a society that does indeed hate them.From supreme court justice Clarence Thomasclaimingthe investigation into sexual harassment claims against him were a “high-tech lynching”, to the actorJonathan Majorsgoing on asympathy tourafter he was convicted of misdemeanour assault and harassment, Black men invoking the racial persecution defence is as typical as it is diabolical.What this all really means is that the court of public opinion has been compromised; we can no longer rely on good sense to prevail even if the courts are unreliable.And at the end of the day, it seems like the message is the same – in a world designed to protect men, women simply can’t win.Tayo Bero is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsWomenOpinionHalle BaileyCelebrityGenderMegan Thee StallionNicki MinajClarence ThomascommentShareReuse this content"

Israel hasannounced its intentto gain full indefinite control over Gaza, in effect aiming for annexation. This was after the international court of justice found Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territoryillegaland demanded it end its occupation as rapidly as possible and provide full reparations to Palestinians.Israel’s increased violence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory also comes after it denied all food, water and supplies from entering Gaza for over 75 days. In March,child acute malnutritionincreased by more than 80%. The price of wheat flour hasincreased by 3,000%since February. The World Food Programmeran out of foodfor kitchens in Gaza on 25 April and the World Central Kitchenclosed its operationson 7 May. If adequate aid does not enter Gaza immediately,14,000 Palestinian babies may die.None of this is new, since Israel has been using hunger as a weapon against civilians in Gazasince 2000. When Benjamin Netanyahuannouncedon 1 March that the “entry of all goods & supplies to the Gaza Strip [would] be halted”, he was flagrantly defying international law – snubbing the international criminal court warrant calling for his arrest for the war crime of starvation and the international court of justice provisional measures in March 2024 recognizing that famine and starvation was rampant in Gaza, creating a risk of genocide. Israeli officials, along with theUS ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, have conditioned the provision of humanitarian relief to Palestinian civilians on Hamas’s release of hostages. Whilehostage-taking is bannedunder international law, there is no situation in which humanitarian aid to civilians can be used as a bargaining chip.The Guardian view on the calls to save Gaza: Palestinians need deeds, not words | EditorialRead moreLast week, HamasreleasedEdan Alexander, the last living US citizen that they held. Soon after, on Monday, with Israel’s permission, the UN arranged fornine trucks to go to Gaza, followed by another 93 trucks on Tuesday.This is welcome but still amounts to almost nothing. Before October 2023, 50% of people inGazawere hungry and 80% relied on humanitarian relief – and this was when 500 trucks of supplies were coming in every day. After 19 months of a starvation campaign, Palestinians in Gaza need a lot more than 500 trucks a day.Israel has put forward an aid plan for Gaza that has beendescribed by the UN secretary generalas not based on international legal principles of humanity, impartiality, independence and neutrality but rather a system of “controlling and callously limiting aid down to the last calorie and grain of flour”.Israel’s aid plan is designed to forcibly displace and concentrate Palestinians into southern Gaza all under the close screening and surveillance of mercenaries or Israeli armed forces. The UN has described the plan as a “military strategy” and a “deliberate attempt to weaponize aid”. Unicef has said that Israel is using aid as “bait” to lure civilians into militarized zones, forcing civilians to choose between “displacement and death”.Israel’s aid plan is designed to forcibly displace and concentrate Palestinians into southern GazaLast week,Tom Fletcher, the under secretary general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator,briefed the UN security councilon the humanitarian situation and the protection of aid workers in Gaza. Fletcher was very clear: “Israel is deliberately and unashamedly imposing inhumane conditions on civilians in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.” He described the Israeli-designed aid plan plainly: “It practically excludes many, including people with disabilities, women, children, the elderly, the wounded … It makes aid conditional on political and military aims. It makes starvation a bargaining chip. It is cynical sideshow. A deliberate distraction. A fig leaf for further violence and displacement.”The US may be taking over the aid plan in Israel. The US government operation will be run by a private foundation, theGaza Humanitarian Foundation, and supported by Israeli military protection. This private foundation isopaquewith no clear details about its source of funding or how it will operate in Gaza. Regardless of who runs it, this “made in Israel” plan has beenrejected by the UNand has been determined by UN-supported experts to be a plan that willnot prevent famine. All this while hundreds of UN humanitarian trucks are at the Gaza borders ready to enter and take advantage of the long-standing relief networks. Recently, when an unarmed civilian ship tried to bring humanitarian aid into Gaza, it wasbombed by a dronein international waters in the Mediterranean Sea.Israel is annihilating Palestinian children. Amer Rabea was one of them | Ahmad IbsaisRead moreWhile Israel’s brutality and the US’s callousness aligns with their public statements, the international response has been slow and ghastly. On Monday, the UK, France and Canadastated: “If Israel does not cease the renewed military offensive and lift its restrictions on humanitarian aid, we will take further concrete actions in response.” On Tuesday, the UK suspended trade negotiations with Israel. For 19 months I haveclosely followed the situation in Gaza, bearing witness to how 1 million children in Gaza have been starved by Israel. At this point, unsubstantiated political threats and suspended trade negotiations ring hollow.Fletcher called upon the security council to act now to prevent genocide. But the security council is predictably debilitated by the US veto. What is to be done?When the security council fails to act to a threat of peace or security because of veto, the UN charter empowers the UN general assembly to step in through what’s called the “Uniting for Peace” provision. Under this provision, the general assembly can pass a resolution calling for UN peacekeepers to accompany humanitarian convoys and deliver the necessary aid into Gaza, regardless of Israel’s plans and permissions. The UN general assembly must break the illegal blockade and stop the starvation of 2.3 million Palestinians.Michael Fakhri is a UN special rapporteur on the right to foodExplore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warOpinionGazaIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesUnited NationsBenjamin NetanyahucommentShareReuse this content"

In 1914, he paid for those efforts with his life when a 29-year-old French nationalist shot him twice in the back.Courage among ordinary people is not in short supply. The doctors and humanitarian workers who rush to war zones and refugee camps to care for those who need it. Rümeysa Öztürk, the PhD student who wasarrestedin the US for voicing an opinion against the relentless bombing of Gaza. Israeliconscientious objectorsand an increasing number ofother refuseniks. The protesters inTbilisi,BelgradeandIstanbulwho have repeatedly faced down their governments’ attempts at repression.Examples of political courage from those in power, though? These feel less numerous. Volodymyr Zelenskyy has displayed it endlessly. French judges did too, when theyupheld the rule of law– which in normal times would simply be doing their duty, but in our times meant facingdeath threats. Pope Francis pushed reforms of the Catholic church to make it more compassionate and inclusive, and didn’t veer from them. He didn’t “change strategy” when attendance failed to pick up, because he didn’t have a strategy – he was simply doing what was right.View image in fullscreenRümeysa Öztürk arrives in Boston after spending more than six weeks in an immigration detention centre in Louisiana, 10 May 2025.Photograph: Faith Ninivaggi/ReutersOn the other hand, we’ve witnessed so many high-profile examples of political cowardice in recent months that I can only talk about them in broad categories. TheUS supreme court justiceswho, last summer, bent over backwards to create a monarchical presidency with impunity to break the law as it desires. The law firms that haveoffered uphundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of pro bono work to an administration busy dismantling the rule of law.The CEOs and companies that have turned on the money tap and tripped over themselves tocancel inclusion initiativesto placate a president who is tanking their share prices. An almost comically conspicuouslevel of grift,alleged corruptionandinsider trading. Congressional Republicans who have sold out their country’s constitutional principles in order to avoid primaries – or perhaps, as the senatorLisa Murkowski put it, because “we are all afraid … because retaliation is real”.What is just? Who is acting with honour? With courage? When did we stop thinking it normal to consider such questions – and to demand those things from the people who lead us? To demand that they, well,lead?Left with basically no other choice, Harvard University finally made thedecision to opposethe Trump administration’s outrageousdemands. That is not to downplay the moral courage in the decision; other universities might have and did make different choices when they were in the same bind. As a result of Harvard’s stand,hundreds of college and university presidentshave decided that sticking together is better than falling one by one.But perhaps in this moment, Harvard and other elite schools like it might take the opportunity to reflect on exactly what kind of virtues they have been instilling in their students. For years,nearly halfof Harvard’s graduates have stepped straight from campus into roles at consulting firms and investment banks. It’s disheartening but perhaps not surprising, given that according to its newspaper, the Crimson, for the past four decades far more first-years have been concerned with “being well-off financially” than with “developing a meaningful life philosophy”.When the primary metric becomes “success” in amassing something – money, followers, territory, votes – society loses its moral centre. As Pankaj Mishra wrote in his 2017 book, Age of Anger, part of the crisis of the current moment is that commercial society has unleashed individuals who are unmoored from each other or from some greater social fabric.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But I reject that. Without an ability to think and speak in real moral language, we end up in a place where there is no more shame in hypocrisy, no dishonour in rapacious greed; where if something is true or false matters less than how many people believe it. We end up in a place where the world’s wealthiest man has overseen a series ofdevastating aid cutsthat will indirectly kill hundreds of thousands of children and sentence millions more to death from disease. There is an appropriate descriptive word for that: the word is evil.Much of the media – US media, most certainly – have a lot to answer for in the ways that they have oriented public conversation. Far too frequently, they have approached politics primarily as a horse race. What does this or that mean for a candidate’s electoral chances? How will it play out in the polls? Who is up, who is down? Who agrees, who disagrees, and what is each party saying about the other? What the media don’t like to do, because it’s far more difficult and far riskier, is to talk about whether the policies being proposed and the decisions being taken are morally commendable, just, honourable, courageous.A focus on speaking the truth, of the kind that Jaurès extolled, opens wide other doors. Among them, the ability to move from a political question – what do we want? – to a more courageous one: is this what weshouldwant?Alexander Hurst is a Guardian Europe columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Maybe ghosts just want someone to listen to them?Thu 22 May 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 22 May 2025 11.02 EDTShareThe ghost in my house is called Henry.I only found this out after naming my cat Henry, at which point one of my kids said, “Oh, like the ghost”, as though this was knowledge we all shared.“Like thewhat?” I went, ordering sage sticks on the internet.“It’s OK,” they said. “He’s a friendly ghost.”Friendly ghosts are fake, obviously. I’ve read enough Stephen King books to understand that a ghost is only ever a malevolent force luring people to their deaths or perpetually re-enacting the horrifying circumstances of their own untimely demise. As an 80s kid, I know to be terrified of pottery wheel ghosts, ghosts trapped in paintings, baseball ghosts hiding in cornfields and Devon Sawa. Also, like every other kid born before the www, I spent my childhood scaring myself on purpose with “101 true ghost stories” books and then sleeping with the lights on.We bear the brunt of the climate crisis. A Pacific Cop could help shape the global response | Surangel Whipps JrRead moreGhosts are restless, angry and set on revenge. They’re mean. Henry’s hobbies include breaking all the doorknobs in our house and locking us variously in and out of the toilet. Sometimes he leaves a cold patch of air outside my bedroom door.I have never, ever wondered if Henry is doing OK.Then I started watching the TV show Ghosts. I had watched all of Sex Lives of College Girls, which was scary in a different way (the writing, the pacing) and needed something new. I chose this show against my better judgment, still in therapy from the Titanic scene in Ghostbusters 2. I went with the US version, but the premise and plot are almost identical in the other countries’ versions (which will soon include Australia). A woman inherits an old house, hits her head and can suddenly interact with the ghosts who live there (“live” is how they describe existing as dead people in the house. Sickos.)Like Henry, Ghosts the TV show perpetuates the friendly ghost lie. These spectres have variously been struck by lightning, eaten by a bear and murdered in cold blood, but they coexist in a mansion with the relaxed whimsy of a sitcom cast.It was tense TV, waiting to find out when the ghosts would turn on their landlord and have her flung from a balcony. But it never came. The ghosts bantered. They reminisced. They told stories and hosted events. Sometimes, they fell in love.Ghosts is a comedy, but it’s jammed full of interactions between living and dead: a dad who finds a way to hug his now-adult daughter; a young son discovering his parents really were proud of him; a Revolutionary War veteran who learns history does remember him after all.The longer I watched, the more the propaganda got to me. These weren’t just friendly ghosts – they were people with families and dreams, trapped like teenagers in an endless battle to be understood. In spite of myself, I cried. Suddenly, I was grateful for the chance to tell someone what I needed, even if they were my adult children who are not interested unless I’m giving them money.Can Albanese really see what needs to be done? | Fiona KatauskasRead moreIn the hallway, there was loud bang on the wall. Henry. Maybe he wasn’t a mean ghost. Maybe he was just waiting for someone to listen.As a crazy person, I’ve often spoken to people who weren’t there. Mostly they were strangers on the internet but sometimes they were figments of my imagination. But there seemed something hyperreal about having a chat with someone who’s never tweeted, or watched a Blake Lively deep dive, or met an incel. Henry the ghost is from a time when real things happened instead of the chaos of collective delusion in which we now live.“Hi,” I said to the air. No reply. “I’ve been watching this TV show.” My house was built in the 1940s; maybe Henry didn’t know what a TV was. “I thought you might like to hang out.” I put down my phone. I made room on the couch (in Ghosts, they can sit on chairs and washing machines). I asked about his family, and what he had done for work, and if he was planning to lock me in the bathroom until I died.He was polite (silent). Eventually, satisfied that I had been sufficiently kind to the wandering ghost in my hallway, I went back to distracting myself from responsibility.Obviously I know Ghosts is not a documentary. I still think ghosts are probably mean, and Henry has never done anything to make me think he’s not kind of a prick who wants me to leave. The doorknobs are worse than they’ve ever been. I have to literally kick the toilet door in now, which is not easy in an emergency.But I hope that now, if eternity is getting him down, Henry knows where he can find me (on the couch, watching TV ghosts marry one another in the afterlife).Explore more on these topicsTelevisionOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

Personally, I am on Team Split. I think it’s high time they put the grunt back into the country party.Yet, having taken the hard decision,David Littleproud– at time of publication – is now sitting astride the barbed wire fence, poised between Team Stay and Team Split. It’s the worst place to be.He appears to be having second thoughts. It is true that outside the Coalition the Nationals will not get their bums on ministerial seats in a future government, but hear me out.This is not the end of the Earth in a more fractured political environment. Notwithstanding Labor’s thumping win this month, you just need to look at data from rural voting booths to see more unpredictable patterns as more people challenge the Coalition status quo. The major parties’ primary votes are trending downwards.1:59Coalition split: the Nationals are breaking up with the Liberal party after election defeat – videoRural Australia holds the balance of power – if it wants to exercise it – in pretty much every parliament. Rural Australians are minority voters and at best 30% of the population. But it is a big enough bloc to wield with intent, if only we could muster our forces.You don’t require night vision goggles to see the potential power of country Australia.There is a whole bloc of rural and regional MPs sitting in the Nats party room, minus Perin Davey (on votes) and Jacinta Nampijinpa Price via defection to the Liberals.Yet the new leadership team of theLiberal partyboth hold rural electorates: Sussan Ley in Farrer (New South Wales) and Ted O’Brien in Fairfax (Queensland). The putative challengers were Angus Taylor, who has been a rural MP up until the last election when Hume was reclassified outer metropolitan. Price is a Country Liberal senator for the Northern Territory. The clue is in the title.The Liberals hold more rural territory than theNational party. There are rural independents, such as Indi MP Helen Haines, Mayo MP Rebekha Sharkie and former Nationals Calare MP Andrew Gee, who saw off the Nationals rival easily.The point is there are lots of rural political representatives in federal parliament, so how does the National party differentiate itself? Their sole branding point is that they only represent rural and regional people.The Coalition split was allegedly about four policies: nuclear energy, supermarket divestiture, a $20bn regional fund and action on rural phone and internet coverage (praise be!). Let’s park the fact that they did nothing about these ideas in their long tenure under Tony Abbott, Malcolm Turnbull and Scott Morrison. Leaving the nukes in the just-not-feasible basket, the old market-based Libs would never go for such interventionist policies. The most likely side to even talk about these would be the crossbench or the Labor party.The untethered Nats could plot a course to a sensible centre-right position that carves out a new city-country contract. Or they could skip down the yellow brick road to Trump world.As a stand alone party, they will live or die by their policies and their capacity to connect with a changing rural voter base as margins get more unpredictable. Younger generations with different voting histories are also moving in, seeking cheaper housing and better lifestyles. There are good reasons to go for a full makeover while you have time to create a modern country political brand.The crossbench has shown the Nationals could develop policies that don’t have to appeal to the Liberal party as long as they got support from other quarters. It could get weird. As Donald Trump has shown, transactional politics can make for the strangest of bedfellows.In the wake of the Coalition’s very public split, I can only offer this time-honoured break-up advice: work on yourself | James ColleyRead moreFree to roam, the Nationals could deal with any party, including Labor. Tony Windsor and Rob Oakeshott did such a deal for their respective electorates of New England and Lyne with Julia Gillard in 2010. They were hammered for it even though the agreement made major commitments to parliamentary reforms and regional Australia including their own electorates. Better still,the deal was made public for their own voters to see.As voters, we cannot see what the Nationals have demanded from the Liberals in the Coalition agreement. We cannot see what the Liberals demanded of the Nats.If you need examples of lateral thinking, the banking royal commission grew from a crossbench alliance driven byNationals own senator John Williamsgoing rogue with Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson and senator Nick Xenophon. They successfully forced the two big parties to act.The federal Icac and action on climate were two key policy planks of both the Greens and the country community independents. Those issues formed part of a platform that provided a launching pad for the city-based teals, the same folk eating the Liberal party’s lunch. The Nats’ own nuclear policy came about as a Coalition fig leaf for the Coalition’s lack of climate policy.So to the Nats, sit down and do some hard yakka to reshape the party for the political landscape as it is, not as you would like it to be.Forget about bowing to oligopolies and billionaires. Remember thekey employers in regional areasare not mining and farming now buthealth services, aged care, education, construction and retail. Professions mostly dominated by women. Where did the Coalition lose ground? With women.Labor has very little interest in the bush because there are no votes in it for them. What better way to get them interested in rural policy than to signal you are open to all sides of politics.Explore more on these topicsNational partyOpinionLiberal partyAustralian politicsRural AustraliaDavid LittleproudcommentShareReuse this content"

But not all the old traditions should be forgottenThu 22 May 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 22 May 2025 14.17 EDTShareMany years ago, as part of a school homework project, I asked my grandparents what the most significant social change had been during their lifetime. Two of them answered “child mortality”. I was surprised. Weren’t there other, more significant experiences in long lives that had stretched from the first and second world wars to the 1980s?But now that I am older and have experienced bereavement, I understand their replies. Both grandparents had sisters who died of diphtheria. And my grandfather’s younger brother died of sepsis, meaning his parents had buried two of their four children before the age of three. Their childhoods had been profoundly shaped by loss. Child mortality was, at that time, horrifyingly common, and from their earliest years many people spent a great deal of their lives coping with theemotional fallout of grief, which shaped their lives into older age.I have spent the past 10 years researching the history of death, while also training as a bereavement counsellor. In my book, No Ordinary Deaths – A People’s History of Mortality, I argue that we have much to learn from the past, particularly in the compassion shown to those facing the end of life, and those struggling with the emotional chasm of grief and loss.The differences between today and the past of even a few generations ago are enormous. Today, most people die in hospitals or care homes, but until well into the 20th century most died at home. Relatives or close friends usually washed and prepared the body for burial. The time between death and burial were understood as a dangerous and unstable moment for the spirit, and some communities developed elaborate wake rituals that could involve smoking, drinking, singing, games and “trickster” antics (such as lowering a shrouded body down the chimney, as recorded once in 19th-century Wales, presumably to distract any passing demons from stealing away with the soul).Wakes could last anything fromhours to daysand even weeks; an issue that horrified 19th-century public health campaigners. Indeed, such practices were regularly cited as one of the main reasons why burial reform was required, demanding that funerals should happen swiftly after death, and graveyards be moved away from city centres and into the suburbs.Nowadays, dying and death are, at least in wealthy, western societies, mostly institutionally managed and medically determined. Unless we work in healthcare or emergency services, seeing a dead body is a relatively unusual experience. And we can usually pinpoint the moment of death.Without easy access to a doctor, a stethoscope (not invented until 1816) or the technology we have today to assess when heartbeat and brain function have stopped, the end of life used to be open to all kinds of interpretation. A mirror, a feather to the lips, the last rasp of agonies, a magpie landing on the roof, a black dog barking – all kinds of signs and symbols could signify the end. But until the body began to putrefy, which could take several days, the time between alive-but-near-the-end and dead was not always precise. Watching for signs of death and caring for the dying was a skilled role often undertaken by older women, who offered comfort and gathered family, friends and priest to the bedside when they assessed the moment of death was approaching.The moment of death was particularly important as it marked the beginning of activities to protect the spiritual integrity of the soul, which may include lighting candles (light around the dead was very important), cleaning and dressing the body, closing or placing coins on the eyes, and bringing aromatic herbs or personal items such as rosary beads, a favourite toy (for a child), a treasured cup or plate to be tucked in with the body. It is probable that placing such grave goods is a pre-Christian practice and may hold several meanings. Perhaps these were considered objects that would be useful in the afterlife; for some communities using things that belonged to the dead is considered to bring bad luck, so best to bury them with their original owner just in case.We might think of grief and consolatory literature such as Julia Samuel’s bestsellingGrief Worksor Megan Devine’s It’s OK That You’re Not OKas a modern phenomenon, but for centuries printing presses have churned out guides to dying and grieving well, offering a blend of richly illustrated earthly and spiritual administrative and emotional advice for preparing for the end and coping with loss.Forget Swedish death cleaning, letting go is hard – even when it’s just a jacket | Nova WeetmanRead moreWhile we may find some of the excesses of, for instance, Victorian mourning ritual – replete with wearing heavy, dark clothing for months or even years, veiled mirrors and mourning tea sets – over the top today, the acknowledgment of grief ran deep in social structures of the past.Bereavementis for many of us the most profound experience we will have. The expectation that people should “move on from” or “get over” loss is to misread its potential to disorder our sense of self. In the past it was not uncommon to find “grief” as a cause of death on mortuary rolls or death certificates. Lives spent in closer relationship to death acknowledged the ways in which it can overwhelm us.Perhaps paradoxically, our medicalised approach to end of life now has resulted in a resurgence of interest in some of the old ways of managing mortality.Death doulasseem to carry the torch of the “death watchers” of the past, acknowledging that endings can be supported, caring, even joyful. The modern “death positive” movement encourages, if they feel able, family and friends to be involved in washing and caring for their dead, and there is evidence that being more involved in these processes can help us in accepting death and loss and beginning to process our grief.For me, there is a more radical message as well. If we can learn to engage – without fear – with the idea of our own mortality, embracing the fact that we will die can be a liberating act. We may use it to reassess our relationship to accumulating stuff, or thinking about the kinds of personal legacy, if any, we wish to leave. And perhaps we can also learn to draw on the past, taking the best and most humane elements of how death was anticipated, the dying supported and, perhaps most crucially, grief and mourning were acknowledged. Doing this may help us to reach back into a deeper relationship with mortality, a kind of modern take onmedia vita in morte sumus–in the midst of life we are in death.Molly Conisbee is a social historian, visiting research fellow at the Centre for Death and Society at the University of Bath, and author ofNo Ordinary DeathsExplore more on these topicsDeath and dyingOpinionBereavementChildrencommentShareReuse this content"

The prime minister announced in the Commons that he would look again at the £11,500 threshold over which pensioners are no longer eligible for the payment, meaning that more pensioners will again be eligible for the benefit. As a Labour MP who voted against the cut, I think the government should go further.During the election, I promised I would defend the community I represent, fight for working-class people and stand by my principles. And so I could not in all conscience vote forthe removal of the winter fuel paymentfrom up to 10 million pensioners as one of the first actions of the new Labour government in September. Approximately 17,000 people in my constituency lost their winter fuel payment. Similar numbers can be seen in constituencies throughout the country.When I think of today’s pensioners, I recall the great generation of working-class people who rebuilt the nation after the second world war. I worked in the clothing factories in Leeds when I left school, and in the building industry in Yorkshire. I saw that generation work hard to create the wealth that we see today. There were others who served in the armed forces. I represent many pensioners who worked in the coalmines. Their work was dangerous. It was hard and it was dirty. They helped create the light, heat and power for our homes and industries.We owe that whole generation a debt of gratitude. It is right that we have tried to secure a decent pension for all by maintaining the triple lock. It was right too that in Gordon Brown’s first budget in 1997,Labourvoted to introduce the winter fuel payment to ease the burden on cold winter days. I was proud that day to vote for it.The point has been made that the payment – of £200 or £300, paid annually in autumn to all pensioners – unjustly handed money to wealthy people. That may be so in a small number of cases. But the truth is that the £11,500 cut-off point was so low that itthrew at least 100,000 people into hardshipat the most difficult time of the year, just as autumn was slowly going to turn into winter. It was brutal in its implementation since pensioners didn’t have time to adjust their household budget before the frosts arrived.Some have said that we should restore the payment to save the Labour party at the ballot box. I say something different. Government policy ought to be guided by true Labour values, not just electoral calculations. Pay respect to pensioners, and accept that the payment cut was an error in judgment. Cuts to sickness and disability benefits also need to be completely rethought.But all this leads to a bigger question. Why did the government make these mistakes? The answer is simple. Last year, the country voted for change, not the continuation of austerity. Yet the government has become entrapped by a stale economic orthodoxy made in the Treasury and in the Bank of England. We need to break free from this narrow mindset. We should build a fiscal framework that addresses the realities of food bank Britain, its profound inequalities, broken public services and declining infrastructure.Some will say we can’t afford to look after our pensioners. But this is one of the richest countries in the world. Only this week, we learned that the richest 50 families in the UKown more wealththan half of the population (34 million people). Would those families really begrudge helping out the generation that helped to create the wealth they now own? And if they do begrudge it, ought we really take those opinions into account? I believe it’s time we taxed the wealth of the richest individuals in the country.There are two final questions the government needs to answer. First, when will pensioners know if and when their winter fuel payments will be restored? The prime minister says he will make an announcement at the next fiscal event – but that isn’t due until the autumn. It surely cannot be the case that pensioners will be left uncertain as to what will happen in the winter.And my second question is: will the prime minister and chancellor apologise for the anxiety and stress so many people experienced during the winter’s cold dark nights?It’s time for Labour MPsto stand up and be counted. Let’s insist on keeping faith with the central values of the British people who – above all things – want a country based on fairness.

The United States’ later descent into civil war over slavery would prove Lincoln right. But is 21st-century Britain now also becoming, in its different way, an unsustainably divided house too? And have Britain’s economic divisions become so intractable that the UK state can no longer manage them? More than at any time in the postwar era, the answer to both questions looks increasingly like yes.History shows that Britain’s capacity for pragmatic resilience in the face of internal and external threat is not to be underestimated. Wednesday’spartial climbdownon winter fuel payments was an example of that instinct for self-preservation at work. Yet the U-turn will not have restored the public’s lost trust in the ability of government to solve their problems.Keir Starmer has inherited this uneasy long-term decline, not created it. His“island of strangers” remarkslast week were one attempt to respond. But immigration is not the sole cause of division. Centrifugal forces have been making the United Kingdom a more fragmented country for much of the past half century. Public confidence in this country’s system of government hasreached record lows. There is little evidence of a cohesive or collaborative political economic purpose that might mark a nation more at ease with itself. The May local elections, which have now triggered the winter fuel rethink, were a powerful sign of how the divisions could easily deepen further.On Friday, Starmer will attempt to remedy another part of the problem he faces. To some, theCouncil of the Nations and Regionswill sound merely like a politicians’ talking shop. Let’s be frank, there is a risk it could become just that. Nor will a Britain whose discontents are fundamentally economic and aspirational be transformed by a constitutional innovation. But this second meeting of the council, which was promised in Labour’s election manifesto and which met first in October, is nevertheless a fundamental test. Put simply, Friday will show whether modern British governance is up to the job.The council is a distant cousin of a proposal that Gordon Brown devised when Starmer’s Labour was still in opposition at Westminster. Under Brown’s ambitious plans, the council would ultimately have formed the basis of a new upper house of the UK parliament, replacing the unelected House of Lords with a more federally conceived body. That project never reached the Labour manifesto in 2024, and there is zero sign that Starmer, let alone the Labour peers, want to revive it in any way.Instead, and according to the Cabinet Office website, the new council is “designed to facilitate partnership working between the UK government, devolved governments, the mayor of London, and mayors of combined authorities and mayors of combined county authorities”. The wordiness of that language underlines that this is not the council’s final form, since Labour’s English devolution plans remain work in progress, and because much of the council’s potential role is extremely ill-defined.All this reflects the continuing piecemeal way that devolution has taken root in a system of government that still insists the UK parliament’s decisions are sovereign. From the 1990s on, UK governments have tended to turn to devolved solutions only at times of crisis in the non-English nations. One result is that some in Westminster and Whitehall still see devolution as something that happens somewhere else.Those instincts were given full rein under the anglocentric prime ministerships of Boris Johnson and Liz Truss. Both leaders had a tin ear for and a visceral dislike of devolution. Johnson called devolution a disaster, and tried to subvert it in his UK internal market act. Neither he nor Truss ever respected the devolution settlement or consulted the devolved governments on anything important,as Covid would exemplify. The hostility was roundly reciprocated.The council’s first meeting came at a propitious moment for Starmer. He was not seen as hostile to devolution, as the defeated Tories had been, while Labour’s UK general election success had made Scotland’s Scottish National party government less openly combative. With the English mayors attending, it was an overwhelmingly Labour gathering, happy to embrace the new UK prime minister and the new era he promised.That seems like another country now. In Scotland, John Swinney’s SNP has its confidence back, and is positioned to beat Labour in next year’s Holyrood election. In England, Reform UK has captured coveted mayoralties inHull and East Yorkshire, and in Greater Lincolnshire. Reform UK has its eyes on more mayoralties in 2026, as well as on winning the Welsh Senedd and on becoming at least thesecond party at Holyrood. The upshot is a much more challenging political environment for Starmer, making attempts at “partnership working” more problematic. At the same time, it also puts pressure on Reform UK’s mayors. Do they engage? Or grandstand? Or even turn up?Yet none of these new tensions weakens the case for collaboration between governments and with mayors. “The key question is: what is the council for?” Prof Michael Kenny argued this week. Last week, Kenny and colleagues from Cambridge University’s Bennett Institutepublished a reportwith Policywise broadly supporting the thinking behind the council, but lamenting its repeated lack of clarity. “It’s not a decision-making body, but it ought to be more clearly structured,” Kenny told me.Another crucial issue, according toGlasgow University’s Prof Nicola McEwen, is that attenders have such different powers. In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland there is clear legislative devolution. Almost nothing of that sort exists in England, where there is no national parliament and mayoral powers are strictly limited from the centre. The danger is that the council becomes all talk and no action. “There are risks in stretching the concept of devolution to include both the intergovernmental relationship with the nations and the functional relationship with the mayors,” McEwen warns.This may all seem somewhat academic, but don’t be deceived. This stuff really matters. Without collaboration between the different parts of the UK’s increasingly devolved system of governance, no government – whether at the UK, the devolved national, or the English regional – is going to achieve its priorities. If Starmer wants his growth agenda or the reset with Europe to work, he needs the give and take that cooperation with the devolved bodies can give. Likewise, if Swinney’s SNP wants to deliver on things such as the abolition of child poverty, it cannot do it without the UK’s help.The collaborative political impulse is not widespread among Westminster parties. Luckily for Starmer, his Paisley-born colleague Pat McFadden, the cabinet minister responsible for making the council work, definitely gets the realities. It may not suit the tribalists in UK politics to admit it, but collaborative government is the way Britain has to be governed now. This week’s council may seem a sideshow to some. Yet it could hold the key to whether public confidence in politics begins to grow again.Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnistThis article was amended on 22 May 2025.

If that was the case, the people of Australia have spoken loud and clear.Like many of us in the Pacific had hoped, most Australians wanted to throw off the shackles of the last decade’s “climate wars” and usher in a new era of responsible climate and energy policy, one that harnesses the limitless potential of Australia’s renewable energy superpowers and helps lead the Pacific region and the world to a safer and more prosperous climate future.By hosting next year’sCop31climate conference together with the Pacific, Australia would have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to both catalyse its own clean transition to a decarbonised economy, and to elevate its relationship with the Pacific to the top tier of its foreign and strategic policy priorities. If well-delivered over the coming two years, these twin objectives might ultimately be viewed as the hallmarks of a nation that successfully left the climate culture wars for dead and cemented a legacy of new climate leadership for, and in solidarity with, its Pacific neighbours.Extinction Rebellion may have gone quiet, but climate protest will come roaring back | Oliver HaynesRead moreAs I said at last year’s Cop29 in Baku, now is the time for those standing in the way of a high ambition Pacific Cop to move aside. That the Pacific has never physically hosted a COP – despite bearing the full brunt of the climate crisis – must be corrected. In this defining decade, a Pacific Cop would ensure that those most affected can help shape the global response.Cop31 would also be an opportunity to shine a light on Australia’s efforts to accelerate the transition of its historically carbon-intensive economy and to demonstrate the multiple benefits that can flow from renewables and new green industries. This would have a particularly important demonstration effect for the booming economies of the Asia-Pacific, whose development pathways must be decarbonised if we are to avoid a significant overshooting of the goals of the Paris agreement.But ultimately, the merit and credibility of a bid from Australia with the Pacific will rest upon two factors.First, the level of ambition demonstrated by Australia in the formulation of its 2035 emissions reduction target under the Paris agreement. As the climate treaty says, each country’s target should reflect its “highest possible ambition”. In other words, it should be a “stretch goal” that is challenging to achieve, but ultimately within reach. I saw an analysis duringmy recent visit to Sydneythat a 1.5C-aligned contribution from Australia would require at least a high-70s% reduction in GHG emissions below 2005 levels by 2035.Australia should also make moves to address the climate impact of its fossil fuel production and exports – it remains one of the top three fossil fuel exporters in the world. As I said in Sydney, we urge the Australian government to shift away from new coal and gas developments, in line with global momentum and the expectations of Pacific partners. Without such a signal, questions may continue to linger over the credibility of Australia’s potential leadership role in the UN process.The second factor will be the collaborative spirit embedded in the Australian-Pacific partnership on Cop31. For example, there should be early moves to appoint Pacific co-leads for key positions in the Cop31 process, such as the formal presidency role as well as “climate champions” who seek to drive new climate commitments from the private sector, regions, cities and local governments. But perhaps more importantly, a landmark Pacific Cop must be convened at the very highest level, bringing in world leaders on Australia’s Pacific coast to ensure that climate remains at the top of the global agenda.Climate targets are only as good as the action behind them. We need to aim higher | Amanda McKenzieRead moreMore substantively, my Pacific colleagues see great value in pursuing a signature new initiative to make the Pacific the first region in the world to become 100%-powered by renewables, both on our islands and through local use of electrified vessels. To shape this initiative, I will host Pacific leaders here inPalauin August 2026, and we can work towards a pre-Cop31 gathering elsewhere in the region to channel international resources towards this win-win-win outcome.The primary aim would be to accelerate the Pacific switch from reliance on expensive imported diesel and other fossil fuels to much cheaper renewable power generation and storage. As one example, we look forward to further support from the Australian Infrastructure Finance Facility for the Pacific to rapidly complete work onPalau’s first utility-scale solar projectin Ngatpang with the planned addition of a battery energy storage system (BESS).To do this at scale across the Pacific will require new flows of climate finance and an associated derisking mechanism to help unlock private sector investment. Either way, Australian leadership will be key to demonstrate how Cop31 can tangibly deliver for the region.The Albanese government now has a crystal clear mandate to make real progress on an intergenerational issue of paramount importance – at home, in the region and on the world stage. It is an opportunity that Australia must now grab with both hands, together with its Pacific family.Surangel Whipps Jr is the president of PalauExplore more on these topicsPalauOpinionCop31Pacific islandsEnergyAsia PacificcommentShareReuse this content"

But a surprising number of pictures at this year’s festival side with the locally rooted over cosmopolitan elitesPhilip Oltermann, European culture editorThu 22 May 2025 10.58 EDTLast modified on Thu 22 May 2025 12.50 EDTShareIfDonald Trumpreally wants to save Hollywood, maybe he needs to venture outside his comfort zone and watch more European art house cinema.TheCannes film festival, which closes on Saturday, is in many ways the very definition of the “globalism” that the American president’s Maga movement despises. Walk past the queues snaking alongside the Palais des Festivals and you hear languages and accents from every corner of the globe. The Marché du Film, where industry professionals strike their deals, is brimming with smart people from all over the world beckoning US producers with irresistible tax incentives – resulting in the kind of movies “produced in foreign lands” that the US president earlier this month proposed punishing with 100% tariffs. At the opening gala, Cannes gave Trump arch-enemy Robert De Niro a platform to rally the world of cinema against the US president, “without violence, but with great passion and determination”.View image in fullscreenAmélie Bonnin’s Partir un jour.Photograph: Courtesy: Cannes film festivalBut then you sit down in a dark screening room at the Palais, the piano strains of Camille Saint-Saëns’ Aquarius trickle over the Cannes trailer, and that distinction is not so clear any more. In French director Amélie Bonnin’s opening film Partir un Jour, driven-but-stressed celebrity chef Cécile is preparing for the opening of her new haute cuisine diner in Paris when news reaches her of the ill health of her father, who runs a run-of-the-mill roadside restaurant called Pit Stop out in the sticks. Cécile’s father ribs his daughter about her disdain for the unsophisticated palates of the “yokels”, but it’s apparent from the outset that the film’s sympathies lie a lorry-ride away from France’s cosmopolitan centre.If at the heart of the culture war waged by Trump and his populist allies in Europe runs a divide between locally rooted “somewheres” and cosmopolitan “anywheres”, Partir un Jour is very much a “somewhere film”. It ultimately rejects shiso-flavoured lobster, roquefort panna cotta and Michelin stars in favour of boeuf bourguignon, hotdogs and Michelin tyres. At Cannes, it turned out to be less of a duff note than the beginning of a theme.Everywhere you looked, there were stories with a very specific sense of place: of people who are stuck in remote locations (Palme d’Or-buzzy The Sound of Falling by German newcomer Mascha Schilinski, Scottish auteur Lynne Ramsay’s Die, My Love) or return to them (French director’s Dominik Moll’s yellow-vests drama Dossier 137).The thrill of big-city living was rarely glimpsed on any of the festival’s many screens. Turkish-German director Fatih Akin, who burst on the international scene 20 years ago with explosive urban drama Head-On, came to the Riviera with Amrum, a film set entirely on a remote North Sea island at the end of the second world war. Even Spanish director Oliver Laxe’s techno-infused mystery drama Sirât is not set in a Barcelona night club but a desert rave. The left-behinds? They were not so much ignored as put centre-stage and armed with automatic rifles in “elevated horror” director Ari Aster’s Eddington, a Covid satire so even-handed in its mockery of pandemic follies that it has earned criticism of striving for“Maga compatibility”.A more lenient view would be that film-makers should have no truck with the binaries conjured up by politicians in the first place, because art at its best dissolves them anyway. Some of the most interesting films at Cannes were somewhere-anywhere films, rooted in a place but allowed to grow outwards. Finnish film-maker Lauri-Matti Parppei’s A Light That Never Goes Out, about a prodigy flautist who returns to his coastal family home after suffering a breakdown, sets out like Bonnin’s but turns a familiar plot on its head: in rural Rauma, protagonist Pauli finds meaning not in folksy simplicity but in joining an experimental noise-core band.Akin’s Amrum prods the eternal German subject ofHeimat(“homeland”) and comes up with unusual answers. What makes someonebelongto Amrum, wonders the film’s child protagonist at one point. His schoolmates reckon it requires one to be born there, while his Nazi mother believes it runs in the blood. But the island’s oldest inhabitants tell him that’s all nonsense: real Amrumers, they reckon, are those who leave the island at the first opportunity.View image in fullscreenImogen Poots in The Chronology of Water.Photograph: Courtesy: Cannes film festival“Anywhere” films at Cannes were few and far between, but it’s perhaps no coincidence that those that fit the tag were the ones with most box office potential: Christopher McQuarrie’s eighth instalment of the globe-racing Mission Impossible franchise, and Wes Anderson’s latest all-star ensemble piece The Phoenician Scheme, whose shady industrialist protagonist Zsa-Zsa Korda (Benicio del Toro) doesn’t even need a passport, because “I live anywhere”.They are anywhere films in terms of their production: M:I 8’s big action set-pieces were filmed in London, Norway and thin airover South Africa, while The Phoenician Scheme is set in the fictional Middle Eastern-looking country of Phoenicia but was shot entirely in a studio in Babelsberg, outside Berlin, Germany. That may be expected of escapist films tilted at the box office, but also applied to two art-house productions with Hollywood involvement: Jennifer Lawrence-starring Die, My Love and Kristen Stewart’s directorial debut The Chronology of Water are set in Montana, California, Texas and Oregon – and filmed in Canada, Latvia and Malta.These are clearly the kind of “movies made in foreign lands” that Trump wants to see the back of. Yet over the course of the festival the consensus gradually shifted to the assumption that tariffs won’t be the way it’s done, because it would be unworkable. As Anderson asked sarcastically when questioned about the presidential film tariffs: “Can you hold up the movie in customs?”“Most people think it will just lead to the US copying the British model,” said Andreas Pense, a German lawyer who advises international film projects. The UK has by far been the most successful country in Europe at attracting American films, paying out £553m in tax relief to film companies in 2022-23. “But the US would have to cough up an insane amount of money, and getting that approved won’t be easy,” Pense added. “American productions are just more expensive.”View image in fullscreenJennifer Lawrence in Lynne Ramsay’s Die, My Love.Photograph: OkashaSome European countries with a presence at Cannes sounded surprisingly optimistic about standing their ground in a tax-incentive arms race with the US. Hungary, for example, does not just offer 30% in rebates to foreign producers making films in the central European state, but can also provide crews that are experienced and cheaper than those in the US, because unions pull much less weight in its cinematic sector than in the US. American productions being filmed outside Budapest this year include cold war spy drama Ponies, featuring Emilia Clarke and Haley Lu Richardson, and alien invasion comedy Alpha Gang, starring Cate Blanchett and Channing Tatum. Its trump card, Hungarian film professionals say, is that Budapest can impersonate anywhere in the world: Paris, Buenos Aires, Moscow, even London and New York. If you are making an anywhere film, what’s to stop you?Perhaps the US president should take a leaf out of the rulebook of Dogme 95, the notorious Danish avant garde film-making movement. In Cannes, a group of Nordic five film-makers launched a reboot of the self-restricting school of cinema that brought forth Lars von Trier and Thomas Vinterberg. They retained only one rule from the original 1995 manifesto: “The film must be shot where the narrative takes place.”A post on Truth Social, an executive order that binds all American directors to making American films set in America, and Hollywood’s problems would be solved in one stroke. Next up: work out whether anyone would still want to watch those films.Explore more on these topicsCannes film festivalFestivalsDonald TrumpfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The First Sight (2016)In 2018, bassist Gerry Love departedTeenage Fanclub(TFC) after 29 years, much to fans’ despair. It’s perhaps a little romantic to see The First Sight as his parting gift, but it’s certainly an impressive closing statement of his songwriting talent: an intricate mesh of guitars, a buoyant horn section, and a typically stunning tune.19. Did I Say (2003)Most artists called upon to pad out a best-of collection with a few new tracks – by a major label about to drop them – would understandably offer something substandard. Not TFC. Driven by an unexpectedly tricky rhythm, Did I Say is folky, beautiful and a noticeable diversion from their usual style.18. Escher (1993)Bandwagonesque’s follow-up Thirteen gets a bad rap, not least from the band themselves – its recording was fraught – but 30-odd years on, it sounds better than its reputation suggests. Escher certainly smooths out Bandwagonesque’s rougher edges, but its drawing of a muddled relationship is no less charming for that.View image in fullscreenSlightly bruised … Teenage Fanclub in 2023: Raymond McGinley, Norman Blake, Francis Macdonald, Dave McGowan and Euros Childs.Photograph: PR17. I Will Love You (2023)From its title down, TFC’s most recent album Nothing Lasts Forever conjured up a kind of twilit optimism: a band staring down their 60s, slightly bruised by life but facing forward. Final track, I Will Love You sums the mood up: slowly shimmering atmospherics that eventually burst into striking, warm vocal harmonies. A joy.16. Your Love Is the Place I Come From (1997)The arrangement of Your Love Is the Place Where I Come From is almost wilfully understated – for most of its three minutes, you could be eavesdropping on a rehearsal – but its no-frills simplicity allows the songwriting, a sigh of contentment in musical form, to shine all the more clearly.15. Cells (2005)TFC aren’t famous for brooding, which makes the sombre tone of Cells all the more striking: the muted take on their sound perfectly fits a set of lyrics haunted by a very middle-aged sense of ageing and loss. And the lengthy acoustic guitar coda is just exquisite.View image in fullscreenStriking a chord … Teenage Fanclub on stage at Cambridge Junction in 2016.Photograph: Sonja Horsman for the Observer New Review/The Observer14. God Knows It’s True (1990)Before their perplexing second album, The King – seven grungy instrumental originals and covers of Pink Floyd’s Interstellar Overdrive and Madonna’s Like a Virgin – TFC released one-off single God Knows It’s True. It’s solo-heavy and slacker sloppy but crucially also a fabulous song.13. Planets (1997)Initially, TFC were a boozy, chaotic proposition, particularly live, but they proved surprisingly adept at growing up in public. Planets alchemises an unpromising subject – relocating to the countryside with your growing family – into musical gold. Sweet, but not cloying, there’s something really moving about its string-laden sense of contentment.12. Alcoholiday (1991)You couldn’t miss the influence of Big Star on Bandwagonesque – it even featured a quote from their lyrics on the cover – but nowhere was it deployed more spectacularly than on Alcoholiday, a glorious, harmony-laden depiction of uncertainty over a blossoming relationship: “Went to bed, but I’m not ready / Baby I’ve been fucked already.”11. I Don’t Want Control of You (1997)It wasBandwagonesque producer Don Flemingwho first suggested TFC concentrate on harmony vocals, but nowhere in their catalogue were they deployed to more euphoric effect than on the second single from Songs from Northern Britain, which is furthermore blessed with the kind of tune that isn’t ripped off from anywhere yet sounds instantly familiar.10. The Concept (1991)The chaotic early Fanclub had their moments, but the release of The Concept introduced the TFC that Kurt Cobain called “the best band in the world”: the guitars are still unruly with feedback, but the melodies are amped up to match them, the vocal harmonies are luscious, the lyrics smart and witty.9. Neil Jung (1995)The idea that none of the singles from Grand Prix made the Top 30 seems absolutely confounding: how could anything as self-evidently brilliant, as insanely tuneful as Neil Jung – romantic disaster plus incredible chorus plus fantastic (and suitably Neil Young-ish) guitar solo – not have been a huge hit? What waswrongwith people?8. Broken (1997)Thegreat TFC deep cut, Broken was inexplicably relegated to a B-side. An acoustic guitar and organ-driven masterpiece of beautiful, mournful simplicity – the lyrics feature just one line, endlessly repeated – it has subsequently also evaded streaming services. If you don’t know it, seek it out and luxuriate in its divine melancholy.View image in fullscreenWig out … Blake back in 1992.Photograph: Martyn Goodacre/Getty Images7. I Need Direction (2000)Packaged in a terrible sleeve and released by an indifferent major label to a decidedly muted response, 2000’s Howdy! tends to get overlooked. But if it’s not quite as good as its two predecessors (Songs from Northern Britain and Grand Prix), it’s still pretty great, as demonstrated by opener I Need Direction: unassuming but utterly delightful, thick with Beach Boys harmonies.6. Baby Lee (2010)By the time of 2010’s Shadows, it was clear that TFC were refining their sound rather than radically overhauling it, but they could still surprise you with the sheer quality of their songwriting. The Norman Blake-penned Baby Lee – lyrical misery, impossibly sunny music – is a triumph.5. Don’t Look Back (1995)Apparently, Love’s favourite among the songs he wrote for Teenage Fanclub, the autumnal Don’t Look Back builds wonderfully from reflective verses into a monster chorus. The advice said chorus doles out, and the acoustic version on the Teenage Fanclub Have Lost It EP, are both worth heeding.4. Everything Flows (1990)Debut album A Catholic Education is messier and noisier than the rest of TFC’s output: a decisive, Crazy Horse-influenced, instrumental jam-laden break with the members’ C86 pasts. But, Everything Flows – twentysomething ennui with a wonderful, wistful melody beneath the guitar overload – pointed the way ahead, an early song as good as any they’ve written.3. Star Sign (1991)Star Sign initially sounds like a Sonic Youth-y drone experiment – over a minute of beat-less monotone guitar – before exploding into life: an irresistible tune built around the kind of descending-but-uplifting chord sequences that helped define glam rock, and a lyric that keeps indifferently shrugging “big deal” in a way that’sveryearly 90s.2. Ain’t That Enough (1997)Songs from Northern Britain’s jewel, and – perhaps – TFC’s essence distilled: plangent guitars, sunlit harmonies, a melody the Fifth Dimension-era Byrds would have been proud of, life’s simple pleasures unfashionably hymned at the height of Britpop’s gruesome cokey grandiosity (“here is a sunrise – ain’t that enough?”). What a lovely song.1. Sparky’s Dream (1995)The songs at the top of this list are all so great, ranking them is mostly just a matter of personal preference, but the highlight of Grand Prix clinches it on the basis of its sheer ebullience – enough to pull any listener out of a gloomy mood – and its absolutely preposterous abundance of hooks: the main riff, the moment in the verses where the vocal melody soars upwards, the solo guitar motif that introduces the chorus, all three parts of the chorus. It’s essentially an album’s worth of incredible tunes crammed into three minutes – not a second of them wasted – and it soundseffortless.Explore more on these topicsTeenage FanclubRankedPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What’s it like being directed byPaul Greengrasswith his fast-cut, handheld camera, reportage style? Do you have to approach your acting in a different way?HighPriest1967Paul is an extraordinary director, a visionary director, and I absorbed so much by watching him work. He comes from documentary, so even though he was filming these elaborate, very expensive, complicated action sequences, he was still able to see things happening spontaneously. I remember when we were shooting The Bourne Ultimatum in Tangier, running through those windy streets. Normally as an actor, you turn a corner and you think you’re off camera, so you’d stop. But you could never do that with Paul because there might be a camera around the corner. He always liked to keep us on our toes.View image in fullscreen‘Different energy’ … with Michael Gross in Chosen Family, 2024.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyYou stole the show asHeather Graham’s sister in Chosen Family. Is it easier to approach comedic, unpredictable roles as opposed to more intense, serious, Bourne-like performances?BicuserI absolutely love working on comedies. People don’t normally think of me as a comedic actress, but when they do, I really appreciate it. It’s such a different energy, trying to get other people to laugh. Working with Heather Graham was great. I’ve just finished shooting a Christmas comedy, Unbearable Christmas, with a lot of improv comedians, and had to keep up in terms of ad-libbing lines. It was the most fun I’ve ever had.Have you ever considered being in a superhero film? What hero appeals to you the most?nailsthatglowI wouldn’t mind playing a villain. I think Mike Myers said that the villain is the hero of his own story. I would find a nerdy acting way to make my villain especially villainous.The hip-hop dance montages in Save the Last Dance were an absolute hook, but the emotional breakthrough scene about the loss of your mother was so powerful. Did you have to dig deep to convey the grief and trauma?MissMuftyThankfully, no, I did not have to draw from personal things. What is beautiful about the setup of that movie, with her mother dying in a car crash, is that it touches on something fundamentally sad and tragic for any human being. So my imagination took over. It was such a wonderful opportunity to do formal dance training. I’d taken ballet, modern dance, jazz and tap classes as a teenager, but never that intensely. I put a lot of pressure on myself, but it was such a great opportunity to dance for six hours a day. I think I got the job because I was better at hip-hop than ballet.View image in fullscreenA break from dancing six hours a day … Stiles as Sara and Sean Patrick Thomas as Derek in Save the Last Dance, 2001.Photograph: Entertainment Pictures/AlamyYou once said you always wanted to be Madonna in Desperately Seeking Susan. Do you still?MrSOBaldrickWhat I responded to about that character was her free-spiritedness. She just didn’t care, and she was so playful. But I think her grifter loneliness is not for me any more.You committed to studying Englishliterature when your career was flying, which is hugely impressive. What did your studies do for you the most?SidKupI was an English major. The joke is that English majors are just reading books, writing essays, and what are you really being trained for? But what I was learning was storytelling. When I finally got to direct my own movie, Wish You Were Here, a lot of what I had learned in terms of classical storytelling, act structure and character development came in handy.Did you seek out advice from other directors?Sagarmatha1953I did. I called Doug Liman, who directed The Bourne Identity. I was lamenting my budget constraints and he gave me advice that I will take with me for ever: when they start giving you more money, they start telling you what to do. I sent Rodrigo García [who directed Stiles in web series Blue] my director’s cut and asked for notes. I also sent it toSusan Seidelman, who directed Desperately Seeking Susan, who I do not know personally, but I’m getting bolder in my old age. She wrote me really extensive, thoughtful notes. I thought that was really lovely, because she didn’t have to take the time to do that.Do you regret breaking up withDexter?Shauny79Well, I didn’t break up with Dexter. Lumen, my character, broke up with Dexter. I remember the writer saying: she’s now been freed of the darkness. It was a beautiful relationship because he helped heal her from trauma. But she didn’t need to be on the dark side any more. She could go back into the light.View image in fullscreen‘Beautiful relationship’ … Stiles as Lumen and Michael C Hall as the eponymous Dexter, 2010.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyWhich meal/dish from New York do you miss when away?RobHughes84I used to be a really good cook. I have three kids now, so I’m really good with things like chicken nuggets. I always miss New York City pizza. That’s one of the first things I want to eat when I come back. If I go to another country, particularly in Europe or even parts of the US, I will taste-test their pizza to see how it compares to New York City pizza. There’s something about a local slice that you really can’t beat. Do I like British food? I love a good Sunday roast. I remember working in London on a play for many, many months. It was a two-hander, so there weren’t a lot of other people to hang out with. But on the weekends, the producers would host a Sunday roast, so it was always something to look forward to.Have you ever considered opening a tile shop, called Julia’s Tiles?Danko1981No, I have not.I don’t think I’ve been so entertained by a TV show with such an insane plot line as Riviera. Did it make sense to you, or did you just do the role to spendsummers in the French Riviera and Venice?brianofbritainI loved making that series. I think we really hit our stride in the third season. I would be lying if I said I didn’t … of course, filming in Venice and the south of France was hugely appealing. But I couldn’t go to work every day if I wasn’t interested in the character and the story I was telling.View image in fullscreen‘Am I going to be in the sequels?’ … Heath Ledger as Patrick and Stiles as Kat in 10 Things I Hate About You, 1999.Photograph: Touchstone Pictures/AllstarCan you still remember Kat’s sonnet from the end of 10 Things I Hate About You [as quoted by Drake in his feud with Kendrick Lamar]?RDMillerOh, I don’t think I could remember the whole thing. I’ve had to clear out space in my brain for 25 years of other monologues. Let’s see … “I hate the way you talk to me. I hate it when you stare … something, something, something … I hate your big dumb combat boots and the fact that you read my mind … something, something, something.

But at theStorm King Art Center, an outdoor sculpture park that rolls across 200 edenic hectares of New York’s Hudson Valley, visitors are now treated to a sublime restroom experience worthy of the spectacular sculptures on show.“It’s quite an upgrade from our porta-potties,” says Nora Lawrence, director of the centre, which has just reopened after a $53m (£39.7m) expansion. She is standing outside the new loos, housed in a sleek wooden pavilion that opens out on to the woodland landscape, framing views of the red maple swamp beyond. A new ticket office stands across a tree-lined “outdoor lobby”, while elegant lampposts line the route to an open-air welcome pavilion, sheltering lockers and phone charging points.View image in fullscreenHaughty … Alexander Calder’s The Arch at the Storm King Art Center.Photograph: Oliver WainwrightStorm King had none of these things before. Founded in 1960, on a ravaged landscape of gravel pits left by neighbouring highway construction, the sculpture park never had the facilities you would expect from such a popular visitor attraction, which draws crowds of 200,000 each year. Named after a local mountain, the art centre began as a small museum of local landscape paintings, housed in a 1930s Normandy-style chateau on a hill here in Mountainville, surrounded by 23 acres. Its founders, Ralph E Ogden, and his son-in-law, H Peter Stern, who co-ran the family business manufacturing steel bolts, soon acquired a taste for outsized sculpture, and, as a consequence, an appetite for more land. Their holdings eventually grew to include 800 hectares of the adjacent Schunnemunk mountain – which Ogden bought to preserve the woodland backdrop, then donated to become a state park.Storm King now boasts one of the world’s greatest collections of outdoor sculpture, with more than 100 works by 20th-century greats, but it has always lacked electricity, piped water, and most of the other hallmarks of civilisation. Alexander Calder’s 17-metre tallThe Archstands in the middle of a meadow like some prized fowl, flaring out its curved black limbs with haughty pride.Mark di Suvero’s trioof colossal steel structures march across the hills, rising on the horizon like abandoned oil derricks, mineshaft headframes or rusting contraptions once used to sculpt the land. Isamu Noguchi’s 40-tonnegranite peachnestles in a woodland clearing nearby, looking positively modest in comparison, while Andy Goldsworthy’sdrystone wallwinds its way for 700 metres between the trees. But in between admiring these wonders, visitors were treated to the delights of portable plastic toilets and crowded parking lots.In true North American fashion, Storm King had a lot of asphalt. Swathes of parking and access roads sliced across the pristine meadows, and muscled into the foreground of the striking steel sculptures, undermining the intention of experiencing art against a backdrop of pure nature.View image in fullscreen‘We’ve tried to let the landscape take over again’ … the Group Pavilion at Storm King’s new visitor entrance.Photograph: © Richard Barnes“The primary visitor experience was sitting in a long line of traffic and finding somewhere to park your car,” says Claire Weisz ofWXY Studio, the architects that have led the project, with Irish firm Heneghan Peng, since 2017. “We’ve tried to let the landscape take over again.”Working with New England landscape practiceReed Hilderbrand, and London firmGustafson Porter + Bowman, the team have torn up over two hectares of asphalt, creating new fields for the display of art, and planted more than 650 trees and shrubs. They have opened up a previously culverted stream, revealing 100 metres of babbling brook, and restored the wetland landscape with sour gum, sweetgum and flowering dogwood, promising a ravishing show of scarlet foliage come the autumn. With much of the tarmac swept away, the colossal outdoor works shine like never before so the new architectural interventions take a back seat, letting the landscape be the real star of the show.Visitors arrive at the newly concentrated 580-space parking lot, where an elegant timber ticket office has been deftly tacked on to the end of a 19th-century stone cottage, shaded by a big projecting canopy. “It replaces a 1950s garage extension,” says Róisín Heneghan, “so we made the canopy look like a big open garage door, in a nod to the American garage sale tradition.”View image in fullscreen‘A celebration of sanitation’ … the restroom pavilion at Storm King Art Center.Photograph: © Richard BarnesThe outdoor lobby, framed by tall, shading sweetgum trees, leads to the new bathroom block, where top-lit wooden cubicles snake in a subtle S-curve, crowned with a floating roof that shelters a long open-air concrete sink. The roof appears to be supported by a row of swivelling wooden shutters, which can be closed in the cooler months, or swung open to connect you directly with the wooded wetland beyond. The architects say they were inspired by the outdoor washbasins of Japanese temples, and there is a similar sense of ritual ablution here, a spiritual cleansing in preparation for the aesthetic revelations that await. For once, the American term is fitting: these are restrooms where you might indeed want to rest awhile, take in the view, and enjoy the aroma of the allspice shrubs, planted, says Beka Sturges of Reed Hilderbrand, “as a celebration of sanitation”.Sturges says her firm is often accused of being too deferential, but here that’s exactly what was needed. Their work is almost invisible: few visitors will remember the previous nightmare of car parks, or realise that a long allée of dying maples has been replaced with more resilient tupelo trees, or that new ground-cover and perennials were selected for their climate resilience. “We’ve tried to interlace a few southern species, where this would be the northern edge of their historic range,” says Sturges, “just to try to get ahead of the terrifying change to climate.”View image in fullscreenSuspended by Menashe Kadishman at Storm King Art Center.Photograph: James Talalay/AlamyThere has also been a lot of work behind the scenes, which most visitors will never see. A new southern logistics entrance means that delivery trucks and maintenance vehicles no longer have to ply their way across the park, disturbing visitors’ reverie. It leads to a new conservation, fabrication and maintenance building, conceived as a big black hangar, cut into a sloping hillside. Here, beneath the six-metre high ceilings, cooled byBig Ass Fans, sculptures can be repaired and repainted in a 15-metre long spray booth, before being wheeled out through full-height doors. It means that work that used to have to be outsourced, entailing more truck deliveries, can now be done on site, while the action can be surveyed from mezzanine offices overhead.It is where the big steel buttresses for a newtemporary installation by Kevin Beasleywere fabricated, which now stand on Tippet’s Field – a prominent new space reclaimed from one of the bigger parking lots – forming a 30-metre long theatre arch of found fabrics suspended in resin. Beasley plans to activate the work with performances this summer, the first test of this grassy stage as a canvas for whatever the next generation of artists will dream up. As Lawrence puts it: “It’s quite unusual for an artist to be told, ‘Here’s a huge landscape, go to town!’” And that’s where Storm King’s magic lies – now with more potential than ever.Explore more on these topicsArchitectureArtSculptureNew YorkMuseumsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As the star plays a police therapist in new Netflix thriller Dept Q, she explains why today’s young female actors leave her in aweThu 22 May 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 22 May 2025 04.52 EDTShareOne of the good things about playing a therapist, saysKelly Macdonaldwith a laugh, is that you get to sit down a lot. There’s a fun scene in the new Netflix thriller Dept. Q in which her character, Dr Rachel Irving, weary of her client DCI Carl Morck, plants herself down behind her desk to eat her packed lunch in front of him. Morck may be the kind of troubled detective we’re used to seeing in police dramas, but Irving isn’t a typical therapist. She’s blunt, antagonistic even. It’s a “shitty” job working with police officers, she tells him. Another time she describes him as “doolally”, which in my experience is not something a typical therapist would say; Macdonald, who has had therapy, “but not regularly”, may agree.In the show – adapted from novels by the Danish author Jussi Adler-Olsen and brought to the screen by Scott Frank, who was also behind the Netflix hit The Queen’s Gambit – Morck is made to see Irving after he survives a shooting. Brilliant but sidelined, Morck is tasked with reviewing cold cases, and moved to a shabby basement office that becomes known as Department Q. The first case for his small crew of misfit detectives is the disappearance of a lawyer four years earlier, who everyone thinks is probably dead. The truth, it soon emerges, is absolutely terrifying.Did Macdonald think she’d be playing a police officer on the show – a role she has played in Line of Duty,Giri/Haji, and Black Mirror? “No. They specifically told me what it was going to be. But I think I’ve played a therapist before as well.” We’re speaking over Zoom; Macdonald is in Los Angeles where she is filming Lanterns, an HBO adaptation of the Green Lantern comics in which – is this right? – she plays a detective. “I don’t actually, I play a sheriff. Very different.” She laughs. “I wear a hat and everything.”Macdonald, now 49, has been there since January, and it’s hard being away from her two sons, 12 and 17, though they’ve been out to see her and she gets home to Glasgow whenever she can. “The guilt never gets easier,” she says. “I think that’s just a working mum thing – you never feel like you’re doing either thing as well as you should be. They understand what I’m doing and where I am, and we’ve got technology at least, so we can see each other’s faces.” She follows them on their phones, “to see where they are, like a sneak, checking up on them. I was doing that a few weeks ago and I zoomed out, and suddenly it was just the Earth, and they were there and I was here. I know this, but it really did something to my brain. Because it’s far.”Not to make assumptions about boys, but presumably they’re more impressed by her work in Lanterns, or her role in Star Wars: Skeleton Crew, than, say, Gosford Park? “We don’t really discuss it too much,” she says. “I did show one of them the prop green lantern. It doesn’t feel like I’m doing a comic thing – it’s a drama.”View image in fullscreenTV juggernaut … Macdonald alongside Vicky McClure in Line of Duty.Photograph: Steffan Hill/APOne day they will surely be impressed that their mother was a 90s icon. Macdonald’s debut was in Trainspotting, playing Diane, the sassy (underage) teenager Ewan McGregor’s Renton gets involved with. Macdonald’s parents divorced when she was a child and she grew up in Glasgow with her mother and brother. She didn’t do much drama at school but she loved films and TV – even adverts stuck in her mind, and she would act them out. Macdonald remembers one summer when she was obsessed with the western musical Calamity Jane, and would go out to see which other kids were around her estate, and try to get them to act out scenes from it. None of them knew it, she says with a smile. “Other kids weren’t so interested.”Acting, for Macdonald, “was my form of play. I was always pretending, and it was pretty private, like in my bedroom.” She was reminded of it recently because her older son is doing exams; Macdonald did fairly well at English because she would learn dialogue in her room. She wanted to be an actor but didn’t really have much of a plan (a theme, it becomes apparent, throughout her life). Then someone gave her a flyer for open auditions forwhat would become Trainspotting.View image in fullscreenTeen star … with Ewan McGregor in Trainspotting.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyShe was 18 and working in a restaurant. As she progressed through the stages towards getting the part, it was “excruciating” she remembers. “Especially when Ewan McGregor was in the room. He says he couldn’t even see what I looked like because I was holding my script covering my face.” In hindsight, she says she can see Trainspotting and its stars were part of a British boom. “At the time I didn’t feel special, I didn’t feel part of a …” She pauses. A picture of an old magazine cover came up online recently, and she clicked on it. “It was, like, Cool Britannia or something. And I was in it. That’s really funny today, it’s very nice.”Did she not go to celeb parties? Hang out with Liam Gallagher and Kate Moss? “I might have gone out with Kate Moss once,” she says, her face crinkling at the effort of dredging her memory. She didn’t really hang out with actors and wasn’t part of a “scene” – she still isn’t. She does remember going to premieres of films she wasn’t in. “I can’t imagine doing that now,” she says with a laugh. “I barely want to go to my own.” Her life in Glasgow – her home town, and that of her former husband, the Travis bassist Dougie Payne – is “pretty boring”, she says. “I’m surrounded by boys and animals. I have a very low-key life, it suits me.” She misses it when away. “I need to go and nest.”Was it a deliberate choice to create a down-to-earth life? She never did the Hollywood hustling thing, and doesn’t do social media. “I’m a pretty patient person and every now and then a great script does come along, luckily, and I get the opportunity to be a part of something.” It’s not that she isn’t ambitious. “I want to do good stuff and work with good people, I just don’t know what the thing is until it comes up, and that’s kind of the way it’s always been.”View image in fullscreenGangster squad … with Steve Buscemi in Boardwalk Empire.Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/AlamyMacdonald has done great work, and worked with great people – four years in the HBO series Boardwalk Empire, a role in No Country for Old Men, some lovely Brit films such as The Girl in the Café Nanny McPhee, and Swallows and Amazons, not to mention the TV juggernaut that was Line of Duty. With years of acclaim and experience behind her, it was fun to be in the 2017 Trainspotting sequel and not feel intimidated the way she did on the first one. “I’d seen Ewan at various points in the interim, and it was just really nice to feel like I was with a peer, rather than someone way beyond my sphere. We got to hang out and I wasn’t hiding in the toilets.”Even so, Macdonald still sometimes feels a little like she did back then. “I mean, aspects have got easier, but when they say ‘action’, it immediately feels like it always did that first time. Like you forget how to walk, really simple things.” She laughs. “I basically want to please my bosses. I want to please the director. If you get through the first day, it gets better after that.” She meets younger women, “and I just am so impressed by them”, she says. “They are unapologetic, and will correct you if you’re down on yourself about something small and piffling. But that’s just the way I was brought up, to be self-deprecating, and they’re having none of it. It’s really impressive.”View image in fullscreenStraight-talking … as police therapist Rachel Irving in Dept. Q.Photograph: NetflixIt took her until her 40s to feel more like that, she says. “You stop giving so much energy to things that are silly and don’t serve you. I just feel like I’m less apologetic about who I am.”If Macdonald is still fixed as that teenager in Trainspotting in many people’s minds, she has been busiest, with her best work, in her late 30s and 40s. “It’s very exciting to read something and feel you can connect to it in some way, and you want to play-act the scenes like I did when I was a kid. Most of my working life, I’m in a room on my own learning lines, which is how I used to play.” It can feel like a slog when it’s not working for her. “But I know when it’s a good one, because I’m quite happy to be back in that room.”Dept. Q is on Netflix on 29 May.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionKelly MacdonaldfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Lili is a co-production between the New York-based game studio iNK Stories (creator of1979 Revolution: Black Friday, about a photojournalist in Iran) and the Royal Shakespeare Company, and it’s been turning heads with its eye-catching translocation of Macbeth to modern-day Iran.“It’s been such an incredible coup to have it as the first video game experience at Cannes,” says iNK Stories co-founder Vassiliki Khonsari. “People have gone in saying, I’m not familiar playing games, so I may just try it out for five minutes. […] But then once they’re in, there is this growing sense of empowerment that people from the film world are feeling.”The Cannes festival’s Immersive Competition began in 2024, although the lineup doesn’t usually feature traditional video games.“VR films and projection mapping is the thrust of it,” says iNK Stories’ other co-founder, Vassiliki’s husband Navid Khonsari. But Lili weaves live-action footage with video game mechanics in a similar way to a game such asTelling LiesorImmortality. Its lead, Zar Amir Ebrahimi, won best actress at Cannes three years ago.Lili focuses on the story of LadyMacbeth, here cast as the ambitious wife of an upwardly mobile officer in the Basij (a paramilitary volunteer militia within the Islamic Revolutionary Guard in Iran). As in the play, she plots a murder to secure her husband’s rise. “I think that the narrative of Lady Macbeth is that she’s manipulative, and that’s exactly what got us interested,” says Navid.“The social limitations based on her gender forced her to try to attain whatever leadership role she can,” he continues. “If she was a man, she would have been one of the greatest kings that country would have ever experienced, but because she was a woman she had to work within the structure that was there for her. And I think this is the same thing that we have with our Lili character: because of society, she’s limited to how high she can rise.”The player is cast as a member of the Hecate Web, a group of hackers who stand in for Macbeth’s witches, and you begin by accessing Lili’s phone and computer, watching her on CCTV cameras inside her home. The oppression of surveillance and censorship is a key theme. At one point Lili tries to access a YouTube makeup tutorial, only to be blocked by the state’s firewall. The fact that the player takes on an uncomfortable voyeuristic role is intentional. “We’re all part of the problem when it comes to surveillance, when it comes to looking at each other, spying on each other,” says Navid.View image in fullscreen‘She’s suffocating in the various layers of masks that she must put on’ … Zar Amir Ebrahimi in Lili.Photograph: Ellie SmithYou can bypass it to give her access, however, prompting a memorable scene in which she wraps her head in clingfilm before applying eyeliner and lipstick. “That is her ritual, applying makeup in a world that she cannot do that [in], without her husband knowing or anyone else knowing,” says Vassiliki. “We love it as this sort of allegory, that she’s suffocating in the world and in the various layers of masks that she must put on herself … our Lady Macbeth, our Lili, has an awakening, and all of those tools that we’ve used to hack her become tools that we actually give her to help her take the system down from within.”Lili is scheduled for release in late 2026, and the RSC’s Sarah Ellis says that it might well be turned into a play at some point in the future. Navid says there are already plans for a film version, using some of the same footage shot for the game – a reminder that the boundaries between the worlds of gaming, movies and theatre are increasingly porous. This is unlikely to be the last time the RSC is involved in games.“I was always interested in games, and the convergence of games and theatre in particular,” says Ellis, who originally approached iNK with the idea for this collaboration. “We’ve worked with some of the best Shakespeare scholars … Professor Emma Smith from Oxford has been an absolute keystone in the dramaturgy of this work,” says Ellis. Smith has said that if Shakespeare were alive today, he’d be writing for games, and Ellis agrees: “He was an innovator.”Explore more on these topicsGamesCannes film festivalFestivalsIranMacbethfeaturesShareReuse this content"

During production, the screenwriters of Jurassic Park (David Koepp) and Chinatown (Robert Towne) sent in duelling script pages for director Brian De Palma and producer Tom Cruise to wrestle over. The magnificent outcome is an intense tango between the modern blockbuster and a classic film noir, circling each other warily, and beautifully, like noMission: Impossiblethat would follow. De Palma’s original is a sexy wrong-man thriller, a Hitchcockian affair that comes disguised as an action-heavy corporate product (or maybe the mask is worn the other way around?). In it, Cruise’s coiled IMF agent, framed for the murder of his entire team and surrounded by slippery allies, is constantly trying to play it cool through the plot’s knotty parlor games, all while feeling the noose tightening around him. If Cruise’s career up to this point was all about often leaving his relaxed boyish middle-American charm on the surface, Mission: Impossible pushed him to try on layers – not just the latex ones – while also pulling off those incredible high-wire stunts, which would only escalate but never improve on the hair-raising tension the first time out.Radheyan SimonpillaiMission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning review – world-saving Tom Cruise signs off with wildly entertaining adventureRead moreMission: Impossible 2By film two, Ethan Hunt is still sort of a blank-slate action man – but John Woo’s take on M:I stands out simply by having the highest iconic-moment-per-minute ratio in the entire series. Cruise first appears on the screen free-soloing a mountain and takes delivery of his mission in the form of a set of rocket-delivered exploding sunglasses: then it’s straight into the motorbike duels, rubber masks and capoeira kicks, with barely a pause for breath. There is a scene in this film whereTom Cruiseflawlessly impersonates a man who is three inches taller than him. There is a stunt where Dougray Scott was encouraged,by Cruise, to put his entire weight on a knife mere millimetres above the megastar’s eyeball, just for a cool closeup. The soundtrack is by Hans Zimmer andLimp Bizkit. It might be silly, and Thandiwe Newton described the shoot as “a nightmare”, but no other Impossible is as rewatchable, let alone as fun.Joel SnapeMission: Impossible IIIIt’s almost impossible to overstate the importance of Mission: Impossible III. For the franchise it was key (the previous John Woo-directed installment remains a baffling mess), but for Cruise himself it was absolutely vital. The film was released right at his nadir. One year earlier, he had gone off the rails in public – leaping on Oprah’s couch, lambasting interviewers for being glib for asking questions about Scientology – and he was three months away from being temporarily sacked from Paramount by its boss, Sumner Redstone. But if Mission: Impossible III delivered, he’d still have a career left to salvage. Luckily it did. Later outings might have outdone it in terms of scale and spectacle, but M:I III was responsible for laying the table for those films. This was the first film where Ethan Hunt was an actual person, not just a smirking mannequin. It was also where we first met Benji, Simon Pegg’s superlative sidekick. The stunts had a pleasingly smashmouth quality (check out the way that Cruise is awkwardly flung against a car during an explosion). What’s more, in Philip Seymour Hoffman, we had the most intense villain of the franchise. Mission: Impossible III is a great film, but the most perfect thing about it is that it arrived just when Tom Cruise needed it most.Stuart HeritageMission: Impossible – Ghost ProtocolThere isn’t really a bad Mission: Impossible sequel, a compliment one would be hard pressed paying to the majority of eight-film-strong franchises (the second, which many would pick, still possesses an aggressively, Limp Bizkit-y year 2000 charm for me). But the one that most effectively packages all of the expected elements is the fourth instalment, Ghost Protocol, which set the perfect blueprint for the latter chapters. Brad Bird might not have been the most stylish of Mission directors (De Palma he is not) but, with a background in animation, there’s both a buoyancy and a clarity to the unrelenting action, delivering some of the most thrillingly staged and paced action sequences in the series (has there been anything more exciting than Cruise climbing the Burj Khalifa?). There’s also something hilariously demented about Cruise responding to quibbles over his age or longevity in the role by offering us two potential replacements in Josh Holloway and Jeremy Renner and then killing one and emasculating the other. King behaviour, honestly.Benjamin LeeMission: Impossible – Rogue NationNearly 10 years after the release of Rogue Nation, it might look less like a highlight than a series turning point, when it switched from accidental director anthology to a long-term collaboration between writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and Tom Cruise. Rogue Nation was the first of four McQuarrie-directed Missions, and the practical, Cruise-endangering stunt work that became a series trademark was, by its nature, repeatedly topped by subsequent instalments. The opening, which merely has Cruise actually hanging on to the side of a real plane as it takes off, camera fixed on him to assure us that it’s not an illusion, now seems downright quaint. But as a spy caper featuring stunts (the airplane opener), break-ins (a spectacularly tricky underwater data breach during which Cruise’s Ethan Hunt literally dies), noir-ish intrigue (the gorgeous sequence at the Vienna Opera House and the shadowy climax recall both Hitchcock and The Third Man), and sheer blockbuster much-ness (the underwater break-in leads to a car chase which leads to a motorcycle chase), Rogue Nation is the series operating at top level. After many personnel shifts, it establishes a core team of Cruise, Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames and a stunning Rebecca Ferguson that will power much of the series going forward, and adds in a little extra Jeremy Renner, as a treat. The sequels are a lot of fun with plenty of indelible moments but the truth is, McQuarrie nailed it in one.Jesse HassengerMission: Impossible – FalloutSome people may cherish Mission: Impossible – Fallout for the glimpse it offers of Ethan’s longing for ex-wife Julia (Michelle Monaghan). But for most of us, the film’s appeal lies in the way it builds its terrifying vertical action sequences from a series of electric ups and downs in Paris and London to take the world to the brink of destruction as Ethan thrashes about in a chopper in Kashmir. Writer-director Christopher McQuarrie provides the kind of plot twists that would satisfy a silent serial without losing focus on Ethan’s route through the moral murk. The European road chases, stunts and perilous parkour have a dash of gritty style, even flashes of lightning, as the camera whips past landmark architecture, while a bathroom fight scene against bright white tile is amusingly inventive – plus there’s noir-chic in the low-lit scenes where expositions and betrayals unfold. But the film is best when it loses its cool, with Ethan trying to intercept the detonator to a nuclear bomb, via a monstrously improbable, breath-stoppingly tense helicopter battle in the mountains.Pamela HutchinsonMission: Impossible – Dead ReckoningThe penultimate Mission: Impossible is the best franchise instalment because it has the best stunt. But, as its Oscar nominations suggest (visual effects and sound design – the only two ever earned by the series), it is a stunt fuelled not just by Tom Cruise’s kamikaze bravado but by good ol’ VFX and some incredible metal groaning on the soundtrack. It’s the film’s climax. We’re on a gorgeous, posh, blue-and-gold runaway steam train. There’s the obligatory knife fight on the roof and a precisely timed leap to liberty by the baddie, but that’s just the start. A viaduct ahead is blown up, and – just in time – Cruise and Hayley Atwell manage to disengage the engine, which crashes spectacularly into a ravine, per Back to the Future III. They did actually crash a steam train for this, in Derbyshire, where itcaused a bit of a stir. But then –then!– our hero and heroine must leap through the next few carriages as they, too, grindingly slide off the edge of the track and hang for a few moments before the couplers fail and the valley awaits. There’s the kitchen car (soup, peppers, gas hob), the dining carriage (crockery, flames, chairs) and, most perilous of all, the cocktail bar (grand piano). It’s like The Poseidon Adventure in super-speed miniature, a Buster Keaton upside-down nightmare and the most fabulous thing ever.Catherine ShoardExplore more on these topicsMission: ImpossibleTom CruiseMission: Impossible - Rogue NationMission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part OneAction and adventure filmsThrillersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But in this east London dance studio – with Zaha Hadid’s Olympic swimming pool visible through the window – young performers in sports socks, joggers and baggy T-shirts are reimagining the Who’s seminal document of the mid-60s Quadrophenia as ballet.Isn’t this 1973 album an unlikely subject for dance? We’ve recently had Black Sabbath: The Ballet, and Message in a Bottle set to Sting, so why not? After all, Quadrophenia is theatrical at its roots. “The closest thing to a grand opera I’ll ever write,” says the Who’s guitarist and songwriterPete Townshend. Set in 1965, the story of disaffected young mod Jimmy looking for meaning in life via music, amphetamines and aspirational tailoring became a cult 1979 film starring Phil Daniels, but a more recent incarnation was Classic Quadrophenia, a symphonic version of the album for orchestra and tenor Alfie Boe. It was when Townshend heard the instrumental version, orchestrated by the musician Rachel Fuller (also Townshend’s wife) that he said to her: “I think this would make a lovely ballet.”A few years on, Fuller was composing a children’s ballet and met ex-RoyalBalletdancer Natalie Harrison; together a plan was hatched (Harrison is creative producer on the project). The person whose job it became to turn this much-loved piece of pop culture into dance, however, had barely heard of Quadrophenia. “I knew the film poster,” says Paul Roberts, a choreographer who has worked with Harry Styles, Spice Girls and numerous other pop luminaries. But the team quickly started workshopping ideas, drawing on classical, contemporary and commercial dance, and brought in Tony-, Emmy- and Olivier-winning director Rob Ashford, to help shape what Townshend calls “a compressed vision of what a lot of young men go through in their late teens and early 20s. This young guy who is bereft and lacks deep friendships and support and yet he feels part of this mod gang.”View image in fullscreenWho better? … the cast of Quadrophenia in rehearsal.Photograph: Rich LakosIt is 60 years since the famous beachfront clash, ancient history for the dancers who are in their 20s, such as Paris Fitzpatrick, 29, who plays Jimmy. Unlike the directionless Jimmy, Fitzpatrick has been training at performing arts school since the age of 12 and gone on to an award-winning dance career. Can he relate to these characters? “Disillusionment? We can all relate, I think,” he says. “Being a bit lost, the search for meaning, I’ve experienced a lot of that.” Harrison tells me that in discussions in the studio, the young cast ended up making parallels with TV series Adolescence, “the anger, confusion of being a young man, needing to belong”.Down the corridor in the costume room, it turns out one thing the dancers are having trouble relating to is the tightness of the suits. “They normally wear triple XL,” laughs associate costume designer Natalie Pryce, amid the racks of Paul Smith shirts, vintage finds, polo shirts and parkas. Smith has designed the costumes, and Pryce and costume stylist Hannah Teare are putting together the wardrobe and adjusting garments for the needs of dancers. That means adding gussets under the arms and in the slim-cut trousers, accommodating dancers’ muscular thighs.Vintage suits have “no bounce”, says Teare, no stretch in the fabric. They also have to double up on some items to take into account all the inevitable sweat. “You’ve got to allow for the first previews and press night, where everyone’s a bit more nervous,” says Pryce. Then you’ve got to get the details right, the correct width of lapel (narrow) and collar style (dagger), the kind of things that might pass some by “but a mod would know that another guy passing on the street was a mod”, says Teare. There are hairstyles to think about, too. A lot of the boys are reluctant to grow out their fades, says Pryce, but others are getting in the spirit. (And since there’s an Oasis reunion about to happen, they might find themselves at the height of fashion.)When Jimmy’s parents move together it’s absolutely powerful and poignant. You couldn’t do it with wordsPete Townshend“The look was the manifesto,” says Townshend of the mod movement. And the suits, in fact, were instrumental in shaping the actual dancing the mods did in the 60s (“Pete got up and showed us some moves,” says Roberts. “There’s one where he flicks his leg out, we’ve stolen that.”) “Because they invested so much into what they were wearing, it’s very poised, very collected, super minimal,” Roberts demonstrates a subtle groove. “You want to keep your tie straight, your shirt tails tucked in,” adds Ashford, and God forbid you mess up your hair. But there was an edge, a sense of the caged animal about it. The energy inside that composure was “scruffy and hectic”, says Roberts, “wild and messy energy contained in a sort of box of self-consciousness” is how Fitzpatrick puts it. “About as far from classical ballet as you can get.”Everyone on the production raves about Fitzpatrick as Jimmy (he’s best known for dancing the lead in Matthew Bourne’s Romeo and Juliet). “He has this fragility, this rawness to him,” says Roberts. It’s the lost boy look in his deep brown eyes. In the show, four other dancers embody the four facets of Jimmy’s personality that he’s grappling with – the Romantic, the Hypocrite, the Tough Guy, the Lunatic – trying to make sense of who he is. Also recently added to the cast is Royal Ballet principal Matthew Ball, as Godfather. Harrison tells me she was watching him in rehearsal leaping around the room. “It was electric,” she says. “You know how suddenly the stars align? It was like Pete’s guitar playing happening as a full-body experience.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Townshend already liked dance. “I’m a big fan of ballet. I go quite a lot,” he says. He talks about a scene between Jimmy’s troubled parents. “When they move together it’s absolutely powerful and poignant. You couldn’t do it with words.”When Townshend first saw some of the movement Roberts had made to his music, “I was struck by the fact that I was being drawn back to my mid-20s by these boys, who had a physical way of expressing the missing lyrics. It felt like it was drawn from deep inside these young dancers. And I found it incredibly moving.” The 1960s was a different world, the inheritance of the postwar generation and the heralding of huge social change. “But it became clear there was a link between the kids that I grew up with and the similar issues, frustrations, difficulties that young men are facing today,” says Townshend. “The world is in a dangerous place at the moment.”Fuller was determined that the ballet shouldn’t be set in the modern day, but in a way, says Townshend, that’s what’s happening. “It’s being brought into the modern day by the dancers. There are a couple of times when I’ve had tears in my eyes,” he says. “And that’s not because I’m listening to my own music,” he smiles, “it’s because it feels like it belongs to this new gang.”There’s so much mythology around the mod movement. “The most dramatic pictures taken in the beach fights? The press set it up,” says Townshend. “Got a couple of rockers to jump off [the prom]. And according to a few of my mates from the day, they were paid 10 quid to smash up some deckchairs. Most of the mods didn’t want to muck up their clothes fighting.” And the movement itself was transitory. “It was very, very strong and very, very powerful when it was there,” says Townshend. “But it only lasted about two and a half years.” Quadrophenia, by contrast, is still thriving.Quadrophenia: A Mod Balletis atTheatre Royal, Plymouth, Wednesday to 1 June; touring to 19 July.Explore more on these topicsDancePete TownshendBalletThe WhofeaturesShareReuse this content"

His debut mixtape Demotape/Vega was nominated for the Mercury prize, and Who Am I, his debut album, features collaborators such as Fred Again.Irish singer-songwriter Orla Gartland won best song musically and lyrically for her spartan ballad Mine, a devastatingly honest song that examines longstanding trauma and how Gartland relearned intimacy.She beat one of the biggest British songs of the year in that category, Messy by Lola Young, as well as competition from Raye, Laura Marling and Fontaines DC. Young picked up the rising star award, though, after the morose and sweary Messy spent four weeks at UK No 1 and became a global smash.Best contemporary song was awarded to the relatively little-heard Circumnavigating Georgia by Sans Soucis, who beat Jade’s pop smash Angel of My Dreams as well as rap tracks by Pa Salieu, Ghetts and Bashy.Sans Soucis is the artist name of Giulia Grispino, an Italian-Congolese artist who relocated to London as a young adult. Circumnavigating Georgia, the title track of her second album, is a dreamy yet pointed ballad with ambient backing, as Grispino considers love and changing selfhood.In the screen composition categories, Raffertie won best original film score for his work on Demi Moore body horror The Substance, and Vince Pope won best television soundtrack for True Detective: Night Country.There was an indie triumph in the best original video game score category, given to John Konsolakis for his symphonic work for homegrown Scottish game Farewell North, in which you play a border collie traversing a landscape inspired by the Scottish Highlands.The award for most performed work was given to Myles Smith for his huge, heartfelt hit Stargazing, which has been ubiquitous on radio and streaming.The Ivors Academy also handed out a series of honorary awards. U2 became the first Irish act to be named Academy Fellows, while the icon award was given toRobbie Williamsin the week he announced his latest album, Britpop. The visionary award was given to Self Esteem, after the recent release of her third studio album A Complicated Woman, and the special international award was given to Brandon Flowers, frontman of the Killers.The classic lineup of British indie bandBloc Party– Kele Okereke, Russell Lissack, Gordon Moakes and Matt Tong – were given the award for outstanding song collection, recognising a career that stretches back to their enduringly popular 2005 debut album Silent Alarm.Ivors Academy chief executive Roberto Neri acknowledged the challenges faced by songwriters as he hailed the winners. “Whether it’s fair pay, safe working environments or ensuring meaningful opt-in consent in the age of AI, the Ivors Academy exists to protect, empower and celebrate the most vital creative force in the music industry,” he said.2025 Ivor Novello winners in fullBest album:Who Am I, written and performed by BerwynBest contemporary song: Circumnavigating Georgia, written and performed by Sans SoucisBest song musically and lyrically: Mine, written and performed by Orla GartlandMost performed work: Stargazing, written by Peter Fenn, Jesse Fink and Myles Smith, and performed by Myles SmithRising star award: Lola YoungBest original fim score: The Substance, composed by RaffertieBest original video game score: Farewell North, composed by John KonsolakisBest television soundtrack: True Detective: Night Country, composed by Vince PopeAcademy fellowship: Bono, the Edge, Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen Jr for U2Outstanding song collection: Kele Okereke, Russell Lissack, Gordon Moakes and Matt Tong for Bloc PartyIcon award: Robbie WilliamsSongwriter of the year: Charli xcxSpecial international award: Brandon FlowersVisionary award: Self EsteemExplore more on these topicsIvor Novello awardsPop and rockAwards and prizesIrelandU2Charli xcxThe KillersnewsShareReuse this content"

All rights reserved. leemiller.co.ukBorn in 1907 in Poughkeepsie, New York state, Miller was first exposed to a camera by working as a model in the late 1920s, when she was photographed by celebrated figures such as Cecil Beaton and Edward Steichen. This inspired her to pursue photography and she quickly became a leading figure of the avant garde.It was after moving to Paris in 1929 that Miller began working with the visual artist Man Ray, becoming his student, muse and lover. Together they discoveredsolarisation, a photographic technique in which reversed halo-like effects are created through exposure to light during processing.In the early 1930s, Miller turned her lens to the streets of Paris, creating a series of photographs capturing the surreal in the everyday. Through crops, disorienting angles and reflections, she reimagined familiar Parisian sights ranging from Notre Dame Cathedral to a Guerlain perfume shop window.View image in fullscreenDavid E Scherman, dressed for war, 1942.Photograph: Lee Miller Archives, England 2025. All rights reserved. leemiller.co.uk.When she moved toLondonin 1939 at the outbreak of the second world war, Miller embarked on a new career in photojournalism, becoming the official war photographer for British Vogue and one of the few accredited female war correspondents.The exhibition will showcase her depictions of blitz-torn London, including You will not lunch in Charlotte Street today (1940) and Fire Masks (1941), which capture the pathos and absurdity of the city in wartime.Also on display will be her photographs of women’s contributions on the home front, harrowing scenes from the frontline, the liberation of Paris, and the devastation and deprivation of the Buchenwald and Dachau concentration camps.View image in fullscreenPortrait of Space, Al Bulwayeb near Siwa, 1937.

All rights reserved. leemiller.co.uk.These works will be presented in dialogue with extracts from Miller’s first-person essays, which were published in British and American Vogue.The show will include the portraits of Miller and David E Scherman in Hitler’s private bath in April 1945,which were stageddirectly after the pair returned from photographing Dachau, and are considered to be some of the most extraordinary images of the 20th century. Miller posed for the photos with the dried mud of that morning’s visit to the camp on her boots deliberately dirtying Hitler’s bathroom.Miller’s work and life have been depicted numerous times, including in the 2005 musical Six Pictures of Lee Miller and the2023 film Lee, in which Kate Winslet played Miller. She was also referenced as role model for the war photographer depicted by Kirsten Dunst in the 2024 film Civil War.Theexhibitionwill run from 2 October 2025 to 15 February 2026.Explore more on these topicsLee MillerExhibitionsTate BritainPhotographyArtSecond world warLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

It is, Abramović says, a reflection on how “in our culture today, we label anything erotic as pornography”.There will be a cast of 70, including dancers, musicians and singers, with the production unfolding across 13 scenes.View image in fullscreenMarina Abramovic says the show looks back to ancient rituals and deals with sexuality in relation to the universe.Photograph: Carlo BachAnyone flustered by the closeup sight of breasts, bottoms, vaginas and penises should probably start drawing up alternative plans for October.The scenes will include Scaring the Gods, a recreation of a centuries-old ritual in which Balkan village women would try to keep the rain away by running to the fields, lifting their skirts up and baring themselves to the heavens.Fertility Rite will re-enact a fevered ritual where naked bodies writhe against the ground in “a desperate call for fertility”.Massaging the Breast explores a ritual where women do just that, gesticulating over graves to awaken the earth.Abramović has described the work as the fulfilment of a long-term dream. “Balkan Erotic Epic is the most ambitious work in my career,” she said. “This gives me a chance to go back to my Slavic roots and culture, look back to ancient rituals and deal with sexuality in relation to the universe and the unanswered questions of our existence.“Through this project I would like to show poetry, desperation, pain, hope, suffering and reflect our own mortality.”Belgrade-born Abramović, 78, is one of the world’s most distinguished artists with a career spanning five decades. She is seen as a boundary pushing pioneer of performance who has regularly used her own body to test the limits of physical and mental endurance, often having to be rescued from peril by audience members.She has explored Balkan erotic rituals in film before, but the project premiering in Manchester is a new, much more ambitious work.In an interview last year, Abramović acknowledged that British people have a peculiar sensibility about certain things. “You’re so puritan about everything, about nudity, about sexual organs,” she said.View image in fullscreenMarina Abramović’s 1977 work,Imponderabilia.Photograph: Marina Abramović and UlayShe revels in challenging that. At her blockbuster retrospective at the Royal Academy of Arts in London in 2023 she re-staged a work called Imponderabilia featuring a naked couple in a doorway it would have been rude for visitors not to squeeze through.The question for many was whether to face the naked man or the naked woman.Some went through, apologising. Others were nonchalant, as if it was something they did all the time.Balkan Erotic Epic is produced by Factory International and will be staged atAviva Studios. The artistic director and chief executive, John McGrath, said it was an honour, describing Abramović as “one of the most influential artists of our time”.He added: “This new performance work offers an unmissable opportunity for audiences to experience the next chapter of her creative life – bold, immersive and on a scale that’s totally unprecedented.”Audiences will be invited to navigate the performance as they wish with the possibility of “pop-up encounters” of “intimate performances, feverish dances and haunting songs”.It is based on folklore and ancestral traditions from regions taking in Romania, Bulgaria, Greece, Albania, Serbia, Kosovo, North Macedonia and Montenegro as well as Roma and Traveller cultures.The idea is that “erotic” is not something that should be seen as taboo, but more as “a vital spiritual and life force”.After Manchester, the production will be seen in Barcelona, Berlin, New York and Hong Kong.Balkan Erotic Epic is at Aviva Studios 9-19 October.Tickets currently on salefor Factory International members and will be available for the general public on 29 MayExplore more on these topicsMarina AbramovićPerformance artManchesterArtEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

I don’t think the film is defining or attempting to redefine masculinity, I think it is being very subjective to the relationship between [their characters] Lionel and David.”Asked whether he was pleased by comparisons some critics had drawn with Brokeback Mountain, in which Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal star as ranchers who fall in love in 1950s Wyoming, Mescal rejected the idea.View image in fullscreenJosh O’Connor and Paul Mescal in The History of Sound.Photograph: Gwen Capistran/© Fair Winter LLC. All Rights Reserved“I personally don’t see the parallels at all with Brokeback Mountain, other than we spent a little time in a tent,” he said.Lee’s drama, which controversially lost out on a best picture Oscar to Crash in 2005, is, continued Mescal, “a beautiful film but it is dealing with the idea of repression … I find those comparisons relatively lazy and frustrating, but for the most part I think the relationship I have to the film is born out of the fact that it’s a celebration between these men’s love and not the repression of their sexuality.”Mescal then praised his absent co-star O’Connor, who made his name in Francis Lee’s queer dramaGod’s Own Countryand is now finishing production on Steven Spielberg’s next film, calling him “one of the easiest persons” to establish a rapport with.“Josh has a great gift,” he said. “The person who the general public sees is very similar to the one that we know and I think that’s very difficult for an actor in today’s age to do.“We’ve known each other for about five years and we were definitely friendly so that foundation of safety and play was there, but that relationship really deepened in the three or four weeks we were filming.”The actor said their bond was further deepened by a shared love of the hard candy Jolly Ranchers.The History of Sound review – Paul Mescal and Josh O’Connor romance is full-bodied but tin-earedRead more“It sounds kind of coy but Josh is just incredibly silly to me,” said Mescal. “We got fixated on this diet drink during the shooting process but we would also become fixated on having eight Jolly Ranchers a day … There’s a microcosm to our relationship that I think of Josh and I think of jolly ranchers.”The History of Sound was warmly greeted at its Cannes premiere on Wednesday evening, although with not quite the same rapturous reception as the later film to screen that evening,Sentimental Value.O’Connor will also be seen in another film premiering on Friday at the festival, Kelly Reichardt’s The Mastermind. Later this year Mescal will star as William Shakespeare opposite Jesse Buckley in Chloé Zhao’s adaptation of Maggie O’Farrell’s novel Hamnet.Explore more on these topicsCannes film festivalPaul MescalFestivalsBrokeback MountainnewsShareReuse this content"

But she wasn’t just strong, she was also especially tender and sensitive.”Adele said she would continue to work as a solo artist, aiming to complete a long-term project spanning 201 canvases. “Eva told me that until the end: ‘Please keep on working.’”Explore more on these topicsPerformance artArtGermanyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

And it’s cut through the hand and cut through the little finger,” she told the audience at Charleston festival in East Sussex, holding up her four-fingered hand.After the accident happened, she said she “just sat at the bottom of the stairs with blood everywhere, because I thought Ipswich hospital would be full of drunks and everything on a Saturday night”.She waited until the following morning to go to hospital and, after an initial operation, she and the doctors decided to “wait to see how it does”.“But it just went black and began to stink,” the artist said. “So I had to have it off.”Ever committed to her art – she gets up at “about five in the summer and six in the winter” and works every day – Hambling was back in the studio as soon as she got back from hospital. She started drawing her right hand, which was in a “great big bandage”, with her left, “and it felt fine”.Her therapist told her that hand injuries were “most difficult for musicians and artists because a lot of their brains are in their hands”, but that was “news to me”, Hambling said.“Two of the funniest things” about the injury, she said, were when her plumber came into her studio in Suffolk, “saw I was working with my left hand, and said: ‘Is it going to be half-price then?’“And then I sent a photograph [of her hand] on my telephone to my friend Carol and she immediately texted back and said: ‘You’ll have to go to Prince Harry’s Invictus Games’,” Hambling said. “And that’s the end of that.”The artist was speaking at the festival, held in the grounds of the former home of the Bloomsbury Group artists Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant, alongside the artistSarah Lucas. The pair have just announced a winter show at Sadie Coles HQ and Frankie Rossi Art Projects, for which they will each select works by the other.The art scene is “a stinking, bitchy world”, Hambling said, with Lucas adding that a lot of artists want to be in the “success club”, “get rich” and “get a yacht”.“Like Tracey Emin,” Hambling joked.Explore more on these topicsMaggi HamblingPaintingArtSarah LucasnewsShareReuse this content"

It said it has been running the school at a substantial loss for the past three years.The announcement has caused outrage in the music industry, with 24 winners of the BBC Young Musician of the Year award signing a letter to protest against the closure.A petition onChange.orghas reached almost 14,000 signatures, while Stuart Andrew, shadow secretary of state for Culture, Media and Sport, has said he would talk to the secretary of state about the suspension.Melanie Watson, Newark’s assistant principal, said the “outpouring of response” had “galvanised our resolve in wanting to ensure a thriving future for musical instrument craft in Newark”.“Moving on from the degree course closure this September, we want to instead work with partners and organisations as well as our own staff and pupils to create a course and programme that encourages and improves what is clearly a very important institution for many,” she added.Watson confirmed the college was considering replacing the degree programme with a privately funded course although she acknowledged this would mean students had no access to finance. In addition, overseas students, who represent a substantial proportion of undergraduates, would be unable to get a visa to study at the college.She added: “Our aim is to explore all options, including partnering with as many organisations, entrepreneurs and industry bodies as possible. We want to make sure we can work together as one to secure programmes that fully meet the needs of learners and of industry, that learners can afford to pay and that grow the number of enrolled students to secure musical instrument craft in Newark so it thrives well into the future.”Campaigners say the four courses being suspended – for violin makers, guitar makers, piano technicians and woodwind specialists – are vital to preserve traditional knowledge that benefits not just every musician, but everyone who enjoys music.“Instrument makers and maintainers are the tiny people,” said Benjamin Hebbert, former chair of the British Violin Making Association, who has lectured for free at the college for the past 15 years. “We’re not glamorous but without us, there are no instruments.”Hebbert, who has written to the all-party parliamentary group for craft, believes the value of the course to the UK’s £4bn music industry makes it “vastly more important for Britain’s cultural landscape than a tiny conglomerate of craft courses at threat”.He said: “We’re not just talking about mending the instruments of the great soloists. Without us, there will be no music in schools or the community – all the school music rooms, gigs and concerts will go silent.”Explore more on these topicsMusicHeritageCraftHigher educationnewsShareReuse this content"

Imelda Staunton and Bessie Carter here make a more compelling double act and bring an added frisson to the play’s intimacies and disputes.Carter plays Vivie, a no-nonsense young woman with ambitions to take up the legal profession. Her mother, Kitty (Staunton), has a successful profession of her own – the world’s oldest – and a string of brothels to her name. When Kitty visits Vivie, who has just graduated from Cambridge, this secret is explosively revealed.You can see why it was originally banned by the Lord Chamberlain. If Victorians were shocked by the theme of sex work, its ideological grenades about the corruptions of capitalism and establishment hypocrisies still resonate today. Some go off in director Dominic Cooke’s period-dress production, which he has edited for sleekness.It feels abidingly faithful but moves stiffly at times, carrying the sense of a dusted down drama despite Chloe Lamford’s shining set, an island of flora and fauna bobbing like an eternally fragrant English garden against a bare black backdrop, before being stripped of its naturalism. The period dress strangely mutes the play’s shocks while, in an awkward touch, lugubrious ghostly figures in undergarments (Victorian sex workers?) crowd around the edges and act as stagehands.View image in fullscreenIdeological grenades … Imelda Staunton and Bessie Carter in Mrs Warren’s Profession.Photograph: Johan PerssonIt is never staid when Staunton is on stage, though. Both mother and daughter give dignified performances, Staunton the more subtle and formidable with an edge of the dandy while Vivie is plainer and more upright. The play flares fully to life in their duologues but the scenes around them feel filled with extraneous, thinly drawn characters and plot. Mr Praed (Sid Sagar)seems redundant to the drama as a whole while the reverend’s self-serving son, Frank (Reuben Joseph), sounds like a pale imitation of Oscar Wilde’s shallow men.Sir George Crofts (Robert Glenister, excellent) appears every bit the arrogant “capitalist bully” that Vivie accuses him of being, although his defence implicates society and Vivie’s privilege too, while the Reverend (Kevin Doyle) is fabulously performed, bumbling, comic and venal.This is, in large part, a static play of ideas, but the arguments are nuanced.Sex workis not an immoral act in itself but symptomatic of the exploitation of – and limits put upon – working women, it is suggested. Capitalism, high society and the church are implicated, and damned.The script’s intellectual restlessness is still enlivening too; the mother-daughter battles are excellent, twisting and switching our sympathies. Kitty, by turns, seems selfish and honest, Vivie puritanical and moral. Generation and class clashes are also at play alongside existential guilt and rebellion, as well as reflections on mothers and daughters’ rights over and responsibilities to each other. Shaw shows himself to be well ahead of his time in capturing all of this and his arguments still hold a grip, even if it comes off like a Wilde play without the jokes.At theGarrick theatre, London, until 16 AugustExplore more on these topicsTheatreGeorge Bernard ShawImelda StauntonWest EndSex workreviewsShareReuse this content"

His last filmLong Day’s Journey Into Nightfrom 2018 was an extraordinary and almost extraterrestrial experience in the cinema which challenged the audience to examine what they thought about time and memory; this doesn’t have quite that power, being effectively a portmanteau movie, some of whose sections are better than others – though it climaxes with some gasp-inducing images and tracking shots and all the constituent parts contribute to the film’s aggregate effect.Resurrection is, perhaps, a long night’s journey to the enlightenment of daybreak; it finishes at a club called the Sunrise. It is also an episodic journey through Chinese history, finishing at that historic moment which continues to fascinate Chinese film-makers whose movies are a way of collectively processing their feelings about it: New Year’s Eve 1999, the new century in whichChinawas to bullishly embrace the new capitalism while cleaving to the political conformism of the old ways.We are in a kind of alt-reality universe where humans have discovered they can live indefinitely if they do not dream, an activity which burns up humans like a lit candle. Bi Gan leaves it up to us to ponder what that implies for overpopulation.But there is one outlier, one dissident, a man who does dream – he is a sacred monster called the Fantasmer (Jackson Yee) and the paradox is that the Fantasmer’s ecstatic perception of illusions and dreams allows him to reincarnate and resurrect in an exotic variety of lowlife existences at different historic times in the last century – and a woman enters his life. Is it the woman perceiving these events, or is the Fantasmer doing it?At the beginning of the century, and occupying a kind of antique silent-movie world, he is a white-faced figure like the vampire Nosferatu being tended to by a mysterious woman (played by longtime Hou Hsiao-shen performer Shu Qi). During the second world war he is involved in a violent imbroglio in a mirror shop – shades of Welles’s The Lady From Shanghai perhaps – involving a theremin. We flashforward 20 years and our time-travelling itinerant Fantasmer is in a remote and wintry temple where he breaks a Buddha statue and encounters a Spirit of Bitterness.Some decades later, he is a crooked card-sharp who inveigles a little girl into a scam he’s got going against a local gangster and finally we are at the brink of the new century in which the Fantasmer meets another mobster Mr Luo – his vampiric destiny, and the movie’s own visuals, ascend to a new plane.It is a deeply mysterious film whose enigma extends to the title – is what is happening “resurrection” in any clear transformative sense? Or is it just a continuous flickering shape-shifting: the Fantasmer just a pulsating star on the far-reaches of the universe, that might in a few hundred thousand years explode or collapse in on itself?Asking or answering these questions may not be the film’s point and its riddling quality, combined with its spectacular visual effects, may leave some audiences agnostic – and I myself wasn’t sure about the silent-movie type effects. Yet it’s a work of real artistry.Resurrection premiered at theCannes film festivalExplore more on these topicsCannes film festivalFestivalsChinareviewsShareReuse this content"

But you don’t have to be married to play Kurtág’s duets – just generous with your personal space.Leif Ove AndsnesandBertrand Chamayouchose eight of them for this recital, performing them alongside Kurtág’s similarly miniature solos and framing them with four works by Schubert, the master piano duet writer of the 19th century.The Kurtág pieces on the main programme were all from Játékok: translating as Games, this is a collection of mostly tiny piano solos and duets united by their concision and sense of mischief whichKurtág, now 99, has been adding to for half a century. Andsnes’s solo set began with an Evocation of Petrushka that indeed sounded like a sped-up tape of Stravinsky; immediately afterwards there was the contrast ofLes Adieux, quietly throbbing into silence, then an about-turn into the frenzied klaxon of Sirens of the Deluge. Chamayou sent his hands cartwheeling repeatedly down the keyboard in The Little Squall, and painted spots of changing colour in Hommage Tardif à Karskaya. Their duets were even more vivid, with Harangok and Kyrie showcasing differing and equally convincing ways of making the piano sound like bells.Close and complementary in style – Chamayou slightly more animated, Andsnes perhaps cooler and more analytical – the two made a rewarding team in Schubert, whether in the richly woven, melodious Rondo in A, the occasionally spiky Allegro in A minor or the constantly shifting harmonies of the E minor Fugue, written for organ. The highlight was the Fantasie in F minor, which with Andsnes on the top line was shaped into long paragraphs in a way that maintained momentum, before broadening out into an impassioned conclusion.It was back to Kurtág for the encores: two of his many Bach transcriptions, ending with theSonatina from Actus Tragicus– two minutes of quiet, unassuming beauty.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

After starring as Jack Ryan on TV, he now plays Luke Purdue, an Indiana Jones knock-off and son of an adventurer-archaeologist (named Harrison, no less) in Guy Ritchie’s soulless business-class yarn. Despite plucky work fromNatalie Portmanas Luke’s disapproving sister Charlotte, this hodgepodge of plundered elements adds up to nothing more than Indiana Bourne and the Thomas Crown Da Vinci Code.Bankrolled by dying billionaire Owen Carver (Domhnall Gleeson), Luke and his dad’s old team are on the trail of themythical Fountain of Youth. He even has a PowerPoint presentation to show how he intends to find it: hidden on the backs of six paintings by artists such as Caravaggio and El Greco are clues which will lead to this fabled source of immortality. Charlotte cautions against the whole enterprise but is soon whisked along, apparently persuaded by her brother’s bumper-sticker slogans (“Life is about adventure!”). It’s almost as if she can’t see that he is an obnoxious bully, chiding her for her life choices, puckering up creepily for kisses from Esme (Eiza González) who is trying to prevent him from finding the fountain, and given to knocking women unconscious with a disabling spray. Nice.Amid interminable chases and fisticuffs, and tourist-board jaunts to Bangkok, Vienna and Cairo, there is the odd bright spot. Gleeson enjoys himself more as his character’s motives become murkier, even if he is forced to play a restaurant comedy scene that makes no sense in terms of characterisation. As a police inspector on the adventurers’ trail, Arian Moayed gets one nice moment: visibly touched that Charlotte has noticed he is wearing houndstooth, he says: “It’s wasted on most suspects.” The gag is only slightly tainted by the fact that it’s a callback to Ritchie’s Sherlock Holmes films.A movie as derivative and uninspired as this will always be surplus to requirements so long as the first three Indiana Jones movies remain in circulation. As the family name Purdue suggests, Luke and Charlotte’s father believed that some things should remain lost. Would that this had been the fate of the film.Fountain of Youth is on Apple TV+ from 23 May.Explore more on these topicsFilmAction and adventure filmsThrillersGuy RitchieNatalie PortmanDomhnall GleesonreviewsShareReuse this content"

This is a story about the randomness of life in the big city, a melodramatic convulsion of grief, rage and pain which has a TV soap feel to its succession of escalating crises. Like Leila’s Brothers, it is about the entitlement of Iran’s menfolk, and how a man – however shiftless, casual and low-status – can somehow pull rank on a woman in the marriage market.Payman Maadi (from Asghar Farhadi’s A Separation) plays Hamid, an ambulance driver in his late 40s with a certain roguish ladies-man charm whose unmarried status raises eyebrows among some of his acquaintances, but who is now engaged to Mahnaz (Parinaz Izadyar). She is a smart, hardworking hospital nurse who is widowed and lives with her sister Mehri (Soha Niasti) and mum (Fereshteh Sadre Orafaee), and her two kids. Teen son Aliyar (Sinan Mohebi) is always in trouble at school and has a breezy way of sweet-talking his mother into forgiving him and younger sister Neda (Arshida Dorostkar).Hamid is not exactly a catch, but behaves implicitly as if Mahnaz’s two children mean that he is the one being a saint. He insists that the children are absent from the house when his parents come round, and that all their things are hidden away as Mahnaz’s future parents-in-law don’t know about them and might stop the marriage. Mahnaz, against her better judgment, parks the children with the grumpy father of her late husband. The meeting with Hamid’s parents goes ahead and terrible events are set in train including one which is, perhaps bafflingly, never shown on camera and its perpetrator never shown explaining it or discussing it – though an enigma is possibly the point.Maadi’s performance coolly conveys how slippery an individual Hamid is: accustomed to being adored for his supposedly endearing way with a gallant remark, but shrill and self-pitying when challenged on anything. He is running a shabby, corrupt little scam: allowing people to sleep in the ambulances when they are not being used, for an exploitative cash payment. And there are signs that Hamid has a roving eye and he is still (instinctively) hitting on other women.From this tense situation (in which the game is patriarchally rigged against Mahnaz in ways that she couldn’t dream of) a catastrophe occurs – in fact a double catastrophe – which sends Mahnaz into a rage-filled confrontation with every single man in her life, including the choleric schoolteacher Mr Samkhanian (Maziar Seyyedi) who expelled Aliyar against his colleague’s advice. The tragic and startling events emerge in a movie whose storytelling style is otherwise very low-key, and which gives an almost bizarre and unexpected quality to all the heartbreaking emotional pain; this is the unexpectedness of real life, perhaps.Izadyar’s full-throttle performance shows how anguish has made her a kind of ghost, haunting a world that she had hoped to occupy as a modestly contended human being. It is a little overwrought, though carried by the forthright performances.Woman and Child screened at theCannes film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsIranWorld cinemaCannes film festivalMiddle East and north AfricaFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

That was the process that led to the final versions of works such as Mémoriale, Anthèmes and …explosante-fixe…, and to the pair of substantial pieces that are played with fabulous precision and incisiveness on this disc.View image in fullscreenBoulez: Éclat/Multiples.Éclat/Multiples, completed in 1981, began life in 1965 as Éclat, a kit-like eight-minute exploration of the sound world Boulez had first created for the central movements of his masterpiece Pli selon Pli, and which he then expanded to a work for 25 instruments. For Sur Incises, which grew by stages through the mid 1990s, the starting point was a solo-piano piece, Incises, while the final work uses trios of pianos, harps and percussionists to create a seductive world of mysterious trills and decaying resonances and sudden outbursts of frantic activity. It’s clear from the sketches for Éclat/Multiples that Boulez intended to extend it beyond the 28-minute version that is played today, and this disc includes an extra four minutes of music never recorded before; there may be yet more to come in the future, but in the meantime these are fine accounts of two of Boulez’s most significant works.One track available onBandcampExplore more on these topicsClassical musicalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

But the present moment – of dangerously disputed truths and lies – is an especially pertinent moment to revisit Miller’s analogy between accusations of witchcraft and McCarthyist terror.This production is faithful to the original 17th-century setting, amid the heat and panic of the Salem witch trials. There is period dress: bonnets for women, pointed hats for men and ribbons for the judges, along with a range of broad British accents for these original American pilgrims. But director Ola Ince brings a quietly radical touch in the form of humour – more absurdist than comic, with accusations of flying girls and demon possession taking on preposterous tones. The men, mostly the judges of the last two acts, appear bumbling, like yokels arguing over the fate of their chattel at a country fair. Deputy Governor Danforth (Gareth Snook) is particularly clownish, though no less awful for it.A few songs by composer Renell Shaw give the town’s girls and women a greater voice in an otherwise dutiful revival which flies in the first half but slows to a trudge by the third act. Maybe because of the laughter, there is also less creepiness to the band of girls who accuse the adults of satanism, and less terror to the court scenes, too. You see the panicked calculation in Tituba (Sarah Merrifield)’s original, forced “confession” but you do not feel her visceral fear. The note of absurdism makes it less terrifying, more ridiculous.View image in fullscreenHeat and panic … Gavin Drea as John Proctor in The Crucible.Photograph: Marc BrennerAbuse, witch-hunts and hangings: why Arthur Miller’s masterpiece The Crucible still haunts usRead moreStill, there is some fine acting from Gavin Drea as John Proctor and Hannah Saxby as his sometime lover, Abigail Williams, who burns with the young, single-minded passion of the spurned. The showdowns in court, with the judges and those between John and Elizabeth Proctor (the a played compellingly by Phoebe Pryce), come weighted with emotion and tragedy. It is also painful to see Mary Warren (Bethany Wooding) as she tries to explain the peer pressure that made her lie in court and be disbelieved by the men around her.Amelia Jane Hankin’sset design has a Quaker bareness, pious and unadorned, with wooden bedsteads and big kitchen tables. There is an almost painterly quality to some scenes with a top window on the stage featuring a tableau of the accused: women standing as still as statues, waiting for their fate to be decided by the men in power.It is a shame the pace slows to such a degree (performed at three hours on press night). Even so, discretely powerful scenes go some way to bringing the tension back, and as the first Miller play to be staged at the Globe it is a powerfully pertinent choice.AtShakespeare’s Globe, London, from 23 May to 12 JulyExplore more on these topicsTheatreArthur MillerShakespeare's GlobereviewsShareReuse this content"

Avocets screech high-pitched cries, defending their eggs from a squawking crow that circles above, while a barnacle goose with a barking call flies overhead.There are 12 of us watching and listening on a dawn chorus workshop at the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust (WWT) Slimbridge centre in Gloucestershire. Being partially sighted, birding has felt out of reach for me. But this morning is about identifying birdsong, and I’m curious as to whether this will help me feel a deeper connection with nature.Slimbridge mapOur guide, Martin, points out the birds he can see and hear. It helps me understand the scene: those silhouettes I see aren’t just miscellaneous birds flying around, but the drama of the avocets swooping together to scare off the crow, the stories taking place in nature. Immediately, I feel a clearer understanding.We wander the wetlands centre, past ponds and down tree-lined paths, regularly pausing to listen. Martin draws our attention to each bird, helping us attune to the unique notes: how a goldfinch’s songtinkles, how areed warblersings continuously in a way that sounds almost mechanical. The chiffchaff’s onomatopoeic call sticks out. When Martin highlights the soft hoot of a woodpigeon, its sound reminds me of warm summer nights, hearing the comforting coo from my garden.View image in fullscreenCaroline Butterwick at the Slimbridge wetlands centreLater, WWT volunteer Dot shows me around the reserve, and she too seems attuned to birdsong. Spurred on by the morning’s session, I ask how to improve my bird listening skills, admitting that I’ve always struggled with identifying wildlife. As we gaze at the Severn estuary from the accessible observation tower, she assures me it takes time, and to practise picking out the ones I now know.As we wander, there is the regular honking of geese, brash and beautiful. Greylags with ungainly goslings trailing behind regularly cross the paths, now busy with families enjoying a warm spring day.Slimbridge was the first ofWWT’s 10 UK sites, and was founded by Peter Scott, son of Antarctic explorer Robert, in 1946. I’m staying in Warblers’ Meadow for the weekend, the site’s recently opened accommodation comprising five shepherd’s huts stationed in a pasture. Our hut, Reed Warbler, has soothing earthy tones, with a comfy double bed, shower room, kitchenette and sofa area, and a wooden deck where I sit in the evenings, listening to the birds.As I listen to birds the rest of the weekend, I realise I’ve started to unpick threads of a tapestry of songThe centre also offers canoe safaris (£10 for an hour), and it feels like exploring a secret space as my husband and I traverse the waterways enclosed by trees, paddling past the occasional bemused duck. We aren’t naturals: we bump into reed banks, and navigate without much grace around other canoes, my husband giving instructions on which way to paddle. It’s relaxing hearing the breeze in the reeds, smelling the damp earth and trees, and feeling the rhythmic tug of water against the paddle.View image in fullscreenCanoe safaris feel like exploring a secret space.Photograph: Ben Langdon Photography/WWTSlimbridge is a good base for exploring the Cotswolds and surrounding countryside, and one evening, we drive to the nearby town of Dursley and enjoy a delicious curry at theEverestNepalese and Indian restaurant. The next day, we head to Uley, where we tuck into a Sunday lunch of mushroom wellington at the 17th-centuryOld Crown Inn.I ask the barman the best way to reachUley Bury, an iron age hillfort, and he points us in the direction of the church opposite, where we follow a narrow path and then upwards through fields and woodland, the verdant swell of countryside around us. We pause on the hillside, and listen. “Those are blackbirds,” my husband says. “And I just heard a woodpigeon,” I add, smiling.This trip reminds me of the sensory joys of the outdoors – of the syrupy scent of wildflowers, the sun on my skin, and hearing a bird and now recognising its songThe ascent isn’t too difficult, my husband pointing out tree roots and loose rocks. Descending is harder for me with a lack of depth perception. At one point, we realise there’s a drop to one side, the path steep and uneven.“I’m going to have to shimmy this bit,” I say as I carefully lower myself and ungracefully, with my hands and feet on the ground, manoeuvre myself down the path until it evens out. It reminds me how my interactions with the outdoors are so influenced by my sight – that I have learned to do things differently. Still, I enjoy our walk with its gentle breeze, the green all around, and, of course, the birdsong.Gentleis the word I find myself using throughout the weekend. Although we do lots, I feel soothed, my anxious mind calmed by being immersed in nature.View image in fullscreenThe goldfinch’s song has a ‘tinkling’ quality.Photograph: Phillip Cull/AlamyI never felt out of place in the dawn chorus workshop. Sound was our shared experience. There were moments when someone pointed to a distant bird I couldn’t see, but I didn’t feel I was missing out. As I listen to birds the rest of the weekend, I realise I’ve started to unpick threads of a tapestry of song – to notice the distinct notes, the cadence and tone of each bird. I still have a lot to learn, but it seems more achievable.As my husband and I sit outside our shepherd’s hut, sipping coffee, we listen. “Is that a chiffchaff?” he says. “I think it is.” “Who’d have thought there would be so much joy in hearing a chiffchaff and knowing that’s what it is.”I can feel cut off from nature as a disabled person. But we all have our own route into nature, our own way of connection. This trip reminds me of the sensory joys of the outdoors – of the syrupy scent of wildflowers, the sun on my skin, and hearing a bird and now recognising its song.Accommodation andactivities provided by WWT.

Customers are very likely to have spotted themillefoglielong before seeing it typed up on the paper menu, though, because it will be sitting near the front door, either on the dessert trolley or zinc bar.Named because the concertina puff of the pastry looks like a thousand (mille) leaves (foglie), La Torricella prepares a millefoglie that is more or less the size of a vinyl LP, its three rings of pastry sandwiched with a mixture of custard and whipped cream, otherwise known as diplomat cream. The layers of preparation make it a special-occasion dessert – in fact, La Torricella makes millefoglie only when a large enough group requests one. The rest of the room, however, then benefits from someone else’s celebration, because the kitchen might as well make two while they’re at it. Or at least I think that’s how it works.Inspired by La Torricella, and also by every millefeuille and cream slice I have ever eaten, I have wanted to include a version of millefoglie in this column since the beginning. Ten years on, however, I am still nowhere near mastering real puff pastry or unsupported pastry cream. A friend suggested I write about a version using rough puff (Jane Grigson’s version) and pastry cream supported by cornflour – a millefoglie with bike stabilisers, if you like. I am not going to lie, however, because making both the pastry and cream still caused me anxiety, which was, I promise, then offset by immense joy.The wonderful thing about millefoglie is that, even if things haven’t gone exactly to plan, and however the pastry, custard and cream come together, it will still taste good. And remember, if all else fails, you can treat the elements like Eton mess. In fact, a mess has its benefits, because cutting a beautiful rectangle can be a nightmare; use a pointy knife to perforate the pastry top like a postage stamp, then try cutting your thousand leaves.Millefoglie(puff pastry and cream sandwich cake)Serves4-6250g plain flour220g very cold butter, diced1 tsp salt2 tsp lemon juice500ml whole milk, warmed1 whole egg plus 3 yolks80g caster sugar65g cornflour150ml double creamIcing sugar, for dustingWash a bowl so it is very cold, then dry. Put the flour in the bowl, add three cubes of the butter and rub together so the mix resembles fine breadcrumbs. Add the salt, then toss through the remaining cubes of butter. Add 125ml iced water and the lemon juice, and bring the dough together into a scraggy mass.Working on a floured board, shape the dough into a 10cm x 20cm rectangle and flour the top. Use a floured rolling pin to roll out the rectangle to double its original size, then fold in both ends so they meet in the middle and fold again over the central divide, so the pastry now looks a bit like a book. Rotate the book and repeat the process, extending, folding in the ends and turning the pastry back into a book. Wrap and chill for an hour.Meanwhile, working in a pan off the heat, beat the whole egg, egg yolks, sugar, cornflour and a few tablespoons of the warmed milk to make a thick paste. Put the pan on a low heat and add the rest of the warmed milk, whisking constantly until the crema is thick. Take off the heat, tip into a bowl and leave to cool. Beat the cream until it’s thick, then chill.Working on a floured surface, roll the dough into a 25cm x 20cm rectangle, then cut it into three even strips. If possible, chill the strips, then arrange them side by side on a baking tray lined with greaseproof paper and prick all over. Bake in a 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 oven for 30 minutes, until golden, then remove and leave to cool completely. Meanwhile, fold the whipped cream into the crema.Put one of the pastry strips on a plate, then spread or pipe a layer of the cream mix on top. Lay a second pastry strip on top, cover with of the cream mix, then top with the last strip of pastry and dust with icing sugar.This article was amended on 22 May 2025 to correct the spelling of Jane Grigson’s surname.Explore more on these topicsBakingA kitchen in RomeFoodItalian food and drinkCakePastryDessertEggsrecipesShareReuse this content"
