The comments came just beforeemergency talks with European leadersin Paris on Monday.The leaders will aim to devise a strategy in response to Donald Trump’s push for a deal with the Russian president and to fears the US will reduce its defence commitments inEurope.Starmer said the crisis was a “once in a generation moment” and an “existential” question forEurope.Writing in the Daily Telegraph, he said the UK was “ready to play a leading role” in Ukraine’s defence and security, including the commitment of £3bn a year until 2030. Starmer said that along with military aid, “it also means being ready and willing to contribute to security guarantees toUkraineby putting our own troops on the ground if necessary”.“I do not say that lightly. I feel very deeply the responsibility that comes with potentially putting British servicemen and women in harm’s way,” Starmer said.“But any role in helping to guarantee Ukraine’s security is helping to guarantee the security of our continent, and the security of this country.“The end of this war, when it comes, cannot merely become a temporary pause before Putin attacks again.”Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022, UK prime ministers have refused to publicly consider sending British soldiers.Military chiefs believe the UK cannot meet its existing military commitments – even before any involvement in any Ukraine peacekeeping force – within the existing defence budget of £64bn which amounts to 2.33% of GDP. But insiders have said Britain is willing to provide troops to a multinational peacekeeping force if that is what emerges from diplomatic efforts.Labour has promised to increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP but has not set a date as to when, while Trump is calling for all European countries to increase it to 5%. Reports suggest British military chiefs are pushing for an increase over time to 2.65%Starmer had previously suggested that British troops could be involved in safeguarding Ukraine after a ceasefire. The UK’s prime minister, who is due to visit Trump in Washington later this month, said: “While European nations must step up in this moment – and we will – US support will remain critical and a US security guarantee is essential for a lasting peace, because only the US can deter Putin from attacking again.”Representatives of the US administration and Russian counterparts are expected to meet in Saudi Arabia for talks followingTrump’s phone conversation with Putinlast Wednesday.But Ukrainian officials are not expected to be at the table at this stage and other European leaders might not be involved in the process at all.Zelenskyy’s week from hell: shock in Ukraine as Trump abandons KyivRead moreStarmer added: “We must be clear that peace cannot come at any cost. Ukraine must be at the table in these negotiations because anything less would accept Putin’s position that Ukraine is not a real nation.”He also warned of a repeat of the chaos after the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan in August 2021 under Joe Biden, which followed a deal struck with the Taliban under Trump.“We cannot have another situation like Afghanistan, where the US negotiated directly with the Taliban and cut out the Afghan government,” Starmer said.“I feel sure that President Trump will want to avoid this too.”Any stepped-up UK military involvement would add to cost pressures, and the heads of the armed forces met Starmer individually on Friday to discuss the state of the military at a time when the army is struggling for numbers and is at its smallest size in over 200 years.A defence source said the chiefs were not seeking to lobby the PM explicitly over defence spending but rather to “build up the PM’s knowledge of the armed forces” as a defence review led by the former Nato chief George Robertson heads towards its conclusion.The service heads believe that despite Treasury concerns over additional spending, it is impossible for the UK to maintain existing political commitments to Nato, the Aukus nuclear submarine programme and next-generation fighter jets within existing budgets.Explore more on these topicsMilitaryKeir StarmerUkraineForeign policyEuropeDonald TrumpVladimir PutinnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s been in modest decline for the last 18 years. There’s an ugly nationalism growing mostly from the intolerant right,” Major said.“At this particular time the big nations – America, China,Russia– are beginning to act unilaterally, where once they would have consulted. And that is a concern, because it does presage the prospect of very great and rather unpleasant changes.”Asked about Trump’s administration, Major called it “a form of presidency I haven’t previously seen”, and he warned against the US president – whoappears to be tryingto reach an end to the Russian invasion of Ukraine by consulting more closely with the Russian president than Europe – avoiding conceding too much to Russia.“Consider what happens if Russia can claim a win,” Major said. “China is going to notice that, and so will the world, and so will every tin-pot dictator around the world. If America is not to stand behind its allies in the way the world has previously seen, then we are moving into a wholly different and, in my view, rather more dangerous world.”Major said he feared the US “may now be turning her back on the international responsibilities she has previously taken, and if she does so there is no other nation state that can replace them, other than China”.He added: “That is not something I think the west would certainly wish to see. And so if that happens, the world, including America, may regret what subsequently follows.”Major was scathing aboutVance’s speechto the Munich Security Conference on Friday, in which he said the erosion of free speech in Europe was more of a threat to the continent than Russia or China.“That is not what we expect from the foremost nation in the free world,” Major said. “It’s certainly not statesmanship, and it potentially gives off a very dangerous signal.“It’s extremely odd to lectureEuropeon the subject of free speech and democracy at the same time as they’re cuddling Mr Putin. In Mr Putin’s Russia, people who disagree with him disappear or die or flee the country, or, at a statistically unlikely level, fall out of high windows somewhere in Moscow.”Asked why he had decided to speak out, Major said: “I rather take the view that former prime ministers by and large should keep out of the way and leave it to the current generation, but sometimes there are things that need to be said that perhaps can’t be said so easily by the present government or by politicians in office that nonetheless need to be said.”Explore more on these topicsJohn MajorDonald TrumpTrump administrationForeign policyUS foreign policyJD VanceRussianewsShareReuse this content"

It ended up with four awards: for best picture, outstanding British film, adapted screenplay and editing.Accepting the second of those, Berger – who swept the board at the awards two years ago with his remake of All Quiet on the Western Front, which won seven prizes – said: “We live in a time of a crisis of democracy. Institutions used to bringing us together are used to pull us apart. Sometimes it’s hard to keep the faith, and that’s why we make movies.”Berger, whose film depicts a battle between liberals and traditionalists that threatens to destroy the Catholic church from within, ended his speech by quoting Leonard Cohen: “There’s a crack in everything, that’s how the light gets in.”View image in fullscreenAdrien Brody accepts the leading actor award for The Brutalist.Photograph: Stuart Wilson/BAFTA/Getty Images for BAFTAThe Brutalist, Brady Corbet’s epic drama about a Hungarian modernist architect working in post-war America, went home with best director, leading actor, cinematography and score.In his speech, starAdrien Brody, who recently appeared on the West End stage in The Fear of 13, thanked the British public for “embracing me and my creative endeavours”, saying “England has felt quite a lot like home lately”.He then went on to thank his partner, designer Georgina Chapman (who is also the ex-wife of Harvey Weinstein), calling her an “angel” and adding: “If it wasn’t for you and for my wonderful parents I wouldn’t be here.”Brody fought off competition from Timothée Chalamet, the star of Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown – which went home empty-handed – and from seven-time Bafta nominee (and one-time winner) Fiennes.‘Karla Sofía I kiss you’: Emilia Pérez director extends Bafta olive branch to absent starRead moreBut there was a surprise in the best actress category, as Anora’s Mikey Madison – who was also beaten by David Jonsson to the rising star award on Sunday – took the prize over frontrunnerDemi Moorefor The Substance and much-loved Hard Truths star Marianne Jean-Baptiste.In Sean Baker’s Palme d’Or winner, which also won best casting, Madison plays an exotic dancer who begins a romance with the son of a Russian oligarch. On the podium she gave a shout-out to the “sex worker community”, saying: “I see you, you deserve respect and human decency. I will always be a friend and an ally and I implore others to do the same.”Meanwhile, Emilia Pérez, Jacques Audiard’s musical about a Mexican cartel leader who transitions while escaping the mob, took two awards (from 11 nominations) despite the ongoing fallout from offensive unearthed social media posts from its star,Karla Sofía Gascón.View image in fullscreenMikey Madison accepts the leading actress award for Anora.Photograph: Stuart Wilson/BAFTA/Getty Images for BAFTAGascónhas taken a vow of media silence since tweets surfaced three weeks ago in which she aired Islamophobic and racist views. She apologised repeatedly, including on a tearful hour-long interview on Spanish TV, but was shunned by many of her colleagues on the film, including her director, who 10 days ago said: “I haven’t spoken to her, and I don’t want to.”Yet Audiard, whose film is up for a record-breaking 13 awards at the Oscars, appeared on Sunday to extend an olive branch toGascónin his acceptance speech for best film not in the English language, dedicating it to the “wonderful artists” from the film who were present in the room, before adding “also you, my dear Karla Sofía, who I kiss”.Accepting the supporting actress award for the film, Zoe Saldaña echoed Audiard, creditingGascónin her speech, before going on to tearfully thank her mother “for being such a selfless person” and her husband: “you are God’s favourite and I hate it – you are so beautiful.”Saldaña has won all the supporting actress awards so far handed out this season and is now considered a lock for the Oscars in a fortnight. Likewise A Real Pain’s Kieran Culkin solidified his status as the inevitable winner of the supporting actor Oscar with a Bafta win for his performance as Jesse Eisenberg’s erratic cousin on a tour of Jewish history in Poland in A Real Pain.Eisenberg picked up the prize on Culkin’s absence – it was, he said, the fifth such award he’d collected for his co-star, “which just confirms my theory that we have a similar life but his is about 27% better than mine”.The Succession star wasn’t present, Eisenberg said, because he wanted to be with a family member who is “quite sick” – an impulse to be with his family no matter what that, continued Eisenberg, had meant Culkin tried to drop out of A Real Pain two weeks before the shoot.“It’s real and it’s beautiful and it’s admirable,” he said. “Kieran is one of these lovely people who’s brilliantly talented but by some random luck of the cosmos has his priorities in order.”View image in fullscreenSaldaña with her award.Photograph: Isabel Infantes/ReutersEisenberg also wrote and directed the film, and appeared to be the person in the room most surprised by his victory in the original screenplay category, saying he didn’t expect to win, nor – apparently – did the person who assigned him his seat in the auditorium.He dedicated the award to his wife, “who didn’t come because she didn’t think I’d win”. Describing himself as an “idiot”, he said his wife, who he met in 2001, had, “dragged me around the world reluctantly” and used “strict Marxist Leninist principles” to teach him that his “grief is unexceptional” compared to the rest of the world.“Anna, you put every worthwhile thought into my head over the last 20 years and I love you so much.”Another double winner wasAardman’s Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl, which beat the likes of Inside Out 2 and The Wild Robot to the animation award, as well as proving a popular winner of the inaugural family film award.Rich Peppiatt converted just one of his six nominations for uproarious semi-fictionalised rap biopicKneecapinto an award, for outstanding debut by a British director. In his speech, Peppiatt said he had met his wife 15 years ago to the day; they moved to Ireland a decade ago and he met the hip-hop trio who became the subject of the film within a week.Kneecap, who hail from west Belfast and whose lyrics mix Irish and English and contain republican rhetoric are, he said “a movement. It’s about how everyone should have their language respected, their culture respected and have their homeland respected. This award is dedicated to everyone out there who’s fighting that fight.”Meanwhile,Super/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story, about the late actor’s career before and after his devastating accident and the impact of it on his children, took best documentary. The film is not nominated for an Oscar, where the frontrunner is No Other Land, about the destruction of Masafer Yatta, made by a Palestinian-Israeli collective.The evening’s most emotional speech was delivered by Warwick Davis, veteran of the Star Wars and Harry Potter films, who received the Bafta fellowship and said it was “probably the best thing that’s happened to me”. He thanked his mother and then paid tribute to his late wife, Sammy, who died almost a year before in what the actor has described as “medical negligence”.His voice cracking, Davis thanked cinema for giving him hope, and “helping me to laugh and to love again”.The ceremony was hosted by returning emcee David Tennant, who landed a few gentle blows on President Donald Trump – some of which were cut by the BBC in their broadcast – and who opened proceedings with a rousing version of I’m Gonna Be (500 Miles), accompanied by Hollywood stars in assorted states of familiarity with The ProclaimersBaftas 2025: the full list of winners – live!Read moreTheBaftasare the final significant film awards ceremony before the Academy Awards in two weeks and many regard them as a last-gasp audition for the Oscars. There is considerable overlap between the 8,000-odd voting members of the British Academy and their 10,000 US counterparts – many of whom wait to complete their ballots, which are due on Tuesday, until they’ve seen how the Baftas unfold.However, although last year’s choices were in almost total lockstep, with Oppenheimer dominating proceedings, the Baftas have become a less reliable Oscars bellwether since they introduced a raft of radical backstage measures in the wake of the #BaftasSoWhite controversy five years ago, when all of the 20 acting nominees were white.Quotas at longlist stage, strict inclusivity criteria for contention in certain categories and a compulsory menu of randomised viewing for each voter has led to a striking diversity among their choices.Explore more on these topicsBaftasAwards and prizesThe BrutalistRalph FiennesConclaveDemi MooreAdrien BrodynewsShareReuse this content"

Will Trump defy them?Read more“He is the most lawless president in US history,” Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor,wrote on Wednesday in the Guardian.“This is bonkers. In our system of government, it’s up to the courts to determine whether the president is using his power ‘legitimately’, not the president.”Trump laid out his position in the tweet posted on Saturday afternoon, aftera round of golfat his Florida resort. The quote, as internet sleuths soon discovered, is a version of a phraseattributed to Napoleon“Celui qui sauve sa patrie ne viole aucune loi,” translated as: “who saves his country violates no law”.Another version appeared in the1970 movie Waterloo, starring Rod Steiger as the dictator who rode roughshod over the French constitution to declare himself emperor and pursue world domination before his comeuppance at the pivotal 1815 battle from which the film’s title is derived.Senior Democrats led the criticism of Trump. The Virginia US senator Tim Kaine, Hillary Clinton’s running mate in the 2016 presidential election that Trump won, told Fox News Sunday that occupation of the White House was not a mandate to ignore the courts.“The president has authority, but the president also has to follow the law,” he said.“There’s this law that, you know, the Empowerment Act, that says once Congress has appropriated dollars for a particular purpose the president is not allowed to say: ‘Yeah, I don’t like that. I’m going to spend this money, but not that money.’“That’s why, so far, there’s a whole lot of lawsuits that have been successful. They’ll go through appeals courts, but a lot of the president’s extreme executive actions that hurt folks are being challenged in court right now.”According to the Associated Press, the administration is facing at least 70 lawsuits nationwide covering actions from the attempted elimination of birthright citizenship to the freezing of federal grants and funds – and the accessing of sensitive computer systems and databy unofficial entities.Trump’s wrecking ball approach since his 20 January inauguration continued this week with deeper infiltration by Elon Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) into federal institutions – and the latest firings of vast numbers of employees.On Sunday, Bloombergreported a wave of new dismissalsat health department agencies including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Other agencies where the workforce has, or will be, slashed include thehomeland security department, theFood and Drug Administration,US Forest Service and National Park Service, the US Agency for International Development (USAid), and the Department of Education.Critics believe that a hollowing out of many essential taxpayer-funded services, especially in healthcare, support for veterans, and military and defense expenditure, will come with alucrative corresponding financial windfallfor private companies, including those owned by Musk.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That is a shutdown unauthorized by Congress, against the law.“My outrage is about who they’re hurting. I don’t like unelected officials, those Doge guys,posting classified information on their website. You shouldn’t let people run rampage through offices that have classified information.”More turmoil came with the administration’s decision to ban Associated Press journalists from the Oval Office and Air Force One for refusing to comply with Trump’s executive order attempting to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the “Gulf of America”.The White House sought to justify the punitive move by insisting that it was “alawful geographic name change”. The AP pointed out that the agency served an international audience, and while it recognized Trump’s order, it would continue referring to the body of water by its globally accepted name.Ina statement, Axios said the right of news organizations to report how they saw fit was “a bedrock of a free press and durable democracy”. Nonetheless, it also said it would use the name Gulf of America because “our audience is mostly US-based compared to other publishers with international audiences”.The Atlantic’s viewwas that it was a spat the AP should have avoided. “To cave now would be to surrender on the constitutional issue. But this is a fight that Trump is clearly happy to have, especially to the extent that it draws attention away from his more egregious affronts to the public interest and the rule of law,” it said.Meanwhile, economic headwinds continue to mount for the fledgling Trump administration as it prepares toimpose new tariffs on trading partnersthat analysts predict will lead to an international trade war and job losses. Inflation rose to 3% in January, according to government figures, despite Trumppromising during election campaigningthat prices “will come down, and they’ll come down fast”.By Thursday, the message had changed. “Prices could go up somewhat short-term,” Trump said as he laid out his tariffs plan, before promising they would go down again at some point.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsElon MusknewsShareReuse this content"

They also claimed Flanagan failed to intervene when one of their daughters was being bullied,the Sunday Times reported.Their alleged behaviour included starting an online fundraising petition to “Remove Kevin Flanagan from his role as headteacher”, and establishing a “FamiliesFightFlanagan” Facebook group and Instagram account, which encouraged online abuse towards him.The couple were also accused of confronting Flanagan and the school’s co-chair of governors outside their individual family homes, and pursuing Flanagan’s partner in a “dangerous and threatening way” while driving, which they denied.Flanagan, 53, took legal action against the couple and a settlement was reached in January, with the Critchleys agreeing to pay him £10,000 in costs and damages, as well as agreeing to multiple restraining and non-harassment orders.“The last near-two years have been a hugely upsetting and traumatic period – not only for myself but my family, colleagues and the broader school community,” said Flanagan.He said legal proceedings were an “option of last resort” and came about after strenuous efforts by the school governors to end the harassment.“I’m pleased we have ultimately been able to bring the matter to a positive conclusion – ending a campaign of appalling behaviour that went well beyond what was reasonable, encouraged others to make vexatious complaints, and ultimately distracted us from the critical task of educating students,” he said.The Critchleys denied harassment and argued their right to freedom of speech over what they genuinely believed was poor treatment of their daughters.Much of the abuse was carried out online, with the social media account attracting individuals with grievances against the school, including previously excluded pupils, who allegedly posted insulting and offensive comments about Flanagan.Comments posted online allegedly made references to Flanagan’s school-age children and his ethnicity.The Critchleys also allegedly encouraged people to make vexatious complaints to Ofsted, Wirral council, the Department for Education and the Teacher Regulation Agency.The education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, recentlytold the Times Education Supplementshe was “concerned about the volume of complaints [against schools] and the degree to which that can take up staff time”. The publication found more than eight in 10 school leaders had had an increase in vexatious complaints.Nick McAleenan, a harassment law specialist at Brabners who represented Flanagan, said: “Teachers are increasingly being subjected to antisocial behaviour at the hands of parents and other individuals,” adding that “discourse and legitimate challenge are an integral part of our society” but teachers should be awarded greater protection to work free from harassment.“It’s my hope that Mr Flanagan’s successful claim acts as a watershed moment in tackling unwarranted disruption of schools and the education of young people,” he said.Explore more on these topicsSchoolsMerseysidenewsShareReuse this content"

That’s why we haven’t seen much in the way of sunshine in most of the UK recently.”Snow fell in parts of East Anglia on Saturday, with 2cm in Norfolk and 1cm in Suffolk.According to the Met Office, parts of the UK may continue to have snowfall throughout Sunday evening and into Monday.The Met Office meteorologist Ellie Glaisyer said: “Over the weekend so far we’ve seen a couple of centimetres in the east.“We could see between 1cm and 3cm in parts of Scotland above 100 metres and the same in the north of the UK [from] Monday into Tuesday. In the highest areas, above 300 metres, Scotland could see up to 20cm.”Explore more on these topicsUK weatherEnglandScotlandWalesNorthern IrelandnewsShareReuse this content"

Not nowSun 16 Feb 2025 12.35 ESTLast modified on Sun 16 Feb 2025 12.51 ESTShareIt has been one of the few political constants in a turbulent period for British politics: an agreement that defence spending really should increase. But in the second era of Donald Trump, what was a consensual background hum has suddenly become an ear-splitting alarm.European Nato members, the UK among them, have long been used to US presidents urging them to spend 2% of GDP at a bare minimum, something only a minority of them manage.Now, with Trumpseemingly more intenton deciding Ukraine’s future with Russia than with European allies, and his defence secretary, Pete Hegseth,warning that“Uncle Sucker” can no longer be fully relied on to defend Europe, this is beginning to look like complacency.The UK currently spends fractionally more than 2.3% of its GDP on defence, well above the Nato average, if some way below America’s 3.3%.More pertinently in a debate that can become bogged down in talk of percentages, British military leaders believe the current annual sum of £64bn is not enough even for current military commitments, let alone mooted new ventures such as involvement in a post-peace multi-nation force to protect Ukraine.Falling UK defence spending chartThe government has committed to increasing defence spending to 2.5%, although ministers have not yet gone past theLabourmanifesto commitment to “set out the path” to this, with no timescale yet given.In contrast, the Conservatives, with the electoral luxury of knowing they were likely to go into opposition, promised to hit this mark by 2030, without much in the way of explanation about how it would be done. This does, nonetheless, put more pressure on ministers.Some reports have sought to present the situation as Keir Starmer trying to persuade a reluctant Rachel Reeves to loosen the purse strings, something dismissed as a nonsense by Downing Street and the Treasury.The official narrative is that it all depends on not just the upcoming cross-government spending review but also the strategic defence review commissioned after the election and headed by George Robertson, the former defence secretary and then Nato head.Nato members' defence spending chartsThere are perfectly good arguments – ones made regularly by ministers – that just chucking more money at defence without a plan for what you want to achieve can be wasteful and counterproductive, but however many reviews you hold, they all lead to the same fiscal impasse.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Under Joe Biden, this was a problem that could wait for something to turn up. Not now.All sorts of back-of-the-envelope answers have been mooted by pundits and observers, including a tax rise sold to the public specifically on the basis of protecting Ukraine, or “Ukraine bonds”, new wartime-style public borrowing.Neither option is beyond the bounds of reality, and other European Nato countries have already considered similar ideas. But for now, UK officials are insistent that nothing will be rushed. Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary who was on government media duty on Sunday, made the point that as well as just money, issues such as domestic defence manufacturing capabilities should be considered.Such caution is arguably part of a wider phenomenon of UK politicians valiantly trying to argue that Trump’s America is the same dependable ally it always was and not the fickle, treaty-shredding transactional force it has suddenly become.The last week has already seen that pretence hit the very solid wall of a new reality. Everything is changing, at speed, and defence spending looks like it may just have to catch up.Explore more on these topicsDefence policyLabouranalysisShareReuse this content"

Two red tartan ribbons, tied on a leafless branch perhaps in private remembrance, flutter in a wintry gust.Eleven of the street’s residents died when the wing section of Pan Am 103 crashed into Sherwood Crescent with the force of a meteorite on 21 December 1988, gouging a 30ft crater on this spot. The impact was such that some bodies were never recovered.This once anonymous street was recreated in meticulous detail for the filming of the Sky Atlantic seriesLockerbie: A Search for Truth, which was first screened last month and stars the Oscar winner Colin Firth as Dr Jim Swire, whose daughter Flora was killed when a bomb exploded on the Pan Am flight from London bound for New York.View image in fullscreenA garden of remembrance is located at Sherwood Crescent, where 11 residents died.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianAlthough the drama has been widely praised, some relatives of the 270 people who lost their lives in what remains the UK’s deadliest terrorist atrocity have questioned the need for such graphic depictions of the immediate aftermath. A spokesperson for the Victims of Pan Am Flight 103 group described it as “tragedy porn” to the Hollywood news site Deadline, while closer to home a Lockerbie resident who lost her sister and brother-in-law wrote in the Annandale Herald: “I don’t need to be reminded about the terrible scene that night.”But for a generation born after 1988, this series may be their first exposure to the tangle of legal proceedings, conspiracy theories and international controversy that has become synonymous with the name of one small town in the south ofScotland.Revealed: Libya aborted plan to hand Gaddafi spy chief to US at last minuteRead moreWith a second dramatisation airing on BBC One and Netflix later this year, a new BBC Scotland documentary, and the trial of the alleged bomb-maker starting in the US in May, Lockerbie is likely to remain in the spotlight this year, willingly or otherwise.“It’s the most normal little town in the world, with a strong community, and people are just living their lives,” says the Rev Frances Henderson, a minister at Lochmaben and Lockerbie Churches. “You don’t see the trauma until suddenly you do. It’s there, being carried and dealt with, a trauma that is part of their lives and has shaped the last decades.”Henderson has not watched the Colin Firth series herself, “not because I object to it but because I feel I’d have to psyche myself up to it,” she says.“I think most people feel it’s been done respectfully but neither have I heard of many watching it because it’s too real. For those who weren’t there, who may be too young to remember, it’s perhaps useful, but not for those who were there.”View image in fullscreenJim Swire, whose daughter Flora, 23, died in the attack, was the subject of the Sky Atlantic series Lockerbie: A Search for Truth.Photograph: Ben Curtis/PAThe series was based on Swire’s investigations into the bombing. He and many supporters have argued consistently for the innocence of Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, the Libyan intelligence officer who was convicted in 2001 at a specially convened Scottish court in the Netherlands of270 counts of murder.Swire believes that Megrahi, who was released on compassionate grounds by the Scottish government in 2009 after a diagnosis of terminal cancer and died in 2011 in Tripoli, was framed to deflect attention from Iranian and Syrian responsibility. This is rejected as a conspiracy theory by US victims’ relatives, who felt the series misrepresented the trial and portrayed Megrahi as “an innocent man that should be empathised with”.Swire and other UK relatives continue to demand a public inquiry into the failure to take seriously or make public warnings that an attack on a Pan Am flight was imminent, while in May another Libyan, 72-year-old Abu Agila Masud, will go on trial in Washington accused of building the bomb that brought down the flight. He denies all charges.Colin Smyth, the Scottish Labour MSP for the region, said: “There has been so much written about the trial and various conspiracy theories, but no one has ever spoken to me about any of that as a constituent.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Those relationships have sustained – you hear of relatives staying at family homes in Lockerbie even now.”Those relationships are woven through the generations, thanks to the enduring scholarship programme between Lockerbie Academy and Syracuse University, New York, which lost 35 students in the disaster.This Saturday Lori Carnochan, the chair of Tundergarth Kirks Trust, took another group of Syracuse students around the church and memorial room to the east of the town, where the plane’s nose cone came to rest.“Visitors have this image in their head of Lockerbie and they’re all so pleasantly surprised – it’s not a sombre place. It’s a thriving, vibrant community, full of positivity and life, a fantastic place to raise a family,” she said.Carnochan is leading plans to create a legacy museum at Tundergarth. “Children and young people need to understand the significance of the worst terrorist attack ever to have happened in the UK and the impact it had not only here in Lockerbie but all over the world, the changes that came about in aviation security and safety because of it.“It’s so important for them to learn about the incredible acts of loving humanity by the people of Lockerbie in the aftermath, like the women who washed and distributed 11,000 items of personal artefacts and clothing back to the families that otherwise would have been destroyed.“It’s a very difficult thing for many in the town to have to live with – it’s widely known many people here have some form of PTSD because of the attack, yet they still open their hearts and homes in the way that they did 36 years ago.”Explore more on these topicsLockerbie plane bombingAbdelbaset al-MegrahiScotlandUK security and counter-terrorismLibyafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Each development comprises self-contained residences as well as community spaces, where activities and most meals are shared.“We’ve got further than any other fully rented cohousing project ever has in Scotland,” said Jenny Rambridge, one of the six members of the Hope Cohousing group in Orkney. “The fact that we’ll be fully rented is vital. Cohousing in Scotland is overwhelmingly owner-occupied, which means people have to sell their family home before buying a cohousing residence. But home ownership is lower in Scotland than England – people rent – so vulnerable people often don’t have a home to sell.“The six of us, for example, currently live in houses that are mostly rented but are socially isolated or too expensive to heat or that, as we age, are difficult for us to get in and out of, or move around inside,” she said. “We just want to live in age-appropriate homes where we can be independent and private but share a community and rely on the friendship of our neighbours.”Cohousing is increasingly popular in England, where there are 31 communities, 65 projects in development and more than 1,000 people signed up to receive advice through the National Cohousing Register.But it is much rarer in Scotland. Groups have been trying to set up schemes for 20 years but most fail because of challenges in securing land and funding, and a lack of established regulations and support systems.View image in fullscreenThe group persuaded Orkney Islands council to give it the land for six terrace houses, for which it then received building permission.Photograph: Grigor Mitchell ArchitectsTom Morton, the convener of Cohousing Scotland, said the Hope project had come so far that “if we can’t achieve Hope then I don’t know what other group will ever succeed”.Morton has spent two decades supporting different groups to create cohousing communities. “We’ve had members who have died waiting for their cohousing project to get the green light and we’ve had others who moved to England because there are viable cohousing options there,” he said.“There’s strong demand but after years of fighting, people get disheartened, grow old and have to move on, either by staying in houses that severely compromise their quality of life or by moving into houses that don’t meet their needs but are the only options available.”Morton, however, has put his hope in Hope Cohousing, which persuaded Robert Gordon University’s school of architecture in Aberdeen to work for free to develop designs, secured feasibility funding from the Scottish government and, crucially, persuaded the Orkney Islands council to give it the land for six terrace houses, for which it then received building permission.“It’s not surprising that most community-led housing projects in Scotland fail,” Rambridge said. “The total cost of the preconstruction phase alone was around £150,000 but there is no clear funding framework: we’ve had to fight for every penny.”But now the group has hit a brick wall: Orkney Islands council says there is no money to bridge a £300,000 funding gap. “We have previously supported this project but there is no delivery vehicle within the council that would support the build and transfer of management for a cohousing development at this time,” said Frances Troup, the council’s head of service for community learning, leisure and housing.Sacha Wright, a project coordinator for Hope Cohousing, criticised what she said was the short-term nature of these funding decisions. “Council and government budgets are very myopic: they only look at housing or at health, but poor social connections are the equivalent of smoking 15 cigarettes a day,” she said.“On top of that, we all know we’ve got an ageing population and a housing emergency but we’re still only looking at the emergency elements of those things,” she said. “Cohousing communities are high-quality, high-impact projects but agencies don’t have the ability to think broadly around these issues.”Rambridge is confident, however, that a way through will be found. “We haven’t come this far for it not to happen,” she said. “And when we succeed, we will share our learning with every other group fighting to create a cohousing community in Scotland. Cohousing in Scotland will become a feasible option for anyone who wants it. We’re determined of that.”The Scottish housing minister, Paul McLennan, said: “The Scottish government supports cohousing. I am aware of the Hope Cohousing project and the group is continuing to engage with my officials.”Explore more on these topicsHousingScotlandCommunitiesLocal governmentfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Conclave wins best filmEveryone expected Edward Berger’s classy thriller to win outstanding British film; in a slightly mediocre year for that prize, it was the clear frontrunner. But few tipped it for the best picture award.The Brutalistseemed to have too much chewy critical adoration; A Complete Unknown is well-loved, especially amongst the boomer demographic which still makes up a considerable portion of the Bafta votership; Anora (see below) was the dark horse emerging into the limelight. But Conclave? Isn’t it a bit … middlebrow? A bit too … enjoyable? And wasn’t that mic-drop ending slightly polarising?Apparently not. What might have propelled it over the finish line other than home advantage? Might the late whiff of controversy have benefited it, with Vatican bigwigs – and US evangelists – suggesting it was the work of Satan? In a year when films need a few hot headlines to be really successful (see The Brutalist) but not too many (see Emilia Pérez) that smattering might have given it much-needed edge. Does it have a real shot at the Oscar? Perhaps one needs to look to theBaftastwo years ago, when Berger’s previous film, All Quiet on the Western Front, won seven awards (picture, director, foreign language, cinematography, adapted screenplay, score and sound). At the Oscars, that went down to – a still very respectable – four (international, cinematography, production design and score).Snub! Ralph Fiennes loses best actorView image in fullscreenFiennes arrives.Photograph: Dave Hogan/Hogan Media/REX/ShutterstockIf Conclave can win best picture and outstanding British film – what’s wrong with the man who is in nearly every scene? Ralph Fiennes’s troubled Cardinal Lawrence is the beating heart of Conclave, its moral centre and the one whose troubled puffing also provided much of the soundtrack. Yet it’s also a performance light on heavy emoting and big stricken speechifying. Might that have cost Fiennes his gong? (It’s worth noting, perhaps, that Timothée Chalamet’s much-admired turn as Bob Dylan has a striking scarcity of Big Acting clips ripe for ceremony airing.) But you do have to feel slightly sorry for Fiennes – it’s been nearly 30 years since his last and only Bafta win, a supporting nod for Schindler’s List, and this marks his sixth defeat.Surprise! Mikey Madison wins best actressView image in fullscreenMikey Madison with her leading actress award.Photograph: Isabel Infantes/ReutersShe might not have managed to secure the rising star award, which is voted for by the public, but Mikey Madison scored a huge coup by taking the best actress prize. Demi Moore’s comeback narrative for The Substance had been assumed to be powerful enough to woo even Bafta voters – and those unmoved might well be expected to go for Marianne Jean-Baptiste, cruelly overlooked at even the Oscar nominations stage but toweringly brilliant in Mike Leigh’s Hard Truths. To celebrate either of those actors would have made a lot of sense, but the 8,000-odd voters instead went for a 25-year-old who plays a sex worker – quite an eyebrow raiser, given that even after their massive voters’ overhaul, Bafta membership still skews fairly old and conservative.Yet Sean Baker’s Palme d’Or winner has accrued considerable momentum over the past week or so, with best picture wins at both the directors and producers’ guild awards in the US – both of which have many active Academy Award voters. Anecdotal reports increasingly suggest that while many people in the industry deeply admire The Brutalist, lots of them really loveAnora. Might that push it over the edge on 2 March? Expect a flurry of fresh bets.Surprise! Christopher Reevetriumphs over No Man’s LandView image in fullscreenThe team behind Super/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story.Photograph: Dave Hogan/Hogan Media/REX/ShutterstockFor the past two years, the Baftas have established an impeccable track record when it comes to celebrating excellent documentaries that engage with chewy issues ripped from the headlines. Last year they chose the devastating Ukrainian war film 20 Days in Mariupol; the previous year it was a study of the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. This year No Other Land was right there: a critically adored look at West Bank devastation by a Palestinian-Israeli collective. And Bafta went for amediocre film about the children of Christopher Reeve. Honorable in itself, of course, and not a film without considerable heft and upset, but a slight chance of direction none the less.Surprise! Emilia Pérez actually wins some awardsView image in fullscreenZoe Saldaña with her Bafta.Photograph: David Fisher/Rex/ShutterstockJacques Audiard’s stitched-together mob musical drama has had the awards season from hell, one that its team wouldn’t like to just forget but to have the faintest memory of surgically removed from their skulls. Right when all hope seemed utterly lost, salvation came in the form of the surprisingly munificent Bafta voters.Emilia Pérez may have only won two awards from 11 nominations, but many would have expected fewer: its win for best film not in the English language, ahead of a strong field including the much admired Kneecap and Oscar best picture nominee I’m Still Here felt genuinely unlikely.And Zoe Saldaña’s victory for supporting actress suggests that she might be untainted by the general toxicity around her film. But will Oscar voters be quite so generous?Snub! The BBC trims the hottest speechesView image in fullscreenHair-raising … David Tennant arrives.Photograph: Ben Perry/REX/ShutterstockA risk-averse BBC tried to head off any issues by dropping potentially tricky quotes – though it’s all relative, as none would have hardly torn the roof off. David Tennant got in a few fairly tame jabs at Donald Trump, including a line about summoning him by saying his name three times – but in the edit only one of his gags survived: “Talking of villains …” And the BBC also deleted a significant news story: Emilia Pérez director Jacques Audiard’s peacemaking “kiss” to his errant star Karla Sofía Gascón, who as the world knows blew up most of the film’s award chances after some loathsome past social media activity was discovered. It might be a bit much to cry censorship, but definitely adds to the impression that all the BBC want is a bland, drama-free two hours of Sunday night TV.Highlight! Three doses of Jesse EisenbergView image in fullscreenJesse Eisenberg accepts the original screenplay award for A Real Pain.Photograph: Stuart Wilson/BAFTA/Getty Images for BAFTAIn so far as the Baftas act as an advert for a movie as much as an audition for the Oscars, A Real Pain must surely be seeing a bit of an uptick – thanks to Jesse Eisenberg’s three brilliantly winning appearances. He manages to be somehow funny and also sincere in all of them – as well as vastly faster than most of the people on the podium. In the first (winning original screenplay) he calls himself a loser and fanboys his wife. In the second (picking up Kieran Culkin’s prize) he is sweet about a person and cutting about the industry all at once. And in the third – presenting animated film – he and co-star Will Sharpe manage to find a category-appropriate riff to joke on that is, remarkably, both funny and plugs their film. For fans of those performances, A Real Pain won’t disappoint.Snub! A Complete Unknown goes home empty-handedView image in fullscreenChalamet on the red carpet.Photograph: Andy Rain/EPAIn a field that for much of awards season has lacked a true frontrunner, some have wondered if A Complete Unknown might do a Coda, and triumph through sheer crowdpleasing charm. That theory had a major hole blown in it at the Baftas, where none of its six nominations resulted in awards wins. If the likes of best film always looked a stretch, there was genuine hopefulness about Chalamet’s best actor chances, particularly given the minor controversy around the use of AI in his awards season rival Adrien Brody’s Brutalist performance. But that clearly wasn’t enough to dissuade Bafta voters from coronating Brody. Instead all A Complete Unknown’s star received were a handful of tired jokes from host David Tennant about Timothée Chalamet lookalike contests.Surprise! Wallace & Gromit beats Inside Out 2View image in fullscreenRichard Beek, Nick Park and Merlin Crossingham, plus plasticine friends, at the Baftas.Photograph: Dave Hogan/Hogan Media/REX/ShutterstockOf all this year’s contenders, the one likely to have been seen by the most people who watched the ceremony on BBC One was the one also on BBC One a month and a half ago: Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl. It scooping both best animation (a competitive field, with Pixar’s box office behemoth Inside Out 2, plus critical favourites Flow and The Wild Robot) and the inaugural family film prize was none the less a big win not just for Aardman but also the Beeb, and Netflix, with whom it shares producing and broadcast rights. Nick Park’s bumbling acceptance speeches, despite having done this for almost 40 years now, adds to the on-brand appeal.Explore more on these topicsBaftasAwards and prizesConclaveRalph FiennesAnoraThe BrutalistShareReuse this content"

Mikey Madison broke ahead of a densely packed crowd of best-actress contenders (in which only the hapless Karla Sofía Gascón was really lagging behind) to win the Bafta for her wonderfully smart, funny, charismatic and vulnerable performance inSean Baker’s Anora, playing a New York table dancer who gets a Vegas wedding to a Russian oligarch’s son. Her final closeup scene in that film is a thrilling masterclass in complexity. I admit that I myself had been rooting for Marianne Jean-Baptiste for her performance in Mike Leigh’s Hard Truths, but who could possibly begrudge Madison her night of triumph?Otherwise, the night’s big winner was Edward Berger’s superbly classy and sleek Vatican conspiracy dramaConclave, based on the Robert Harris bestseller; it was level pegging in terms of numbers with The Brutalist, but carried off the evening’s top prize. Conclave is the movie whose blue-chip excellence all round made it a firm favourite with Bafta voters, who were thrilled by Ralph Fiennes’s lead performance as the troubled cardinal; they were diverted by its visual flourishes, amused by its intelligent but approachable dialogue on religious issues and vastly entertained by its twist ending. Strict anti-spoiler rules dictate that we can’t fully discuss how this film in fact is part of a contemporary debate exhaustively analysed elsewhere.Baftas 2025: Conclave beats The Brutalist to best picture as Mikey Madison scoops best actressRead moreThe Brutalist can count itself as the almost-joint winner; I was delighted to see Brady Corbet get best director for this mysterious and monumental drama, which also got best cinematography, and a best actor Bafta for Adrien Brody’s angular, arresting, gauntly passionate lead performance. It’s a Randian parable of a Hungarian Holocaust survivor and architect, played by Brody, who makes his name in the postwar US courtesy of a highly strung and vindictive sponsor, played by Guy Pearce, who sets out to create and then destroy the talent that he has nurtured. (And incidentally, there hasn’t been a bigger onscreen promotion for Ayn Rand since the scene in TV’s Mad Men when eccentric ad mogul Bert Cooper tells Don Draper that he really ought to read Atlas Shrugged.)It’s heartening to see so much Bafta love go to a comedy (although it had to be a comedy on a deeply serious issue) andA Real Pain– the story of two New York Jewish cousins going on a Holocaust tour of Poland – is a joy, getting best original screenplay for Jesse Eisenberg’s sparkling script and best supporting actor for Kieran Culkin’s hyperactive, hilarious and unexpectedly subtle performance. It’s a masterclass in intimately detailed and very funny drama.There is no Bafta for worst PR campaign but there’s no doubt who would have won. The hilariously embarrassing mess over the old tweets ofEmilia Pérezstar Gascón, in which she unveiled gruesomely bigoted thoughts about Hitler, George Floyd, Islam and indeed diversity at the Oscars – that last being the very issue which Netflix was hoping to clinch an Oscar for Gascón – was of course a farrago which, as I cautiously predicted, did not utterly destroy the film’s chances overall, and it won best non-English-language film and best supporting actress for the estimable Zoe Saldaña, for whom awards season has clearly been an awful trial. (And it’s something to ponder that before social media, Gascón would have just said or even silently thought these fatuously offensive things without them being preserved for ever in an archive of shame.)Baftas 2025 red carpet: sequins, satin and a ski mask – in picturesRead moreIn truth,Emilia Pérezis a middling and overpraised film and one of the weakest of this year’s awards season favourites. However, it is an interesting example of that kind of movie about which there is not a critical disagreement, but a kind of two-way optical illusion, like the white-and-gold dress/blue-and-black dress phenomenon in the 2015 viral photo. To some, Emilia Pérez looks like a grotesquely conceited tone-deaf mess for which mockery is a righteous punching-up duty. To others, it’s a gloriously bonkers extravagant melodrama whose very implausibility is a part of its defiant energy and reach. (Much the same thing happened with Lars von Trier’s bizarre Björk tragedy-musical Dancer in the Dark a generation ago.)Conversely, the most heartening underdog victory at theBaftashas to be the remarkable success of Kneecap, the fictionalised true story of the Irish-language hip-hop band which got outstanding British debut, the entry-level Bafta which is the heart and soul of the evening, and the award which probably means most to the recipient. I was not entirely enthusiastic about the film but its sheer energy and infectious self-belief has been a joy to see, and it’s great to think that Kneecap have provided the soundtrack to this year’s Bafta night.Explore more on these topicsBaftasAwards and prizesEmilia PérezConclaveThe BrutalistA Real PaincommentShareReuse this content"

This one is entitled Escaping Utopia, a three-part documentary series on Gloriavale, a secretive sect founded in 1969 by preacher Neville Cooper, after he was vouchsafed at the age of 22 a vision of heaven on Earth by God. This vision involved establishing an isolated community in a remote part ofNew Zealandthat would be run along wholly egalitarian lines, and men would live in absolute parity to women to secure their place in feminist heaven.I jest, of course. Gloriavale ran – and, in reduced form, still runs – on the principles of women’s absolute subservience to men, men’s absolute subservience to the leaders above them (the dozen or so “shepherds”), and the shepherds’ absolute allegiance to Cooper (who renamed himself Hopeful Christian) – until he died in 2018 and was replaced by shepherd Howard Temple. No conversation is allowed between young people of different sexes after puberty. Women, who must wear uniform dresses and expose no skin but for the hands and face lest they inflame men’s uncontrollable lusts, are married off as young as possible – generally to the men Cooper/Christian deemed most suitable – and expected to devote themselves to having as many babies as possible. Everyone lives under the threat of eternal damnation. You get the picture, I’m sure.Allotting three hours to such a documentary is often a sign of a padded narrative forthcoming, but Escaping Utopia has almost too much material to be covered even by that generous span. It follows members – including some offspring of Hopeful himself – who have broken free and been exiled from all remaining family and friends. Many are now part of a semi-underground network that helps others to flee the Gloriavale compound. It visits the Indian outpost of the community that Hopeful set up after authorities started taking an interest in his original venture, probably to give himself a refuge if and when it became necessary. There we see a group of frightened-looking, near-silent women with multiple children, overseen by a leader who, unprompted, tells the visitors that rape is part of the culture and that women’s lives are always harder than men’s.The series also covers the landmark 2023 employment case brought by former female members of the community. They argued that their relentless work as cooks and laundresses in a place they felt they couldn’t leave made them employees, if not virtually enslaved people, rather than volunteers. And above all, it tracks the investigations into endemic sexual abuse that were first sparked by journalist Melanie Reid back in the mid-90s. “I was always,” says former member Elijah Overcomer quietly, “glad that I wasn’t a girl.” Claims, charges and convictions have proliferated since Reid brought the cult to public attention – though the last, as ever, not quite commensurately with the first two.The escapers who have time to regroup and gain perspective on their nightmarish childhoods, during which Hopeful made sure they knew what sex entailed by making them watch their parents in the marital bed – just one form of the abuse they were subjected to – talk frankly about the truths they can now see. Pilgrim, one of Hopeful’s sons, describes his father’s growing power (especially as the community became increasingly composed of people who had been born there and knew no other way of life) and the terrible freedom it gave him to exercise his perversions.Sirius: An Apocalyptic Order review – the disturbing details pile up in this French cult exposéRead moreMore than most documentaries on the subject, Escaping Utopia concentrates on the psychological aspects of the members’ experiences and sufferings. Rosanna Overcomer remembers being paralysed with fear whenever her laundry partner was late for work, in case this was the moment that all the deserving had been taken up to heaven and Rosanna had been found unworthy and left behind on Earth and would face eternal torture in the afterlife. Sharon Ready, who has been with the community for more than 50 years since she joined, age 11 (though she is now being shunned for her growing doubts), is visibly stricken as she struggles to reconcile her enduring love of Christ with the sexual abuse she has suffered and the “slow coercion … a little bit here, a little bit there” that meant “you actually lost your identity … and felt like you were doing it willingly”.It is an unusually detailed study of multiple aspects of cult formation and survival, examined with endless compassion for the victims and pitiless scrutiny of the perpetrators of the crimes carried out in Christ’s name. If the Rapture ever comes, I hope he damns the right ones.Escaping Utopia aired on BBC Two and is on iPlayer now in the UK, and on ABC iview in Australia.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionReligionNew ZealandreviewsShareReuse this content"

It now has an estimated 150 million users.One of those users, since 2012, was Odunayo, a software ­engineer and developer from London. Six years ago, she sat down to ­create what she imagined might be a companion app to Goodreads.After building a demo for a few friends, she quickly realised it was more likely to be a competitor, ­offering readers’ tracking tools and trends – using AI – that could help recommend their next book. And as of this week,The StoryGraphhas 3.8 million active users, many of whom have ditched Goodreads.In a blogpost entitled “Leaving Goodreads in 2025!” just before Christmas, a blogger and reviewer going by the name Books With Bunny wrote: “I don’t love that Goodreads is owned by Amazon. There’s so much about the company that I don’t agree with … Goodreads feels outdated. Its interface looks clunky, and the features are limited … I’ve found Goodreads’ recommendations underwhelming and heavily skewed toward popular titles.”I think people love the different types of data we give. We just have a lot of really cool features, and the buddy read-alongs. But I think the number one thing is that it’s just not owned by Amazon’Nadia OdunayoBunny announced she would be using The StoryGraph going forward: “I’ve been loving it so far! Not only is it woman-owned, but it also offers so many fantastic features.”A Goodreads spokesperson said on Saturday that in 2024 it “welcomed millions of readers and we saw strong year-over-year growth in book tracking with our community adding hundreds of millions of books to their want to read, currently reading, and read shelves”.Odunayo, 33, said: “I think people love the different types of data we give. We just have a lot of really cool features, and the buddy read-alongs.“But I think the number one thing, if people are comparing us with Goodreads, is that a lot of ­people do go: ‘It’s just not owned by Amazon.’”Goodreads has struggled with a perception that there can be malicious reviewing and even personal attacks on authors from users. In 2023, debut author-to-be Cait Corrain wasdropped by her publisher, Del Rey, and her planned publication was scrapped after she admitted creating fake Goodreads accounts to boost the ratings on her own work and attack other debut authors with books due out at the same time as hers.In the wake of the Corrain incident, Goodreads released a statement saying that while it welcomed both positive and negative reviews, it “prohibits reviews that are not ­relevant to the book, harass readers or authors, or attempt to artificially deflate or inflate the overall rating of the book”.It added: “We continue to invest in improvements to quickly detect and moderate content and accounts that violate our reviews or ­community guidelines.”The StoryGraph has tried to head off such problems by not allowing private messaging or comments on reviews. Odunayo said she wanted to avoid a situation “where anyone can just comment on your review and you’ve got to deal with being scared to put reviews up there”.Odunayo never had ambitions to work in tech when she was younger. She studied philosophy, politics and economics at the University of Oxford and had an offer to work for Deutsche Bank.But after winning a competition for a place on a coding course for women – “just a nice skill to have in my back pocket” – the tech industry became her home.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Even going to Oxford, there weren’t many people around that looked like me,” she said. “So I know not everyone like me has that experience.”The StoryGraph, despite its ­climbing user numbers, is still run by Odunayo, who puts videos on Instagram and social media, talking about the app and her own reading, and answers direct messages personally.‘It’s totally unhinged’: is the book world turning against Goodreads?Read moreBut given the rate of growth, can that continue? And what if Amazon comes calling with a briefcase full of cash to buy out its Goodreads competitor?“That’s not something we’re interested in,” says Odunayo. “We had zero investment in The StoryGraph. It’s a completely bootstrapped ­company. Anything can happen in life, obviously, but right now we’re happy and we’re enjoying it. We see The StoryGraph as our life’s work.“I don’t think there’s a limit to how big we can get and ­maintain what we’re doing now. I just want more people to know about us. I want us to be the most popular book app in the world.”For Odunayo, the reason she started all this in the first place – the books – is more important than ever. “I remember a friend ­posting on social media that he’d had a busy year and only managed to read 45 books,” she said. “And I was ­thinking: ‘Wait a minute – I’m ­single, I don’t have any kids, the company I was running at the time was a 9am until 6pm situation, and I’ve only read 13 books this year.’“So I set myself a target of 30 or so books a year. It’s funny, because people always say to me: ‘Your ­reading must have plummeted since you set up The StoryGraph, being a one-woman development team’ – but it’s shot up.”In fact, Oduyano now reads 70 or 80 books a year, split between nonfiction and novels. Her current read isThe Ministry of Timeby Kaliane Bradley. “I was exposed to so many more books through interacting with readers that I was like: ‘Oh, I need to read this; I want to read that.’ But I’m now the CEO of a company that’s a reading tracking app. So reading is now part of my whole identity.”Explore more on these topicsBooksThe ObserverAmazonInternetPublishingAppsnewsShareReuse this content"

It has very good performances and witty visual ideas, but the dramatic shape and emotional focus could have been tightened and sharpened. Yet this is a smart film which pays its audience the compliment of assuming they are intelligent enough to work things out on their own in a drama of sexual tension and dangerously polite encounters, something like Jacques Deray’s The Swimming Pool or Paul Schrader’s The Comfort of Strangers.Riley plays Tom, a tennis coach at a middling hotel resort in Fuerteventura in the Canary Islands. He has been here for almost a decade, increasingly unhappy with his aimless, pointless life of no worries, no responsibilities, spending nights just boozing, doing drugs and having endless one-night stands with women. Tragically, he is nicknamed “Ace” because he once got to play briefly on the hotel court with Rafael Nadal and gossip has embellished that anecdote into a (fictional) glorious victory over the tennis legend in front of hundreds of onlookers. But Tom is now descending into alcoholism, always waking up hungover in his car, or on the beach, or by the pool with no memory of the night before.He finds himself strangely interested in a British couple, Anne (Stacy Martin) and Dave (Jack Farthing), who are rather more stylish and sophisticated than the hotel’s usual package-crowd clientele, and persuade him to give private lessons to their charming young son Anton (Dylan Torrell). He agrees to show them round the island, and they take him out to dinner, where Anne explains she is a failed TV actor whose brief appearances explain why people think they know her. Then it’s back to their room for drinks – and things lead to something dramatic and unnerving.This is a drama with a twist in its tale, but Gerster clearly doesn’t want to spring the surprise on you in any obvious way, or after conventionally ingenious narrative misdirections. The penny is allowed to drop very slowly and almost imperceptibly, yet once the audience have grasped the point, they may be waiting for someone or something to make it explicit – or in the absence of that, just make clear the emotional effect that the awful truth is having. I’m not sure we get that in what is a reasonably long movie but it’s refreshing for a film-maker to opt for subtlety, and there are good performances from Riley, Martin and Farthing.Islands screened at theBerlin film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersSam RileyTennisGermanyEuropeBerlin film festivalreviewsShareReuse this content"

Otto Silbermann never makes it out of the country but – maddeningly – loops round and round, stuck in the trap of rising Nazi terror and afraid of every passenger he meets. He carries a suitcase of money, the last vestige of power he has in a homeland that has turned against Jews.The Passenger is based on Ulrich Alexander Boschwitz’s novel, which was written at blazing speed when Boschwitz, himself a German Jew, was just 23. His manuscript was discovered decades after his death in 1942, at the age of 27.It is an immensely chilling story, all the more daring for being written in an absurdist vein, but it is not refined or dread-filled enough in its enactment here. The production, adapted by Nadya Menuhin and directed by Tim Supple, is given a symbolic, stripped-down staging. We follow Otto (Robert Neumark Jones) as accompanying actors (Ben Fox, Kelly Price, Eric MacLennan and Dan Milne) juggle multiple parts including those of his business employee, his “Aryan” wife and his Nazi brother-in-law, as well as others he encounters in his journeys.View image in fullscreenEric MacLennan (Theo Findler), Kelly Price (Ursula Elfriede) and Robert Neumark Jones (Otto Silbermann) in The Passenger.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianA key element of the story is the threatening whirl of passengers and guards around Otto. So actors come and go out of the auditorium almost constantly. This does not play to the strengths of the theatre’s limited space, and the atmosphere is variously busy or cramped rather than escalating in darkness or claustrophobic intensity.Among the passengers is a scared German Jewish cabinet maker; an SA member who wants to play chess with Otto; and a woman who flirts with him but does not offer anything more concrete. Others absolve themselves of responsibility for his dispossessed and endangered place in Germany – from Belgian border guards to police officers and old associates.There is a square arrangement of chairs around the stage that represents train carriages, but it is blockish, limiting the space around it for actors to navigate. Smatters of clumsy exposition come with the opening scenes and some performances are too blunt or shouty. There are a few powerful scenes and the production has a brooding, black-and-white quality, but as a whole it is not noirish enough despite the shadows, haze and fedora-clad figures.Terror never really collects, although there is certainly a sense of Otto’s rising frustration at the senselessness of his changed status from citizen to state pariah. The production captures the dizzying circuitousness of his journey but not the fear, tension, panic and depths of rage that this story deserves.AtFinborough theatre, London, until 15 MarchExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreFinborough theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

But one debilitating condition, experienced by 80% of women, remains shrouded in secrecy and misunderstandingPolly HudsonSun 16 Feb 2025 09.00 ESTShareWhen Lorraine Kelly shared her experience of menopause on her daytime TV show in 2017, she was her own last resort. Initially, she set out to interview a famous woman about her story, but everyone she approached refused.“I thought, nobody else will talk about it so I’ll do it. It was a breakthrough moment,”said Kelly.Seven years later, it often feels as though we have reached peak menopause.Michelle Obama, Salma Hayek and Gwyneth Paltrow have all been open about their experiences, encouraging women not to feel ashamed about a biological process an estimated13 million peoplein the UK are now going through. And yet there’s still one part of it that is barely spoken about.Vaginal dryness.As with so much in this realm, it took a celebrity – Davina McCall in this case – to shine a light on it. For those of us who’d assumed this symptom was a minor inconvenience, which only affected sex and was easily remedied with the kinds of lubrication readily available from high street chemists, it was a brutal wake-up call.“I had severe dryness, so severe that when I tried to wipe myself after going to the loo, it was so sore I was having to kind of dab,” McCall said in her 2021 documentary, Sex, Myths and theMenopause. “I didn’t know what it was, I had no idea that it was part of being perimenopausal.”View image in fullscreen‘I thought, nobody else will talk about it so I’ll do it,’ said Lorraine Kelly in 2017.Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The ObserverPreviously known as vulvovaginal atrophy, now rebranded as genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM), vaginal dryness will probably affectbetween 60%and80% of women, according to various studies. It is caused by the drop in oestrogen levels, which happens as women go through menopause, causing vaginal tissue to become thinner and less elastic. Despite it being so common, one study has found that athird of female sufferers did not report it to their doctor.This is partly because of embarrassment, says Haitham Hamoda, consultant gynaecologist and clinical lead of the menopause service at King’s College Hospital. “Most GPs are well informed and offer a great service, but of course, there are variations of what you can access. Part of it is going to be what is available to you, what is offered to you, and what you feel comfortable talking about.”He continues: “You’d be surprised how many people would come and see you because they’re talking about flushes and sweats and brain fog. And when you say, ‘Do you have vaginal dryness?’ they will say, ‘Oh, yes, it’s really uncomfortable’. But they never really think about bringing it up, unless you specifically ask.”Hamoda has seen women who are too sore to wear underwear. “You do find people who say clothes are uncomfortable because it’s touching against the area … In extreme cases they find it uncomfortable sitting or walking.”When you ask, ‘Do you have vaginal dryness?’ they reply, ‘Yes, it’s really uncomfortable’. But they never bring it upGP and menopause expert Dr Renée Hoenderkamp has had cases like this too. “I’ve seen women who can’t go about their daily life because of vaginal dryness. It’s absolutely debilitating. They can’t go to the gym any more, can’t wear jeans, can’t go for a bike ride, can’t run up the stairs at the station. It’s all just too painful.”Clare, 55, says GSM “consumed my whole life”. “I used to sit in a shallow, cold bath, sobbing. It was agony, the burning never let up for one second of the day or night. Even walking was painful.” It began when she was 47, but she never considered her symptoms could have anything to do with being perimenopausal because her periods were regular, and she was not having hot flushes.But, as Hoenderkamp points out, every menopause is different: “For some women, vaginal dryness will be their first symptom, very early, even before their periods have changed. Other women won’t get it until they’ve gone through it all. It’s really individual.”She also believes that seeing dryness as just a symptom of menopause can be misleading. “Women who breastfeed for more than six months will suppress their oestrogen to a level where they may get vaginal dryness. The pill can cause it. Antidepressants. It’s not just restricted to menopausal women.”The implications of vaginal dryness can go far beyond pain, says Hoenderkamp. “Once past menopause, when all of the tissue in and around the vagina and urethra dries and atrophies, women become much more susceptible to urine infections because bacteria are able to attach to the tissue.”Hamoda has also seen women avoiding or missing cervical screening due to GSM. “Sometimes you can’t open the speculum because they’re so dry and uncomfortable, even though, of course, you’re using plenty of lubrication.” In some cases, he has told patients to “take vaginal oestrogen for the next two months, then come back and we’ll attempt this smear again. Sadly, this is not an uncommon scenario.”View image in fullscreen‘I had no idea that it was part of being perimenopausal,’ said Davina McCall in 2021.Photograph: ITV/Harry Page/ShutterstockNot every doctor is aware of how to help women with GSM. Emily, 44, sought medical advice as soon as her vaginal dryness began four years ago. “It felt like there was a red hot poker inside of me,” she says. She also suffered from urinary tract infections. Her GP found it so hard to reach a diagnosis that at one point he told her – on the phone – that she might simply have to prepare herself for a life of chronic pain.As she was 40 when her symptoms began, her doctor didn’t consider perimenopause. She was passed between different NHS services, given courses of antibiotics, a cystoscopy, referrals to urology, gynaecology and physiotherapy. She also paid to see a private vulval pain specialist. As all this was going on, no painkillers could make any difference, and she remained in agony.“It’s been catastrophic,” she says. “The pain makes it very difficult to concentrate. I’ve had to give up four jobs in the space of four years. I’ve had to sell my house and move away from my friends because I need to have more savings in case I can’t carry on working. It’s had a massive effect on my mental health.”Whereas other menopausal symptoms get less severe then stop, GSM becomes progressively worse and is difficult to reverseOut of desperation, Emily began to research her symptoms herself. She found out thatone in 20 womengo through perimenopause before they’re 45, and, presuming this was what was happening to her, Emily wrote a detailed letter to her GP, asking for vaginal oestrogen. He agreed to put her on a low dose. “And within two days the burning stopped.”She is still, however, struggling with her UTI symptoms – which include needing to pee around four times an hour. While it’s impossible to know what has caused this, she believes that because her infection was not treated for so long it has got worse. She is now being treated separately for her persistent UTI.Misdiagnosis is a common thread through this condition. Dr Paula Briggs, a consultant in sexual and reproductive health at Liverpool Women’s NHS Foundation Trust, reports, “It depends who the patient presents to, how likely they are to get the right diagnosis. Loads of women will be told they’ve got thrush.”It’s a perfect storm – women reluctant to seek medical help in the first place, then a delay in being diagnosed.“Whereas other menopausal symptoms resolve – generally they get less severe, then they stop – GSM becomes progressively worse over time and is very difficult to reverse,” says Briggs. She now thinks all women should be given vaginal oestrogen at around the age of 45 as a default.However, as oestrogen pessaries fall under the HRT umbrella, some women remain nervous due to the small increased risk of breast cancer linked to progestogen-containing forms of HRT. Hoenderkamp says that vaginal oestrogen does not carry the same risk. “It is just about as safe as houses, and very easy. I often have women who say I can’t have vaginal oestrogen because I’ve had breast cancer. Well, you can.”Hamoda is more cautious: “Generally speaking, with breast cancer patients you would try other non-hormonal options first. But on an individual basis.”However, it is not a problem that will disappear overnight. “In terms of the oestrogen, women are not going to do it for a year and then it will all be OK. It’s probably a lifelong commitment to their vagina,” says Hoenderkamp.Vaginal oestrogen is available from chemists – although it’s cheaper on prescription from your GP – and there are also moisturisers and lubricants women can buy over the counter as a possible first port of call.The message overall is clear, though. If you are uncomfortably dry, you should never suffer in silence – it’s not just a part of ageing that happens to everyone, which you have to grin and bear – it’s something that can be treated and, in most cases, eased.“Awareness is key,” says Hamoda. So, while there has never been so much talk about menopause as there is now, there’s still a lot that needs to be said.Some names have been changedExplore more on these topicsMenopauseSexual healthHealthSexMedicineWomenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It wittily fuses the real and the fictional into a trance-state – and that’s the state that I’ve sometimes found a little static in previous films by Lucile Hadzihalilovic, but not here. Dreamily strange it might be (and in fact, on the face of it, entirely preposterous) this movie had me gripped with its two outstanding lead performances – fromMarion Cotillardand newcomer Clara Pacini – and a clamorous musical score.Cotillard plays a diva-ish movie actress called Cristina, who is the lead in a new adaptation of Hans Christian Andersen’s The Snow Queen being filmed on a soundstage which is in a remote and snowy spot in late 60s France; she is gorgeously costumed in a sparkling white form-fitting gown and crown, a look she carries off with great unsmiling hauteur. Pacini plays Jeanne, a teenage girl in a foster home nearby, stricken with memories of the death of her mother, whose bead necklace she keeps. In her loneliness and grief, Jeanne has projected her feelings into an obsession with the story of the Snow Queen, an obsession further displaced at another remove into idolising the teen girls who ice-skate at the local rink. One day she runs away, stealing the ID of an older girl called Bianca and breaks into the film studio to sleep overnight; she somehow gets a job as an extra, astonished to realise what story is being filmed, and it is here that her gamine prettiness and air of demurely sensitive adoration for the queen catches Cristina’s eye.Cristina’s somewhat louche director Dino, played by cameo by Hadzihalilovic’s partner Gaspar Noé, is in the habit of telling likely young actresses that he might cast them in his next project, a Hitchcockian thriller. In fact, there is something Hitchcockian in this shoot, with an attack carried out by a bird, and in Cristina’s own cold, cruel detachment from the victim’s suffering. Hadzihalilovic might intend us to notice in one shot a movie poster for The Red Shoes, but the Powell/Pressburger film that this more resembles is surely Black Narcissus with its female desire and delirium in the bitter mountain cold.Cristina and Jeanne become very close in a dangerous way, although the younger woman is always subject to Cristina’s whim and caprices, the starry mannerisms which Cristina has learned to enforce her own status and mask her vulnerability. There is a great shot of Jeanne’s awestruck gaze as she turns the pages of a glossy-magazine profile of Cristina. She learns, along with the audience, that they have much in common: Cristina herself was once in a foster home, and appears to have been guided and protected in her early years by a male confidant, Max (August Diehl), who calls himself her friend and doctor. Has Max been prescribing certain medications for Cristina?Sequences in the film let us drift onto the set of The Snow Queen, as if in a dream; it is a production design which fabricates the ice-realm in all its seductive artificiality, with the ice tower in one shot is juxtaposed with Cristina’s own statuesque poise. We can feel what Jeanne woozily feels: that she has miraculously found herself in the ice realm with the ice queen herself. But what does Cristina want of Jeanne – and what can she want of Cristina? It is a mesmeric melodrama, mixing sensuality with a teetering anxiety, balancing on a cliff-edge of disaster.The Ice Tower screened at theBerlin film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsMarion CotillardBerlin film festivalFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Devious, nimble little beasts that have occupied my head for the best part of 30 years. A cerebral itch, impossible to scratch. They wield their own special power over my brain, shaping the architecture and rhythm of my thoughts. An immovable nest, weighing heavy in my skull. I know these creatures well, but they know me better. I am their dutiful puppet, stuck inside an endless loop of sleepless nights and watchful days.They answer to another name, this nest of scorpions, the writhing black mass that lives inside my head: obsessive-compulsive disorder.OCD is a mental illness that affects about 2% of the global population, but the proportion of people touched by it is far higher. A condition that causes obsessive, unwanted thoughts and repetitive behaviour known as compulsions, it is often described as a “silent” illness, carrying with it a lot of shame, stigma and misconception. It is common, and relatively easy, for sufferers to disguise or hide it due to the internal nature of the intrusive thoughts and the embarrassment brought about by irrational or unusual compulsions.As a society, we often classify certain mental health disorders as less acute than others; OCD is one of them. It is still trivialised by the media, and many people falsely believe that it can be filed under a personality type characterised by traits or quirks such as liking things to be clean or being concerned with order. There is a plethora of novelty merchandise available, branding their owner as “a little bit OCD”. I have a coffee mug that I received as a Christmas present many years ago in my own kitchen cupboard that has the words “obsessive compulsive” emblazoned across it in bright pink letters. It is hard to imagine a line of gift items with anorexia or PTSD boldly stamped upon them for all to see. So why is OCD continually used as a shorthand for lighthearted craziness, or categorised as one of the more comic disorders of the mind?ProfileTuppence MiddletonShowTuppence Middleton won plaudits recently for her portrayal of Elizabeth Taylor in Jack Thorne’s playThe Motive and the Cue, which was directed by Sam Mendes at the National Theatre and subsequently in the West End. On television, she has appeared inBlack Mirrorand played the wicked Hélène Kuragina in the BBC adaptation ofWar and Peace. Film roles, after her breakthrough inThe Imitation Game, have included Lucy Smith in bothDownton Abbeymovies and Sara Mankiewicz in David Fincher’sMank. Born and raised in Somerset, she was named Tuppence after the childhood nickname her grandmother gave to her mother.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The truth is that this condition can devastate people’s lives, leading to job loss, relationship breakdown and total isolation, as well as, in more severe cases, suicide. Diagnosis is often reached much later than it should be for numerous reasons, be that social, cultural or familial. From my own experience I know that it was a condition my family and I had heard very little about when I was growing up, let alone felt able to seek help for. Thankfully, the conversation around mental health has opened up a lot since I was a child, but to me it feels as though OCD is still relatively misunderstood, under-researched and has fewer treatment options than other mental health conditions such as anxiety or depression.View image in fullscreenTuppence Middleton alongside Laura Carmichael in Downton Abbey.Photograph: Entertainment Pictures/AlamyFor almost as long as I can remember I have struggled with obsessive thoughts, checking compulsions, and an extreme fear of vomiting, manifesting and evolving in different ways at each stage of my life. This took root when I was 11 and had to stay off school for months with chronic fatigue syndrome. It started with my favourite number, 16, which as all children are aware can be divided into eights, fours and twos – all even, rounded numbers. But it was the eights that interested me most, and I started to see them everywhere. The fingers on a pair of hands fascinated me, while the thumbs faded into soft focus. My eyes would seek out a constellation of eight small freckles on a stranger’s arm. Each time the world around me filled me with fear, I heard the encouraging hum of the scorpions telling me to count. This silent counting kept the swelling panic at bay. At first it was the corners of rooms, the edges of mirrors, the frames of doorways.One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.Each corner had its own dedicated count. All eight numbers were given their due weight and time before I moved on to the next “unclean” corner, waiting to be baptised by my routine. The looming threat of corners and edges soon became bigger: pillows, curtains, TV screens, textbooks, light switches, pieces of toast.Everything needed to be organised and contained by the number eight. My blood would bubble and a feeling like a wave rising in a tsunami would build inside my chest, only to be stopped by the incessant counting.Dark thoughts threatened to punish me for any noncompliance…If you don’t finish the count, your parents will die.If you don’t finish the count, the house will burn down.If you don’t finish the count, you will be sick.Sticking to my silent counting rituals in order to quell the panic that surged in my chest, I managed to carry on with life in an outwardly normal fashion until the night my mother discovered me on the landing, midway through one of my self-imposed routines. She took me to visit our family doctor, the first of many visits throughout the blur of my secondary school years. Therapy was naturally one of the first suggestions made by Dr G, but the idea of it scared me, making me feel like I had failed at the simple task of being normal. Later, he suggested antidepressants. I exchanged a look of barely concealed terror with my mother, before reassuring him: “I’m not depressed, I just can’t stop doing these routines. I don’t want to take any tablets.”View image in fullscreenA young Tuppence Middleton shortly before she became ill with chronic fatigue syndrome.Photograph: Courtesy of Tuppence MiddletonDr G was a quintessential, doctorly mix of utter kindness and cold, hard realism as he told me: “It’s actually very common that antidepressants are prescribed for your condition: they alter the way different parts of the brain communicate with each other, and the way in which obsessive compulsive disorder interrupts these processes.”Obsessive-compulsive disorder. It felt strange to hear it said aloud so flippantly. Until then we had largely referred to it as my “routine”. The words seemed to reverberate around the room, bouncing off each of the corners I was doing my very best not to count. On the short journey home, my mother and I agreed that it was the right decision to refuse the tablets. Medication was meant only for the severely mentally ill, the desperately unhappy or hardcore drug addicts – and I was coping just fine, we concurred. Everyone has their little quirks… Mental health was almost never talked about in our house – or any other house that we knew of, for that matter.As I crept towards the end of my school days, I managed the condition relatively well, but because OCD thrives in solitude, intimate friendships were something of a minefield. Group gatherings, sleepovers, school trips were all things that I resolutely avoided. I still observe large friendship groups like a detached cat watching a swarm of bees.When I left home for drama school in London, where I had opted to share a house with three young men during my first year, I had hoped the move might rid me of my compulsive rituals for good. I had hoped that it was habit born of a time and place that I had now left behind. However, the routines travelled with me.The routines developed. They became longer and more complex, which often made me late leaving the house. Late attendance to our course was tolerated on a “three strikes and you’re out” basis, so there was a particularly all-consuming kind of pressure that accompanied my ritualistic checking in the first year of training.My routines or compulsions centre (and have always centred) on two main points of focus: home environment and illness/death. A typical thought/behaviour cycle I experienced often went something like this:I’m standing in the middle of my kitchen and am already 10 minutes late. But if I perform the routine one more time, then this feeling of impending doom might just go away long enough for me to get out the front door. I hold my hand palm-up beneath the tap, staring at the empty space where running water would usually flow. It’s definitely off. Can I feel the water? NO. Can I see it? NO. Can I hear it?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I open my eyes again and everything remains the same, not least my belief that somehow the tap is still running at full flow into the sink. I look. I count. I’ve lost track of the minutes I’ve been standing here.I move to the cooker. The gas is off. I know it’s off. But gas is invisible, so how do I know it isn’t slowly leaking into every room of my house and I won’t die of suffocation in my sleep later tonight?In the midst of these thought cycles I might send a quick message to my agent/friend/family member to say I am running late. Transport issues, I’d say. Now I would have to start my routine again. I look at the various enemies occupying my kitchen: door, tap, cooker, fridge, light switch.I’d promise myself this was the last time. After all, I’d still have more rooms to check before I could leave.One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.The counting happens almost without thought or intention now. It is so ingrained, so practised, that I can perform it in a kind of standby mode.After drama school it became obvious that three years is not long enough to learn how to become an actor. You spend your entire career learning, as you spend your entire life learning how to become a human being. Each year of my training I learned new skills, new processes, but I also learned how to pretend beyond the confines of acting. To pretend I was calm or composed. That there wasn’t a nest of scorpions living inside my brain. It is an exhausting way to function, to constantly hide a part of yourself that is so intrinsic and unappealing. I have no doubt that I am a better pretender than I am an actor, so adept at moving through life undetected that I can almost convince myself that the scorpions are not there.But they are there. Meddling, goading, rewarding.I decided it was time to attempt to kill them. The year after drama school I tried an NHS-prescribed course of cognitive behavioural therapy, during which I ticked all the right boxes and agreed dutifully, when asked if the sessions were helping, giving the performance of my life as a young woman who was overcoming her compulsive behaviour and disordered way of thinking. I couldn’t bear to disappoint my enthusiastic young therapist by telling her the simple truth. That I was scared of what it might require of me to make myself better, and that I didn’t feel that this kind of logic-driven, behaviour-focused approach was the right fit for me. And so, after a block of eight arduous sessions, I was discharged from her care and my GP was informed that the treatment had been successful. Case closed. Or so they thought.The next attempt came three years later, when my anxiety increased substantially and the physical effects of that began to take their toll on my body. I was living alone at the time and finding it impossible to get any sleep due to the panic attacks I was experiencing on a semi-regular basis. However, I have always been one of those frustrating people who waits until the headache is almost blinding them before they take a painkiller. So, I waited until the physical effect of anxiety – the rapid heartbeat, the breathlessness, the chest pain, the stomach cramps, the insomnia – became unbearable, and decided to return to the solution that had been offered to me by Dr G as a teenager.As I sat in the chair and my therapist listened and shared and suggested, I realised that I had for most of my life underestimated the power of talkingInitially I was prescribed a strong anti-anxiety medication, diazepam. Then I began taking an antidepressant called fluoxetine, commonly known as Prozac. When it eventually kicked in, as Dr G had predicted, I felt calmer, more in control, less enslaved by the scorpions. I could sleep through the night and my panic attacks stopped completely. I felt stabilised for the first time in a long while.Although my physical symptoms had improved, I was still aware of a hum of activity continuing inside my head. Just because I couldn’t see or feel the effects of the scorpions, it didn’t mean they weren’t still there, chipping away at my neural pathways, weaving new and complex thoughts into the bedrock of my brain. So after a blissful two years of feeling something close to normal on the outside, I decided to take advantage of this momentum and put everything into attacking my little monsters from the inside too with psychotherapy.View image in fullscreenIn British thriller Trap for Cinderella (2013).As I sat in the chair and my therapist listened and shared and suggested, I realised that I had for most of my life underestimated the power of talking. As this slow and steady process began to blunt the pincers and neutralise the stings, my therapist suggested making steps towards coming off my medication. I felt daunted by the idea of saying goodbye to my crutch and fending for myself again. Would the panic attacks come back? Would talking about my scorpions really be enough to keep them at bay?Within six months I had stopped taking the drugs, which I attribute to continuing therapy at my own pace while slowly lowering my dosage. The scorpions were still there, but my mind was no longer a cramped and festering mass, rather an open passageway for the scorpions to pass through. Sometimes there are more than others, sometimes I don’t feel them for weeks on end, and sometimes there is a blockage – a lone scorpion stuck in the outer reaches of my mind, leading all the others to the same place until the pressure builds and I must find my own ways to set them free.In Hindu tradition scorpion bites are known to have been treated by the recitation of mantras. There is a special mantra that consists of counting from 100 back to one, then repeating the whole count 108 times. Allegedly, this mantra is said to work solely on Holi or Diwali festival days, or during solar or lunar eclipses. Only an obsessive can appreciate how satisfying this kind of specificity can be…My rituals and routines function in much the same way as these mantras. Through counting or checking or touching, I soothe the anxious energy in my body and calm the negative thoughts until that thrumming swarm is reduced to a distant scuttle. When the rituals don’t satisfy my obsessions, then I take photographs – of taps, of cookers, of other dangers – to assure myself. When I can’t assure myself, I look to others to reassure me. When I can’t be reassured, I wash my hands, I avoid people, I don’t leave the house, I invent a new routine, a new bargain, a new unpleasant thought. And when the nest overwhelms me again, I return to my role as therapee.Treatment is an ever-evolving process, as different for each person as it has been for me at every stage of my life with OCD. Each avenue has provided me with a new way of approaching those days when everything feels stuck. A sense of relief that there is help out there, however the scorpions choose to surprise me. It is just a matter of asking for it.This is an edited extract fromScorpions: A Memoirby Tuppence Middleton, published by Rider, an imprint of Ebury Publishing (£18.99).To support theGuardianandObserverorder your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

I switched those off – and every other alert – and it helped my wellbeing, sleep and parentingChloë HamiltonSun 16 Feb 2025 06.00 ESTShareMy phone vibrates itself awake, disturbing my baby, who has only just dropped off after an hour of my shushing in the hazy, sepia-toned dark of the early hours. It’s aWhatsAppmessage from a mum friend. Another buzz signals another message. And then another one. Everyone is up. Everyone – and every baby – is sleepless. Everyone is typing.My own baby cries as I turn over in bed to soothe him, flicking open my messages to catch up on the gossip as I do so. One mum is asking about the right Calpol dosage for a teething nine-month-old, while another wants to know what time we’re meeting tomorrow. Someone else has forwarded a syrupy-sweet Instagram reel about motherhood and the power of women, and her friend has replied with a supportive: “We can do this, mamas!” But I don’t feel powerful and, right now, I really can’t do this. It’s 3.07am. I’m tired, overwhelmed and, thanks to the glaring blue light of my phone and the adrenaline galloping through my body, wide awake.It’s in this moment that I make my change, swiping my finger down from the top right-hand corner of my phone to bring up its control centre; thumbing, wildly, at the little crescent moon icon that stops notifications in their tracks; and hanging up my virtual door sign: Do Not Disturb.View image in fullscreen‘The net gain is positive’ … Chloë with her partner, Stuart, and their two sons, Fabian (left) and Inigo.Photograph: Chloë HamiltonThat was three years ago, and I’ve only flipped the door sign back around on a few occasions: when waiting for callbacks from doctors, for example, or if I’ve pre-arranged a phone call with a contact. Instead, in the main, my notifications remain firmly, resolutely, off. I do not want to be disturbed; nor, actually, do I want my phone to demand as much of my attention as my now toddler or his new baby brother do. Sure, I’m probably a nightmare to get hold of at a moment’s notice – and should never,everbe someone’s In Case of Emergency, much to my partner’s chagrin – but I’m immeasurably calmer now I’m not perpetually available to the world and his WhatsApp-mad wife.I’ve still had to work on my self-discipline, so that I don’t spend all my time checking my phone to see what I’ve missed. This is, arguably, the hardest part – the lure of a potential unread message can be profound – but I remain convinced the net gain to my wellbeing, my sleep and my parenting is positive. My phone is still a big part of my life but it doesn’t intrude on my living as much as it once did.I think – I hope – my change has made me a better, more present mother. There are, after all, few things that seek quite as much attention as toddlers and WhatsApp groups. If I had to choose, I’d rather give that attention to the three-year-old trying to climb the curtains/put the dog in the washing machine/feed his baby brother a stick of chalk, than a phone that fizzes and bleats with alerts that masquerade as urgent but, really, are anything but.Explore more on these topicsHealth & wellbeingThe one change that workedMobile phonesParents and parentingWhatsAppfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Just next game’Maddison scores winner to ease pressure on PostecoglouEd Aaronsat Tottenham Hotspur StadiumSun 16 Feb 2025 15.28 ESTLast modified on Sun 16 Feb 2025 18.02 ESTShareRuben Amorim has insisted that he will “stick with my beliefs” after watching his injury-hit Manchester United side endure a12th Premier League defeatof the campaign that leaves them 15th in the table.A first-half goal from James Maddison, who celebrated by putting his finger to his lips in response to criticism he received last week from Roy Keane, sealed Tottenham’s first win at home in the Premier League since they beat Aston Villa here in November. On his return from injury, Guglielmo Vicario produced a brilliant save to deny an Alejandro Garnacho shot in the second half.It meant that United have now lost the most times after 25 games since they were relegated in 1974, with only 12 points separating them from the bottom three. But while Amorim refused to criticise his side’s efforts after Kobbie Mainoo, Manuel Ugarte and Amad Diallo were all ruled out with injury, he acknowledged that results must improve quickly.Tottenham 1-0 Manchester United: Premier League – as it happenedRead more“You grow and you learn a lot of things. We just need to face it and not run away, that is my feeling,” the United manager said.“Today will hurt, it is a tough pain to lose so many games, but then you can change things in a week. I have a lot of problems, my job is so, so hard here. But I stick with my beliefs. We need to stop focusing on the big picture. Just focus on the next game. Let’s do everything to finish the season well and then think about the big picture. That is our goal. In this moment it’s about not even looking at the table or the schedule. That is my part.”The defender Victor Lindelöf was the only substitute on United’s bench who had made a first‑team appearance and Amorim admitted losing three key players had not been ideal preparation. “At the beginning of this week we tried to train but day by day we were losing players. I don’t want to use that as an excuse because a lot of teams are suffering like that. Sometimes you have to face up to the challenge.”More than 1,000 Spurs supporters gathered before kick-off in a protest against the chairman, Daniel Levy, that was organised by the Change for Tottenham action group. But while some remained after the full-time whistle to take part in a planned sit‑in protest, the numbers were significantly reduced.“I thought the fans were great and they got behind the team. They contributed to us getting the result we needed,” saidAnge Postecoglou, whose side have now moved up to 12th.“It’s unacceptable that we are in the position that we are but the circumstances have dictated that. Today was an important game if we are going to start that process of improving. We certainly feel that we have an opportunity to climb up the table.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

People will have their opinions. No one is more critical of me than myself. The gaffer prefers when we are in our own bubble, but it’s difficult with social media, you see this stuff.“To be fair to the boys who’ve been fit all season, we don’t want to make excuses, but the last few months have been really difficult.

Konaté could have increased their problems when, having been booked for dragging back Matheus Cunha, he collided late with the Wolves playmaker shortly before the interval. The referee, Simon Hooper, ignored Wolves’ appeals for a second yellow and thus a red card. “I cannot change anything now but in my opinion it was a second yellow card,” Vítor Pereira, the head coach, said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I saw him getting his first yellow – that for me was a soft yellow. If he got his second one for a shoulder push that would have again been a soft yellow so he would have been sent off for two soft yellows. I think the referee felt the same and that’s why he didn’t [book him again].“But I’ve watched football so many times in my life and I know that a player and the referee is then under pressure. So the next foul will lead to a referee thinking that maybe he should give it. It is so difficult to play 45 minutes against a strong Wolves team so I had to take Ibou off because you can’t play football knowing in your head you can’t make a foul against such good players as Wolves have.”Cunha’s strike set up an anxious finale for Liverpool yet Slot praised the mentality of his team, particularly after events at Goodison Park on Wednesday. “I don’t think the nerves were too much, it had more to do with how Wolves came out [in the second half]. We showed immense mentality on Wednesday in the most difficult circumstances we faced this season. Then today at 2-0 up we think we have made it 3-0, but it was the correct decision to disallow it for offside, then we thought we had a penalty and again it was the correct decision to overturn it, and then they scored. Mentally that is not easy.“For the first time this season, it looked like we were thinking: ‘Oh.’ That’s why these wins are probably more important than when you outplay Tottenham like we did heretwo weeks ago for 4-0. We need to show the same mentality this week [at Aston Villa and Manchester City] but play better on the ball.”Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolArne SlotWolverhampton WanderersnewsShareReuse this content"

The generally optimistic mood, though, is somewhat at odds with the gloomy feel across much of the rest of the club amid the latest reportsof a further 200 job losses.Five-star Arsenal hammer Tottenham in WSL derby as Chloe Kelly makes returnRead moreOn the pitch this team have put smiles on faces. Enjoying a pastry before the lunchtime kick‑off, Martyn, who goes to around 10 men’s games a season at Old Trafford but enjoys bringing his six‑year-old daughter to WSL games at Leigh, joked before kick‑off: “It’s nice to come to a United game where I can look forward to winning, for a change.”His confidence was not misplaced, as the Norway striker Elisabeth Terland slotted in low to give Marc Skinner’s side the lead. Crystal Palace, bottom of the table, did manage to level before half‑time through Mille Gejl on the counterattack – Manchester United conceded to a team in the WSL’s bottom half for the first time this season – but Terland rolled in her second for the dominant hosts after the Sweden international My Cato inadvertently knocked the ball into her path. The England midfielder Grace Clinton headed in the hosts’ third late on, from a free‑kick whipped in by an in-form Ella Toone.Despite the good results on the pitch, there was still a lingering feeling of frustration among some United supporters, summed up by home fan Aimee, who had travelled up from Wales to see this game. “These girls are amazing. Just imagine how good they could be with a bit more support from Jim.”View image in fullscreenSir Jim Ratcliffe at Old Trafford in January 2025.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAIt would be unfair to say the dislike of Ratcliffe is universal: many fans were keen to point out “he’s better than the Glazers”. Yet there is frustration at some of Ratcliffe’s comments in interviews that suggested the women’s side is not his priority. Andy Slater, editor of the Manchester United women’s team fanzine Barmy Article’, who is sad about the job cuts changing the “family feel” of the club, said: “It’s just baffling, the things he comes out with. It’s more about attitudes.“Even without putting Chelsea levels of money into it, it [the women’s side] doesn’t take a whole lot to let it run itself – give the women’s side the tools to do what it needs to do, and let it run. Since the winter break, we’ve really turned things around [in the WSL] and now we’re playing this way, if we can keep it going, it’s a really exciting team to follow.”Another fan who has followed the women’s side since it was re-formed in 2018 is presenter and content creator Mina Ibrahim, who said she has seen pros and cons. “The most important thing is, the women were backed sufficiently in last summer’s transfer window to bring in talent, like a proven goalscorer. That was needed.“I’ve also been disappointed with the public comments made. He’s kind of suggested multiple times that the women’s team is not on the forefront, and it would be nice for fans and players to feel like they’re standing side-by-side with the ownership and being supported publicly as well as privately.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Shekiera Martínez opened the scoring for the hosts from close range in the 11th minute, but Nikita Parris quickly hit back for Brighton, sweeping home Rachel McLauchlan's low cross.Rehanne Skinner's side emerged stronger after the restart and Riko Ueki restored their lead after 64 minutes, with Viviane Asseyi scoring a penalty four minutes later after being brought down by McLauchlan as West Ham climbed to eighth.Leicestereased to a 3-0 win over Aston Villa to leapfrog their opponents, who slip back down to 11th in the table.

Ratcliffe is yet to attend any women’s matches at Leigh Sports Village – something that even Michael Owen managed to do earlier this season as a fan – although the chief executive, Omar Berrada, and other senior club figures have done so.There was an attendance of 4,761 for this game, many hundreds of whom were determined to stay outside the players’ entrance for well over an hour after full time in the hope of a selfie. Maybe one day, Ratcliffe will be among them.Explore more on these topicsManchester United WomenCrystal Palace WomenWomen's Super LeagueWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We extend our appreciation to the multidisciplinary teams who provided the best of medical care to Michael, both on the racecourse and in hospital.“Michael’s family took the decision to donate his organs at this incredibly difficult time, but in doing so made a choice that will make a real difference to the lives of other patients and their families.“I have had the privilege of knowing Michael through his amateur and professional career and his dedication, modesty and kind nature always made him a pleasure to be around. Michael’s success and his humility will have inspired many and I share the feeling of loss today with all those who knew him.”O’Sullivan, who was Ireland’s champion under-21 point-to-point rider in 2019, turned professional in September 2022. Only six months later, he realised one of the ultimate dreams for any jump jockey – never mind one still riding out their claim – as he took the Supreme Novices’ Hurdle, the first race of the 2023 Cheltenham festival, on Barry Connell’s Marine Nationale.View image in fullscreenMichael O’Sullivan won the Supreme Novices’ Hurdle at Cheltenham with Marine Nationale in 2023.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe jockey had already notched his first win at the highest level aboard Marine Nationale in the Royal Bond Novice Hurdle three months earlier, having initially called Connell to ask for the ride when Marine Nationale was entered for his first start in a “bumper” – a flat race for jumps-bred horses – at Punchestown in May 2022.“We quickly decided Michael’s talent was very special and he got the job riding full-time for us,” Connell said on Sunday. “Things happened very quickly after that … a matter of weeks after he turned pro, he rode a grade two winner for us as a claimer and then rode Marine Nationale in the Royal Bond and gave him a wonderful ride.“He had a great partnership with the horse which culminated in the Supreme Novice and it was fairytale stuff for both myself and Michael on a journey together with the horse. Despite being a claimer and having limited experience of Cheltenham, he gave the horse a masterful ride. The icing on the cake was he got a spare ride later in the day [on Gordon Elliott’s Jazzy Matty in the Boodles Juvenile Handicap Hurdle] and had a double.”O’Sullivan’s two wins on the day meant he had the honour of wearing the armband of the meeting’s leading rider in the first race the following afternoon. Although his association with Connell’s stable came to an end in November 2024, he had subsequently been riding for both Elliott and Willie Mullins, Ireland’s most successful trainers, in a freelance role.View image in fullscreenMichael O’Sullivan and owner/trainer Barry Connell (right) celebrated Marine Nationale’s win at Cheltenham in 2023.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian“It’s a terrible tragedy for racing and today is about remembering Michael,” Elliott said on Sunday. “We had some great moments on track together, including when winning at the Cheltenham festival in 2023. We send our deepest condolences to Michael’s family, friends and colleagues.”Simon Harris, Ireland’s tánaiste (deputy prime minister), also paid tribute to O’Sullivan in a post on X. “Such sad news this morning,” Harris said. “I know people across our country are thinking of the family of Michael O’Sullivan this morning and of the wider racing family. An incredible talent taken so young. Keeping his family in my prayers at this extraordinarily painful time for them all.”O’Sullivan’s family, from County Cork, is steeped in racing and point-to-pointing. His father, William, rode Lovely Citizen, trained by his brother, Eugene, to victory in the Foxhunter Chase at Cheltenham in March 1991, while Eugene’s daughter, Maxine, won the same race aboard her father’s It Came To Pass in 2020.“We are deeply saddened by the tragic loss of our colleague, Michael,” Andrew Coonan, the secretary of the Irish Jockeys Association, said on Sunday. “Our heartfelt sympathies go out to his father, William, his mother, Bernadette, his brother, Alan and girlfriend, Charlotte. Jockeys face the risks of race-riding every day, but it is only when a tragedy like this befalls us that those full risks are truly realised.“Michael was not only a highly talented rider but also a great friend and colleague to many in the weigh room. We are all the richer for having known him, even though his time with us was far too short.”Quick GuideGreg Wood's Monday racing tipsShowCarlisle1.20 My Lady Elektra 1.50 Butch 2.20 Malicash 2.50 Geryville 3.20 Joltin N Jiving 3.55 Mavis Pike 4.30 Tommy Combats (nb) 5.05 BroughshaneSouthwell1.35 Illogical Logic 2.05 Kayce Dutton 2.35 Nazare 3.05 Wolf Moon 3.40 Born In The West 4.15 Asa 4.45 GotthereintheendWolverhampton4.25 King’s Code 5.00 Overnight Oats 5.30 Bryant 6.00 Blinky (nap) 6.30 Marioento 7.00 Nordic Glory 7.30 Due Date 8.00 Angel Of England 8.30 Brian The SnailWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Explore more on these topicsHorse racingIrelandnewsShareReuse this content"

But these days the story of the Burgess brothers is being told back home in England – and the latest intriguing chapter began in the slightly murkier surroundings of Huddersfield.Sam, George, Tom and Luke made history in 2013 when they all played in the same Souths side in the National Rugby League, together, they all achieved success in Australia, albeit to varying degrees. But never before have the brothers squared off against one another, a situation Sam and Tom encountered for the first time onSuper League’s opening weekend.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Sam has long since settled back into life away from the Sydney limelight, in his second season asWarringtonWolves’ head coach. Tom will have a similar experience, albeit slightly closer to their Dewsbury roots just down the road in Huddersfield after joining the Giants on a three‑year deal following the curtain coming down on his own career with Souths last year.But while they will enjoy a similar lifestyle away from the bright lights and scrutiny that comes with everyday life in Australia and the NRL, they will almost certainly have different experiences ofSuper Leaguein 2025. For the brothers Burgess are at two clubs on very different journeys.View image in fullscreenWarrington Wolves head coach Sam Burgess will be expected to capture some silverware this season.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PAAfter a number of shock resultsduring the opening weekend of the new season, the final game of the round went the way most expected, with Sam’s Warrington winning 20-12 against Tom’s Huddersfield despite a sterling effort from a Giants side many are tipping to be near the bottom this year. At 32, Tom is no longer the fresh-faced youngster he was when he arrived in Australia and he has a clear role at his new club.This is a Huddersfield very much in transition, with Burgess handed a leadership role to help their young players through what may well be formative and tough times. The expectation is not trophies: it is keeping the club’s head above water. “He’ll add a bit to them and he’ll grow into his role with them,” Sam said of his brother. “He’s a big boy and he’s hard to handle.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Having guided Warrington to a cup final and playoff semi‑final in his first season as a head coach, there is already an expectation that success for the 36-year-old this year will be defined by bringing silverware to Warrington. There is no doubt that he is a fine coach, illustrated by the progression seen at the Wolves in 2024.Burgess also has the bright lights of Las Vegas to prepare for in a fortnight’s time when his Wolves face Wigan, and while the fact it is the opening weekend adds some validity to why the Wolves weren’t at their best here, that is also another challenge for Burgess to manage. While Sam is stateside, Tom will be playing in Huddersfield at home against Hull FC.There was a chance for a brotherly embrace at full time on Sunday and a joke from Sam, after Tom challenged the loser of this contest to a bungee jump. “You’d best find a big bungee jump for him,” the Warrington coach said with a smile. Together they conquered the game in Australia with Souths – but now, the brothers must forge their own paths over the next eight months.Explore more on these topicsSuper LeagueHuddersfield GiantsWarringtonRugby leagueSam BurgessfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Juve are now in fourth spot with 46.Barcelona’s Hansi Flick criticises Jude Bellingham over ‘disrespectful’ red cardRead moreInter quickly got into their stride with Mehdi Taremi’s bicycle kick saved by Michele Di Gregorio before Denzel Dumfries put the ball over the bar. Juve responded with Nicolás Gonzalez forcing Yann Sommer into a fine double save, first to keep out a long-range shot and then to deny Conceiçao from the rebound.Both sides continued to attack in the second half but it was Conceição who finally broke Inter’s resistance.Meanwhile, teenager Assane Diao could very well prove to beComo’s saviour. The 19-year-old scored again to set his relegation threatened side on their way to a 2-0 win atFiorentina. It was Diao’s fourth goal in his seven matches since joining from Real Betis last month and the win lifted Cesc Fàbregas’ team five points above the drop zone.Como broke the deadlock four minutes before half-time with a rapid counterattack. A Fiorentina free-kick was headed out of the area when Diao gathered the ball deep inside his own half and raced forward to beat the home goalkeeper, David de Gea, one-on-one. Nico Paz got Como’s second in the 66th minute with a shot that took a slight deflection to curl in off the top of the left post.View image in fullscreenNico Paz (right) celebrates with Assane Diao after scoring against Fiorentina.Photograph: Marco Bucco/APRomawere without injured forward Paulo Dybala but managed to win 1-0 at 10-manParma.

The referee initially awarded a penalty to the visitors and showed Leoni a yellow card.However, the video assistant referee confirmed that contact was outside the area so the penalty was rescinded but Leoni’s card was changed to a red as the 18-year-old had prevented a clear scoring opportunity.

Or, if we do, we will be gladly entertained.When Paddy’s death was confirmed on Friday, the sad news not only inspired the attention of more than two million pairs of eyeballs on various chattering sites – irredeemably lachrymose, no doubt – it was among the 10 most-read articles on theGuardian’s website, testimony to the stature of one of the industry’s charismatic football sages.Patrick Barclay, talented and respected football journalist, dies aged 77Read moreWhat might have amused the enthusiastic gourmand about hisGuardianlisting was the fact he was sandwiched between the review of an apparently dreadful restaurant across the river from his home in south London and a story about James Bond.The son of an actor (the Hungarian-born Guy Deghy, who appeared in 60s TV staples such asThe SaintandDanger Man, as well as the filmWhere Eagles Dare), Paddy would not have looked out of place as 007 – but decidedly uncomfortable in a substandard eating house.Born in London, he gazed on occasional postwar British acting celebrities as a small boy, before the family moved to Scotland, where his grandfather imbued him with a love of Dundee FC and a peculiarly Scottish addiction to football. He grew into a natural teller of tales and glory and loved nothing better than an anecdote, new, old or vaguely believable.A couple of long-time colleagues, Jon Henderson and Mike Collett, Paddy and myself met last Monday at his club near London’s Trafalgar Square, a fashionably shabby hideaway where retired rascals can swap as many myths as time will allow. It was one of our regular lunches and we recycled some tired jokes, raged at pet foibles, generally behaving as if the world and football would stop spinning without us.Now we’ve lost our supernova. As Joni Mitchell sang, you don’t know what you got ’til it’s gone. That sense of loss is felt most deeply by Paddy’s family, of course, and that is where our sympathies must surely reside. There will be grieving, too, among the scores of his long-time friends, inside and outside the business, where he moved with panache and authority.A good style of a man, as an earlier generation used to say, Paddy was not without ego, and he blushed when I observed once that his neatly trimmed sideburns had been shaped at a rakish 45 degrees. He kept them that way for some time … even when his hair began to thin beyond redemption.It was in the press box where Paddy left his most indelible impressions, as he settled down alongside the pack at internationals and big domestic matches, with no preconceptions and some strongly held views. In the early days, for instance, he did not see the need for a foreign manager of the England team, although he mellowed.He was hardly ever wrong – but there were moments. I remember (and he liked to forget) the time onQuiz Bowl(Channel 4, Friday nights, when many of the sports media big hitters put their egos on the line), as he failed to recognise Dundee FC as a correct answer. It was a rare lapse, because his football knowledge was encyclopaedic.View image in fullscreenPatrick Barclay awards Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah the 2018 Football Writers’ Association Footballer of the Year prize.Photograph: PA Images/AlamyWhile his professionalism dictated that he would not appear wildly partisan (unlike some of his contemporaries), two fellow Scots hovered above most others in his estimation: Hugh McIlvanney and Alex Ferguson. He toiled, starry-eyed, alongside the former (for three of his five years at theObserver) and wrote a fine book on the latter.For all that he wrote for most of the nation’s best newspapers at one time or another – as well as inheriting some of his father’s actorly elan on television and, latterly, explored the jungle of social media – theGuardianwas his spiritual home.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I like to think theObserverwas in a fond second place; others might have different rankings. Whatever, we shared space in these pages, as well as many adventures, and nobody could have wished for a finer companion.Paddy could be quirky. When rung at home once to confirm a detail in his copy, the timing was awkward, apparently. “Jesus Christ!” he exclaimed, “I’m in the middle of my cheese on toast sandwich.” Extraneous noises in public could disturb his otherwise shiny demeanour. An enduring memory is Paddy remonstrating with a nearby diner for the loud chatter on his mobile phone. The poor man finished his call and left.It wasn’t just his Caledonian charm and natural effervescence that made Paddy a joy to be with, although that could be as intoxicating as his favourite red wine. It was his modulated and lightly worn expertise on the sport he loved that lit up any conversation, whatever the setting. While Dens Park inspired his early enthusiasm, Craven Cottage became his London venue of choice. Otherwise, the world was his footballing oyster.He was his own toughest critic, too, not always logically so. “I’m putting too many ‘indeeds’ in my copy,” he complained once. Well take them out, we said. “Easy for you to say,” he replied.Not many could match Paddy for stories stretching back to the 60s, but he never lost touch with contemporary issues. Among his latter projects was the splendid look-back podcast, Football Ruined My Life. Friday’s edition, his 80th, was withdrawn out of respect for his passing.We are left, meanwhile, with a body of work that few in his time could match for insight and wit.

It centres on theNHS, our strained systems of social care and an ever-more toxic and hateful conversation about immigration. Without hundreds of thousands of people who have come to the UK from abroad, the most basic aspects of how we look after old, infirm and ill people would simply collapse. Politics, however, increasingly seems to demand that this truth has to be denied – and the result is a level of hypocrisy that is remarkable even by modern standards.Three weeks before last Christmas, my dad – who turns 89 next month – fell down a flight of stairs, and broke his hip. After a terrifyingly long wait for an ambulance, he was admitted to hospital in Macclesfield, Cheshire, and operated on. In the midst of yet another awful NHS winter, the treatment he received felt faintly miraculous. And there was another aspect of his stay that seemed no less remarkable. Macclesfield is hardly the most diverse place in the world, but most of the doctors and nurses who so carefully looked after him were first-generation immigrants, mostly either from African countries, or India: people regularly overburdened and rushed off their feet, but who answered my endless questions and queries with an amazing grace and patience.My dad was on the orthopaedic trauma ward for six long weeks. And from my first visit onwards, my mind began boggling at the scenes quietly playing out around us, which are surely similar all over the country. When I glanced at my phone, or heard a news bulletin blaring from another patient’s iPad, the headlines were often about the current political obsession with immigration and integration. Each morning, a trolley laden with newspapers would appear, and the most popular choices were the Mail and Express, whose pages were – as ever – regularlyfull of warningsabout influxes of foreigners, and a country supposedly falling apart. In the most visceral way imaginable, what was happening in front of our eyes disproved just about all of it, but the contradiction simply sat there: one more howling British inconsistency, in a country brimming with them.Midway through January, I began to get acquainted with another place: a care home in the outer Mancunian suburbs, to which my dad was transferred for physiotherapy and rehab. I have been there a lot lately. Just about all the clients and patients are of the ethnicity we classify as white British – while, once again, most of the staff are from abroad. My dad’s most regular care worker came to the UK from the Indian state of Kerala. The people in charge are mostly from the Philippines. They carry out duties that would leave most of us wondering where to start: lifting people out of bed and easing them into long and painful days; providing constant friendship and comfort; answering endless cries for help.Why does Labour think bashing migrants is the way to defeat Reform? Look abroad: the tactic never works | Owen JonesRead moreTwenty-eight per cent of NHS nursesarenon-UK nationals; among doctors, the figure is 35%. In London, the relevant share of health-service personnel is 30%. The figure among English social care workers is reckoned to beas high as 32%. But as of March last year, migrants in that line of work have been subject to acruel new rule, whereby they cannot bring any dependents to live with them: the result has beena sharp declinein both the number of approved health and care worker visas, and applications for them. You can join the dots from that development to another story. Aroundone in sevenNHS beds is said to be occupied by someone well enough to be discharged, but waiting for social care. In the latter sector, the most recent estimates suggest that there are130,000 job vacancies. The chief executive of Care England, Martin Green,says the dependents banis “shortsighted and profoundly damaging”. This is the proof.But the grim Westminster mood music continues; in fact, it is rapidly turning completely poisonous, across the political board. Last year, Kemi Badenoch was asked about her stance on immigration, and her answer reduced care work toa crass cartoon: “We need to make sure we are thinking about the next generation, not just who’s going to wipe bottoms for us today.” She now wants to force people from abroad towait 15 yearsbefore they can apply for British citizenship, while also denying permanent residency to anyone who has claimed benefits or social housing. Clearly, this is what happens when conservatism is dragged constantly rightwards by Reform UK, a party that wants “net zero” immigration, and whose leader wasrecently heard telling farmersprotesting about changes to inheritance tax that the government wants to acquire “lots of land because they’re planning for another 5 million people to come into the country”.The Labour party is obviously feeling the same pull. The last couple of weeks have illustrated what Keir Starmer and his colleagues think is going to get them out of their current hole: pursuing his promise to “reduce immigration–legal and illegal”, charging the Tories with running what he rather mendaciously calls an “open borders” experiment, and making sure eyes are averted from the practical consequences of a tacit return to the so-called hostile environment. With the prospect oftightened public spending, the possibility of a more constructive agenda – reducing the political salience of immigration by building social housing, ending local austerity, or finally reforming and boosting a threadbare care sector so more British-born people take jobs in it – feels like it is falling away. Instead, the UK may be about to learn the same lesson awaiting large swathes of Europe, and the US: that particularly in ageing societies, effectively hanging up a sign that reads “migrants not wanted” is never the cleverest move.When human beings are dependent on others for the most essential needs, the most moral response ought to be gratitude. But dependency also tends to trigger resentment and anger, which I think is part of the contemporary British condition. It is not that long since millions of us stood outside our houses and gave “key workers”a vast round of applause; now, our politicians seem set on telling a lot of them that they are either not wanted, or only allowed to be here on the basis of miserable and inhuman restrictions. Westminster, in fact, seems to be fixed on a future that Badenoch, Starmer and Nigel Farage may eventually be old and infirm enough to directly experience.

Did you know this was happening?” The most recent felt like a horror-movie trope. It’s the part of the film, about a third of the way in, where a woman is locked up with the lie that the incarceration is for her own good.A lack of mental health beds means a woman is taken to prison “as a place of safety” and there she’ll stay, unsentencedIt’s not just films, of course, not just fiction – countless women were institutionalised in the 19th century for “abnormal” behaviours, like disagreeing with their husbands, or following “unnatural” sexual impulses. Some were locked up for postnatal depression, some alcoholism, some “moral insanity”, which meant, somehow, infidelity. But what shocked me even more than historical reports on women like Elizabeth Packard, who was incarcerated by her husband in 1860 (the doctor’s reasons included her refusal to shake his hand and the fact that she was above the age of 40), what got me asking, sayingwait,was the knowledge that something similar is still happening daily, in prisons across the country.Typically, this is how it goes: a woman on the street behaves erratically and police pick her up, concerned she might harm herself or others. Perhaps she’ll be held in a police car or cell for a while, charged with disorderly conduct, or perhaps she’ll be taken to hospital. But increasingly a lack of mental health beds means she is then taken to prison “as a place of safety” and there she’ll stay, unsentenced and without specialist care, sometimes lingering in a cell for more than a year. These patients include (wrote Charlie Taylor, HM Chief Inspector of Prisons,in a report last year) people whose psychosis can make them violent, meaning they’re held in isolation, and people so driven to harming themselves, “They have repeatedly blocked their own airways with bedding, removed teeth or maimed themselves to the point of exposing their own intestines.”In 19th-century asylums, women were offered very little mental health provision and patients routinely self-harmed. There are a series of unnerving and moving photos online by society photographer Henry Hering who took portraits of Bethlem patients, including Eliza Josolyne, admitted in 1857 with “overwork”. She “frequently tried to injure herself by knocking her head against doors and walls, and has slept in the padded room on this account”. Perhaps it’s unhelpful to keep returning to the Victorian asylums, but here is where my mind goes, aided in part by pictures of a prison currently housing women as “a place of safety” (the words catch on the tongue) – HMP Styal in Cheshire, which occupies a former “orphanage for destitute children” opened in 1898.There were 11 suicides at HMP Styal between 2007 and 2024, more than any other women’s jail in England. One was 18-year-oldAnnelise Sanderson, who had been arrested in 2020 for stealing a pair of trainers and assaulting emergency workers who had intervened. When she was apprehended she poured petrol on herself and tried to drink it; instead of being offered psychiatric treatment, she was sentenced to 12 months at Styal. A woman detained there at the same time told the BBC that it was “no place for a vulnerable young woman” and that Anderson “needed help, yet found herself in the same pit of monsters as me”.Other prisons house more tragedies. Last year a jury concluded that Eastwood Park prison in Gloucestershire failed to provide for 36-year-old Kay Melhuish’s “basic human needs” and that neglect (including a 10-day wait for clean underwear) contributed to her death by suicide. Melhuish was being held on remand during an acute mental health crisis – campaigning for access to her children, she was arrested holding a knife to her own throat. The prison was aware of her history of suicide attempts and self-harm, and had been warned that her autism and PTSD made prison (with its noise and regular use of force) particularly difficult for her to cope with. Less than three weeks after she arrived, she was dead. Her daughtertold theGuardian, “Mum was ill, not bad.”Prison is not a place of safety. For women especially, it is a place of chaos and trauma where vulnerable people struggle to maintain their dignity, let alone sanity.A new reportfound that “the frustrations of day-to-day life” and a “lack of basic care” (including not being allowed to clean their underwear in washing machines) were driving women in prison to hurt themselves – the self-harm rate is 5,785 incidents per 1,000 prisoners, more than eight times higher than in men’s prisons.And into these containers of suffering are dropped women whose only crime is mental illness, who are not only locked inside bodies that are attacking them, but inside cells that inspire violence. Their presence imports further vulnerability to the prisons, to both prisoners and to staff, unequipped to deal with either complex mental health problems or the violence they might provoke. The women’s justice board’s plans to reduce the number of women in prison cannot come soon enough and should be only the beginning – prison is not a place of safety, it’s a place often, of dark and utter terror.Email Eva ate.wiseman@observer.co.ukExplore more on these topicsPrisons and probationThe Eva Wiseman columnUK criminal justiceWomencommentShareReuse this content"

That’s why our jails are overflowingSamira ShackleFor 20 years, the UK has been inflating sentences despite little evidence it deters crime. But a new review offers a glimmer of hopeSun 16 Feb 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 16 Feb 2025 12.59 ESTShareWe’ve heard a lot about prisons in recent months; specifically, the factthat they were fullwhen the new government took office last summer. Labour introduced emergency measures torelease thousands of prisonersearly, which eased the immediate pressure. The government has committed tobuilding four new prisonsas well as adding blocks to existing prisons,creating14,000 new prison spaces over the next seven years. But when the prison system gets bigger, so do the problems within it. And none of this answers the more complicated question of what happens next.So far, we have seen sticking-plaster solutions to a systemic crisis that has been created, in no small part, by the desire of successive governments to appear tough on crime. Any serious attempt to turn things around requires consideration of how we got here. The UK’s prison populationis at record levels; it hasalmost doubledin the past 30 years. England and Wales have thehighest per capita prison populationin western Europe, and in the wider continent, only Russia and Turkeyjailmore people. Amid endemic overcrowding and understaffing, conditions are often poor, with inmates routinely confined to their cells – usually shared – for23 hours a day. The suicide rate in our jails istwicethe European average. Waiting lists for rehabilitative work – behaviour courses, education, training – are so long that some inmates mightnever accessthem at all. Most people would probably agree that none of this is desirable; it certainly doesn’t do much to lower the crime rate.So how has this situation come about? The crucialissue is sentence inflation. In short, over the past 20 years, more people have been handed prison sentences, and they have got longer and longer over time, despite no corresponding increase in crime. In 2023, the average custodial sentence given at crown court was25% longerthan in 2012. This isn’t solely a case of more serious offences being tried – it’s also true that longer sentences are being handed out for the same crime. Sentences for robbery, for example, were13 months longeron average in 2023 than in 2012, anincrease of 36%.In the Netherlands, we’re closing our emptying prisons. What can other countries learn from how we did it? | Renate van der ZeeRead moreThese longer sentences kept the prison population flat over the 2010s, despite falling numbers of people being tried and convicted for crimes overall. In September 2024, the Howard League (which advocates for penal reform)published a paperby five senior former judges, calling for an “an honest conversation about what custodial sentences can and cannot achieve” and a return to “more modest proportionate sentences across the board”. The judges wrote that in the 50 years they’d been involved with the law, sentence lengths had doubled and so had the prison population, and called for a reversal of this trend.There was no single moment where sentences became longer; it has been a slow creep, the result of decades of small changes to the law. But one crucial turning point was the Blair government’s 2003 Criminal Justice Act, which introducedstatutory starting pointsfor minimum terms for murder. The change was implemented only in England and Wales, where sentences for serious offences haverisenmuch faster than in Scotland, demonstrating how one seemingly small legislative change can have a cascade of consequences. When sentences are made longer, or minimum terms are introduced for one crime, it can lead to calls for similar conditions on other crimes. More recently, thePolice, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022increased the maximum sentence for death by dangerous driving from14 years to life imprisonment, while other legislation has increased minimum sentences for crimes such asfirearms offencesanddomestic burglary. Emotive campaigns by victims or pressure groups to create new offences or lengthen sentences to address specific issues or problems can have a similar effect.Imposing longer sentences for specific crimes can feel intuitively like a satisfying and fair solution to specific instances of injustice. But a prison system already swollen by years of successive sentencing increases was not in a position to accommodate new, successive crises. Over the past decade and a half, austerity has meant drastic cuts to the probation service and court systems. Since 2017, the number of people beingrecalledto prison after being released on probation hasgone up 85%. Massive crown court backlogs have led to more people beingheld on remandawaiting trial – an84% increasesince 2019 (with two-thirds of those people yet to be convicted of a crime).For too long, the emphasis, by successive governments, has been on sending people to prison without much thought for what happens while they are there. Equally little consideration is given to what is actually effective. In 2022, theSentencing Council concludedthat there was no strong evidence that severe sentences deter people from committing crime.Could this approach change? There are some glimmers of hope. Alongside the push to expand prison places, the government isconductingan independent review of sentencing policy, due to report in the spring. It’s expected to recommend that more people are given community orders or suspended sentences – meaning that they are served outside prison. This is a way to ease pressure on prison spaces, but it might also prove effective; at present, offenders given noncustodial sentences have lower levels of recidivism, perhaps because it is easier to access support and rehabilitation outside prison than inside.If we actually want to reduce crime, we might shift from looking at the length of sentences to what people are doing while serving them – and instead of judging criminal justice policies on whether they sound “tough” or “soft” on crime, considering whether they work.Samira Shackle is a freelance journalist and the author of Karachi ViceExplore more on these topicsPrisons and probationOpinionUK criminal justicecommentShareReuse this content"

Together, they speak volumes about two-speedEnglandand government priorities.Somewhat forlorn, partly covered in scaffolding, the majestic, rusting Tyne Bridge linking Newcastle upon Tyne and Gateshead is undergoing along-delayed, four-year restorationmeant to be completed for its centenary in 2028. The last government initially promised £35m towards the £41m cost – and while the prime minister recently described the structure as an “iconic part of the Newcastle and Gateshead skyline”, he refused to offer any assurance that the remaining £6mwould be forthcomingin a review of infrastructure projects being undertaken by the Department for Transport. Local councils, cash-strapped and facing another round of austerity, are dismayed.But there’s no such reluctance for the proposed Thames crossing, involving a 2.6-mile tunnel – the longest of its kind in Britain – from the chancellor, Rachel Reeves. She says it represents “infrastructure the country desperately needs”. But surely that could also be said of the 13-mile upgrade of the A1 inNorthumberland, north of the Tyne Bridge, from single to dual carriageway. Yet plans, approved by the last government, have been abandoned because its £500m cost apparently offers “poor value for money and limited economic benefits”.Putting aside the obvious question as to whether a safer, free-flowing road, rather than a dangerous mix of dual and single carriageway, might actually encourage investment in a less-favoured region, the political messaging from ministers is dreadful. People feel betrayed,when £68m has already been spent on preparatory workand buying land. Labour stalwarts in “red wall” seats are angry and restless.Once again, a skewed Whitehall “cost-benefit” analysis – crudely calculating that the greater south-east will assuredly grow while much of the north will inevitably lag behind – has played down the potential for regional growth. Decent infrastructure, after all, sends out positive signals to investors while underpinning the foundational, social economy and the services that sustain vibrant communities, particularly in areas that have barely recovered from the recession of the early 1980s, let alone subsequent financial crises and further mass redundancies.For much of my working life, not least as regional affairs editor of the Guardian, I’ve been chronicling the injustices of what was – and remains –one of the most divided nations in the OECD, with only Turkey, Colombia and Hungary languishing below us.Our deep regional inequalities can be traced back to Victorian times, with north-south divisions intensifying in the 1920s-30s, prompting governments to respond with a series of measures from targeted help for “special areas” – notably, the north-east, Scotland and Wales – to directing new industries to regions labelled less-favoured. This brought some stability until the early 1980s, when the gap between the greater south-east and the north widened considerably. It has stubbornly remained so, in spite of valiant efforts byLabourafter 1997.It’s 20 years since I chaired a cross-party commission –Connecting England– which examined in detail the uneven economy of a divided nation and put the case for a national framework to identity “future development needs and priorities”. It immediately caught the attention of the late John Prescott, former deputy prime minister, who created nine regional development agencies in England with substantial budgets to create jobs, renew older industrial areas and clear derelict land.I noted, in the introduction, that without a national framework to guide key projects – road and rail investment, the location of ports and airports, for instance – the country would “drift directionless, reinforcing a belief … that the winner takes all”. And so it is now proving again.Prescott took on board our case for greater emphasis on regional economies away from London, producing a “northern way” growth strategy around a trans-Pennine corridor and a specialist team to take it forward. But in 2010, a Tory-Liberal Democrat government scrapped the regional development agencies, regional planning strategies and all. Eric Pickles, then local government and planning secretary, famously labelled regional direction “Stalinist”.‘Symbol of our pride’: Newcastle city council vows to restore Tyne BridgeRead moreOn taking office seven months ago, the Labour government inherited a country denied a regional policy and the essential institutions capable of addressing the north-south divide. I assumed it had a plan to address England and its profound regional inequalities. Sadly, I was wrong. Ringing in my ears were comments in an interview two years ago with the late Bob Kerslake, former head of the civil service and, before that, chief executive of Sheffield city council, that “comprehensive long-term intervention” was needed to begin turning round the economies of post-industrial areas, away from the big cities: areas – dare I suggest, like the communities in “red wall” constituencies not far from the cancelled A1 dual carriageway in Northumberland.It took Rachel Reeves to confirm recently there was no meaningful strategy, aside from promising to go “further and faster” to drive growth in the greater south-east:backing expansion of Heathrowwith a third runway; reviving plans for a multibillion-pound Oxford-Cambridge hi-tech arc with new communities plus rail link and, of course,supporting that Lower Thames Crossinglinking the M2 in Kent with the M25 in Essex.Not surprisingly, many in the north are now asking if, yet again, a government grasping at old Treasury straws is assuming London and the greater south-east will drive national growth in the faint hope it will filter down to other regions – no matter that there’s precious little evidence trickle-down – or in this case up – from south to north has worked in the past.We are left, then, with the dismissive tones of National Highways, which runs major roads in England, suggesting that the new Thames crossing will unlock growth by doubling road capacity east of London “to better link the north and the Midlands with the ports of the south-east”. Pull the other one.“Regional policy?” mused an old friend, a leading academic who has spent much of his working life studying regional disparities in Europe and beyond. “It’s called London and the greater south-east.” With the odd exception, it’s same as it ever was.Peter Hetherington writes for Society Guardian on communities and regenerationExplore more on these topicsNorth-south divideOpinionNorth of EnglandNewcastleNorthumberlandInfrastructureTransportLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

They are vital scrutinySonia SodhaRather than rush through such a high-stakes law, it’s essential to listen to all sides of the debateSun 16 Feb 2025 03.30 ESTLast modified on Sun 16 Feb 2025 08.34 ESTShareYou can glean a lot from the way someone characterises their opponents in a debate. Do they engage with them constructively, assuming the best about their motives? Or imply they are acting out of bad faith? It’s telling that Kim Leadbeater, the MP who’s brought forward the bill tolegalise assisted dying, seems to have gone for the latter approach.There could not be more at stake: legalising the prescription of lethal drugs to terminally ill people raises the spectre of vulnerable people being wrongfully subjected to anassisted death with state assistance. It is critical that the bill’s proponents engage constructively with the doctors, psychiatrists, social workers, lawyers and domestic abuse experts who have this concern. Yet Leadbeater appears affronted by the opposition to her bill; she hascharacterised it as “noise”, described those who oppose her change in the law asunconstructive, and has complained about their “clear mobilisation”. (Yes, when people are worried that legislation could have tragic consequences, that’s what they do.) The implication seemingly being that, unless you agree with her on the principle, there’s no legitimate role for you in scrutinising her bill.This attitude seems to be driving the way the bill’s proponents are approaching its scrutiny. Leadbeater picked the bill committee and on the opposition side left off seasoned MPs with relevant experience, such as the psychiatrist Ben Spencer, instead selecting a relatively inexperienced group. The committee heard just three days of oral evidence, heavily skewed to those infavour of the bill. It took no evidence from experts in domestic abuse, and had to be shamed into allowing the Royal College of Psychiatrists to give evidence. Almost400 pieces of written evidencehave been published just in the last couple of weeks; when are the MPs on the committee supposed to read and digest them? Meanwhile, the bill’s proponents appear to be cherrypicking evidence from those who agree with them while ignoring the medical experts pointing out therisks of their approach.And now Leadbeater has abruptly proposed a big change to the bill that will almost certainly be rammed through, despite denying it was on the cards until the moment it was announced. Until last week the bill’s safeguards were talked up as the strongest in the world because assisted deaths would be signed off by a high court judge. This was criticised by legal experts both for and against the bill because the process was essentially a tick-box exercise, with the judge having no scope to hear cross-examination onwhether the right decision has been made. For it to function as a safeguard, the judge’s role would have needed significant beefing up.Leadbeater has watered it down by removing the judicial element altogether; instead, panels consisting of a senior lawyer or a judge, a social worker and a psychiatrist will sign off. They can sit in private; they don’t appear to have powers to compel witnesses to give evidenceunder oath; and not only is there no way for relatives to challenge approvals if they feel they have been given on the basis of incomplete evidence, there is also no obligation to let family members know, raising the possibility that someone’s adult child or parent might embark on an assisted death because they don’t want to be a burden, and the first their loved one hears of it is after they’ve killed themselves.Important opposition amendments that would strengthen the bill’s safeguards have already been rejectedHer amendments also remove the role of the chief medical officer in monitoring assisted dying, replacing it with an assisted dying commissioner who has the dual job of appointing the panels and reporting on safety, marking their own homework. Neither panel members nor the commissioner will be acting in a judicial capacity, but this hasn’t stopped proponents dishonestly branding the proposal as “judge plus”.Important opposition amendments that would strengthen the bill’s safeguardshave already been rejected. There are more on the table, including requiring someone requesting assisted dying to have an independent psychiatric assessment, and opponents will try to remove the bill’s extraordinary provision that there should be no civil liability, including for negligence, for doctors prescribing lethal drugs to citizens. But unless something big shifts, the status quo will stand.This approach appears to be underwritten by the prime minister.Keir Starmerhas made no secret of the fact he supports this bill. Two ministers on the committee are voting with the bill’s proponents despite the government’s purported neutrality, rather than abstaining, as they ought. The government has said it will not publish an impact assessment, including cost estimates, until after committee stage, effectively handing its proponents a blank cheque, in sharp contrast to the frugality ministers are expected to exercise in other areas.At the heart of this is a dispute about whether a neat line can be drawn around those making an autonomous, empowered decision to end their own life to relieve their suffering. The bill’s proponents believe against the evidence that this is relatively easy; its opponents believe people who are vulnerable through mental illness, abuse and poverty will inevitably be caught up in it. You can see this in the policing of language; proponents have tried tostop critics using the term “suicide”, with Kit Malthouse MP preposterously trying to redefine it as a “healthy person taking their own life”. Yet the government’s suicide prevention adviser is clear in his view that there is no clear line to be drawnbetween suicide and assisted dying.If this bill passes, some people will be wrongly prescribed lethal drugs by the state. No state system of regulation is infallible: to take just one example, the Human Tissue Authority, with a considerablymore independent assessment processthan that proposed by this bill, has approved victims of organ trafficking for organ donation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Mostly that things do get betterEmma BeddingtonEveryone hopes that they will get happier and wiser as well as older. And you know what? Sometimes they doSun 16 Feb 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 16 Feb 2025 20.32 ESTShareImet my younger self for coffee. She wore a crisp white Agnès B shirt and patent ballet pumps; I wore H&M elastic waisted trousers and the T-shirt I wore to the gym the day before. She ordered … hang on, hang on. First, isn’t this a time-travel no-no? And if it’s OK, I have questions. Say I met my 20-year-old self – is it 1995, meaning weak filter in the hippy cafe with cakes that taste like horse food? Or 2025, when every second shop serves violently acidic espressos? (Either way, I need to prepare my stomach.) And how have I lured her out? Because she may be naive, but no way would she agree to coffee with “your future self”. That’s plainly a trap.This whimsy, you may not be surprised to hear, is a TikTok trend. Based on a poem byJennae Cecelia, it has been enthusiastically adopted by the youth (how are you dewy-faced babies meeting your younger selves – what are they, foetuses?). The formulaic videos are set to the kind of acoustic crooning that makes my husband instantly switch the radio to Capital Dance and wow, are they earnest about their lost, hurting youthful selves and self-actualised current incarnations. Aren’t gen Z supposed to be jokey nihilists? “We hugged and I told her I am becoming everything she had ever wanted me to be,” goes TikToker@earthtoapryl’s version(2m views). “I told her she’s full of purpose and has taught 10 million people to love themselves,” says another, and if you aren’t cringing your entire body inside out reading that, you’re probably not a gen X cynic.But everyone loves a growth narrative: the “older self compassionately contemplates young fuck-up” trope is hard to resist. People are forever writing letters to their foolish younger selves as if they’d care; the Guardianran a whole seriesin 2017. We need to believe we become wiser and happier; it’s what keeps us slogging on, through the trenches of adulthood, towards the mythicsunlit uplands of the contentment U-curve. No TikTok “younger self” coffee dates I’ve seen go anything like: “She looked at me pityingly; asked pointed questions about my skincare routine and current earnings. She paid, and as she left, I heard her mutter it was no surprise my husband had left me.”And of course, it does get better, in so many ways. I could do my own: she arrived beautifully turned out, trying to convey an air of remote glamour (reading an article about the mystique of the young Nigella Lawson at an impressionable age was a disaster for me). She struggled to conceal her horror at the potato-faced version of herself who showed up and said she was living back in York and loving it. She wouldn’t have cake with her coffee and wrote everything she ate in tiny neat handwriting in a notebook full of joyless meals (the phrase “scraping of butter” still haunts me). She was brittle and lonely. The older version is a bit gentler, edges rubbed off by life and endlessly getting things wrong; she’s learned to find joy in tiny things (usually, but not exclusively, birds). The younger one would be surprised, I think, that the boyfriend she fought with all the time is now her husband and that we’re mostly very gentle with each other. Sure, there’s all that.But, at the same time, there’s so much more than skin elasticity going for youth. I know my younger self could teach me things – and not just how to blend foundation properly. She read widely and ambitiously and could concentrate for hours on end. She had expansive thoughts on topics other than lunch. She was sharp, energetic and rarely questioned her own intellect. She was clear about what she wanted from life. The anxious, blurry, unsure, often disappointed-in-myself older version could do with a dose of that.It would be possible for a person to get quite gloomy thinking about this. But I do know younger me would be astonished (and irrationally resentful) that older me is doing the job she wants, but feels will never be within her grasp – it’s quite salutary to realise that. And if further cheer is needed, there are always 90s faves on Capital Dance. We’d probably both enjoy some of those.Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLife and styleOpinionYoung peopleFriendshipHealth & wellbeingSocial mediaInternetcommentShareReuse this content"

In the middle of last month, he flew to Kyiv to double-down on the commitment to back Ukraine’s struggle for freedom, a pledge he first made a defining feature of his leadership when Labour was in opposition. Hands were warmly clasped with Volodymyr Zelenskyy, wailing air raid sirens greeted a Russian drone attack, financial promises were made, and signatures were inscribed on a100-year partnershiptreaty. The prime minister solemnly intoned the western mantra about backing the resistance to Russian tyranny “for as long as it takes” for Ukraine to become “free and thriving once again”.All of which now sounds for the birds, thanks to Donald Trump. It was with his trademark contempt for his country’s traditional allies that the US president blindsided them by announcing thathe had initiated peace negotiationswith Vladimir Putin over the heads of Ukraine and the European members of Nato. The UK received no more warning of this bombshell than anyone else. So much for the vaunted “special relationship”. The US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, then unleashed another punch to the solar plexus of European security bypublicly declaringthat Ukraine would have to accept the surrender of large chunks of its territory and should forget about becoming a member of Nato. The future defence of Ukraine, he went on to declare, would be down to Europe, because the US wouldn’t be sending any of its troops to sustain a security guarantee.Humiliated and anguished, European leaders are crying “betrayal”. The UK government is not adding its voice to that charge in public, but it privately agrees. There is astonishment that the US presidentblithely conceded to several Russian demandsbefore negotiations have even begun. “What happened to the Art of the Deal?” asks one flabbergasted minister. There is disgust at theKremlin’s undisguised gleewith what it interprets as a vindication of the barbarity it has inflicted on its neighbour. There is fear of the consequences for the Baltic states and others by rewarding Russian predation. There is horror at Trump’s subsequent suggestion thatPutin be invited to rejoin the G7, as if the bloody slate of war crimes perpetrated by the Russians can simply be wiped clean.A hideous idea doing the rounds is that Trump will make a state visit to Moscow timed to coincide with the May Day parade, which celebrates Russia’s military. What a grotesque spectacle: the supposed leader of the free world sitting with the Kremlin’s tyrant watching a march across Red Square by the army that has committed so many atrocities inUkraine.The biggest surprise is that so many people claim to be surprised. We knew that this US president despises America’s historic allies among the European democracies as he disdains the architecture of international security that his predecessors built. His geopolitics is one in which carnivorous great powers cut deals with each other and the smaller ones fall into line or get crushed underfoot. If you are genuinely shocked by these developments, I can only assume you haven’t been paying much attention.The perils are acute. A dictated peace will embolden Putin and other predators by sanctifying the redrawing of international borders by force. Were the US in concert withRussiato dismember Ukraine over the protests of Kyiv and European capitals, the transatlantic alliance would be mortally fractured.Europeans are right to be angry with Trump, but they should also be furious with themselves. They are to blame for leaving their continent so vulnerable to this danger-infused turn in world events. Trump has always had a point when he’s railed about Uncle Sam being treated as Uncle Sucker and he isn’t the first US president to tell Europe to take more responsibility for its security, even if none before have been so brutal about it. Under the lazy assumption that the US would always ultimately have their backs, European countries have spent too little on their own defence. The Russian invasion of Ukraine was often described as a wake-up call, but too much of Europe responded by hitting the snooze button. Three years on, thelatest authoritative reportfrom the International Institute for Strategic Studies finds that Moscow is feeding more resources into its war machine than the entirety of non-Russian Europe is spending on defence. Some frontline Nato countries, notably Poland, haveramped up their military budgetsin response to the ravaging of Ukraine. The Poles grasp that the cost of deterrence is worth paying to avoid the far greater price of leaving yourself exposed to devastation. Others are still asleep. Last year, eight of Nato’s 32 members were still failing to meet the modest obligation to spend at least 2% of GDP.The perils are acute. Dictated peace will embolden Putin by sanctifying the redrawing of international borders by forceIt is not that Europe lacks the resources to protect itself without US assistance.Russia’s populationis about 144 million. The total population of Nato countries, excluding the US, is over 636 million and their combined economic heft is about 12 times that of Russia. The means are there; what’s been lacking is the will.Defence spending is about to become a lively issue in British politics. George Robertson, defence secretary during Tony Blair’s time at Number 10 and subsequently a secretary general of Nato, has been leading a strategicdefence review. Lord Robertson is a shrewd Scot who has overseen a serious piece of work that has come to conclusions which will be jolting. His grim findings have just been delivered to the desks of the defence secretary and the prime minister. They will have landed with a thump.The Robertson review will add further detail to an already alarming picture of escalating threats out-matching inadequate protections. It suggests innovations designed to extract more bangs for taxpayers’ bucks by improving the efficiency of defence spending. It also recommends the reprioritisation of roles and activities. It makes the argument that it’s not just how much you spend that matters, it is also how well you spend. Yet the bluntest message of the review will be that Britain is not adequately resourcing its security. John Healey, the defence secretary, haseffectively concededthat already by decrying the “hollowed-out” armed forces left behind by the Tories, a “dire inheritance” which includes the smallest army since the Napoleonic wars and an air forcelosing pilotsfaster than it can train replacements.One of Mr Healey’s junior ministers has said that the British armycould be wiped outin as little as six months if it engaged in a war on the scale of the conflict in Ukraine. In the realm of cyberwarfare, the head of the National Cyber Security Centrerecently warnedthat Britain’s shields aren’t strong enough to protect from the myriad bad actors who are menacing us.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At an imminent meeting with the prime minister at Number 10, the heads of the armed forces are expected to argue that there will be more cuts to our enfeebled capability unless they get an additional £10bn a year than has been budgeted for.People in a position to know tell me that Sir Keir is becoming swayed by the case to spend more. For that to happen, three big obstacles will have to be overcome. One is the Treasury, which has ever viewed the MoD as a prodigiously wasteful spender, as it often has been. When money is already tight, Rachel Reeves is going to take a lot of persuading to make a special case of defence. There will be baulking by the many Labour ministers and MPs who will flinch at more money for missiles when it will mean less for public services. There’s also a job of persuasion to do with the British public for whom defence and security has not recently been a priority. At last summer’s election, just one in 50 named it astheir top issuein deciding how to vote.It is going to take a lot of effort to shift the dial, but the need to do so is becoming pressing. There’s an old diplomatic saw: “If you’re not at the table, you’ll probably be on the menu.” In this era of international relations, exemplified by Trump seeking to do a strongman-to-strongman deal with Putin to carve up Ukraine, the law of the jungle is beginning to prevail. If the UK and the rest of Europe don’t want their vital interests to be on the menu, we’re going to have to stump up the cost of a seat at the table.Andrew Rawnsley is the Chief Political Commentator of the ObserverExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionVladimir PutinKeir StarmerUkraineDonald TrumpUS politicsEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

On defence and in other areas, they need to chart their own courseSun 16 Feb 2025 12.30 ESTLast modified on Sun 16 Feb 2025 14.27 ESTShareIn 2007, Vladimir Putindelivereda speech to the Munich security conference that stunned western diplomats by launching an unforeseen assault on the post-1989 international order. The United States, alleged Mr Putin, had perniciously manufactured a unipolar world “in which there is one master, one sovereign”. Seven years later, Russian forces illegallyoccupiedCrimea, and Moscow-funded separatists seized swathes of territory in eastern Ukraine, in what turned out to be the precursor to full-blown invasion.Nearly two decades later, the disturbingspeechat the same venue by the US vice-president, JD Vance, may prove to be similarly significant as the geopolitics of the 21st century continue to shift. Mr Vance had been expected to concentrate last Friday’s remarks on Ukraine, after a week in which Donald Trump appeared to be unilaterallypreparingto negotiate a ceasefire deal entirely on Mr Putin’s terms. Instead, he used his platform as a pulpit from which to berate the US’s European allies on issues such as multiculturalism, migration and the regulation of social media. Indefensibly, the Trump administration now actively cheerleads for far-right parties such as Germany’s Alternative für Deutschland, whose leader, Alice Weidel,he chose to meetin Munich.A month into Trump 2.0, Mr Vance and other senior outriders such as Elon Musk are full of ideological hubris and jubilant self-regard. But the vice-president’s use of Maga-style culture war rhetoric to attack European governments amounted to more than mere trolling. In deeply ominous fashion it also shredded the idea of a “west” that shares fundamental values.In the post-cold war era, the transatlantic alliance was founded on a common commitment to international norms that this White House holds in sneering contempt. Mr Trump’s brutally transactional approach is infused with a Hobbesian cynicism – witness hisdeterminationto exploit Ukraine’s vulnerability to seize 50% of its rare earth minerals on favourable terms. Europe must swiftly learn to adapt to an isolationist US that sees it as an ideological adversary and economic competitor.Conflicts and challenging trade-offs are inevitable. Mr Vance’sexcoriationof “digital censorship” in Europe is a prelude to future attempts to see off theregulationof US tech companies via the EU Digital Services Act. On security and defence, climate action and the terms of transatlantic trade, European nations will need to find the unity to stand up to “America-first” bullying tactics, and begin to lay foundations for greater strategic and economic autonomy.This week’s crisismeetingon Ukraine in Paris, convened at short notice by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, is a step in the right direction. Amid justified fears of a neo-imperial carve-up, it is imperative to ensure that Europe, along with Ukraine itself, plays a full part in any future negotiations with Mr Putin – all the more so given that the apparent US expectation that it would police the result.Europe was slow to wake up to the implications of a newly rivalrous and multipolar world, in which transatlantic ties would no longer bind in the same way. The new reality will be characterised by Trumpian bluff, bluster and brinkmanship. Following Mr Vance’s visit to Munich, leaders can hardly say they have not been warned. The task now is to find ways to safeguard the European model from an increasingly sinister US administration that would love to see it fail.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Ministers must fight for plans that put people firstSun 16 Feb 2025 12.25 ESTLast modified on Sun 16 Feb 2025 14.59 ESTShareThe greatly increaseddifficulty for young adultsof either buying a home or finding a long-term, affordable tenancy is both a generational and socioeconomic injustice, and a serious political problem. Sir Keir Starmer’s government knows this and hopes itscommitment to build 1.5m new homeswill shore up support among voters.Making people more secure, so that disappointment and grievance do not make them easy targets for rightwing populists, is a vital task for social democratic parties everywhere. In the UK, where accommodation costs are44% higherthan the western European average, and younger people aredisproportionately trappedin low-quality homes, policies to support those in housing need are a pressing priority.The renters’ rights bill goes some way towardsrebalancing the marketin tenants’ favour. The reduction in the right-to-buy discount ought to make it easier for councils to replace homes that are sold – although with London councils scrambling to cope withsoaring right-to-buy applicationsbefore the deadline, there is short-term disruption to manage first. Another change, made by the last government, was toincrease taxes on landlords and second homes. Angela Rayner, the housing minister, is fighting to make newfunding for affordable homesa priority in the spending review.But house prices are now out of the reach of millions of people without family wealth to draw on, whileone in 21 adults is a landlord. Building a way out of such baked-in inequalities – as ministers have pledged to do – is enormously challenging. The danger is not only that Labour finds itself unable to meet ambitious pledges in terms of numbers, or because objections lead to schemes becoming bogged down in planning and local politics. Already, it is clear that some “new towns” will beextensions to existing towns and cities– more like new suburbs.The bigger problem is that the interests of the big building companies that the government relies on to deliver its policy are not the same as those of people who need homes. To maximise their profits, and value to shareholders, housebuilders want prices as high as possible, even if this places them out of reach for first-time buyers, or those without hefty deposits. Last month, the Competition and Markets Authorityextended its investigationinto seven firms that it said “may have exchanged competitively sensitive information”.Increasing the supply of affordable homes for social rent, meanwhile, has not been seen as a priority, with even housing associationscutting backpartly due to raised maintenance costs and tighter regulations since the Grenfell Tower fire. Fifteen years afterGeorge Osborne cut fundingfor affordable housing by 60%, the impact of this hollowing out of the state’s role as a housing provider is clearer than ever. The poorest households and those who are homeless bear the brunt, while wealthy people have been incentivised to own multiple properties and earn income from rent.Housing is not the only area of life in which many young people face more restricted opportunities than their parents. But shelter is such a basic human need that its importance is hard to overestimate. Ministers must use every lever at their disposal to ensure that new homes are built on terms as favourable as possible to the people who will live in them – not according to rules made by developers.Explore more on these topicsHousingOpinionLabourKeir StarmerRenting propertyLocal governmentSecond homesGeorge OsborneeditorialsShareReuse this content"

Not only is he missing out on a lovely creative piece of television, but he is failing to recognise that pots, jugs, vessels, dishes and containers of all shapes and sizes have played a vital part in the development of civilisation over the ages.Pots for carrying, storing and dispensing water, wine, oil, foodstuff and human waste are important historical markers of human ingenuity and skill that we should not dismiss. While the use of terracotta, ceramics, bone china etc for functional items in our lives has been usurped by plastic and metal, the artistic merits of pots and their intricate illustrations is something to be celebrated. Maybe Mr Chiles needs to sign up for a pottery class.Jan RossSilverton, DevonAs a huge fan of theBritish Museum, I was at first surprised how Adrian Chiles didn’t share my wonder at what’s on display. On reflection, if I had only got round to watching my first football match at 58, I would probably say something inane like “Seen one man kicking a ball, seen them all”. Sounds as if he expected a huge return for little investment.

Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a British-Iranian dual national, was transferred to Kerman after her initial arrest.The couple were heading for Australia, having crossed into Iran from Armenia on 30 December, according to social media posts. From Iran the couple had shared updates, including plans to enter Pakistan next.This week state mediapublished photographspurportedly showing the UK ambassador to Iran, Hugo Shorter, meeting the couple, whom the country has called “national security” suspects.The published photo shows that a meeting on Wednesday was held in the presence of a Kerman prosecutor, Mehdi Bakhshi, and the Kerman governor’s deputy for security and law enforcement, Rahman Jalali.The latest post on the Foremans’ Facebook page, from Isfahan in Iran on 3 January, includes selfies apparently showing the couple, with the caption: “What a wonderful place.”A Foreign Office spokesperson said: “We are providing consular assistance to two British nationals detained in Iran and are in contact with the local authorities.”The UK government advises that British and dual nationals are at significant risk of arrest, questioning or detention in Iran, and that a British passport or UK connections “can be reason enough” to be detained by Iranian authorities.At least 66 foreign and dual nationals have been detained by Iran since 2010, according to research published by the University of Essex in 2022, as part of a growing practice of “politically motivated arrests” that has been decried by Human Rights Watch.After the death in September 2022 of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian of Kurdish origin who had been arrested three days earlier for allegedly breaching the Islamic dress code for women, at least 40 foreign and dual nationals were arrested.Ratcliffe said of the Foremans: “The top priority for the government should be to make sure they get to visit and that they are not being kept in solitary. It will be important they do not feel alone. A court process may soon come. It’s not a real court. But it will be a form of brutal theatre to get the government’s attention.”Mehran Raoof, a dual national and labour rights activist, has been in prison in Iran since 2020 facing national security-related charges.Explore more on these topicsForeign policyIranNazanin Zaghari-RatcliffeMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

I would be tempted to perhaps say: ‘Can I not stay with you?’,” said Oliver, a former secondary school art teacher and headteacher.“[After the pandemic] suddenly people were used to working from home and in many cases I don’t think there was that same desire to have their child in school while they were at home,” he said. “They had been used to it for the best part of a year and a half, on and off, during lockdown. That changed something.”Nearly a seventh of primary school children and a quarter of state secondary pupils are persistently absent, missing at least one day every two weeks, according to official figures. AcrossEngland, persistent absences in all state secondary schools rose from 13% in 2018-19 to 24% in 2022-23.While a small number of schools allow children to be “flexi-schooled”, where parents can teach their children from home for part of the week, Oliver said Fridays had always been the worst attendance day. And in Westminster, where the watchdog is based, he often sees “the place clearing out” on a Thursday night.“I think developing good social habits of getting up in the morning, putting your shoes on instead of your slippers, going out to work, going to school, expecting to complete a full day’s school, a full day’s work, clearly that’s habit-forming,” Oliver said.Other factors such as poor mental health, anxiety and depression were also contributing to poorer pupil attendance rates, he said, in addition to a lack of funding for school services including nurses and child psychologists and limiting screen time.While some companies such as JP Morgan, Amazon and Boots have asked staff to return to offices full-time since the pandemic, many others still have flexible arrangements, with some insisting on at least three days a week in the office.Oliver believes the working-from-home culture will persist and so too will the inevitable challenges that brings to schools.“We’re still going to have to deal with the fact that there are great things you can do really efficiently behind a screen now,” he said. “But you can’t deny that a child accessing other children, other adults and learning to socialise is a clear benefit of schooling.”Explore more on these topicsSchoolsOfstedWorking from homeChildrenEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The report suggests a smaller number of voting hubs, some located in populated areas such as shopping centres.These could have shorter hours, but people could vote at any centre in their local council area. The report also suggests moving from holding elections on a Thursday to weekends, as happens in most other European countries. This would also mean schools used as polling stations would not need to close.Another problem highlighted in the report is the growth of postal voting, which the AEA says is “the biggest threat to the safe and secure delivery of any election”.Before last July’s general election, there were about 1.3m new postal vote applications, it said, which “overwhelmed many electoral registration officers and their teams” who were also trying to manage new voter registrations.The organisation has called for the deadline to apply for a postal vote to be extended from 11 working days before the poll to 16.On voter ID, the report suggests expanding the narrow list of eligible documents – something the government is looking at – and consider allowing digital forms of ID.More widely, it called for a royal commission or a similar process to examine how election processes could be improved.Peter Stanyon, the AEA’s chief executive, said: “Constant electoral change without fundamental reform has made elections harder than ever to deliver to the standard voters rightly expect.“With votes from [age] 16 coming to England and UK polls and changes in devolved nations, we can’t continue bolting 21st century voter expectations on to 19th century infrastructure. The risk of failure increases with every change made.”Explore more on these topicsElectoral reformElections pastnewsShareReuse this content"

It is concerned that the Labour government is turning to a select group of private equity-backed developers for a quick fix to the housing crisis.In a report,Open for Business or Up for Sale, the thinktank says a boom in developments designated for renters is being backed by “profit-seeking institutional investors”, often based overseas. Common Wealth said its research showed that four of the top five operators were backed by private equity funds and several were based abroad.The sector could be at the heart of Labour’s housing plans tobuild at least 1.5m homesby the end of the parliament.Corporate landlords could be given a large slice of land in Labour’s12 new towns, allowing them to deliver as much as a fifth of the expected 10,000 properties in each location.Almost 90% of BTR properties are occupied by couples and flatshares, or single individuals rather than families, the report says.This compares with the private rented sector as a whole, where one in four households are families. Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds and Wakefield are among the cities with the highest concentration of BTR.“Housing in the sector also skews toward households on above-average and higher incomes, with industry data showing households in BTR are much more likely to be on incomes of over £68,000 a year than the average for the private rental sector,” the report says.In the top five BTR groups are Greystar Europe, Get Living, Simple Life Homes, Quintain Living and the L&Q PRS, a subsidiary of the social housing provider London and Quadrant.Simple Life Homes, which is owned by Sigma Capital, has several developments in the UK, including one- to three-bedroom homes available at its Albion Homes site in Salford, Greater Manchester. The housebuilder also manages private estates in Kent, Derbyshire and Devon.Ministers are known to favour handing over large tracts of development land to the new breed of corporate landlords in order to speed up the delivery of new housing.Advertising newly built rental properties and signing contracts with tenants can take months rather than the years it takes to sell homes on sites of more than 500 dwellings.The arrival of renters in large numbers on a site in the early stages of a development encourages the providers of amenities such as schools, doctors’ surgeries and shops to open premises earlier and not wait several years until the development is sold to individual buyers.Homes in BTR developments are constructed for the private rental sector and units are not for sale to individual buyers. Buildings are owned by one single owner or consortium, typically institutional investors.BTR developers are often criticised for drip-feeding properties into the local market to maintain prices.According to estate agent Savills, BTR housing stock stood at 105,000 homes at the end of 2023 from a private rented housing stock of about 5m homes.Marcus Dixon, head of research at real estate advisers JLL, said it was likely that foreign-backed funds were early adopters in the UK because their home markets in the US and continental Europe already had large institutional rental sectors.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said in many cases “houses would remain unbuilt were it not for the intervention of us and others like us”.He added: “Anecdotally, the homes delivered for us are typically the first to be built on a site and provide a much quicker sense ofplacemaking… Families with children constitute approximately 50% of our residents.”Sumner said the firm mainly built suburban homes for families, recognising that there was “a whole section of society who were too economically active to qualify for social provision but not in a position to be able to gather sufficient funds for a purchase deposit. And why should they have to settle for inferior quality housing stock?”Two-income households need social housing too. Here’s whyRead moreA spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing,Communitiesand Local Government said: “We do not recognise these claims, and have committed to delivering a gold standard of 40% genuinely affordable housing for new towns, with a focus on social rent homes.”Common Wealth said in its report: “The UK is in the midst of an unrelenting housing crisis, weighed down by issues of unaffordability, insecurity and inaccessibility. Along with falling home ownership, these conditions are leaving the UK with an ever-expanding private rental sector where profit-seeking institutional investors are both an important and rapidly growing presence.”It said ministers should seek to control the profits made by BTR developers on land designated by the public sector for housing.Explore more on these topicsHousing marketThe ObserverHousingSocial housingReal estateConstruction industryCommunitiesPrivate equitynewsShareReuse this content"

A specialist liaison CPS prosecutor in the United States has been working with international partners to obtain material which may be relevant. We are thankful to the US Department of Justice and the FBI for their ongoing assistance, and the importance which they have placed upon our request.”According to reports, investigators hope to recover deleted searches from Rudakubana’s Google and Microsoft accounts within weeks.Rudakubana fatally stabbed Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine, at a dance class at the Hart Space in Southport just after 11am on 29 July last year.Police discovered a number of devices during a search of Rudakubana’s home in Banks, Lancashire, after the attack, but he had deleted his internet history 10 minutes before he left home to carry out the killings.A search on X made minutes before he left home, about the stabbing of Mar Mari Emmanuel, a bishop who was injured in a terrorist knife attack on an Australian church in April last year, was the only thing that remained, police have said.It is believed the data could hold vital clues about why he targeted the dance class for young girls five miles from his home. Officers believe he must have seen the class advertised, but they have been unable to prove their theory.He bought the 20cm (8in) kitchen knife used in the attack on Amazon days after the class was advertised on 7 July.To uncover what Rudakubana had been searching for in the days and months before the attack, detectives said they had to go through Microsoft, which owns the search engine Bing, and Google, which owns the browser Chrome. Both are US companies.The senior investigating officer, DCI Jason Pye,previously saidthe process of retrieving the information was ongoing and that it could take years.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The murders were not declared terrorism because police have been unable to find any clear evidence that they were carried out to advance any political, religious or ideological cause.“Our case has always been, based on the evidence, it’s not counter-terrorism.

Those communities are still healing from that violence and part of the response to the violence should be on creating integrated communities.“Labelling refugees, who through no fault of their own have had to put their lives at risk on flimsy vessels, or have had to hide in the backs of lorries to reach safety on our shores, as a type of second-class individual will simply breed division and distrust. It risks playing into a toxic politics that pits ‘us vs them’ and is then manipulated by the far right to bring hate and disorder to our streets.”Theletter adds that Tony Blair’s government – in which Cooper was a minister – recognised the importance of citizenship “in fostering integration, and the proportion of refugees applying for citizenship was a key indicator for the strategy”.Other signatories include the heads of the Refugee Council, Islamic Relief UK and the Chartered Institute of Housing; and other faith leaders such as rabbis from the Conference of Liberal Rabbis and Cantors, the president and vice-president of the Methodist Conference and the general secretary of the Baptist Union.The letter adds: “When refugees become citizens, they feel a greater sense of belonging as full members of their communities with a stable future for themselves, their children and generations to come.”An update to the Home Office’s guidance for caseworkers states that anyone applying for British citizenship from last Monday who arrived in the UK illegally “will normally be refused, regardless of the time that has passed since the illegal entry took place”.The Refugee Council said it could bar 71,000 people who had successfully applied for asylum from claiming UK citizenship. Colin Yeo, a leading immigration barrister, said it was a breach of international law.On Wednesday the former home secretary David Blunkett was granted a rare urgent question in the House of Lords on the topic.He asked: “Will [the minister on duty] ask the home secretary to reflect on the societal and cohesion aspects of this policy, the impact on children and their right to UK citizenship and the statelessness which would arise for individuals if their birth country refused to renew or retain their nationality?”He added: “Surely this parliament should have a say in such a big change.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “There are longstanding rules that can prevent those arriving illegally from gaining citizenship. The government is strengthening these measures to make it clear that anyone who enters the UK illegally, including small boat arrivals, faces having a British citizenship application refused.”Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumLabourYvette CooperUnisonTrade unionsRefugeesnewsShareReuse this content"

And as an all-round communicator on the game he was even nearer the pinnacle.He spent 20 years on the Guardian and was shaped by this newspaper, and another six close to home on the Observer. In time he worked for every newspaper company at the respectable end of Fleet Street and built a new career as a pundit on Sky TV that made him instantly recognisable to supporters inside the grounds.But he had talked about football pretty much all his life. It is rare to find a journalist quite so in love with his speciality. His insights into the game allowed him to be taken seriously by managers and the hierarchy. Yet he could also chat about anything to anyone else, and talk hind legs off donkeys, too, without – except when he moaned about subeditors – ever becoming a bore. Even his latter-day TV fan base, calling, if he passed by, “Oi, Paddy, what did you make of that?” would get a proper answer. He was “Paddy” to just about everyone, and he is irreplaceable.View image in fullscreenPatrick Barclay, left, with Wayne Rooney.Photograph: PA Images/AlamyHe was born in London toGuy Deghy, a Hungarian-born actor, and Patricia. The relationship did not last, and both Patricia and Paddy soon moved to Dundee, where they took the name Barclay. The boy soon acquired, and never lost, both a Scottish accent and a love for Dundee FC (not to be confused with Dundee United) who, when he was 14, gave him the thrill of winning the Scottish League for the first and last time. Two years later he left High School of Dundee and became a trainee on the local Evening Telegraph. Thus began a tortuous journey vaguely in the directions of both the south and the top.He was still barely out of his teens when he got a job as a subeditor on the Guardian in Manchester. But bylines were hard to come by in his first nine years, at least in the London edition.The first mention of Patrick Barclay in the digital files came in 1971 for a match report from Old Trafford, when Matt Busby had a brief reprise as manager and a forward line includingBest,CharltonandLawlost 2-1 to Derby. Five years later, Paddy finally won promotion and became the northern football correspondent, making him No 2 toDavid Lacey.View image in fullscreenPatrick Barclay, left, with Gordon Banks.Photograph: PA Images/AlamyBut, for Paddy, this was still frustrating. Lacey would be in place as a star turn for another 27 years, and the sports desk’s Monday conferences were relayed to Manchester on a primeval squawk box, making it difficult for him to make constructive interventions.By 1986 he was desperate enough to take the first chance to become a No 1, when Eddy Shah opened a shortlived tabloid, Today (Lacey’s parting comment was: “It’s the end of an earache”). But then came the Independent, which was an immediate – if also not eternal – success. Paddy switched horses and reached for the sky.Lacey’s great gift was to make football writing entertaining and witty enough to attract readers who had little interest in the game. Barclay spoke directly to the fan base, and as football recovered from the hooligan-haunted 1980s to become bigger than ever, his restless mind led him towards the future.In 1989, when the European Cup final was an un-enticing match-up between Milan and Steaua Bucharest, other British writers stayed at home and watched on television; Paddy turned up – making contacts, talking, listening.In 1992, by which time he was on the Observer, with a lighter workload than on a daily paper, he went to the African Nations’ Cup, the only frontline British journalist in sight. This was two years after Cameroon almost beat England in the World Cup: “For a time,” Barclay wrote of that, “Cameroon treated England like a chainsaw would a balsa canoe.” Now he gave himself and his readers a masterclass on the development of African football.In 1996, having jumped to the Sunday Telegraph, he was in his element when Scotland played England in the 1996 Euros at Wembley. Scotland’s sense of superiority, he explained without any partisanship, was rooted in the 19th century, when they beat England far more often than not.“That was an era in which Scots took the role filled today by the wily continentals; they administered lessons in technique, and that was why English clubs started to lure them south. They could pass and dribble. The English seemed to treat football as just another reason to crash into each other.”Whichever paper he was playing for – and a stint on the Times and a column in the Evening Standard lay ahead – he was beloved and respected by colleagues. “He had effortless charm,” said Jeff Powell, doyen of the Daily Mail. “He had a good eye, understood what he saw, judged players well and wrote interestingly without being extravagant.”Amy Lawrence, who covers Arsenal for the Athletic and became a staunch friend, said: “He was such a purist, a romantic and a man of principle about the game. He was enchanted by football and he really wanted it to be dazzling and amazing and food for the soul.”Small wonder that a pall hung over every football press box this weekend.Paddy wrote four books about football managers: Busby, José Mourinho, Alex Ferguson and the Arsenal manager of the 30s, Herbert Chapman.He is survived by two children, Jennifer and Duncan.Patrick Barclay, journalist, born 15 August 1947; died 12 February 2025Explore more on these topicsSportNewspapersSky SportsThe GuardianThe ObserverDundee (UK news)Dundee (Football)obituariesShareReuse this content"

I find it very astonishing.”Nnamdi, a dual national and father of two, had been wanted by Nigerian authorities since 2015 after setting up a digital radio station, Radio Biafra, at his London home around the time when mass Biafra secessionist protests erupted in Nigeria for the first time since thecivil war.He fled while on bail in 2017, after Nigerian security forces stormed his residence in Nigeria in an operation coded “Python Dance”, according to court documents. At least 28 members of Ipob were killed.In 2021, Nnamdi was arrested by Nigerian authorities in Kenya and taken to Nigeria in an act of extraordinary rendition – an unlawful inter-state transfer – family, lawyers, the UN and a Nigerian court have said. He has since pleaded not guilty to 15 criminal charges relating to terrorism and treason, seven of which he still faces.The British government faced a legal challenge from Kingsley Kanu over itshandling of the case, which was ultimately dismissed. However, the judge found, citing the Nigerian court, that Nnamdi had been subject to extraordinary rendition, despite the refusal by a number of former foreign secretaries to take such a view.In 2023, a UK court of appealjudgmentsaid the government position “might well be different” if the Nigerian supreme court upheld a ruling by the Nigerian court of appeal that Nnamdi had been extraordinarily rendered.Despite the Nigerian supreme court now having done this, Kingsley said the government had turned its back on his brother. He said the Nigerian supreme court ruling in December 2023 provided a clear route for the UK government to take action. But Kingsley has yet to hear from Starmer, the fourth prime minister during the period of his brother’s detention.A spokesperson for the Foreign Office said: “We are providing consular support to Mr Kanu and remain in contact with his family and legal representatives. We have raised his case with the Nigerian authorities.”Nnamdi has monthly consular visits, according to his brother, who is able to communicate with him through lawyers and his younger brother. His family and lawyers have previously raised concerns over Nnamdi’s treatment after he has been held largely in solitary confinement, in poor conditions and without access to medical treatment for a heart condition.“The high court and Nigeria have spoken,” Kingsley said. “We have to stand on that, we have to implement that.”The Nigerian embassy has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsNigeriaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It argues that universities have had to hire 18 extra staff on average to meet the current regulations, with the OfS’s plans to expand its powers creating further expenses during the financial crisis within higher education.Three in four England universities expected to be in the red next yearRead moreVivienne Stern, UUK’s chief executive, said: “The regulator should bear in mind that increasing regulatory burden means increasing the amount of time and money that universities have to spend on regulatory demands, rather than frontline teaching and support for students.“We need a streamlined and efficient regulator, which works to support universities to manage the pressures they face. You can’t regulate your way out of a financial crisis.”Josh Fleming, the OfS’s director of strategy and delivery, said: “Our proposed new strategy sharpens the OfS’s focus on the quality of higher education and the financial resilience of the sector. It also prioritises the non-academic features of higher education – such as the prevention of harassment and sexual misconduct – which can have a significant impact on students’ experiences.“We’ve worked with students and the sector to form these proposals, through events, focus groups and polling. We’re now consulting on them to test our thinking and make sure we end up with a strategy that supports a higher education sector that enables students to thrive while studying and beyond.”The OfS was founded in 2017 and regulates more than 400 higher education providers in England. OfS registration is needed to qualify for student loans, and for universities to receive teaching grants, award degrees and sponsor international student visas.In 2023 the OfS wascriticised by the House of Lords industry and regulators committeefor its “burdensome” data requirements, lack of focus and a “distant and combative” relationship with universities.Anindependent reviewlast year by David Behan – later appointed as the OfS’s interim chair by the education secretary, Bridget Phillipson – echoed vice-chancellors’ concerns over the “disproportionate” fee structure that made OfS membership far cheaper by student for larger providers.OfSannual feesare based on bands of student numbers. A small provider, such as the National Film and Television School, pays £100 for each of its more than 400 full-time students, while the Courtauld Institute of Art pays £92 and the Royal College of Music £62 a student. But large institutions such as the University of Manchester and University College London pay less than £5 a student.UUK said: “Given the potential increase in regulatory burden implied by a strategy in which no current activity is set to be stopped but more activity introduced, smaller and specialist providers may be particularly at risk of having to absorb additional costs.”The OfS said its registration fees were “a matter for government”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This means per-head calculations are misleading.”The OfS strategy document widens the regulator’s powers to include oversight of overseas campuses. But university leaders who spoke to the Guardian said the OfS “can barely manage effective regulation in England, let alone the rest of the world”, as well as taking responsibility for new laws over free speech on campus.The OfS also wants to create a new “quality risk register” for individual institutions, which sector leaders say is ill-defined and could be better achieved using existing structures.Since December the OfS hassuspended workon vetting new providers in order to concentrate on financial oversight, a movederided by the former universities minister Jo Johnson, who said the OfS “should be able to walk and chew gum”.UUK welcomed the OfS’s greater priority on financial oversight but added: “We are not convinced the financial reality is sufficiently reflected in the detail of the proposed strategy and in OfS’s planned activity. It needs to prioritise its work, be reasonable in its expectations, and minimise any additional regulatory costs.”Explore more on these topicsHigher educationOffice for StudentsStudentsUniversity leadershipHigher education policyRegulatorsUniversitiesnewsShareReuse this content"

It was not clear whether FDA employees who review drugs were exempted.US Forest Service and National Park Service to fire thousands of workersRead moreOn Friday, the US Department ofHealthand Human Services announced plans to fire 5,200 probationary employees across its agencies, which include the National Institutes of Health, the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.People who spoke with the AP on condition of anonymity on Friday said the number of probationary employees to be laid off at the CDC would total nearly 1,300. But as of early Sunday afternoon, about 700 people had received notices, according to three people who spoke on condition on anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. They said none of the CDC layoffs affected the doctors and researchers who track diseases in what’s known as the Epidemic Intelligence Service.The FDA is headquartered in theMarylandsuburbs outside Washington DC and employs nearly 20,000 people. It’s long been a target of newly sworn-in health secretary Robert Kennedy Jr, who last year accused the agency of waging a “war on public health” for not approving unproven treatments such as psychedelics, stem cells and chelation therapy.Kennedy also has called for eliminating thousands of chemicals and colorings from US foods. But the cuts at FDA include staffers responsible for reviewing the safety of new food additives and ingredients, according to an FDA staffer familiar with the firings.An HHS spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sunday afternoon.Nearly half of the FDA’s $6.9bn budget comes from fees paid by companies the agency regulates, including drug and medical device makers, which allows the agency to hire extra scientists to swiftly review products. Eliminating those positions will not reduce government spending.A former FDA official said cutting recent hires could backfire, eliminating staffers who tend to be younger and have more up-to-date technical skills. The FDA’s workforce skews toward older workers who have spent one or two decades at the agency, and the Government Accountability Office noted in 2022 that the FDA “has historically faced challenges in recruiting and retaining” staff due to better money in the private sector.Trump administration fires 20 immigration judges with no explanationRead more“You want to bring in new blood,” said Peter Pitts, a former FDA associate commissioner under George W Bush. “You want people with new ideas, greater enthusiasm and the latest thinking in terms of technology.”Mitch Zeller, former FDA director for tobacco, said the firings are a way to “demoralize and undermine the spirit of the federal workforce”.“The combined effect of what they’re trying to do is going to destroy the ability to recruit and retain talent,” Zeller said.The FDA’s inspection force has been particularly strained in recent years after a wave of departures during the Covid-19 pandemic, and many of the agency’s current inspectors are recent hires. It was not immediately clear whether those employees were exempted.FDA inspectors are responsible for overseeing thousands of food, drug, tobacco and medical device facilities worldwide, though the AP reported last year that the agency faced a backlog of roughly 2,000 uninspected drug facilities that hadn’t been visited since before the pandemic.The agency’s inspection force have also been criticized for not moving faster to catch recent problems involving infant formula, baby food and eyedrops.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationFood & drink industryDonald TrumpUS politicsMarylandHealthCoronavirusnewsShareReuse this content"

No member of Hamas would sit on the committee. But the future military status of Hamas within Gaza is unresolved, which is likely to be a barrier to Israeli endorsement of the plan.Arab states – principally the United Arab Emirates and Qatar – are preparing to make financial offers to fund reconstruction, but on the basis that Palestinians are given the right to remain inGazaand are not forced to seek temporary or permanent refuge in Egypt or Jordan. Reconstruction would take three to five years, with 65% of the property in Gaza having been destroyed.European sources admit the issue of providing security guarantees to Israel for Gaza remains unresolved since no Arab country is willing to offer troops in the absence of Israel offering a clear political horizon to a Palestinian state.An Arab summit is due to be held in Riyadh on 27 February at which an alternative to the Trump plan for Gaza is due to be discussed and parts of it revealed.So far Saudi Arabia has not explicitly called forHamasto be excluded from the reconstruction process or governance of Gaza, but Anwar Gargash, a UAE senior diplomatic adviser, praised a recent call from Ahmed Aboul Gheit, the secretary general of the Arab League, for Hamas to step down from the administration of Gaza as “appropriate and rational”.Aboul Gheit said: “The interests of the Palestinian people must come before the interests of the movement [Hamas], especially in light of the calls to displace Palestinians from Gaza, and the resulting war that destroyed the Gaza Strip and tore apart its human and social fabric as a result of its decisions.”He also told the World Governments Summit last week that Trump’s proposal to move the roughly 2 million Palestinians out of Gaza would push the region into a cycle of crises with a damaging effect on peace and stability. “It’s unacceptable for the Arab world, which has fought this idea for 100 years,” he said.It is expected that the committee proposed in the Arab plan would include independent technocrats and representatives of civil society and unions, to ensure that no single faction dominates.Even moderate Arab diplomats say the Trump plan is neither practical nor morally right, but one said: “We have to engage with it and if possible divert people away from it.” A second Arab source said: “A lot of it sounds far-fetched, such as converting Hamas tunnels into a metro network. The idea came out of the blue.”The Palestinian Authority (PA), which governs the West Bank, has not endorsed the committee plan, fearing it could presage a permanent division between the West Bank and Gaza through two separate administrative systems.Jibril Rajoub, of Fatah, which dominates the PA, said the group refused to discuss the idea of the committee, describing it as “a prelude to consecrating division”, and he stressed adherence to what he called “the unity of the government and the regime”.The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, has not ruled out an alternative to the Trump plan but said: “Any plan that leaves Hamas in the Gaza Strip will be a problem, because Israel will not tolerate that,” and thus would be a return to square one.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warHamasPalestinian territoriesIsraelEgyptMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

I do not know when he prepares it,” Zelenskyy said. “But it will happen. And at that moment, knowing that he did not succeed in occupying us, we do not know where he will go.”Zelenskyy added that he believed Putin’s next targets could be Poland and Lithuania – which were occupied during the second world war by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union – “because we believe that [Russian president] Putin will wage war against Nato”, the international military alliance formally known as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.Macron convenes European leaders for Ukraine summit amid tension with USRead moreZelenskyy said he had viewed documents indicating that Putin was “preparing to train 150,000 people” in Belarus, a staunch ally of Moscow – and that he had shared that intelligence with allies.The Russian leader, Zelenskyy said, wanted to “show it for the world that it is just training” and would claim “that these are exercises that are always ongoing” in Belarus.“But it’s not truth,” Zelenskyy said. “From such point, he began the occupation [of Ukraine] three years ago. Full-scale war he began from some symbolic trainings. The missiles the first night flew from Belarus, and the invasion came from Belarus.”Zelenskyy insisted he still had trust in Donald Trump’s ability to negotiate with Russia after beginning his second US presidency in January. But Zelenskyy said he would not accept any peace agreement that excluded Ukraine from the negotiating table. He also said that some of the “messages” coming from the US in recent days, such as Vice-President JD Vance’s speech in Munichdenouncing European leaders, and Trump’s comment that Ukraine “may be Russian some day”, were “a disappointment”.In a recentexclusive interview with the Guardian, Zelenskyy stressed that Europe could not guarantee Ukraine’s security without US help – and he returned to the theme in his Meet the Press interview.“There is no leader in the world who can really make a deal with Putin without us about us,” he said, speaking in English.“Of course, the US can have a lot of decisions, economical partnerships, etc. We’re not happy with it, but they can have [them] with [the] Russians. But not about this war without us.“There are messages, which, you know, make disappointment for a lot of leaders ofEurope, because they also feel sometimes that they are out of decisions.“They have to be in unity with the US otherwise, not only [can the] US lose Europe as a strategic partner, Europe also can lose the US.”His comments mirrored the alarm of European leaders at the US’s backpedalling over support for Ukraine, and Trump’s cozying up to Putin in a recent phone call, which many have portrayedas a capitulation.In advance of Vance’s divisive speech at the Munich Security Conference, European powers including Britain, France and Germany said there could beno lasting peace in Ukrainewithout their participation in peace talks.After it, some, including the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz,took Vance to taskfor his comments questioning the future of the decades-old US-European alliance. Scholz also accused the US of “unacceptable interference” in its upcoming election after praise from Vance and the billionaire Elon Musk, Trump’s “special government employee”, for the far-right nationalist party AfD.Zelenskyy, who in Munich on Saturdaycalled for the formation of an armed forces of Europe, told NBC that any weakening of US support for Europe or Nato would open the door to Putin’s plans for a territory grab.“What is he waiting for? For a weakening ofNatoby, for instance, policy of the US, that the US will think to take its military from Europe,” he said.“Yes, Putin thinks of that. But I will believe that the US will not take its forces, its contingents from Europe, because that will severely weaken Nato and the European continent. Putin definitely counts on that, and the fact that we receive information that he will think of the invasion against former Soviet republics.“The risk that Russia will occupy Europe is 100%, not all Europe, they will begin [with] those countries who are our friends, small countries who’ve been in the USSR, in the Soviet Union. Forgive me, but today these are Nato countries.”Explore more on these topicsVolodymyr ZelenskyyNatoUkraineRussiaEuropeDonald TrumpVladimir PutinnewsShareReuse this content"

We hope to be provided the opportunity to review the files as a family prior to its public release.”However, according to a White House official speaking to Axios, theTrump administrationrefused that request from King’s family, though it claimed the refusal did not stem from “animus toward the family”.Speaking to the outlet, a second source who spoke with one of King’s two surviving adult children said that “there are deep concerns” within the family over the ordered release.“They know the right wing wants to smear Dr King, and one way to do it is by putting these smears in the public under the guise of transparency. If there are assassination records, release those. But smears are not assassination records,” the source told Axios.King dedicated his life’s work to advancing civil rights across the United States before assassin James Earl Ray fatally shot him at the Lorraine motel in Memphis, Tennessee, on 4 April 1968.A 2020 documentary by US film-maker Sam Pollard titledMLK/FBIexplores the agency’s pursuit of King via state-sanctioned surveillance.Explore more on these topicsMartin Luther KingTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsJohn F KennedyRobert F Kennedy JrnewsShareReuse this content"

Rubio and Netanyahu blamed Iran for the violence in the Middle East and insisted Tehran would be stopped from developing nuclear weapons.Trump’s shock proposal earlier this month for a “Riviera of the Middle East” has been condemned around the world as a blueprint for ethnic cleansing, but Rubio and Netanyahu insisted it would proceed.“We discussed Trump’s bold vision for Gaza’s future and will work to ensure that vision becomes a reality,” Netanyahu told reporters after the meeting, which overran by an hour. “We have a common strategy, and we can’t always share the details of this strategy with the public”.He did say, however, that it included opening “the gates of hell” on Gaza, a phrased used by Trump, if all the Israeli hostages held by Hamas and other militant groups were not released.Rubio promoted the Trump plan as a breakthrough. “It may have shocked and surprised many,” he said. “But what cannot continue is the same cycle where we repeat over and over again and wind up in the exact same place.”Neither Rubio nor Netanyahu answered questions at their press event in Jerusalem. Israel’s finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, said on Saturday night that he hoped the mass transfer of Palestinians from Gaza endorsed by Trump could begin soon. He said he expected Palestinians would be forced to leave by a resumption of bombing.“It’s a process I hope will begin in the coming weeks,” he told Israel’s Channel 12. “Even if it’s slow at first, it will gradually pick up pace and intensify. There won’t be anything for the Gazans in Gaza for the next 10 to 15 years. After we go back to fighting, and all of Gaza looks like Jabaliya, there definitely will be nothing for them there.”Smotrich was referring to Jabaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza, which was flattened by blanket bombing during 15 months of conflict.View image in fullscreenThe destruction caused by Israel’s attacks on Jabaliya in northern Gaza.Photograph: Abed Hajjar/APHe said that ultimately the vast majority of Palestinians would want to leave, and that the challenges for Israel would be finding countries willing and able to take 2 million Palestinians, coupled with “the huge logistical operation to get such vast numbers of people out of here”.The planned removal of Palestinians from Gaza is a potential crime against humanity. The international court of justice is already examining allegations of genocide against Israel, and the international criminal court (ICC) has issued arrest warrants against Netanyahu and his former defence minister, Yoav Gallant, for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza.Netanyahu denounced both courts for what he called “lawfare”, thanked theTrump administrationfor placing sanctions on the ICC, and suggested more joint action against international judicial institutions was being planned.“The secretary and I discussed working together to formulate a common strategy to deal with the threat of lawfare and neutralise this threat once and for all,” he said.Neither Netanyahu nor Rubio addressed the terms of the Gaza ceasefire, other than to demand the return of all hostages. The Israeli prime minister depends on Smotrich’s party for his governing coalition to survive, and the latter restated his opposition to the current deal and his desire to see it collapse.“The current deal is bad but I very much hope it is temporary,” Smotrich said in his Saturday night interview.The Israeli government is reportedly seeking to change theterms of the agreementwith Washington’s backing. It is calling for the six surviving hostages who remain in Gaza scheduled to be released in the first phase of the agreement to be freed all at once next Saturday, rather than in two groups of three over the final two weeks of the first phase, which ends on 1 March.Netanyahu’s office said on Sunday he had told US Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, that Israel’s security cabinet would convene on Monday to discuss the second phase. The agreement had envisaged the talks would start in the first week of February, but he had so far prevented negotiators from discussing the issue.Israeli political analysts say he fears that the implementation of the second phase could trigger the collapse of his coalition, leading to new elections and increasing his legal jeopardy in his trial on corruption charges.In an embodiment of the Trump administration’s unconditional support for Israel, a shipment of US-made heavy bombs arrived in the port of Ashdod on Saturday night.The Biden administration had suspended delivery of the 2,000lb (907kg) MK-84 bombs on the grounds that they were too indiscriminate and could cause too many civilian casualties in a densely populated area such as Gaza. Trump immediately lifted the ban when he assumed office.The Israeli defence minister, Israel Katz, said in a statement on Sunday morning: “The munitions shipment that arrived in Israel tonight, released by the Trump administration, represents a significant asset for the air force and the IDF, and serves as further evidence of the strong alliance between Israel and the United States.”At Sunday’s press statement in Jerusalem, Netanyahu and Rubio began their presentations on Iran, which they said was primarily responsible for all the instability and violence in the region. Netanyahu said they agreed that Tehran could never have nuclear weapons and that “Iran’s aggression in the region has to be rolled back”.“There can never be a nuclear Iran, a nuclear Iran that could then hold itself immune from pressure and from action. That can never happen,” Rubio said. “Behind every terrorist group, behind every act of violence, behind every destabilising activity, behind everything that threatens peace and stability for the millions of people who call this region home, is Iran.”During Trump’s first administration, Netanyahu failed to convince him to participate in joint strikes against Iran’s nuclear programme, but the heightened rhetoric of the new administration has raised questions about whether the Israeli prime minister might succeed this time.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warIsraelUS foreign policyMarco RubioTrump administrationPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

The man was arrested just after the attack, which was stopped when a fellow Syrian, a food delivery driver, rammed a car into the suspected assailant.A 14-year-old boy died and five other males were hurt, two of them seriously. Among the wounded are two 15-year-old teenagers, police said.The suspect is an asylum seeker with a valid residence permit and no criminal record, according to police.On Sunday, people placed candles in front of shops in the street where the attack took place in the centre of Villach, a city in Carinthia province.Tanja Planinschek, a local person, said: “I am afraid for my children. I am afraid for those around me. I fear for the future. I fear where this will lead. I am endlessly sad.“Not only I, but all of us have been afraid for a long time that something bigger will happen,” she said, adding that the country “should open our eyes and see who we let in, who we help, who we leave with all kinds of freedoms. If nothing is done, it will get even worse.”The food delivery driver who rammed his car into the attacker was slightly hurt, police said.The Krone tabloid quoted the driver, Alaaeddin Alhalabi, 42, as saying: “I saw a person lying on the ground, a man was attacking other passersby – I didn’t think twice and drove at him.“He wanted to go towards the city centre, there were children on the street – I couldn’t let that happen,” he said, adding that he regretted he could not save the 14-year-old.The Carinthia governor, Peter Kaiser of the Social Democrats, called for the “harshest consequences” for this “unbelievable atrocity”.The far-right leader Herbert Kickl, whose party topped September’s national elections for the first time, said he was “appalled” by the attack and called for “a rigorous clampdown on asylum”.Kickl’s Freedom party this week failed in talks to form a government with the runner-up and incumbent conservatives because of disagreements including over who would hold sensitive cabinet posts dealing with security.Austria has a large Syrian refugee population of almost 100,000 people. After Bashar al-Assad was ousted from power in Syria in December, Austria and several European countries froze pending asylum requests from Syrians to reassess the situation.Austria has also stopped family reunifications and sent at least 2,400 letters to revoke refugee status. The interior ministry has said it is preparing “an orderly repatriation and deportation programme to Syria”.Austria has previously had one jihadist attack, in 2020, when a convicted IS sympathiser went on a shooting rampage in downtown Vienna, killing four.On Thursday in Munich, Germany, a man rammed a car into people,killing a two-year-old girl and her motherand wounding 37 other people.A 24-year-old Afghan asylum seeker was arrested on suspicion of deliberately driving the car into a trade union march. German police said he may have had Islamist extremist motives.Explore more on these topicsAustriaIslamic StateEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Navalny’s work was all the more brave,” Scholz said in a social media post. “His courage made a difference and reaches far beyond his death.”Kaja Kallas, the EU’s foreign policy chief, said Putin bore “ultimate responsibility” for Navalny’s death. Navalny “gave his life for a free and democratic Russia”, she said, calling for the release of all political prisoners in the country.“As Russia intensifies its illegal war of aggression against Ukraine, it also continues its internal repression, targeting those who stand for democracy,” Kallas said, adding that Navalny’s lawyers and “hundreds of others … remain unjustly imprisoned”.View image in fullscreenPeople queue to visit Navalny’s grave in Moscow.Photograph: Evgenia Novozhenina/ReutersIn a video released on Sunday, Navalnaya said opposition supporters “know why we are fighting: for a future Russia free, peaceful and beautiful. The one Alexei dreamed of is possible; do everything to make his dream come true.”Navalnaya, a leading figure in Russia’s weakened and fractured opposition, most of whose members are now in exile, accused Putin of trying to “erase our memory of Alexei’s name, of hiding the truth about his murder and forcing us to give up”.She said: “Everyone can do something: protest, write to political prisoners, change the minds of those close to you, support each other. Alexei inspires people … who understand that our country is not just about war, corruption and oppression.”The Observer view: A year on from his death, Alexei Navalny still shines bright in a dark land  | Observer editorialRead moreNavalny died aged 47 on 16 February last year in the Polar Wolf penal colony in Kharp, to where he had been transferred in 2023. He was arrested in 2021 after returning to Russia from medical treatment in Germany for novichok nerve agent poisoning.He was declared an “extremist” by Russian authorities, meaning anyone who mentions his name or that of his Anti-Corruption Foundation without also saying they are “extremist” can be fined or, for repeat offences, jailed for up to four years.Participation in an organisation designated as “extremist” is punishable by up to six years in prison, and even public displays of “symbols” of an extremist organisation – including photos of Navalny or his name – risk a fine or stint in a police cell.Despite posts on pro-Kremlin Telegram channels warning of “Big Brother and his ever-watchful eye” and including a photo of a security camera sign at the cemetery, several hundred people gathered at Borisovskoye on Sunday, an Agence France-Presse reporter said.Russia has never fully explained Navalny’s death, which came less than a month before a presidential election that extended Putin’s more than two-decade rule, saying only that it happened as he was walking in the prison yard.The opposition figurehead had continued to call for Russians to oppose the Kremlin and denounced Moscow’s Ukraine offensive, even from behind bars. “I took the decision not to be afraid,” he wrote in his autobiography published after his death.Explore more on these topicsAlexei NavalnyRussiaVladimir PutinEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Two years later he started hosting meetings in his home city for LGBTQ+ Muslims, who treated him like their community imam. “I opened my garage, put a carpet down and invited people to have tea and talk,” hetold the Guardianin 2022.In 2011 Hendricks bolstered his role as an imam figure by setting up a mosque space after a friend endured a local sermon condemning homosexuality. “I said, ‘Maybe it’s time we started our own space, so people can pray without being judged’.”He ran the Al-Ghurbaah mosque at Wynberg near his birthplace, Cape Town. The mosque provides “a safe space in which queer Muslims and marginalised women can practise Islam”, its website states.Hendricks, the subject of a 2022 documentary called The Radical, had previously alluded to threats against him.He told the Guardian he had been advised to hire bodyguards but said he never feared attacks and insisted that “the need to be authentic” was “greater than the fear to die”.Hendricks, who had worked as an Arabic language teacher and fashion designer, was 29 when he came out to his mother. Born into a Muslim family, he married a woman, had children, then divorced before revealing his sexuality to his family, eight years after his father died.South Africa has one of the world’s highest murder rates, with 28,000 murders in the year to February 2024, according to police data.Explore more on these topicsSouth AfricaIslamReligionAfricaLGBTQ+ rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

Last year,the city estimatedthat the migration crisis has cost New York $5bn in two years, and costs are expected to double in 2025.Last week, the justice department in Washington sent a proposal to New York’s southern district to shelve an indictment against Adams on corruption charges ofaccepting illegal campaign donationsin exchange for political favours, arguing that it would interfere with his ability to help the administration tackle illegal immigration.Democrats claimed the move amounted to using the law to influence an elected politician. It was characterised by one of Adams’ prosecutors as a “dismissal-with-leverage” proposal, a corrupt exchange for allowing federal agents to deport tens of thousands of migrants in the city against sanctuary city laws.Danielle Sassoon, acting US attorney in New York, said she could not “agree to seek a dismissal driven by improper considerations”, and resigned. Emil Bove, acting deputy US attorney general, accepted her resignation, alleging that she was “incapable of fairly and impartially” reviewing the case.Hochul said she was considering removing Adams as mayor over the alleged deal and claims Trump’s department of justice “is already showing they’re corrupt”. Homan called Hochul an “embarrassment” who “needs to be removed”. Progressive Bronx DemocratAlexandria Ocasio-Cortezsaid: “This corruption poses a real threat to the people of the city.”View image in fullscreenAdams leaving federal court in Manhattan after an appearance on 27 September 2024.Photograph: Yuki Iwamura/APThe escalating drama kicked off last month whenDamian Williams, the former Democrat prosecutor who brought corruption charges against Adams, wrote that New York was “being led with abroken ethical compass” – seemingly a reference to Adams.That was a red flag to the incoming administration, whose chief executive is still smarting over a state conviction on a scheme to obscure hush-money payments to a porn actor and an$83m civil judgmentfor defaming writer E Jean Carroll and has seemingly found an ally in the Democrat mayor.“We are living in an era where political favoritism overrides the legal process in pursuit of political gains. This marks a dangerous new phase where selective law enforcement, applied at whim, is a weapon,” saidMike Quinn, a lawyer involved in the drive to hold Sackler family members accountable for theopioid crisis.Adams, like Trump, claims the criminal actions brought against him are politically motivated. The two are growing closer, with Adams visiting Trump at his Florida estate.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Arecent pollahead of the Democrat primary in April had the mayor in third or fourth place, behind Trump’s arch enemyAndrew Cuomo, the former New York governor who resigned in 2021 amid asexual harassment scandal. Cuomo has not yet officially declared. In the running also isZohran Mamdani, a progressive Democrat, who has vowed to lower the cost of living for working-class New Yorkers.A poll last month found that 73% of likely primary voters held an “unfavorable” view of Adams, with fears about subway crime, highlighted in December when a homeless woman wasfatally set on firein a subway car, among the factors behind their dissatisfaction.“New Yorkers have the idea that the mayor turns on the lights in the morning and turns them off at night,” says Democrat consultant Hank Sheinkopf. “They instil in him tremendous values and powers. When he fails to meet them on either side of the aisle, people lose their minds, and that’s what’s happening inNew Yorkright now.”But Adams has scored some wins, including reducing a post-Covid rat infestation by introducing plastic rubbish bins. “Everybody wants the city to function, and if it doesn’t function it doesn’t really matter what your ideological bent is,” says Sheinkopf. “It’s about how the garbage gets picked up, how you don’t feel threatened by homeless people and how your life functions.”But the left also dislikes Adams as a matter of reflex. “It’s a natural response, because anything Trump touches is right by definition,” Sheinkopf points out.Eric Adams meets Trump ‘border tsar’ to discuss Ice plan for Rikers Island jailRead moreIf Adams loses the Democrat nomination, he could run as a Republican, much as three-term mayor Mike Bloomberg did in 2002. New York has only had four Republican mayors in a century, each one elected after a crisis.The crisis this time, says Sheinkopf, “is that New York is out of control. Corruption, crime and the sense that things have broken down.” But he doubts Adams is the one to fix it. “He created it, so it’s a hard sell”.One scenario, hinted at by City Hall insiders, is that under a deal to drop the Adams corruption charges, the mayor could then switch party in a bid to stop Trump’s arch enemy, Cuomo.Trump and Cuomo have fought bitterly over the years, including in 2019, when Trump called his brother Chris, a former CNN host, Fredo after the hapless brother inThe Godfather.“If I wasn’t governor of New York, I would have decked him. Period,” Cuomo said.Explore more on these topicsEric AdamsThe ObserverUS immigrationTrump administrationAndrew CuomoMigrationRepublicansUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He chose to paint it black.In contrast to recent appearances where the actorrode a Lime bike on the red carpetin London and wore a pink tracksuit in Berlin, this appearance was more low-key. He wore a black Bottega Veneta cropped jacket matched with trousers and shoes in the same colour.The colour choice chimed with a goth-tinged theme – lots of black, with added drama – that dominated the style at the award ceremony.Like other outfits on the promo tour for A Complete Unknown, Chalamet referenced an outfit worn by Dylan – his stylist Taylor McNeil shared the inspiration image on her Instagram account.View image in fullscreenCynthia Erivo wore a lace dress by Louis Vuitton.Photograph: Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty ImagesElsewhere on the red carpet, Zoe Saldana wore an evil queen-ish black gown with a frilled neckline made by Saint Laurent. If Cynthia Erivo’s Louis Vuitton lace dress was white, the extended bodice and pointy nails would have worked well at 80s goth club the Batcave, as would Gwendoline Christie’s long cobwebby plaits and black satin dress with torn sleeves made by Giles Deacon. The black and white cut-out dress, worn by designer Vera Wang with an oversized biker jacket, also worked here.View image in fullscreenJeff Goldblum wore a tuxedo covered with iridescent black and green feathers made by Loewe.Photograph: David Fisher/REX/ShutterstockIn menswear, meanwhile, Jeff Goldblum, attending the ceremony with his dancer wife Emilie Livingston, wore a tux with tails and a waistcoat covered with striking iridescent black and green feathers made by Loewe. A Real Pain star Will Sharpe, also in all black like Chalamet – but with added cool thanks to the classic movie star sunglasses – brought that ultimate goth signifier: black nail varnish.Of course, black wasn’t only used in a goth context. Black and white are always popular choices for the red carpet and this was definitely the case here, with actors like Adrien Brody, Orlando Bloom and Jesse Eisenberg wearing classic black tuxedos, and stars like Pamela Anderson and Mikey Madison wearing all white. Lupita Nyong’o and Selena Gomez also wore dresses that were black and white.View image in fullscreenDesigner Vera Wang wore an oversized black biker jacket.Photograph: Dave Benett/Max Cisotti/Getty ImagesElsewhere, fashion moments came with print and colour. Ariana Grande’s Louis Vuitton dress, with its oversized frilled pink skirt was sugary sweet, while Colman Domingo’s outfit – with scarf print lining and unbuttoned shirt, studded gloves and pointed shoes – was indisputably the menswear look of the night. Isabella Rossellini’s robe covered with roses was a grown-up take on comfort and Saoirse Ronan’s dress – another by Louis Vuitton – in the palest of aquamarine, was simply but extremely elegant.View image in fullscreenWill Sharpe, also in all black.Photograph: Anthony Harvey/REX/ShutterstockGoth fashion – which dates back to the 70s in the UK – has had something of a revival of late, with London labels like Dilara Findikoglu, Chopova Lowena and 16Arlington embracing the trend potentially due to new inspirations like thesmash hit Netflix series Wednesdayandthe first album in 16 yearsfrom goth stalwarts The Cure.The Grammyslast month also skewed towards a gothic aesthetic, with Miley Cyrus in black leather, Lady Gaga in an ornate black corset and – of course – Jaden Smith, in a black suit with a black castle hat covering his face. Whether or not this trend will carry over to the Oscars red carpet next month, remains to be seen.Explore more on these topicsBaftasAwards and prizesnewsShareReuse this content"

It is understood that the streamer has removed the film’s star from campaigning materials, will no longer provide funds for her to attend events and ceremonies, and is no longer in direct contact with her.Accepting the award for best supporting actress, Zoe Saldaña also thanked the film’s “wonderful cast” including Gascon.Gascón, who is the first out transgender actress to be Bafta- and Oscar-nominated for leading actress, was absent from the awards. This followed an apology that she hoped her “silence will allow the film to be appreciated for what it is, a beautiful ode to love and difference.”“It’s very hard for me to think back to the work I did with Karla Sofía,” Audiard said in an interview withDeadlineearlier this month. “The trust we shared, the exceptional atmosphere that we had on the set that was indeed based on trust.“And when you have that kind of relationship and suddenly you read something that that person has said, things that are absolutely hateful and worthy of being hated, of course that relationship is affected. It’s as if you fall into a hole. Because what Karla Sofía said is inexcusable.”When asked if he has spoken to her since, he responded at the time: “I haven’t spoken to her, and I don’t want to. She is in a self-destructive approach that I can’t interfere in, and I really don’t understand why she’s continuing.”After the tweets were discovered, Gascón initially went on the attack with multiple statements and an hour-long interview. While she has admitted to being “deeply sorry” she also called out a “campaign of hate and misinformation” that led to her being “harassed”.“She’s really playing the victim,” Audiard said in response. “She’s talking about herself as a victim, which is surprising. It’s as if she thought that words don’t hurt.”Emilia Pérez was nominated for 11 Baftas, including best director, best film, and film not in the English language. The film was alsocriticised heavily in Mexicoover issues of authenticity and taste, for which Audiard later apologised.In his speech on Sunday, Audiard also paid tribute to his fellow shortlisted directors. “From Ireland, India, Iran, or Brazil, we all try to talk about the world in our own way, with our own tools and sensibilities,” he said. “Through cinema, we weave narratives that try to push back the boundaries, to question a few conventions, even if that sometimes means breaking a few rules along the way.”Explore more on these topicsFilmEmilia PérezBaftasJacques AudiardAwards and prizesnewsShareReuse this content"

The film marks Universal’s 11th best opening, just behind Jurassic World Dominion.Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy review – giant laughs for Hugh Grant but weepie sequel is strangely dazedRead moreThe film, which opened alongside new titles such as Captain America: Brave New World, accounted for 45% of the UK box office take over the weekend, while exhibitor Everyman delivered their largest ever three-day opening, beating the record previously set by the most recent James Bond film, No Time to Die.However, while pre-sales werereported last week to have outstripped Barbie, in the end Michael Morris’s fourquel fell short of that £18.5m opening enjoyed by Greta Gerwig’s satire.Mad About the Boy, which sees Renée Zellweger’s heroine now widowed with two young children, and choosing between suitors Leo Woodall and Chiwetel Ejiofor, also opened strongly in territories such as Australia and Mexico, as well as across Europe. In the US, however, it has gone straight to streaming through Peacock.Explore more on these topicsFilmBridget Jones' DiaryRenée ZellwegerRomance filmsComedy filmsUniversal PicturesComedynewsShareReuse this content"

There are a number to his “child-friends” and their parents, often sending riddles and jokes and copies of books. Some shed light on Carroll’s interest in the theatre.There are also significant early editions, including the Alice books, The Hunting of the Snark and mathematical works. A copy of Alice’s Adventures Under Ground is inscribed to Alice’s mother by Carroll: “To her, whose children’s smiles fed the narrator’s fancy and were his rich reward: from the author. Xmas 1886.”Carroll is considered one of the best amateur photographers of his day and the donation includes more than 100 of his photographs. The subjects include his friends and noted figures such as the painter and poet Dante Gabriel Rossetti.View image in fullscreenAn original electrotype of the frontispiece for Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, 1887.Photograph: Christ Church/University of OxfordGabriel Sewell, the Christ Church college librarian, was taken aback when she received a brief email out of the blue from the US collector, who wrote: “I have decided to donate my Lewis Carroll collection. It includes more than 200 letters and 100 photographs plus many obscure printed items. Have you any interest?”The email was sent by Jon A Lindseth, a retired American businessman and philanthropist, collector and scholar.Sewell said: “It was a bit of a surprise. It’s an enormous collection. He’s incredibly generous. It would be impossible to make a collection like this nowadays without having an enormous amount of money.“Such material doesn’t come on to the market these days, and not all at once. When we’ve tried to buy Carroll photographs, we’ve never had enough money. They get snapped up by people with much deeper pockets.”She did not know Lindseth personally, but was aware that, over decades, he had built up a significant collection of material relating to Carroll, the pen name of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, whose professional life was spent chiefly as an academic, a mathematician and logician at Christ Church.View image in fullscreenA sketch by John Tenniel of Alice and the golden crown.Photograph: Christ Church/University of OxfordHaving excelled at the college as a student, he received its mathematical lectureship in 1855 and remained there in various capacities until his death in 1898. He even worked as its sub-librarian for a time.His friendship with Henry Liddell, the college’s dean, and his family, inspired him to write his famous children’s story, first told to Alice Liddell and her sisters on a boating trip in 1862.They were captivated by the little girl named Alice who goes looking for an adventure, and Alice asked him to write it down for her.The unpublished correspondence reflects Carroll’s frustration over the misuse of his pen name. In 1890, he fired off a letter to the bookseller Messrs H Sotheran in Manchester, who had listed Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, The Hunting of the Snark and Through the Looking-Glass in its catalogue, attributing them to “Carroll (Lewis, ie Rev CL Dodgson)”.Carroll wrote that the bookseller had inserted his name “in connection with books of which he has never claimed or acknowledged the authorship, + which no one has any right to attribute to him: he will be much obliged if they will forbear from doing this for the future”.There are also unpublished letters from Carroll to Edith Rix, whom he had tutored in logic. He reportedly regarded her as the cleverest woman he ever knew. She went on to study mathematics at the University of Cambridge and to work at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich. In 1886, he wrote to her: “I would love to write you a chatty letter, in answer to 2 or 3 of yours: but I’ve no time for this post, + won’t keep you longer waiting for answers to your mathematical questions …”Sewell said: “It is [at Christ Church] that [Carroll] produced the hundreds of letters, photographs and sketches that now return home as part of the remarkable collection expertly curated by Jon Lindseth.”Lindseth is a noted Carroll scholar, whose publications include Alice in a World of Wonderlands: The Translations of Lewis Carroll’s Masterpiece. He has also written for the journals of the Lewis Carroll Society and curated two Carroll exhibitions.Christ Church has long possessed one of the foremost Carroll archives. Sewell said: “With this unparalleled donation from Lindseth, however, there can be no doubt that the college is now the pre-eminent institutional collection of Carroll material in the UK.”She added: “[Lindseth] was very firm that he wanted it to come to the UK and he wanted it to be in Christ Church, where Carroll lived and worked … No other institution in the UK has a particularly big Carroll collection. All the big collections are in the States, and he wanted to remedy that.”Cataloguing and digitisation of the Lindseth Lewis Carroll collection has only just begun, but an exhibition displaying some of the most exceptional items is in Christ Church’s historicupper library until 17 April– the first time the collection has been displayed in the UK.Explore more on these topicsLewis CarrollUniversity of OxfordHeritagenewsShareReuse this content"

Folded into a slightly-too-small chair in the regal-looking cafe of north London’s St Pancras Renaissance hotel, he shakes his head in dismay, causing his mass of tight curls to jiggle. “Rooke. Is. Gay,” he slowly repeats when reminded of the three words that make up the entirety ofhis Wikipedia page’s “personal life” section. “There’s a guy I’m currently dating who has mentioned it no less than four times. I’m like, ‘Can somebody just delete that?’”But while Wikipedia’s summation of Rooke’s personal life may be reductive, its section headed “works” is expansive. It culminates inBig Boys, the 31-year-old comedian and writer’s Bafta-nominated, semi-autobiographical coming-of-age comedy, which has just returned to Channel 4 for its third and final season. Based on Rooke’s 2015 Edinburgh fringe show,Good Grief, about the death of his father from cancer, and his 2020 memoir-slash-advice guide,Cheer the F**k Up, it follows grieving, gay student Jack (Dylan Llewellyn) as he navigates life at Brent University and tries to lose his anal virginity.By his side is straight best friend Danny (Jon Pointing), his geezer-y bluster and banter masking a struggle with depression. Both are buffeted by a support cast of strong, straight-talking female characters including Jack’s hilarious cousin Shannon (Harriet Webb).At its best,Big Boysmixes the soulful pathos ofThe Royle Familywith the top-tier cringe comedy ofFleabag. It’s about life and death, but with jokes involving eye-opening gloryhole injuries, the perils of downing poppers and niche 2010s pop culture – Jack’s pet fish is called Alison Hammond – littered throughout. Rooke himself acts as narrator, often speaking directly to Danny – a character “based on four of my friends”, he says, “three of them are still here and one of them isn’t”. The fact that Danny is addressed in the past tense adds an undercurrent of melancholy.View image in fullscreenLife and death and niche pop culture: Big Boys series three.Photograph: Patch Dolan/Channel 4/Matt CrockettRooke, today sporting a shirt stolen from theBig Boyscostume department, had trouble letting go of his creation. “I spent a lot of time crying in the car on the way [to set],” he says. “And then, because the budgets got so bad, later I was also crying on the tube on the way to set because I thought ‘every little helps’,” he laughs, pulling off a very Rooke/Big Boystrait of mixing humour with something more serious: acashflow catastrophe hitting homegrown TV productionand UK culture more broadly. “But while I was there, I had the happiest, best time.”Some of the best days were spent filming with the likes of Rylan Clark and the actual Alison Hammond, who both have cameos. Rooke says he was certain neither would agree to appear, which seems strange given the show’s glowing reviews, litany of awards (in 2023, Rooke won a Writers’ Guild of Great Britain award) and celebrity fans such as Kylie Minogue, who was recommended the show by a friend of a friend (“I think if you’re a gay man and Kylie Minogue doesn’t have your number, then you’re not gay,” Rooke quips).So why the lack of confidence? “I still don’t see it as a hit show,” he says, sipping a mint tea. “I see what huge hit shows get in terms of budget and marketing.” He references cash-rich Netflix productions promoted by flashy immersive experiences housed in warehouses. “I’m like, ‘Can’t we do that withBig Boys? Go to a warehouse and there’s gloryholes everywhere, but you have to put a love letter through the hole instead of a cock.’”Even the big set piece that opens series three – the gang jet off to Greece after Shannon wins big-ish at bingo – was done on a budget. “It wasn’t actually Greece,” Rooke laughs. “It was Malta, because of the tax cuts. Also, there’s a whole Greek gay bar section that we shot in a hotel in Edgware called the Madonna hotel. It’s the campest place ever.”Rooke has always been able to improvise if necessary. As a kid, growing up in Watford, he was obsessed with magic and would sleep with a homemade magic wand (actually a stick covered in masking tape). He struggles to pinpoint exactly what it was about magic that he loved, but is wary of linking it to his sexuality, or upbringing, as part of some Sad Gay Past he had to escape from.“I am the product of two working-class parents that had a kid in their mid-40s and by that point had a bit of money,” he says. “I was born into a council flat but then we moved to a house so I feel like I had a foot in the working-class experience of growing up and not having much, and then a foot in the middle-class experience. I also don’t really know how much of my youth I spent worrying about being gay.”Even series one’s crowning moment – whenJack tells his mum he’s gay– was never supposed to be a big event. “I used to get very annoyed on set when people called it the coming out scene,” he says. “For me, it’s about the fact his dad’s dead and he can’t tell him something about himself that’s new. That was the emotional drive. It wasn’t about the shame of sexuality.” The scene was later shown onCelebrity Goggleboxand hit a nerve, going viral on TikTok. “I was trying not to do the grand cliche of gay writers who write the coming out scene, but of course it was a fucking coming out scene. I needed to just accept that.”I was around a lot of women taking very little shit from anyone for anythingRooke says there was always “the presumption that I was [gay] from very masculine, geezer-y figures in my family”. But his dad, “a bit of a Danny”, would take him to places that “had some gay presence”, like Camden market, and would also support his childhood obsession with the Spice Girls, replacing a Baby Spice doll after Rooke chewed its head off. Even before his dad died when Rooke was 15, he was supported by a strong feminine energy. “I was around a lot of women taking very little shit from anyone for anything,” he smiles. He mentions his auntie Jill, a 74-year-old painter and decorator, and his auntie Marion, who drove buses. “They all grafted a lot, because they had to. The men I spent a lot of time with in my earlier years were either in crisis or violent. And I don’t mean constantly abusive, constantly bad people, but they dealt with their aggression through punching walls or kicking something.”In his late teens, Rooke did work experience atCalm, a charity aimed at offering support for those in crisis. “Everyone who called in the first week I was there was a wife, sister, mother or girlfriend, worried sick about a man in their life,” he says. The experience inspiredBig Boysstorylines involving Danny’s girlfriend Corinne (Izuka Hoyle) and his hapless university mentor Jules (Katy Wix), who attempt to put Danny back together. “The reason the male mental health conversation has occurred is because women have encouraged men to open up,” Rooke says. “I want this series to celebrate those women.”View image in fullscreenJack Rooke performing Love Letters at the Edinburgh fringe in 2019.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The ObserverI ask Rooke why he suggested we meet in the Renaissance hotel. I assume, perhaps, it was a Spice Girls reference (theirdebut video for Wannabewas filmed here). It turns out it’s to do with where he’s heading next, post-Big Boys, with the hotel featuring in not one but two future projects. “One is a film I want to write and direct, and the other is a comedy drama.”He’s tight-lipped about the latter but, likeBig Boys, the film is a personal story tinged by loss. In 2020, Rooke’s older brother Dean lost his partner to cancer. The day they found out it was terminal Dean proposed underneath Tracey Emin’s “I want my time with you” neon sign that hangs at the back of the hotel. “Dean is a real geez, like a lad’s lad, and I remember thinking it was the most touching, thoughtful, emotionally resilient, brave thing I’ve ever seen anyone do ever.”Writing, however, isn’t necessarily where Rooke’s future lies. He much prefers being on a set, running things, feeding into every detail. He’s disarmingly honest about his book, calling it “awful. Dreadful.” He was inspired to write it after reading too many books about mental health written by “a thirtysomething middle-class person who would then say, ‘I did have a private therapist subsidised by both my parents as well as the income that I’d made in my 20s being a FTSE 100 company leader’”. He lets out a loud cackle. “I got so fucking fed up of reading those shitty books that I was like, there has to be one that’s written by someone like me on the NHS waiting list who thinks they might be gay and whose friend’s killed themselves. But I don’t think I’m a very talented longform writer. Did I do the book for the money? Yes. Did I also hope it would be useful and that it would have advice for young people? Yes.”An increasingly powerful figure in TV – he recently signed with the prestigious American agency UTA, whose other clients include Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Greta Gerwig – Rooke is keen for his work to continue to help people. It’s this altruistic trait he admires in others, too. He tells me his current celebrity crush is financial journalist and unlikely hunk Martin Lewis. “I don’t know why,” he laughs. “There’s something about him wanting to help people not get scammed that really makes me go fucking feral.” Another line for the Wikipedia page, perhaps.Big Boysseries three isavailable to streamon the Channel 4 websiteExplore more on these topicsTV comedyThe ObserverComedyTelevisionChannel 4LGBTQ+ rightsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

But the NorthernPastaCo’s products, from rigatoni to fusilli, are part of a growing wave of the Italian staple being made in the UK.The Cumbria-based company’s sales increased 357% in the year to February 2024, and from the spring its products will be sold on Ocado. Similarly, the Yorkshire Pasta Company, founded in 2019, is now stocked at more than 600 shops. Cornwall Pasta Co makes flavoured pastas, while Riverford sells pasta made by the Fresh Flour Company in Devon.The brands all use historic, organic or regenerative British grains, and offer a premium product, at up to £5 a bag. In January, the supermarket chain Booths launched a new promotion for Northern Pasta, Yorkshire Pasta and Cornwall Pasta. “Sales are increasing week on week. We’re at the start of a British pasta revolution,” said buyer Haris Deane, adding that customers were “open to trying new varieties” of the pantry staple.In 2023,the UK imported £1bn worth of pasta– making it the fourth-largest importer in the world – primarily from Italy. According to an Ibis World report, the “perceived superiority” of the Italian product has long limited sales of British-made ­versions, “especially in the dried pasta market.”View image in fullscreenImogen Royall and Matt Kenyon of the Northern Pasta Co.Photograph: James MoyleMost Britons eat pasta at least once a weekand those behind the new British offerings – all of which focus on dried pasta – say there is a growing appetite for locally produced alternatives. Northern Pasta made its first bag of pasta in 2022. Imogen Royall was working at an artisan bakery where she would encounter “beautiful British grains”, yet at home would eat regular pasta and feel “heavy and bloated,” she said. “That’s when I put two and two together: why aren’t we using these beautiful grains to create delicious pasta?”Royall and her husband, Matt Kenyon, created dried spelt pasta in their kitchen, took it to a market in Kendal, and it “took off incredibly quickly,” she said.Royall believes that “pasta is one of those products people just throw into their baskets and don’t think about, but she wanted to change that. Most pasta, she says, is dried quickly at high temperatures, which makes the texture “very plasticky”.By contrast, a slow drying process, combined with high-quality flour, locks in more of the wheat’s rich, nutty flavour. After six months, Northern Pasta was featured on the ITV cooking showJames Martin’s Saturday Morning. It is still made by Kenyon and one employee.Yorkshire Pasta’s owner, Kathryn Bumby, realised there was little available on the market between “naff, yellow, shiny-like-Play-Doh” supermarket pasta and “high-end” product imported from Italy. “There was nothing in the middle, nothing British, and everything was packaged in plastic,” she said. “We saw an opportunity.”Bumby drove around the country speaking to deli owners to gauge interest and visited Italy to learn how to make dried pasta.View image in fullscreenFounder Kathryn Bumby, left, with members of the team at the Yorkshire Pasta Company.Photograph: Gary Calton/The Observer“Pasta is phenomenal in Italy,” Bumby told theObserver. “It’s made so much slower and gentler, it’s all about the ingredients, getting the right wheat. If you make pasta correctly, you can get that characteristic out of the grain.” She compares high-quality pasta to sourdough bread: “Fresh pasta is seen as superior in England. In Italy it’s not at all.”The 20 best easy pasta recipes – from pistachio pesto to great baked gnocchiRead moreBritish customers have become more invested in what they are cooking and eating, Bumby believes, particularly since Covid. Having launched just before the pandemic, she said “the timing couldn’t have suited us better”. “People wanted a nice story, this English girl making pasta in Yorkshire. It just took off.”Yorkshire Pasta is now sold at Booths, but Bumby doesn’t want to enter nationwide supermarkets. Earlier this year,FineFoodDigestmagazine ran a survey of shop owners asking them what sold well, and Yorkshire Pasta’s range came third in the pasta category, behind two Italian brands.What do Italians think? A few have been reticent, Royall admits, but plenty have been won over – “which always gives me a sense of complete happiness”.Explore more on these topicsPastaThe ObserverFoodItalian food and drinkFood & drink industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I could, of course, be making this whole thing up, reconstructing this rose-tinted fantasy as a childhood memory of my own. I’m not even certain a Silver Cross ever graced our front door. And I’d have been too big a lump to be sitting upon its apron, as well as older in this memory than would have been possible. So, yes, making it up is highly probable.There is a particular kind of intimacy that exists between you and your hairdresser that’s hard to capture anywhere elseBut one thing I know is true is that around that time, I became obsessed with our local hairdressers. This tiny universe of transformation sandwiched between the newsagents and chemist of the local L-shaped shopping complex in the newly exploding suburb of Dublin 15.When my mother and father moved to Blanchardstown in 1978 from the central city, people thought they were mad –Is it even still Dublin? Don’t tell me it’s Meath? You’re out in the sticks– and out in the sticks it was. Dots of estates surrounded by fields, until eventually estate touched estate. Fields vanished. A brand spanking new concrete jungle in their place, with the curse of the 39 bus to connect us all. Dublin truly is a city of suburbs, growing out, not up, and as the city sprawled further during a period of rapid suburban expansion in the 1960s and 70s, creating new communities such as ours, small businesses followed. The independent hairdresser became as essential to these neighbourhoods as the local shop, the parish church or the post office and, by the mid-1970s, you’d be hard pushed to find a suburb without one.View image in fullscreen‘As a true child of the 80s, it’s the haunting of home bowl haircuts’: Fiona Scarlett reminisces on her mother’s handiwork.Photograph: Fiona ScarlettI’m not quite sure where this local hairdressers obsession of mine stemmed from. Perhaps as a true child of the 80s, it’s the haunting of home bowl haircuts. Early photos betraying my mother’s handiwork as I gap-tooth grin in tones of sepia, hair lopsided and elfin short (less Mia Farrow’sRosemary’s Baby, more Jim Carrey’sDumb and Dumber). I begged to be allowed to grow my hair long, mad jealous of the flowing locks and waves, plaits and colourful fancy clips of my peers.Your hair’s too fine, I was told.Too wispy, they said, to even consider any sort of length. A bob was relented to eventually, but with my signature uneven fringe. Always a fringe.My first proper haircut came when I was about seven, clutching my magazine-snipped mullet inspiration in my sweaty little palm. Handing it over as if it were the most precious of jewels. Sitting on top of a pile of fresh towels as my hair was styled to perfection. Fine sharp hairs stabbing my eyes, lining my mouth, then tongue, sticking firmly to the back of my neck. The best day of my life. Did it all go according to plan? Did it feck – sorry mullet fans, but there is a reason they should have stayed trapped in the 80s. I was slagged mercilessly in school and at home (ah, slagging, the Irish showing of affection). But did I care? Not in the slightest. To me I was Vidal Sassooning the shite out of my new fancy ’do.And so began my love affair. Time and again I would return, spending hours under a heated hood, rollers pinned, curls for my confirmation, forever chasing ringlets – only to prove everyone right as they fell to their natural poker-straight form within two hours. Later, I was berated by my hairdresser for using expensive Nicky Clarke shampoo, which I had spent all my 13th birthday money on. (It was drying the crap out of my scalp, apparently too rich for my hair.)View image in fullscreen‘I would be told outright when I was making a disastrous hair disaster decision – whether I listened or not’: Fiona Scarlett.Photograph: Sarah Doyle/The ObserverI would be told outright when I was making a disastrous hair decision, whether I listened or not. There was trust here, in this tiny claustrophobic space full of hot-steam hairdryers, crimpers and nauseating chemical smells, full of chatter and gossip; it was never just about the hair for me. It was the stories. The laughter. The tears. The people. Long before I knew I wanted to be a writer, I knew I wanted to write about this place.I’ve always been adventurous when it comes to my hair. That’s the rebel in me. And the affliction of my straight fine mane came into its own as I aged… Fast growing. Fast drying. Style holding well (except for any sort of curl, still to this day). I’ve had it dyed every colour under the sun. Chopped from long past my bum to sharp chin-length bobs. Pixie cuts. The Shag. The Rachel. The Lob. Gwyneth Paltrow’sSliding Doorssplendidness. Side-parted. Middle-parted. And every type of fringe imaginable.I served my time as a hair model, too, just for classes, mind, my orange-and-yellow-and-black Tony the Tiger striped balayage a particular highlight, it has to be said. I cheered openly when hairdressers opened after lockdown, the first one bashing down the door to rid me of my 28 washout (ha!) jet-black dye, and to fix my son’s mother-inflicted 90s step, bowl haircuts harder than they look.However, the roleof the suburban hairdresser has always been about more than aesthetic transformation. When our elderly neighbour had a fall and ended up in hospital for her 90th birthday, it was our local hairdresser who called in to style her hair so it would look just right for her photos. Not a penny would be taken.When one of my dearest friends was going through chemotherapy, it was her local hairdresser who prepared her for her hair loss: cutting to a bob first, before making the decision to fully shave. The same hairdresser who styled it as it grew back. Who listened to her and her fears of ever growing it long again, afraid of having to relive the trauma of losing it.When my own hair started coming out in clumps – a joyous peri-menopausal gift – it was my local hairdresser who reassured, styled, offered advice on what could be done to combat it and ways to live with it. Hairdressers are there for key milestones in our lives: sitting with a glass of champagne before a wedding; an hour’s peace and a semblance of normality for a new mother; for a complete transformation after a difficult breakup. In times of joy, sadness, great sickness and in health, hairdressers are there, donning multiple hats. Therapist. Confidant. Friend. Knowing when to listen or when to offer advice or when there is a need for silence (a true and rare gift). There is a particular kind of intimacy that exists between you and your hairdresser that’s hard to capture anywhere else.View image in fullscreen‘Long before I knew I wanted to be a writer, I knew I wanted to write about this place’: Fiona Scarlett at her hairdressers in County Kildare, IrelandPhotograph: Sarah Doyle/The ObserverBut times have changed. Independent hairdressers across the country are struggling. The rise of chain salons, with their sleek interiors and standardised services, has transformed the industry. Many of these chains offer cheaper prices and longer opening hours, making it harder for small salons to compete. In my present commuter-belt community, of the five salons that existed here when we first moved into the area 19 years ago, only two remain. The others have either closed down or changed ownership. The pandemic dealt another blow, many small salons unable to weather the extended closures.In the age of Instagram, we have every style imaginable at our fingertips and clients are looking for them to be replicated. Salons have to change with the times in order to survive in an incredibly cutthroat industry. More training. Longer hours. Finding ways to attract new customers whether that be through social media, online bookings, advertising, all costing money and time, which don’t affect the chains in the same way. And how much change is necessary? How do you retain the essence of what makes a hairdressers unique, maintaining what makes them special in the first place?Those that have remained and stood the test of time have found their niche in offering not just services, but sanctuary. A place where people can still connect in real, meaningful ways. And that, to me, is irreplaceable.While researching my novel, I spoke with dozens of suburban hairdressers. Their stories confirmed what I’d always known – that these spaces serve a vital social function that goes far beyond haircare. In an increasingly digital world, small businesses, shops, banks and post offices across Ireland are shutting down, with more and more social interactions forced online. The physical intimacy and face-to-face interaction of a hair appointment becomes even more sacred.This hit home particularly during the post-lockdown reopening. My local hairdresser, who runs a small but thriving salon in County Kildare, where I now live (utterly betraying my Dublin roots), told me how her elderly clients in particular had longed for and missed human connection, some having not been touched by another person in months, or years. The utter loneliness of that. For some, a hairdresser might be one of very few instances of human interaction, of touch, of conversation, of company, in their life. A hair appointment provides a time and space for undivided, one-on-one attention for an hour or more.The suburban hairdresser offers something that few other services can recreate – continuity, community and genuine connection. They know your history, your family, your troubles and rejoicings. They remember how you like your tea, which magazines you prefer, whether you’re afraid of the harsh blast of the hairdryer… Knowledge accumulated over years, even decades, and incredibly difficult to replicate.As Ireland continues to evolve, with new suburbs sprouting and old ones changing, the role of the local hairdresser shifts, too. But their fundamental purpose – as guardians of communities, providers of care that goes beyond the cosmetic – remains as vital as ever. In a world that often feels increasingly fragmented and isolated, these small, familiar spaces become more, not less, essential. The conversations still flow. The stories still unfold. And the heart of these communities still beats strongly, filled with possibility.May All Your Skies Be Blue by Fíona Scarlett is published by Faber at £16.99.

Snacks and small plates £5-£14, large plates £18-£29, desserts £9, wines from £36Don’t Tell Dad in London’s Queen’s Park is a self-declared neighbourhood restaurant in a knowingly dishevelled neighbourhood. It sits on a part-cobbled, mews-style lane which was once home to stable blocks and very much looks like it. If you want to snoop at the red-rust frontage on Google Street View, however, you can’t. It’s a private street, through which Google’s cars may never pass. Lonsdale Road, once the property of the Church Commissioners, is now owned by a single landlord, Feldberg Capital, which is gently turning it into an ever-so-random-on-purpose leisure destination.Josh Katz’s Middle Eastern-influenced grill restaurant Carmel is here, as is the Australian-inspiredMilk Beachand an outpost ofPizza Pilgrims, alongside a micro-brewery, a yoga studio, co-working spaces and a macrobiotic deli where they crochet their own fermented sea-vegetables. Perhaps I made the last one up.Anywhere which tops a heap of oxtail with fried bread crumbs, puts it on a crumpet and calls it a snack, is fine by meThis reads like an eye-roll at the tastes of the infuriating, lotus-eating middle classes and the sort of businesses which pander to them. As I’m one of those infuriating people, I’m basically rolling my eyes at myself. Lonsdale Road has a lovely, rackety Copenhagen vibe and I would be thrilled if it were part of my neighbourhood. By day, Don’t Tell Dad is a bakery serving brown butter hazelnut croissant, and pear and whisky Danish, by head baker Keren Sternberg, formerly of Layla. By night it is a restaurant serving many other things. It fits in here perfectly.View image in fullscreen‘It takes experience to cook a wild duck like this’: mallard.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverThe restaurant was founded by local Daniel Land, the former banker behind quick-service pasta chainCoco di Mama, and is named in memory of his sister Lesley, who died suddenly not long ago. As a child, Lesley was always good for skulduggery of which their parents should know nothing. She came up with plans and urged her brother not to tell dad. It’s a sweet back story to a restaurant of innocent if serious pleasures; the kind only the most puritanical of fathers could find it in themselves to disapprove of. Anywhere which braises oxtail down until it is a sticky mess of uber-gravy-slicked meaty threads, tops a heap of it with dripping-fried breadcrumbs, and then puts all of that on a small crumpet and calls it a snack, is fine by me.View image in fullscreen‘A sticky mess’: oxtail crumpet.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverA few years ago, perhaps pre-Covid, a restaurant like this in London would most likely have been found in what my kids call Central and I call the West End. (Sidebar: when did this change? How dare the young people come up with a name which makes so much more sense?) But the gravitational pull of the capital has shifted, from the middle to a little further out. Why drag into town if it can be avoided? It has the feel of somewhere you might stumble into and then out of again. There’s an open kitchen, soft lighting, cosy banquettes and booths, and a beautiful tiled floor, all of it picking up the colours from outside, as if bathing you in the glow of a guttering hearth. The orange ducted ceiling is, like the music, low (gentle club beats in the dining room; showtunes by the loos). Try to get a table, rather than a seat at a counter. The curve-backed stools look comfortable, but aren’t quite. No worries. An oxtail crumpet will quickly soothe the wriggling.View image in fullscreen‘Impressively deep-filled’: crab tart.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverHead chef Luke Frankie, formerly of Noble Rot and the Drapers Arms, has written a menu I’m going to call Cosmopolitan English: these are dishes which are both rooted very much in the here, but also reference over there. Among the small plates there’s an impressively deep-filled crab tart of white and brown meat in a thin, flaky pastry shell, spun through with green herbs, which tastes like something straight out of Jane Grigson’s cookbookEnglishFood. But there is also a shuddering cairn of fritto misto which, with its inflated, glowing batter, is more Tokyo tempura than Italian antipasto. This one is announced as a fritto misto of winter vegetables, so you can feel good about your life choices, while celebrating the delicate art of deep-fat frying. There may have been slivers of squash and torn cabbage leaves hiding under the carapace. Who cares? It comes dribbled with a little honey, and dusted with chilli flakes. Abandon cutlery. This is work for fingers.View image in fullscreenMonkfish.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverAs a foil against the fried goods, order the panzanella of impeccable, taut-skinned tomatoes with torn pieces of their own dense sourdough to soak up the dressing, topped with snowy fleshed fillets of fried sardine. It’s a summer afternoon on the beach, here amid a London winter. After which Don’t Tell Dad stops being one of those small-plates restaurants you’ve started whining to your tolerant friends about, and just serves up plates of dinner. A piece of sea bass, cooked so the bronze sear has edged deeper into the fillet, lies on a textured purée of nutty Jerusalem artichokes.View image in fullscreen‘Impeccable, taut-skinned tomatoes’: panzanella.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverOr there’s what amounts to the whole of a thumping mallard, complete with shot, for an extremely keen £28: both legs, slow-cooked then crisped, and both breasts, spiced, roasted and rested. Cooking wild duck like this isn’t something to which you can turn your hand. It takes experience to make sure it doesn’t tense up as it cooks, like aMastermindcontestant in the black chair. The skin is dark and rendered, and there’s a sweet carrot and date purée which is the ideal foil to the gamey meat. For salt there are bacon lardons. For greens there’s kale. Like the crab tart, there is something very English about it, a pleasing whiff of damp field and meadow under glowering skies.View image in fullscreen‘Baked to order’: madeleines.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverFor dessert they offer madeleines. Make sure to leave time because, just as at St John where I first came across this proposition, they will be baked to order. I watch the tray being slipped into the oven. They arrive 10 minutes later, hot and crisp-edged, with a little orange cream to drag them through. The wine list by Bert Blaize, author of the bookWhich Wine When, is concise, big on bottles by small producers and has a good choice by the glass and 500ml carafe. Have one each. Daniel Land, responsible for feeding a lot of City workers, has talked effusively about now wanting to create something for where he lives: an adaptable space that changes through the day. The result may not always be cheap. It may feel like a neighbourhood restaurant for well-heeled neighbours. But that doesn’t change the fact that it’s a class act. Trust me, this is one you can mention to your dad, and anyone else for that matter.News bitesThe big news in the London restaurant world this week is the announcement that cult Leytonstone Thai restaurant Singburi will end its recent sabbatical by reopening in Shoreditch. The new venture, which has been described as Singburi 2.0, is a joint enterprise by head chef Sirichai Kularbwong (son of the original founders who have now retired), Nick Molyviatis of Kiln and Oma, and Alexander Gkikas of Catalyst. The new incarnation will open later in the spring.Meanwhile Shaun Moffat, formerly of Manteca in Shoreditch, and more recently of the Edinburgh Castle in Manchester’s Ancoats and then Maya, is staying in the city to open a restaurant called Winsome on Princess Street. It will, he says, serve ‘thoughtful British cooking’. He’ll be joined in the business by Owain Williams, one of the team behind Liverpool’s Belzan and more recently Medlock Canteen.The Midland Grand Dining Room at the St Pancras Renaissance Hotel, formerly the Gilbert Scott, is being taken over by Victor Garvey of Sola in Soho. ‘A dining room of this stature deserves a menu that matches its grandeur,’ Garvey has said, describing his plans for the room as ‘Old world, new ideas, to honour the foundations of classical French cuisine while embracing modernity.’ The opening menu includes tuna with white peach, duck with boudin noir and calvados apples, and guinea fowl with Armagnac prunes. Three courses will cost £75 and it opens on 25 February (midlandgranddiningroom.com).Email Jay at jay.rayner@observer.co.uk or follow him on Instagram@jayrayner1Explore more on these topicsRestaurantsJay Rayner on restaurantsFoodreviewsShareReuse this content"

He was the kind of man who prided himself on his ability to keep it together, no matter the situation. A busy father of two, working long hours in a demanding corporate role, he believed stress was simply part of the job – a badge of honour in today’s relentless grind.But then, out of nowhere, the panic attacks began.The first time it happened, James was in the middle of a meeting. His heart started racing, his palms were drenched in sweat and he felt a sudden tightness in his chest. He excused himself, thinking perhaps he was coming down with a virus, or worse, having a heart attack. But the symptoms didn’t go away. If anything, they worsened.“It felt like I was dying,” James admitted in our first session. “I couldn’t breathe, my chest was tight, I was dizzy and I was convinced something was seriously wrong. I wasn’t in bad shape but I wasn’t sleeping well and felt like I was burning the candle at both ends between work and family commitments.”Sandra was estranged from her mother after experiencing childhood trauma. The grief when she died was complicated | Ahona GuhaRead moreAfter multiple visits to his GP and even a trip to the emergency room, all of which ruled out any physical issues, James was told by a doctor that it may have been a panic attack. James became aware, after some discussion with his GP, that panic attacks are quite common. In fact, 40% of Australians can experience a panic attack once or twice in their lives, and 5% may experience the more debilitating panic disorder. The difference is that a panic attack will happen irregularly and usually only once or twice a year, whereas those diagnosed with a panic disorder will experience repeated and regular panic attacks.At first, James was confused. Stress was normal, wasn’t it? Everyone dealt with it. Why did he feel his body was suddenly giving up? A few weeks went by until he finally decided to book in for a therapy session. It wasn’t until then that he began to understand the deeper layers of his panic disorder. He realised that his panic attacks came on quickly and felt as though they lasted for an eternity, leaving him with a sense of dread. They would often last for up to 30 minutes, with the first 10 minutes being the most extreme.The pressure cooker: work and familyFor years James had been juggling an unmanageable workload alongside the pressures of fatherhood, with a six-year-old and four-year-old. His banking job demanded long hours, constant travel and unrealistic deadlines. At home he often felt as though he was failing. “I wanted to be present for my kids but I was always too tired or distracted,” he said. “I felt like I wasn’t enough.”James’s wife had tried to talk to him about the toll it was taking but he brushed her off. “I’d say, ‘I’m fine. It’s just a busy season.’ But the truth was I didn’t want to admit that I was drowning.”Unpacking the pastIn therapy, we began to explore not just his stressors but also his childhood. He grew up in a household where emotions were rarely discussed. His father, a strict disciplinarian, dismissed vulnerability as weakness. “Crying wasn’t an option,” James recalls. “You just had to get on with it and, from an early age, my father drilled into me the importance of success and hard work. If I didn’t win a footy match as a boy, he wouldn’t talk to me for the rest of the day, then he would say that I needed to train harder.”This stoic mindset carried into adulthood, where James learned to bury his emotions rather than confront them. But the unresolved tension didn’t disappear. Instead, it simmered beneath the surface, waiting for the right conditions to boil over.From carer to carefree? How to move on from years of devotion after a loved one dies | Gaynor ParkinRead moreIn one session we looked at how early trauma could shape his brain’s response to stress. The constant pressure at work and home had triggered his fight-or-flight system, leading to panic attacks.Moving forwardRecovery for James has been slow and non-linear. He now prioritises self-care – something he used to scoff at. Regular exercise, mindfulness and setting boundaries at work have become non-negotiable. He’s also learning to be more open with his family and prioritise quality time with his two children.While initially James was resistant to the thought of therapy, with support from his family and close friends, the process has helped him unpack his life history, his unexpressed emotions and to speak openly with those he trusted about his life and his concerns. The rumination and overthinking, which would often lead to him feeling overwhelmed and result in a panic attack, has now subsided.“The first time I told my wife how overwhelmed I was, I felt so relieved,” he said. “I didn’t realise how much I’d been holding in and I realised it actually made my life and relationships more authentic and real. It has been a learning curve but now I feel more comfortable about sharing how I feel about myself, my life and my relationships.”James’ story is a reminder that stress isn’t something to dismiss or power through. It can be the body’s way of asking us to stop and listen. And while addressing it can be uncomfortable, it’s also the first step toward healing. “I used to think asking for help was a sign of failure,” James said. “Now I see it as strength. You don’t have to carry it all alone.”*All clients discussed are fictional amalgamsDiane Young is a trauma specialist and psychotherapist atSouth Pacific Private, a trauma, addiction and mental health treatment centreIn Australia, support is available atBeyond Blueon 1300 22 4636,Lifelineon 13 11 14, and atMensLineon 1300 789 978.

A magnet had fallen off the fridge and met the floor with a startling crack, causing him to shout, ‘Jesus Christ!’His first retort is that we say it all the time, which is a hard one for us to argue‘Language!’ we say, with disapproving voices. If I’m honest, mine is actually my dad’s voice. I can’t help it. I’ve never really developed a disciplinary mode of my own, so any time I need to admonish my children it’s him that comes out, unbidden and full-throated, with a tinge of his Fermanagh brogue to make its source even more mortifyingly obvious. My wife, too, has a similar affliction, inflecting her most authoritatively maternal barbs with hints of her mum’s native Carlow. There we stand, a Derryman and a Dubliner in London, so unused to confrontation we can only raise our voices using accents we’ve never had.My son seems shocked at our vehemence, because he doesn’t quite get how blasphemy works. He learns about various faiths in school and seems quite keen on the idea of God as creator of everything, albeit with an assist from the Big Bang, a phenomenon he still thinks of as a person – specifically, God’s friend who does a few odd jobs around the universe.I don’t know if he’s aware who Jesus is, or if he’s got to the New Testament yet. This is markedly different from my own education, every second of which took place within 6ft of a crucifix. By the time I was his age, I was picking out bibles and rosary beads, memorising my Our Fathers and Hail Marys so I’d be present and correct for my first holy communion. I’d spent seemingly 40% of my life in mass and had learned the grisly details of Christ’s death, each stumble, trip and stabbing that led him to Golgotha, before I’d been introduced to times-tables or joined-up writing.Despite all this, since my wife and I are no longer believers, our son’s childlike confusion over God now renders him more, not less, religious than his parents. Unable to plead piety, we simply tell him that you can’t shout ‘Jesus Christ!’ because it’s… rude.His first retort is that we say it all the time, which is a hard one for us to argue, although we try one in the ‘we’re adults, so we’re allowed to’ vein, which demeans us all.Thankfully, his second defence is that a friend of his ‘says it all the time’.‘So what?’ snaps my wife, quicker than I can get to the mark. I freeze as I realise she has channelled her mum before I’ve had time to summon my dad. ‘If he jumped off a bridge, would you do it too?’The boy is bamboozled, but it is a death blow to us both. For him, the first time he’s encountered such a devastating medley of words. He tries to think of a comeback. He even looks at me for guidance, but I’m too busy boiling in defeat to notice.The chance spurned to utter a phrase I’ve wanted to say in earnest since it was first used against me in childhood. My wife has beaten me to it, and I might never forgive her. ‘Jesus Christ’ I mutter to myself. ‘Language’ says my son.Explore more on these topicsFamilyThe Séamas O’Reilly columnParents and parentingcommentShareReuse this content"

There is still a great deal of common ground between the US and its European allies. We must play our part in strengthening that.”The Paris gathering is being organised by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, to come up with a joint European response to US efforts to exclude European leaders from the peace talks, as well as issues such as Ukraine’s future membership of Nato.Seeking to play down the impact of the shock to Europe of Trump setting out what appears to be a unilateral plan for an end to the war that began when Russia invaded Ukraine, Reynolds said it remained possible that Ukraine may be permitted to join Nato, saying the US had “said everything is still on the table”.But he disagreed withthe speech givenby Trump’s vice-president, JD Vance, to the Munich Security Conference on Friday.Europeans are right to be angry with Donald Trump, but they should also be furious with themselves | Andrew RawnsleyRead moreStunning his European hosts, Vance barely mentioned Ukraine and instead delivered a culture war-heavy lecture arguing that the real threat to Europe was not Russia or China but the suppression of free speech.“We can disagree on some things and still be close allies,” Reynolds said. “I would disagree on that. I think the threat from Russia is real.”In his speech, Vance used the example of a British anti-abortion activist who was arrested for praying inside a “buffer zone” near an abortion clinic as an attack on religious liberties.Reynolds took issue with this. “Let’s be clear, we don’t have blasphemy laws in the UK. That’s the right thing. I say that as a Christian. No one is arrested for what they are praying about. The example he gave was about making sure people can access healthcare,” he said.With the Sunday Timesreportingthat Starmer wants to overrule any Treasury worries and confirm an increase in UK defence spending – denied by No 10 sources – Reynolds declined to give any details but said the entire government realised the need for this.He told Sky News: “The whole cabinet, the whole government, I think most people in this country recognise the pressures the world is under, recognise more will have to be spent on defence. Now the spending review will set out the roadmap towards that target.”He added: “The chancellor knows more than most people the pressures on public services across the board, but defence has to be the cornerstone of our national prosperity as well as our security.”Pushed on when there would be an increase, he said: “We will set out that roadmap. We have already put more money into defence in the first budget of this new government. So our credentials are there.”Explore more on these topicsForeign policyDefence policyJonathan ReynoldsTrump administrationUkraineEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Sado Junaid, whose sister and brother-in-law were detained and tortured in the squat facility’s underground prison, sided with Mahmoud al-Bashar, who as they spoke sometimes held the black coil of wire and a black-and-white rod once used to beat him and other detainees.They clashed with another young recruit about whether they should be allowed to torture officers from the deposed regime ofBashar al-Assadbefore any accused of crimes face trial, or whether suspects should be immediately delivered to Syria’s nascent justice system.“I just want to meet one of them and torture them as they did to me,” said Bashar.“If you saw someone who tortured your father, your brother, your loved one, can you really say you would deal with them peacefully?” said Junaid. He only wanted to hurt those who had harmed his family, he said, although he conceded he would not recognise their names or faces if he passed them on the street.Homs was known as the cradle of the uprising against Assad, where Syria’s Alawite and Sunni communities have long lived in close quarters.View image in fullscreenA boy carrying a small child passes a clock tower, a well=known symbol of Homs, draped with the new Syrian flag.Photograph: David Lombeida/The GuardianThe diverse city has grown tense since Assad’s fall, as security forces loyal to the new caretaker government conduct sweeping raids targeting groups loyal to the deposed dictatorship. Homs’ Alawites, including many who once filled the ranks of Assad’s army and security forces, say they are terrified of reprisal attacks, and whisper about kidnappings and violence targeting members of their sect.Junaid was quick to say he had no issue with the Alawite people, but he hoped to see justice served “for those who committed crimes”, even as the identities of those he wanted to stand trial remained opaque.“The good Alawites who committed no crimes can live peacefully, as long as they don’t establish sleeper cells,” he said, in a nod to the frequent spasms of violence that continue to plague Homs. From the perspective of Homs’ Sunnis, the source of the problem was remnants of the former regime. For Alawites, it is armed extremists they say are targeting civilians, accusing the new government of turning a blind eye.“We live in constant fear and instability now,” said Abu Mohammed, an Alawite former three-star captain in Assad’s army. He had barely left his house since the Assad regime fell, he said, instead spending his days frantically scrolling social media where descriptions of attacks on Alawite villages outside Homs were rampant, although often difficult to verify.View image in fullscreenMembers of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the group that toppled Assad, stand guard in central Homs.Photograph: David Lombeida/The GuardianMohammed and his former army colleague Mahmud Ibrahim said they felt abandoned by the upper echelons of the military who had either fled or were in hiding, leaving them facing an uncertain future.Mohammed had been to one of the settlement centres set up by the new authority, where security and military personnel turn in their weapons in exchange for papers saying they have surrendered and regularised their status. He described witnessing Sunni militants assault an Alawite student who they had pulled from a nearby bus as he waited in a queue outside the settlement centre. He had since avoided the checkpoints staffed by fighters that ring the city, fearing the piece of paper he obtained from the settlement centre would do little to protect him.“Both of us want to return to the army – but also to get a salary,” said Ibrahim, frustrated at being out of work despite his former status as a military recruiter. Mohammed scoffed at the idea they could volunteer for the new local security forces like Junaid and the others, who earn the equivalent of £80 a month in foreign currency. Guarding buildings, he said, was beneath their former military status.For the people of Homs, the violence of the Assad regime was intimate. Security services largely made up of Alawites raided the homes of their neighbours in majority-Sunni neighbourhoods, often a short drive from the imposing detention centres ringed with barbed wire, where the officers surveilled their neighbours. Officials worked house by house to crack down on anyone accused of joining protests against Assad’s rule that began in 2011, with Homs witnessing the largest demonstrations in Syria, as well as mass arrests in response.View image in fullscreenA young boy walks in the Baba Amr district of Homs, where many buildings are still damaged or destroyed from bombing and raids during the Assad regime.Photograph: David Lombeida/The GuardianSwaths of the city bear the scars of the civil war that followed, when the Assad regime attacked its own citizens with airstrikes and shelling. Neighbourhoods whose names became synonymous with destruction by Assad’s forces, such asBaba Amr, where Bashar said he once fought, contain whole blocks ground into little more than pockmarked foundations and dust.Some residents such as Bashar say they know the identities of those who abused or surveilled them, raising the spectre that victims of the Assad regime’s violence against its own people could one day encounter those responsible on the streets of Homs. While many of the notorious names such as the former head of the political security directorateHusam Loukafled with Assad to Moscow, many of the lower-ranking officers and security personnel who could not afford to leave the country are now in hiding, either in Homs or the nearby Alawite heartland of Latakia.“All those remnants of the former regime are hiding in their homes, down to the former traffic police,” said Salman Shbeeb, an Alawite former politician who said he had encouraged changes from the Assad regime and had been detained and questioned under Assad and his father, Hafez, who was president until his death in 2000.“They’ve even got new, Sunni recruits directing the traffic now,” he added.View image in fullscreenAn Hayat Tahrir al-Sham soldier directs traffic in Homs.Photograph: David Lombeida/The GuardianAt busy intersections across city, these tensions were laid bare as fighters from Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the group that toppled Assad, stood guard. At the entrance to one majority-Alawite neighbourhood, militants loitered next to an anti-aircraft missile mounted on a flatbed truck. Elsewhere in the city, fighters ringed a roundabout near a Sunni neighbourhood, saying they were there to keep the Alawite and Sunni communities apart after an Alawite protest got out of hand when a militia joined in.“Our goal is to stop the fighting,” said Abu Salem Hawash, a HTS fighter standing guard. Their presence was intended “to push the Sunnis away and protect the Alawites”, he said.Another fighter, Abu Mossah Kermaz, said he was among the forces raiding Alawite homes, and was adamant that suggestions of reprisal attacks were lies. The militants had been careful to treat people with respect when they went inside looking for people, he said, adding that they had directed all the women in the house to one room and asked homeowners to keep hold of their valuable items and electronics.“The new government will solve all these problems soon, god willing,” he added. What the new authority in Damascus may do other than target remnants of the former regime remained unclear.Ibrahim and Mohammed said they had attempted to establish a kind of neighbourhood watch group, but said local Sunni forces had prevented this. Confined to their homes and fearful, they were desperate to find something to do.“Maybe they will allow us to protect our neighbourhoods, without guns, but we’re not even allowed to gather in big numbers,” said Mohammed.Ibrahim was bolder with his frustrations. “If the Sunnis continue like this for another few months, maybe the Alawites will call for the return of a president like Assad. Maybe they’ll even call for his return,” he said.Explore more on these topicsSyriaBashar al-AssadMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Then came an announcement over the public address system. “Air Force One is currently in international waters,”declared the flight crewof the US presidential jet, “for the first time in history flying over the recently renamed Gulf of America.”As his aides clapped and whooped, Trump gloated: “Isn’t that nice? We’re about ‘Make America Great Again’, right? That’s what we care about.” He proceeded to sign a proclamation declaring 9 February “Gulf of America Day” as Air Force One flew over the body of water previously known as the Gulf of Mexico.It was classicTrumpian showmanshipfrom the highest perch in the world. It was also the latest salvo by the 47th president and his allies to control language, influence media narratives and reshape cultural institutions in ways that some compare with the Soviet Union or other authoritarian regimes from history.Long a master of branding, Trump is making propaganda a core element of his strongman presidency. This comes as little surprise to critics who regard it as an extension of last year’s election campaign in which he sold himself as a champion of the forgotten people and victim of a weaponised justice department.Tara Setmayer, a former Republican communications director on Capitol Hill, said: “Donald Trump’s re-election is the greatest, most successful propaganda op in history. Propaganda is why Donald Trump is president again and they know this, which is why they undermined the press, expertise and science.”Since taking office, Trump has outpaced his predecessors by signing64 executive ordersand 27 memos and proclamations in less than a month. His blitz on immigration, trade and the federal bureaucracy was expected. But the president’s aggressive approach to reshaping national identity through symbolism and language has taken opponents by surprise.It’s not an accident that Trump went after the FCC licenses and sued these media conglomerates for them to bend their knees to himTara SetmayerWhen Trump used hisinaugural addressto assert his vision of US dominance by promising to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, the former secretary of state Hillary Clinton burst out laughing. But the switch came with a sinister edge.This week, the White House banned the Associated Press, one of the world’s biggest news outlets, because it has not changed its stylebook entry for Gulf of Mexico to Gulf of America (the AP serves numerous countries that do not recognise the new name). The punitive measure prompted CNN toinvoke “newspeak”from George Orwell’s novel 1984, in which language is a tool of control and can be narrowed to limit thought.In a similar vein, the US defense secretary,Pete Hegseth, signed an order restoring the name of a special operations forces base in North Carolina back toFort Bragg, reversing a Joe Biden effort in 2023 to remove names that honored Confederate leaders (Hegseth swerved past that association by this time recognising Roland Bragg, an obscure veteran of the second world war).The White House is also redefining terms to cast opponents in a negative light – for example, by referring to fired federal employees as “deep-state activists”. The National Park Service erased references to transgender people on its webpage for the Stonewall national monument.As the AP discovered, the media – long derided by Trump as “fake news” and “the enemy of the people” – is now subject to a system of rewards and punishments. The owners of the Washington Post and major social media platforms such as Facebook and X had the best seats in the house at his inauguration.At least 10 of the 18 reporters that the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, called on during her briefing this week work for partisan rightwing outlets. Officials at the Pentagon decided to “rotate” eight major news outlets from their workspaces, replacing them with more Trump-friendly media, andinvited a far-right activist, Jack Posobiec, to take part in Hegseth’s first trip overseas.In addition, Trump is pursuing lawsuits against media outlets by using novel legal theories to circumvent established first amendment protections, while his allies are using the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to target broadcast news networks whose content they deem unfavorable.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump at the Kennedy Center in Washington DC on 1 July 2017.Photograph: Olivier Douliery/EPAThere are concerns that the intimidatory tactics are working. Setmayer, who now leadsthe Seneca Project, a women-led super political action committee, said: “The mainstream American media has failed.What is happening is not a normal transition; it’s a constitutional crisis. That’s the way the American media should be covering this and they’re not.“They’re parsing their words. They’re whitewashing and sanewashing what Elon Musk has been allowed to do and whatDonald Trumpis telegraphing he plans to do more of. They’ve made a business decision to obey in advance. It’s not an accident that Trump went after the FCC licenses and sued these media conglomerates for them to bend their knees to him, so they won’t cover him honestly.”Trump is also making a surprise foray into arts and culture witha hostile takeoverof the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, a living memorial for the 35th president that, with a $268m budget last year, hosts classical music, dance, hip-hop, opera, theatre, touring productions and educational arts programming.Trump has installed himself as chair, stacked the board of trustees with his loyalists and replaced president Deborah Rutter with his former acting director of national intelligence,Ric Grenell, a disrupter who has no prior experience in arts administration.“We know the importance of the arts in telling stories and keeping the truth out there and in being part of the resistance, so it is no accident that Trump is coming for the arts, similar to other fascists in history,” Setmayer said.The president admitted he has not been to the Kennedy Center but felt the overhaul was necessary because of drag shows that are “specifically targeting our youth” as well as other “anti-American propaganda”. He told reporters: “We’re going to make sure that it’s good and it’s not going to be woke. There’s no more woke in this country.” In response, several stars havedissociated themselvesfrom the centre.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

People need to be paying attention to these types of thing.”“They may seem frivolous: why do I care what he did to the Kennedy Center? Well, let’s look at the history. Who has ever done that as president? Why is he doing that? It’s all part of the overarching effort by this individual who wants to control every narrative there is.”Like past authoritarians, Trump understands the power of symbols such as Mount Rushmore in South Dakota, which is carved with the faces of former presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt. Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna of Floridaproposed legislationadding Trump to the monument, explaining: “President Trump’s bold leadership and steadfast dedication to America’s greatness have cemented his place in history.”Trump has issued an order to revive a “National Garden of American Heroes”, an attempt to curate a version of history that reinforces ideas of national exceptionalism. The representativeBuddy Carterof Georgia has introduced a bill to rename Greenland as “Red, White, and Blueland”, as Trumpseeks to acquire the island territory.Trump has also called for “patriotic education”, attempting to control what is taught in schools and instil a conservative vision. The administration is pushing to restrict what teachers can teach about gender and race and has threatened to withhold funds from schools that fail to comply.Above all, the 47th president is dominating the nation’s attention, filling news cycles and social media 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Last Sunday, he became the first sitting US president to attend the Super Bowl, the crown jewel of US sport, which drew a record 127 million viewers and “a Caesar-at-the-Colosseum air,” according to New York Times critic James Poniewozik.Then, when Trump hosted ally Elon Musk and his son X in the Oval Office, there was saturation coverage. White House communications director Steven Cheungtweeted an imageof eight news networks simultaneously broadcasting the meeting and boasted: “FULL SPECTRUM DOMINANCE.”Reed Galen, president of the Union, a pro-democracy coalition, said: “With dictators throughout history, it’s all spectacle. The idea of propaganda is not necessarily to lie about things but to keep the attention focused where you want it, and he’s a master of that.”Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a history and Italian studies professor at New York University and author ofStrongmen: Mussolini to the Present, describes Trump as “one of the most successful propagandists in all of history”, as skilled as the former Italian dictator Benito Mussolini in his use of images, symbols and repetition.She said: “The cult of personality is that you must be omnipotent but you’re also omnipresent, you’re everywhere. It’s not just old-school dictatorships like North Korea today or communist China where the face of the leader is everywhere.“Nowadays, for example, Modi in India is the most followed leader in the world. He’s a genius at Instagram. When he ran for office in 2014, he used holograms so he could be in a hundred places at the same time. Being everywhere and inescapable is part of making the population depend on you and on no one else.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpArts policyUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Then the wildfires came, and I realised, in an era of disasters, how vital trained neighbors areAudrey Grayin Los AngelesSun 16 Feb 2025 11.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 16 Feb 2025 11.02 ESTShareKelley McIntosh is the kind of person who gives her friends fire extinguishers as housewarming gifts. In other words, my kind of person: as a climate journalist who’s spent eight years reporting on adaptations critical to life in our burning, storming, fevered world, I’ve been known to gift-wrap prepper items, too. Loved ones have sighed and nodded as they opened solar lanterns, flashlights and emergency radios none of us quite understand how to “crank”.Shockingly for two hypervigilants, neither Kelley nor I had ever actually pulled the pin and shot a fire extinguisher until the day we met last September inLos Angeles.We’d both signed up for community emergency response team (Cert) training, a federallyadministered, locally organized program that has, for decades, taught disaster preparedness and response skills to volunteer civilians for free. More than 20 of my neighbors and I enrolled for three day-long sessions. Would it be geeky or depressing to immerse ourselves in worst-case scenarios, three beautiful LA Saturdays in a row? Perhaps. But our desire for some sense of agency or usefulness as more climate-intensified disasters hit took precedence. Why not at least try to avoid being caught pants down when the next “unprecedented” event slammed in?That was all just four months ago. After our training, Santa Monica’s chief resilience officer thanked us for a willingness to “ease the burden on our community during disasters”.Too soon, we’d find out if we could.View image in fullscreenMembers of the Cert team in Hawthorne, California, on 11 April 2009.Photograph: MediaNews Group/Orange County Register/Getty ImagesFor Kelley, fire was the disaster that unnerved her most. She had grown up in rural Pennsylvania, where tall barns would light up in a flash and take out the homes around them. When she moved to LA more than two decades ago to work in entertainment marketing, the caution came with her.“Fire is just something you lose control of so fast,” she told me. “I’ve always been a little crazy about it.”Cert trainings happen in all 50 states and on tribal lands, but they’re only offered when local leaders have enough funding to run a class. Most of us spent months on Santa Monica’s waitlist before our local office of emergency management finally announced a 2024 class.That first Saturday, we gathered in an air-conditioned classroom at the city’s fire-training facility. The resilience officer, Lindsay Barker Call, and two local fire marshals talked us through hazards particular to our daily stomping grounds. My impression was that earthquakes topped the list. Wildfires and smoke inundation were of course mentioned, becauseCalifornia, but walkable Santa Monica felt somehow insulated from the fire-prone canyon country around us. Still, since earthquakes sometimes set off urban fires, we learned basic protocol – how to pry open doors with crowbars, shut off a leaking gas valve (at Cert graduation, we’d each be given our own wrench for this), or command the power of a home extinguisher to vanquish a spot fire.I remember cheering for Kelley that afternoon as a firefighter in full gear set flame to a pan of diesel fuel on the lot. It was a hot day. Kelley was wearing loose joggers and a short-sleeve T-shirt, her ponytail tucked under a baseball cap. The fire was instantly as tall as she was, and a thick column of smoke rose even higher. I watched Kelley aim the extinguisher at her worst fear and put her whole body into killing it in under 10 seconds.It felt empowering to practice, to understand “go bags” and what to do before first responders got to you, from blood staunching to “psychologically stabilizing survivors”.We trained hard. After three weeks, we took a group photo, exchanged phone numbers and promised to look after our neighbors. We felt as ready as civilians could be without going full bunker.View image in fullscreenKelley McIntosh, a Santa Monica homeowner, attacks a test fire during her first day of Cert training last September.Photograph: Audrey GrayView image in fullscreenThe September 2024 cohort of Santa Monica Cert trainees on their graduation day.Photograph: Audrey GrayOn Tuesday, 7 January, smoke was visible in Santa Monica well before lunchtime. I’d just left a doctor’s appointment and joined the office staff out on the sidewalk as they pointed, wondering what the hell was happening just north of us. A monster plume of churning black smoke looked like it was only blocks away.I don’t have words yet for the wind-whipped hours that followed. I remember sending a quick video to the family group chat. I know I careened home, pulled my file marked “Documents” and set out a solar battery pack, hoping it would charge in the smoke-veiled sun. I remember strategizing with my neighbors, and the moment we saw flames.As prepared as I’d tried to be, I evacuated that night with my phone and battery pack but no cord to connect them. True disaster had messed with my brain, shredding my focus on anything smaller than moving our bodies away, fast.A couple of miles south-east of my block, Kelley readied her go bags just as we’d been trained, one for her and one for her 90lb German shepherd/great dane mix, Bucky. She’d already texted her neighbor Linda Mansolillo, an air force reservist with a subspecialty in disaster response (and quite likely the most qualified human ever to graduate from a Santa Monica Cert training). They activated a messaging chain Mansolillo had organized during summer block parties and began assessing who needed help.Kelley was busy, but as scared as she’d ever been, too.“We had no inkling of the devastation happening in the Palisades at that point,” she said. “But you could see flames on the hillside, and I was thinking, if that wind changed … ”It was a sleepless night for Kelley, as it was for many of the 9.6 million of us in LA county. For those on the west side who’d spent the day watching or fleeing the Palisades fire, horror was magnified by early evening reports of the Eaton fire exploding in the east. These weren’t canyon wildfires. They were the most damaging urban firestorms in American history, and they’d keep coming, day after day, relentlessly sparking up with new names.The second night of the disaster, Kelley was finally able to close her eyes.“I knew that between Santa Monica’s systems and my neighbors, there was no danger I’d sleep through an evacuation order,” she said. “We didn’t feel safe from the fires exactly, but we felt like we had each other’s back.”A couple of days later, after I returned to a blessedly standing apartment building and then left again when my chest constricted from toxic air and ash, I dialed Kelley’s number. We didn’t even say hello. She picked up immediately with: “You’ve been on my mind, too.”View image in fullscreenPeople evacuate from Pacific Palisades in January.Photograph: Mike Blake/ReutersTrained Cert volunteersin Malibuwere mobilized recently at the Malibu pier to help fire officials prepare and protect residents returning after evacuations, but in Santa Monica, the emergency management team made the decision to keep us where we were, focused on our neighbors. Ever the trainer, Barker Call sent mea study published in 2024finding that every $1 of investment in resilience and disaster preparedness reduces the damage and cleanup costs of a disaster by $6. Intrigued, I began reaching out to other disaster-recovery researchers.“I’m a big fan of Cert,” said the University of Southern California civil engineering professorCostas Synolakis, who has studied responses to tsunamis and wildfires around the world. “I like the idea of self-organizing. You saw it in this fire. The fire department was clearly spread way too thin. In post-fire emergency response, you need trained volunteers who already know the neighborhood.”We saw this happen in western North Carolina last autumn as well, after Hurricane Helene wiped out roads and infrastructure, leaving people cut off from first responders. Thousands of people were on their own for the hours, days and sometimes weeks it took for outside assistance to make it in, and thousands more lived without power or water longer than they ever had before. Emergency response systems at all levels are stretched thin by a quickening drumbeat of climate-intensified “events”, from killer heatwaves to floods, windstorms and wildfires. Over the entirety of the 1980s, the US experienced33 billion-dollar disasters. In the last two years alone, we’ve endured more than 50.“To adapt and mitigate for climate change … you need people,” Synolakis told me. “If you don’t train them, they’re going to get in trouble.”I heard the same from Samantha Montano, an emergency management professor at the Massachusetts Maritime Academy who once taught a Cert class to teenagers at a high school in rural North Dakota.“They understood the material completely,” she said. “I think it’s a really smart and logical thing to do.”But she talked about the limitations of the program, too, including the relatively few people who have even heard of Cert training, not to mention the lack of federal and local funding.Cert is by no means the only way neighbors organize to protect each other after the unthinkable happens. Grassroots mutual aid and environmental justice groups have repeatedly stepped up when government agencies have failed. I do fear that the types of disasters we’re experiencing now will continue to outpace anyone’s adaptation efforts. But having lived through the last month in LA, I can tell you that local organizing helped me and my neighbors cope in ways that may never show up in budgets or studies.One of the youngest trainees in my Cert cohort was Manny Apilado, a soulful and tattooed 31-year-old who works as a bartender and manager at a local beach club. Sunset Boulevard ends at the beach, and on that incomprehensible afternoon when people from the Palisades left their cars on Sunset Boulevard and ran for their lives, some of them ran into Manny.“It was like after 9/11, like they were just out of a war,” he told me on the phone later. “The ashes, the dust on their faces. Some were wearing ski masks or goggles. Two people just fell to the floor.”One man in his 70s fell into Manny’s arms.We’d been taught a section in Cert about “what not to say” to someone in crisis. Things like: “At least you still have … ” or: “Everything will be OK.” Empathy in the moment always trumps talking a survivor out of their feelings.Manny said he had stood there overwhelmed, wanting to provide refuge as he was realizing any foolproof zones of safety were gone.“There were no words,” Manny told me. “All I could say was: ‘I’m here for you.’”Explore more on these topicsCalifornia wildfiresLos AngelesCaliforniaWest CoastWildfiresfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I speak English and French, not American. And I pronounce it ‘about’ – not ‘a boot’.”The crowd, indifferent at first, grows increasingly enthusiastic as the man works his way through a catalogue of Canadian stereotypes, passing from diffidence to defiance before the climactic cry: “Canada is the second largest landmass! The first nation of hockey! And the best part of North America! My name is Joe! And I am Canadian!”The ad, for Molson Canadian beer, was immensely popular when it aired in 2000. And now, with Canada’s identity and sovereignty under threat, it has roared back into the public consciousness.In recent weeks, Canadian patriotism has surged in response to Donald Trump’s suggestion that the US could annex its northern neighbour. His threats have prompted an outpouring of disbelief and defiance, but – in a very Canadian way – they has also revived questions over the complexities of national identity.View image in fullscreenBhangra dancer Gurdeep Pandher performs on Canada Day in Ottawa, Ontario in 2022.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesTrump began his campaign of diplomatic trolling before he had even assumed office, questioning Canada’s viability as a nation, suggesting that it could become the 51st American state, and deriding the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, as a “governor”.In response, Canadians have taken to acts of patriotism, small and large: one pilotflew his small plane in the shape of a maple leaf; sports fans have booed US teams;hats insisting “Canada is not for sale”have gone viral; consumers havepledged to buy only Canadian-made products– a pledge skewered in aviralsketch in which one shopper berates another for buying American ketchup.Canada’s Liberal party was left for dead, but Trump might have just given it a second chanceRead more“What the hell are you doing?” he asked “We’re in a trade war, you traitor!”“It’s been absolutely crazy and overwhelming,” said Dylan Lobo, who runs MadeInCa, a website that catalogues products made in-country. “We’re struggling to keep up with all the listings. People are really frustrated and they want to find a way to support Canadian and buy Canadian.”Politicians, aware of a looming election, have wrapped themselves in the flag. And in a show of bipartisan unity, five former prime ministers have called for Canadian unity.“We all agree on one thing: Canada, the true north, strong and free, the best country in the world, is worth celebrating and fighting for,” the leaders wrote in a statement.A recent poll found pro-Canadian sentiment has surged in recent weeks – with the biggest leap towards patriotism found in francophone Quebec,a region historically ambivalent towards federal patriotism.View image in fullscreenCanada fans dressed as Royal Canadian Mounted Police at the Fifa World Cup on 27 November 2022 in Doha, Qatar.Photograph: Fantasista/Getty ImagesThe shift marks a dramatic rebound from 2020, when the divisive policies of the coronavirus pandemic shifted how many Canadians viewed the flag – especially afterthe maple leaf was appropriated by the by far-right Freedom Convoy protests in Ottawa.At the same time, new stress has been put on Canadian national identity amid growing recognition of the historical injustices perpetrated against Indigenous peoples.Statues of monarchsand founding statesmen have been pulled down, and buildings renamed amid a heated national discussion about the legacy of colonial rule.“Trump’s comments on annexation have certainly awakened something in people,” said Wilfred King, the chief of Gull Bay First Nation. “But I think we also need to remember on both side of the border, that Indigenous people in Canada are the only ones that can really speak about true sovereignty in this country.”Unlike in other colonial conquests, King said, the Crown made alliances with Indigenous peoples in what is now Canada. “There was no surrender to outside forces.”“When crisis and conflict came, we answered the call. Indigenous people volunteered more than any other group to fight alongside their allies in both world wars,” said King, whose father served in the second world war. “When they returned home, they were marginalized. They saw what it was like to be betrayed by a friend.”And so the fraught nature of Canada’s relationship with the US is jarringly familiar to the country’s first peoples. “They’re only feeling what we’ve been feeling for the last 175 years. It’s how the government has treated First Nations in Canada.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: HelloWorld Images/AlamyFor Jeff Douglas, who played Joe Canada in popular the 2000 ad campaign, the recent surge of nationalism has brought mixed feelings.“Patriotism wasn’t something that ever really resonated with me and I was very ignorant about the totality of Canadian history when we made the ad,” he said.Douglas, who later became an acclaimed radio host for the CBC, says decades spent meeting different groups across the country has deepened his understanding of Canada’s complicated, and dark, history.“I think that we can still be proud. We just have to be aware – and then being aware of the wrongs of the past and the continuing wrongs in the present doesn’t mean that we can’t be proud to be Canadian. Pride in being Canadian cannot come at the cost of that awareness,” he said.And while he says a “blind” shift towards patriotism doesn’t serve the broader goals of fixing injustices, it also reflects the “dynamic” nature of people’s relationship with their country.“There are going to be times where you’re going to need to just say, ‘We need to be strong and face forward if that’s what the country needs to get through the existential threat we’re facing,’” he said.Douglas is hopeful the current fixation on buttressing Canadian identity in the face of threats to the country will serve a broader purpose.“My love of the country, or rather the people of the country, is a love of what we potentially could achieve, and it is richer when I understand the complexity of where we’ve been and where we are. We can grow. But it’s important to remember that you can love something that’s imperfect.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS foreign policyUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In breaks from classes, he would wander the streets of the city taking pictures. Nearly all those images were unprinted and until recently existed only as negatives. A new book,Tall Socks, collects that work for the first time.This picture of a kid with his hand in the bubble gum machine is freighted with the weight of time and place of that backstory; those of us of a certain age will be able to recall the exact fairground feel and resistance of the handle that ejected the gum in its little plastic pod, as well as that eternal childish hope that someone might, this time, have left the prize – with its free-gift creepy-crawly – in the chute, waiting to be discovered.Cohen’s pictures themselves, as you turn the page, carry a similar sense of anticipation. They capture that period, before attempts to sanitise the street life of the city, when New York’s more desperate characters seemed to emerge from the subways in an endless stream. The ordinary faces that Cohen found, from Manhattan to the Bowery to Coney Island, demand a soundtrack from the Velvet Underground and a shot at fame at the Factory.Some are carrying things; one woman strides purposefully through Cohen’s frame with a bundle of peacock feathers under her arm; a boy carries a plank that could be a coffin lid. If flesh is on show, somebody always seems to be grabbing for it; when money changes hands, it carries the sweat of a thousand transactions. It is no surprise that these streets gave rise to the noir films of that period; as Cohen’s pictures show, all you had to do was go outside and look, and stories came at you from all sides.Tall Socksis published in April by Gost(£50)Explore more on these topicsPhotographyThe big pictureArt and design booksNew YorkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I find it very astonishing.”Nnamdi, a dual national and father of two, had been wanted by Nigerian authorities since 2015 after setting up a digital radio station, Radio Biafra, at his London home around the time when mass Biafra secessionist protests erupted in Nigeria for the first time since thecivil war.He fled while on bail in 2017, after Nigerian security forces stormed his residence in Nigeria in an operation coded “Python Dance”, according to court documents. At least 28 members of Ipob were killed.In 2021, Nnamdi was arrested by Nigerian authorities in Kenya and taken to Nigeria in an act of extraordinary rendition – an unlawful inter-state transfer – family, lawyers, the UN and a Nigerian court have said. He has since pleaded not guilty to 15 criminal charges relating to terrorism and treason, seven of which he still faces.The British government faced a legal challenge from Kingsley Kanu over itshandling of the case, which was ultimately dismissed. However, the judge found, citing the Nigerian court, that Nnamdi had been subject to extraordinary rendition, despite the refusal by a number of former foreign secretaries to take such a view.In 2023, a UK court of appealjudgmentsaid the government position “might well be different” if the Nigerian supreme court upheld a ruling by the Nigerian court of appeal that Nnamdi had been extraordinarily rendered.Despite the Nigerian supreme court now having done this, Kingsley said the government had turned its back on his brother. He said the Nigerian supreme court ruling in December 2023 provided a clear route for the UK government to take action. But Kingsley has yet to hear from Starmer, the fourth prime minister during the period of his brother’s detention.A spokesperson for the Foreign Office said: “We are providing consular support to Mr Kanu and remain in contact with his family and legal representatives. We have raised his case with the Nigerian authorities.”Nnamdi has monthly consular visits, according to his brother, who is able to communicate with him through lawyers and his younger brother. His family and lawyers have previously raised concerns over Nnamdi’s treatment after he has been held largely in solitary confinement, in poor conditions and without access to medical treatment for a heart condition.“The high court and Nigeria have spoken,” Kingsley said. “We have to stand on that, we have to implement that.”The Nigerian embassy has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsNigeriaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Among them was a woman with her baby on her back.”A local official confirmed the cave-in, while the Kenieba goldminers’ association also put the death toll at 48.The search for victims was ongoing, the head of an environmental organisation said.Saturday’s accident took place at an abandoned site formerly operated by a Chinese company, sources told AFP.In January, a landslide at a goldmine in southern Mali killed at least 10 people and left many others missing, most of them women.Just over a year ago, a tunnel collapsed at a goldmining site in the same region as Saturday’s landslide, killing more than 70 people.Explore more on these topicsMaliMiningAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Two years later he started hosting meetings in his home city for LGBTQ+ Muslims, who treated him like their community imam. “I opened my garage, put a carpet down and invited people to have tea and talk,” hetold the Guardianin 2022.In 2011 Hendricks bolstered his role as an imam figure by setting up a mosque space after a friend endured a local sermon condemning homosexuality. “I said, ‘Maybe it’s time we started our own space, so people can pray without being judged’.”He ran the Al-Ghurbaah mosque at Wynberg near his birthplace, Cape Town. The mosque provides “a safe space in which queer Muslims and marginalised women can practise Islam”, its website states.Hendricks, the subject of a 2022 documentary called The Radical, had previously alluded to threats against him.He told the Guardian he had been advised to hire bodyguards but said he never feared attacks and insisted that “the need to be authentic” was “greater than the fear to die”.Hendricks, who had worked as an Arabic language teacher and fashion designer, was 29 when he came out to his mother. Born into a Muslim family, he married a woman, had children, then divorced before revealing his sexuality to his family, eight years after his father died.South Africa has one of the world’s highest murder rates, with 28,000 murders in the year to February 2024, according to police data.Explore more on these topicsSouth AfricaIslamReligionAfricaLGBTQ+ rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

The Nordelta sits within the Paraná Delta,an environmentally importantwetland home to dense flora, an abundance of birds and dozens of species of mammals.Silvia Soto and a group of neighbours known as “Nordelta Capybaras – We Are Your Voice” say the plans should be halted, dispute that there is an overpopulation problem and criticise property developers for ignoring proposals to create biological corridors and protected areas.“For years, we have been asking for different, linked green areas that function as natural reserves connected by biological corridors, to protect the capybaras and preserve their survival and coexistence in their own natural space,” Soto said, adding that the group’s surveys had “not been taken into account”.Environmentalists are also now weighing in and calling on the government to protect the capybaras, which are the world’s largest rodent, and the wetlands.Explore more on these topicsArgentinaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

There was a cost before that, when they were being held in prison.“But no cost has been greater than the cost to the Australian community of their crimes.”Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailIt is expected lawyers representing the trio will mount a legal challenge against the government to determine whether the resettlement is lawful.Burke said the Commonwealth would respond with “very strong positions”, noting the laws had been drafted after considering “every available precedent”.The three individuals will remain in immigration detention for at least seven days before they are flown to Nauru.Burke said that once in Nauru, the three men would reside in individual facilities with a shared kitchen space, be free to move around the island and would have working rights.A short history of Nauru, Australia’s dumping ground for refugeesRead moreJana Favero, deputy chief executive of the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre , said the announcement suggested those not born in Australia would never be treated equally.“To see this play out in the media, possibly just before an election is called, sets a dangerous precedent and raises serious questions about the fairness of these actions,” she said.“There has to be consideration of the lawfulness of banishing people offshore, when they’ve been living as part of our community – it’s a complete disregard of people’s human rights.”The Greens senator, David Shoebridge, accused the federal government of pandering to the opposition by choosing a “divisive and dehumanising path”.“This posturing by Labor doesn’t build their brand, all it does is legitimise Dutton’s brutal rhetoric on migration and citizenship,” he said.“No one is in immigration detention because they have committed a crime. They are in immigration detention because of a visa issue.“Make no mistake, history has told us what will happen next: people will die, families will be separated, and the major parties will still blame migrants for problems they created.”Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

There is a lot of hurt out there. More than ever the artist’s voice is needed.”Guardian Australia understands that the legal academic and author Larissa Behrendt was the only board member not present for the unanimous decision.On Monday the board said it would commission a review of the process that resulted in Sabsabi and Dagostino’s selection.The terms of reference have yet to be released but the Guardian understands the independent review will not look into the decision to withdraw the pair from the 2026 international event.The five-member selection panel included Prof Anthony Gardner, the head of the Ruskin School ofArtat the University of Oxford, Dunja Rmandić, the director of the Mornington Peninsula Regional Gallery, Dr Mariko Smith, the First Nations curator at the Australian Museum, Wassan Al-Khudhairi, a curator of contemporary art from the Arab world and Elaine Chia, the executive director of the Naomi Milgrom Foundation.None of the panellists have so far commented on the board’s decision to rescind their selection.The move to rescind the invitationhas been condemnedby many artists and leading art organisations, who say it sets a concerning precedent for artistic freedom and independence within cultural institutions.The federal arts ministerTony Burkehas denied allegations of political interference, despite expressing his “shock” at Sabsabi’s work in the hours before the board dumped him.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Here’s what happened last timeRead more“I support that they’ve made the decision, but it’s been made at arm’s length from me,” he said.“I have seen this artist’s work over the years, and aside from that work I will say he is an extraordinary and gifted artist. I was looking forward, as I think everyone at Creative Australia was, to the work that he’d been commissioned to do at the Venice Biennale.”The move has garnered global attention, with the London-based The Art Newspaper reporting on the accusations of “cowardice” that have been levelled against Creative Australia. The international art publication e-flux haspublished a letter by the five shortlisted teamsdemanding Sabsabi’s reinstatement.The Greens’ spokesperson for the arts, SenatorSarah Hanson-Young, said the board’s about-face was a “big mistake and must be reversed and investigated”.“We need a full independent inquiry into the crisis,” Hanson-Young said. “The integrity of Creative Australia is on the line.“Artistic expression must be free from political interference and intimidation. This is nothing short of an international arts embarrassment for Australia.”Contacted for comment, Creative Australia said it had nothing further to add to the statement it released on Thursday.That statement said the board “believes a prolonged and divisive debate about the 2026 selection outcome poses an unacceptable risk to public support for Australia’s artistic community and could undermine our goal of bringing Australians together through art and creativity”.Explore more on these topicsArtVenice BiennaleRaceTony BurkeAustralian politicsAustralian GreensSarah Hanson-YoungnewsShareReuse this content"

The Amazonian artistAycoobowas celebrated, as were carvings by the Māori artistFred Graham. The eventual winner of the Golden Lion – the event’s highest accolade – was theIndigenous Australian artist Archie Moore.View image in fullscreenArchie Moore with the Golden Lion award.Photograph: Andrea Merola/EPAThe biennale’s curator,Adriano Pedrosa, said the event’stheme of Strangers Everywhereincluded “the Indigenous artist, frequently treated as a foreigner in their own land”. Now Indigenous artistshad seemingly taken over.The influence of Venice is reaching these shores. After the event,Tate launched a fundaimed at increasing the representation of Indigenous works in its collection. This year it will host a retrospective of the Indigenous Australian artist Emily Kam Kngwarray, while Ames Yavuz gallery, a specialist in Indigenous Australian art, is to open a London outpost this spring.View image in fullscreenKith and Kin by Archie Moore at the Venice Biennale. Moore, an Indigenous Australian artist, won the Golden Lion – the event’s highest accolade.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianCurators and artists have spoken about this being a time of overdue recognition, while others are cautious about the longevity of this moment. “It’s definitely the zeitgeist at the moment,” said Dianne Tanzer of the Australian gallery This Is No Fantasy, which is exhibiting the Indigenous artist Johnathon World Peace Bush at Frieze Cork Street in central London from 27 February.“At some stage who knows when it becomes unfashionable … it’s like everything in life, it’s not going to be forever but we hope we get the best of it while it lasts,” she added.“It’s not a bubble,” said Pippy Houldsworth, whose gallery is showing the Indigenous American artist Mario Martinez’s first UK show. “Look at the huge excitement about black artists over the last few years. That hasn’t come and gone by any means, it’s just brought greater recognition to a greater number of people who have been sidelined in the past.”Since Venice, a backlash has emerged. In December 2024, Harper’s Magazine ran acover feature by the Spike magazine critic Dean Kissick. He observed that all the major biennales he had visited in recent years had embraced “overlooked artists from the 20th century and exhibited recycled junk, traditional craft, and folk art”.View image in fullscreenEmily Kam Kngwarray’s work at the National Gallery of Australia. Her work will be shown at the Tate this year.Photograph: © Emily Kam Kngwarray/Copyright Agency. Licensed by DACS 2025The art world’s worthy fixation on all things “identity” had, he said, replaced the “spectacle and innovation” of work from a decade ago.Kelli Cole, a curator at the National Gallery of Australia, said inthe context of a new Trump presidencyand a political shift to the right, Indigenous shows could face further criticism. “Trump is in now and people are being accused of being too politically correct. Are we going to get questions at the Tate: has the gallery become politically correct because it’s showing a black woman from Australia rather than a ‘key’ male artist?”For Indigenous artists such as Martinez, there’s an expectation that they will create a certain type of art. His practice is focused on abstract paintings, some of which allude to his heritage as a member of the Pascua Yaqui Tribe of Arizona.“Indigenous artists have always had abstraction, whether it’s through spirituality or art,” said Martinez, who had a solo show at Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of the American Indian. “But people are often surprised by my work, even native curators.”View image in fullscreenMario Martinez’s work. The Indigenous American artist will have his first UK show this year.Photograph: courtesy the artist, Pippy Houldsworth Gallery, London, and Garth Greenan Gallery, New York. © Mario Martinez 2025.But far from being a flash in the pan “moment”, curators and artists say the recognition of Indigenous artists around the world and a greater understanding of their work has been built up over the last two decades.Tanzer and Nicola Stein of This Is No Fantasy said they first took artists,including Michael Cookin 2015, to satellite events at the Venice Biennale rather than the main event, slowly attracting audiences and buyers.“It feels like it’s pivoted quickly but it’s actually been a very slow burn,” said Stein, who praised Judith Ryan, a curator and academic, forcollecting and writing about Indigenous art yearsbefore it hit the mainstream. “It’s taken time for it to be celebrated and for it to find its place within the contemporary art world.”Johnathon World Peace Bush is at Frieze No.9 Cork Street from 27 February to 15 March; Mario Martinez is at Pippy Houldsworth Gallery from 21 February to 22 March; Emily Kam Kngwarray is at Tate Modern from 10 July to 11 January 2026.Explore more on these topicsArtVenice Biennale 2024Indigenous AustraliansIndigenous peoplesIndigenous artExhibitionsnewsShareReuse this content"

In simple terms, that means that for the same output, fewer than half as many houses are being completed.A more comprehensive “value-added” measure, which factors in quality improvements and increases in housing size, still shows productivity declined by 12%.LiveHow did Australia's housing market get so bad, and is it all negative gearing's fault? – videoIf the broader economy (where productivity increased 49% over the same 30-year period) moved at the same pace as the construction sector, average wages would be 41% lower, the report found.“Australian housing is increasingly unaffordable [and] decades of inadequate supply coupled with high demand has driven this outcome,” the report said.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThe commission chair, Danielle Wood, said governments had been focused on changing planning rules to boost new home supply but addressing the speed and cost of building was also important.“Too many Australians, particularly younger Australians, are struggling to afford a home in which to live,” Wood said. “Lifting the productivity of homebuilding will deliver more homes, regardless of what is happening with the workforce, interest rates or cost.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Some are now being forced to leaveRead moreThey must be out by midnight on Sunday or face large fines, according to the notices.Beau Haywood, thefounder of local food charity Nourish Street, said the goods people were storing were all the possessions they owned and they didn’t own any private land to store it on because they were homeless.“I think they’re trying to make homelessness illegal in Moreton Bay,” he said.A spokesperson for the City of Moreton Bay said they were not attempting to make homelessness illegal.The notice warns failure to comply can attract a penalty between 5 and 50 penalty units, worth between $806 and $8,065. Only a court can impose fines greater than the lowest amount.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailResidents of a second tent city in the municipality, at Woody Point, were issued a move on directive by police earlier this week. They were given seven days to leave, with that deadline also set at midnight Sunday.In December, councillors amended local laws to ban people keeping pets in public spaces or living in vehicles. The council has not issued any fines for the new laws, but has handed out warning notices which have forced some people into tents.Many of the residents said they had not been offered temporary emergency accommodation by state government staff, which is standard practice for homeless clearances.A spokesperson for the housing minister said the department’s critical response team attended the site on Friday and “offered temporary emergency accommodation to every person they interacted with”.The team will visit the area for a second time on Monday to “continue to offer temporary emergency accommodation to those sleeping rough and connect people with [social housing services] in the Moreton Bay region”.View image in fullscreen‘There’s always worser options, but no one wants to think about that stuff, you know?’ … Alan, one of the homeless residents being moved on.Photograph: Andrew Messenger/The GuardianTrent Heselden has lived in the park with his partner for nine months, but has been waiting on the social housing waiting list for six years.

Other compliance notices related to camping with animals, which is prohibited under council’s local laws.”On Sunday, hundreds of people could be seen at Suttons Beach park, some having barbecues and others swimming at the beach.The council spokesperson said the local government has had a 90% increase in the number of people experiencing homelessness in the last decade, according to 2021 Census data.The premier, David Crisafulli, said it was important to ensure individuals had the right to enjoy public spaces, but it was equally important to “do all we can put a roof over the head of people who are vulnerable”.“I’ve seen the images, and I’ve seen the frustration from not only the community, but also our MPs in the local area,” Crisafulli said on Sunday.Explore more on these topicsHomelessnessQueenslandHousingnewsShareReuse this content"

The comments came just beforeemergency talks with European leadersin Paris on Monday.The leaders will aim to devise a strategy in response to Donald Trump’s push for a deal with the Russian president and to fears the US will reduce its defence commitments inEurope.Starmer said the crisis was a “once in a generation moment” and an “existential” question forEurope.Writing in the Daily Telegraph, he said the UK was “ready to play a leading role” in Ukraine’s defence and security, including the commitment of £3bn a year until 2030. Starmer said that along with military aid, “it also means being ready and willing to contribute to security guarantees toUkraineby putting our own troops on the ground if necessary”.“I do not say that lightly. I feel very deeply the responsibility that comes with potentially putting British servicemen and women in harm’s way,” Starmer said.“But any role in helping to guarantee Ukraine’s security is helping to guarantee the security of our continent, and the security of this country.“The end of this war, when it comes, cannot merely become a temporary pause before Putin attacks again.”Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022, UK prime ministers have refused to publicly consider sending British soldiers.Military chiefs believe the UK cannot meet its existing military commitments – even before any involvement in any Ukraine peacekeeping force – within the existing defence budget of £64bn which amounts to 2.33% of GDP. But insiders have said Britain is willing to provide troops to a multinational peacekeeping force if that is what emerges from diplomatic efforts.Labour has promised to increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP but has not set a date as to when, while Trump is calling for all European countries to increase it to 5%. Reports suggest British military chiefs are pushing for an increase over time to 2.65%Starmer had previously suggested that British troops could be involved in safeguarding Ukraine after a ceasefire. The UK’s prime minister, who is due to visit Trump in Washington later this month, said: “While European nations must step up in this moment – and we will – US support will remain critical and a US security guarantee is essential for a lasting peace, because only the US can deter Putin from attacking again.”Representatives of the US administration and Russian counterparts are expected to meet in Saudi Arabia for talks followingTrump’s phone conversation with Putinlast Wednesday.But Ukrainian officials are not expected to be at the table at this stage and other European leaders might not be involved in the process at all.Zelenskyy’s week from hell: shock in Ukraine as Trump abandons KyivRead moreStarmer added: “We must be clear that peace cannot come at any cost. Ukraine must be at the table in these negotiations because anything less would accept Putin’s position that Ukraine is not a real nation.”He also warned of a repeat of the chaos after the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan in August 2021 under Joe Biden, which followed a deal struck with the Taliban under Trump.“We cannot have another situation like Afghanistan, where the US negotiated directly with the Taliban and cut out the Afghan government,” Starmer said.“I feel sure that President Trump will want to avoid this too.”Any stepped-up UK military involvement would add to cost pressures, and the heads of the armed forces met Starmer individually on Friday to discuss the state of the military at a time when the army is struggling for numbers and is at its smallest size in over 200 years.A defence source said the chiefs were not seeking to lobby the PM explicitly over defence spending but rather to “build up the PM’s knowledge of the armed forces” as a defence review led by the former Nato chief George Robertson heads towards its conclusion.The service heads believe that despite Treasury concerns over additional spending, it is impossible for the UK to maintain existing political commitments to Nato, the Aukus nuclear submarine programme and next-generation fighter jets within existing budgets.Explore more on these topicsMilitaryKeir StarmerUkraineForeign policyEuropeDonald TrumpVladimir PutinnewsShareReuse this content"

There are fears inEuropethat Russia via the US talks will relaunch its plan for imposed Ukrainian neutrality and a joint US-Russia carve-up with agreed spheres of influence.The Paris meeting will aim to outline a European action plan after days of chaotic briefing by the Trump administration. The summit will also need to decide how to respond to a request by the US to spell out whether leaders are prepared to commit troops to a stabilisation force in the event of a ceasefire.Keir Starmer will attend, as well as Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and Poland’s prime minister, Donald Tusk. France is determined that the UK is closely involved in all future discussions onUkraine.Downing Street said it believed Starmer could play a central role in securing Ukraine’s future by conveying Europe’s warnings against a potential US-Russian carve-up of the country directly to Trump when the prime minister visits Washington DC next week. He will then report back to other European leaders. “It’s not a role we necessarily looked for, but it’s one the PM wants to step into,” a source said.On Sunday night, Starmer told the Telegraph he was prepared to put British troops on the ground in Ukraine to safeguard peace.The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, speaking in an interview from the Munich Security Conference, said he was doubtful that Vladimir Putin was prepared to make concessions and repeated his claim that Russia wasplanning an attack on Nato countries next year. Ukraine and many of its closest European allies believe Putin wants a recasting of the postwar order as his precondition for a ceasefire.Confirming the Paris meeting, France’s foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, toldFranceInter radio on Sunday: “The president will bring together the main European countries tomorrow for discussions on European security.” He said there was a wind of unity blowing through.European diplomatic sources said the Monday afternoon summit would also include Italy and Denmark – representing the Baltic and Scandinavian countries – as well as theNatosecretary general, Mark Rutte, and the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen.It will discuss what defence capabilities Europe could provide to give Ukraine credible security guarantees, including a plan for Ukraine to be given automatic Nato membership in the event of a clear ceasefire breach by Russia. The US has said there must be devastating consequences for any side that breaches a ceasefire agreement, an element missing from previous Ukraine ceasefires since 2014.“Only the Ukrainians can decide to stop fighting,” Barrot said. The Ukrainians “will never stop as long as they are not sure the peace suggested to them will be long-lasting”.An offer of Nato membership conditional on a Russian ceasefire breach – probably requiring the US to remain a backstop guarantor for Ukraine – has been promoted by some US senators and now has the backing of senior European leaders, including Alexander Stubb, the Finnish president. He insisted the door should not be open for a Russian fantasy about spheres of influence.Zelenskyy’s week from hell: shock in Ukraine as Trump abandons KyivRead moreKeith Kellogg, the US special envoy on Ukraine, briefed European leaders in Munich on the US negotiating strategy, which the Polish foreign minister, Radosław Sikorski, described as unorthodox.Neither Ukraine nor European states have been invited to the talks in Riyadh. Kellogg argued their views would be taken into account, and claimed earlier peace talks had foundered due to the large negotiating table.It became evident over the weekend that there were contrasting approaches within the Trump administration towards future talks over Ukraine. Rubio insisted on Sunday that any peace agreement in Ukraine would have to be enduring, fair, and respect Ukrainian sovereignty. He also said Ukraine and Europe would have to be involved in any meaningful talks.“The president expressed his desire to see an end to this conflict in a way that was enduring, and that protected Ukrainian sovereignty, and that was an enduring peace, not that we’re going to have another invasion in three or four years,” Rubio told the CBS programme Face the Nation while on a visit to Israel.Trump last week surprised Ukraine and America’s allies by announcing he had discussed Ukraine’s future in a phone call with Putin on Wednesday. The president said nothing about Ukrainian sovereignty and even suggested that Ukrainians might “be Russian some day”.On Sunday night, Trump told reporters he was working hard to achieve peace and that he believed he would meet Putin “very soon”.Macron has said he is not shocked or surprised by the speed with which Trump is acting to push through a ceasefire bargain, but European officials fear Russia is seeking not only Ukraine’s neutrality through capping the size of its army and the ousting of Zelenskyy, but also a spheres of influence agreement akin to the Yalta agreement signed over the heads of many nations in 1945 by the US, Britain and the Soviet Union.That would put some western countries within “a sphere of coercion in which nations lives in fear”, one official said.European leaders are divided in their response to Trump’s initiatives, with some predicting the opening of a fundamental rupture between Washington and Europe, and others arguing that if Europe can fulfil the US demand to improve its security offer then the transatlantic relationship can be repaired and Europe will find a place at the table on the future of Ukraine.Downing Street said Starmer’s meetings with European leaders and Trump in successive weeks were in part an accident of scheduling, but also reflected the government’s desire to be a bridge to the US. It said Starmer was expected to try to lower the temperature.“Our whole approach is to not be alarmed by anything, but to try and be a calm partner for the US, and to play the role we can, which is to be a bridge,” the No 10 source said. “That’s why we can’t get distracted by things likeJD Vance’s speech. Whatever your view on that, there are much bigger things to focus on.”The EU leaders are also expected to discuss the outlines of a major boost to defence spending triggered by budget increases, and a relaxation of EU debt rules applying to defence investment.“We will launch a large package that has never been seen in this dimension before,” said the German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock. “Similar to the euro or the corona crisis, there is now a financial package for security in Europe. That will come in the near future.”It is likely to be launched after the German elections next weekend.As the US walks away, Europe needs to step up for Ukraine. But does it have the will?Read moreThe phrasing of a call to arms issued to Europe by Zelenskyy in Munich on Saturday was regarded as unhelpful because he couched it in terms of a unified European army, anathema to many voters, but Macron has long argued that a distinctive European force is required. He was also the first nearly a year ago to suggest European forces enter Ukraine on an initial training mission.Sikorski, the Polish foreign minister, said: “If the US wants us to step up in defence, it should have a national component, a Nato component, but I also believe a European EU component, EU subsidies for the defence industry to build up our capacity to produce, but also an EU force worthy of its name.”He reiterated that having Polish troops on the ground in Ukraine was “not a consideration, because Poland’s duty to Nato is to protect the eastern flank, ie, its own territory.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineEuropean UnionRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskyyFranceEmmanuel MacronPolandnewsShareReuse this content"

Russian units had made rapid gains in the area in December and January, seizing a string of settlements and threatening to cut off Pokrovsk.Since early this month, the Russians’ progress has stalled. Russian bloggers say Ukrainian drones dominate the skies and have been methodically destroying armoured vehicles. Russian troops have to walk 10km on foot, with many not arriving alive, they say.The high rate of Russian casualties has had a demoralising effect on forward combat units. Snowy conditions and a lack of tree cover has made it easier for Ukrainian defenders to pick off infantry soldiers before they reached the contact line, they add.map of area of Donetsk showing Pischane and PokrovskSpeaking at the Munich Security Conference, Zelenskyy confirmed that the situation in the Pokrovsk direction had recently improved. The village’s recapture bolsters Kyiv’s argument that Moscow’s victory is not inevitable and that with sufficient western support it can claw back territory. Ukrainian platoons have also counterattacked around the neighbouring village of Kotlyne.Russian advances have been made at a vast human cost. According to Maj Viktor Trehubov, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s ground forces in the east, 7,000 Russian soldiers died in January in the battle for Pokrovsk, and 15,000 are wounded or missing.Zelenskyy said in Munich that the Kremlin was ready to expand its war in Ukraine and toattack Nato. In an interview with the broadcaster NBC, he said Vladimir Putin would take advantage of a weakened alliance should the US pull its military out of Europe.“We believe that Putin will wage war against Nato,” Zelenskyy predicted. He said the Russian president should not be trusted under any circumstances, but emphasised that Donald Trump still had leverage to push him into negotiations.Zelenskyy suggested Putin did not want a genuine peace deal and instead required war “to keep his grip on power”. He said over the previous week Russia had hit Ukraine with nearly 1,220 aerial bombs and more than 850 attack drones, as well as 40 other missiles.“Ukraine is defending … but we need more air defence systems to protect Ukrainians’ lives.Europeand the world must be better protected from such evil and prepared to confront it,” he wrote on social media on Sunday.He added: “This requires a strong, united foreign policy and pressure on Putin, who started this war and is now expanding it globally. Together with Europe, the US and all our partners, we can end this war with a just and lasting peace.”Officials in Kyiv, meanwhile, confirmed Zelenskyy’s statement during the weekend that Ukraine had been kept in the dark over negotiations about a summit between Putin and Trump. “I saw that someone said that there would be a meeting in Saudi Arabia. I do not know what it is,” Zelenskyy said on Saturday.Russia and the US are due to send high-level delegations for talks this week in Saudi Arabia. European countries willmeet on Monday in Paristo discussTrump’s apparent planto carve up Ukraine, with Russia keeping its battlefield gains, in anemergency summithosted by France’s president, Emmanuel Macron.Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the head of Zelenskyy’s office, said Ukraine would not take part in the US-Russia meeting in Riyadh. “There is nothing on the negotiating table that would be worth discussing,” he told Ukrainian TV, stressing: “Russia is not ready for negotiations.”On Sunday, Zelenskyy arrived in the United Arab Emirates, saying his top priority was to ensure “that still more of our people are able to return home from captivity”. He also said investment would be discussed.The UAE has played a key role in overseeing the return home of Ukrainians deported to Russia during the nearly three-year-old war, many of them children.The Kremlin, meanwhile, continued its winter bombing campaign against Ukraine’s energy infrastructure. Late on Saturday several Shahed drones smashed into a thermal power plant in the southern city of Mykolaiv. The attack followed a Russian strike on the Chornobyl nuclear power station’s concrete shelter.According to Mykolaiv’s mayor, Oleksandr Senkevych, the plant was badly damaged. “This was done deliberately to leave people without heat at sub-zero temperatures and create a humanitarian catastrophe,” he wrote on Telegram. More than 100,000 people are without heating.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskyyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

If Vladimir Putin turned on the US in a famous 2007 speech at the conference, in 2025 it was the US that turned on Europe.In a “virulent diatribe against European democracies he accused of stifling freedom of speech and religion”, Vance said the greatest threat to the continent was notRussiaor China but Europe’s own retreat from some of its “most fundamental values”.Worse, his relative silence on “the topic Europe most wanted to hear him on”, Russia’s all-out invasion ofUkraine, “prolongs the incomprehension and confusion over Trump’s initiative aimed at ending the war”, Kauffmann said.“A thick fog now surrounds Washington’s intentions; between the public statements of Vance and the US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, and the various interviews followed by denials, contradictory positions have multiplied,” she said.New York TimesThe US administration had done nothing less than “offer what may be a preview under Mr Trump of a redefinition of a transatlantic relationship built on postwar bonds of stability between allied governments”,the paper said.It too reminded readersof Putin’s 2007 speech in which the Russian president “demanded the rollback of American influence and a new balance of power in Europe more suitable to Moscow”, adding that he “didn’t get what he wanted – then”.Now, top Trump officials had “made one thing clear: Putin has found an American administration that might help him realise his dream”. The comments raised fears the US may now “align with Russia and either assail Europe or abandon it altogether”.Such a shift, the paper said, would amount to “a previously unthinkable victory far more momentous for [Putin] than any objectives in Ukraine”.Süddeutsche ZeitungCommentatorDaniel Brössler saidin the Munich-based Süddeutsche Zeitung that Vance had not come to the German city to give “a friendly wake-up call”, but as “an arsonist”. The US vice-president’s mission was “the triumph of rightwing populism – with the backing of America’s billionaire chief Elon Musk”.His silence on security policy was because “work has already begun on a deal with Putin at the expense of Ukraine, but also of Europe … This much is clear: Trump will make the deal, and the Europeans will have to pay and secure peace militarily.”Europe, Brössler said, was being attacked “by Putin, who has come a good deal closer to his goal of revising the European order in recent days. And by Trump, who no longer even recognises common interests – and certainly not common values.”On the one hand, the US “is demanding Europe finally become capable of defending itself against Russia. On the other, it is backing Putin’s henchmen and appeasers”, from Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, to the Alternative für Deutschland co-leader Alice Weidel.The continent, he said, “will have to rise above itself”.Editorialist Detlef Essinger saidVance had deployed “a trick that populists and authoritarians have used for years … The principle is: accuse others of exactly everything that you do yourself.”This “confuses them. It puts you on the offensive, and your opponents on the defensive. It gives you sovereignty over the terms. And a debate is not won by the person who has the better arguments, but by the person who owns the terms.”The Kyiv Independent“The US administration is ready to hand Russia a win in its brutal war against Ukraine. That’s the only conclusion we can make,” the papersaid in a blunt editorial. The words and acts of Trump and his team go “beyond appeasement”.But, it added, while the US may be “the biggest and richest ally Ukraine has”, it is far from the only one: “That means all eyes are on you, Europe. The real decision on whether Russia wins the war doesn’t actually sit with Trump now – it’s with Europe.”Europe’s leaders, if they are “real leaders of their nations and not political opportunists, need to recognise the urgency of the situation, and act now. After all, if the US is out and Ukraine falls, Europe will be left to face Russia one on one.”Russia, the paper said, “is not at war with Ukraine, it’s at war with the west. And if a significant part of the west deserts, the rest needs to make sure to show up for battle.” Nobody, it said, wanted the war to end more than Ukrainians do.“But we understand that any compromise with Russia won’t be the end of the war. There can’t be a compromise in this war. Russia wins – the west loses. The west wins – Russia loses. Europe, the time is now.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationEuropeUkraineDonald TrumpJD VanceUS foreign policyRussianewsShareReuse this content"

I do not know when he prepares it,” Zelenskyy said. “But it will happen. And at that moment, knowing that he did not succeed in occupying us, we do not know where he will go.”Zelenskyy added that he believed Putin’s next targets could be Poland and Lithuania – which were occupied during the second world war by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union – “because we believe that [Russian president] Putin will wage war against Nato”, the international military alliance formally known as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.Macron convenes European leaders for Ukraine summit amid tension with USRead moreZelenskyy said he had viewed documents indicating that Putin was “preparing to train 150,000 people” in Belarus, a staunch ally of Moscow – and that he had shared that intelligence with allies.The Russian leader, Zelenskyy said, wanted to “show it for the world that it is just training” and would claim “that these are exercises that are always ongoing” in Belarus.“But it’s not truth,” Zelenskyy said. “From such point, he began the occupation [of Ukraine] three years ago. Full-scale war he began from some symbolic trainings. The missiles the first night flew from Belarus, and the invasion came from Belarus.”Zelenskyy insisted he still had trust in Donald Trump’s ability to negotiate with Russia after beginning his second US presidency in January. But Zelenskyy said he would not accept any peace agreement that excluded Ukraine from the negotiating table. He also said that some of the “messages” coming from the US in recent days, such as Vice-President JD Vance’s speech in Munichdenouncing European leaders, and Trump’s comment that Ukraine “may be Russian some day”, were “a disappointment”.In a recentexclusive interview with the Guardian, Zelenskyy stressed that Europe could not guarantee Ukraine’s security without US help – and he returned to the theme in his Meet the Press interview.“There is no leader in the world who can really make a deal with Putin without us about us,” he said, speaking in English.“Of course, the US can have a lot of decisions, economical partnerships, etc. We’re not happy with it, but they can have [them] with [the] Russians. But not about this war without us.“There are messages, which, you know, make disappointment for a lot of leaders ofEurope, because they also feel sometimes that they are out of decisions.“They have to be in unity with the US otherwise, not only [can the] US lose Europe as a strategic partner, Europe also can lose the US.”His comments mirrored the alarm of European leaders at the US’s backpedalling over support for Ukraine, and Trump’s cozying up to Putin in a recent phone call, which many have portrayedas a capitulation.In advance of Vance’s divisive speech at the Munich Security Conference, European powers including Britain, France and Germany said there could beno lasting peace in Ukrainewithout their participation in peace talks.After it, some, including the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz,took Vance to taskfor his comments questioning the future of the decades-old US-European alliance. Scholz also accused the US of “unacceptable interference” in its upcoming election after praise from Vance and the billionaire Elon Musk, Trump’s “special government employee”, for the far-right nationalist party AfD.Zelenskyy, who in Munich on Saturdaycalled for the formation of an armed forces of Europe, told NBC that any weakening of US support for Europe or Nato would open the door to Putin’s plans for a territory grab.“What is he waiting for? For a weakening ofNatoby, for instance, policy of the US, that the US will think to take its military from Europe,” he said.“Yes, Putin thinks of that. But I will believe that the US will not take its forces, its contingents from Europe, because that will severely weaken Nato and the European continent. Putin definitely counts on that, and the fact that we receive information that he will think of the invasion against former Soviet republics.“The risk that Russia will occupy Europe is 100%, not all Europe, they will begin [with] those countries who are our friends, small countries who’ve been in the USSR, in the Soviet Union. Forgive me, but today these are Nato countries.”Explore more on these topicsVolodymyr ZelenskyyNatoUkraineRussiaEuropeDonald TrumpVladimir PutinnewsShareReuse this content"

No member of Hamas would sit on the committee. But the future military status of Hamas within Gaza is unresolved, which is likely to be a barrier to Israeli endorsement of the plan.Arab states – principally the United Arab Emirates and Qatar – are preparing to make financial offers to fund reconstruction, but on the basis that Palestinians are given the right to remain inGazaand are not forced to seek temporary or permanent refuge in Egypt or Jordan. Reconstruction would take three to five years, with 65% of the property in Gaza having been destroyed.European sources admit the issue of providing security guarantees to Israel for Gaza remains unresolved since no Arab country is willing to offer troops in the absence of Israel offering a clear political horizon to a Palestinian state.An Arab summit is due to be held in Riyadh on 27 February at which an alternative to the Trump plan for Gaza is due to be discussed and parts of it revealed.So far Saudi Arabia has not explicitly called forHamasto be excluded from the reconstruction process or governance of Gaza, but Anwar Gargash, a UAE senior diplomatic adviser, praised a recent call from Ahmed Aboul Gheit, the secretary general of the Arab League, for Hamas to step down from the administration of Gaza as “appropriate and rational”.Aboul Gheit said: “The interests of the Palestinian people must come before the interests of the movement [Hamas], especially in light of the calls to displace Palestinians from Gaza, and the resulting war that destroyed the Gaza Strip and tore apart its human and social fabric as a result of its decisions.”He also told the World Governments Summit last week that Trump’s proposal to move the roughly 2 million Palestinians out of Gaza would push the region into a cycle of crises with a damaging effect on peace and stability. “It’s unacceptable for the Arab world, which has fought this idea for 100 years,” he said.It is expected that the committee proposed in the Arab plan would include independent technocrats and representatives of civil society and unions, to ensure that no single faction dominates.Even moderate Arab diplomats say the Trump plan is neither practical nor morally right, but one said: “We have to engage with it and if possible divert people away from it.” A second Arab source said: “A lot of it sounds far-fetched, such as converting Hamas tunnels into a metro network. The idea came out of the blue.”The Palestinian Authority (PA), which governs the West Bank, has not endorsed the committee plan, fearing it could presage a permanent division between the West Bank and Gaza through two separate administrative systems.Jibril Rajoub, of Fatah, which dominates the PA, said the group refused to discuss the idea of the committee, describing it as “a prelude to consecrating division”, and he stressed adherence to what he called “the unity of the government and the regime”.The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, has not ruled out an alternative to the Trump plan but said: “Any plan that leaves Hamas in the Gaza Strip will be a problem, because Israel will not tolerate that,” and thus would be a return to square one.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warHamasPalestinian territoriesIsraelEgyptMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a British-Iranian dual national, was transferred to Kerman after her initial arrest.The couple were heading for Australia, having crossed into Iran from Armenia on 30 December, according to social media posts. From Iran the couple had shared updates, including plans to enter Pakistan next.This week state mediapublished photographspurportedly showing the UK ambassador to Iran, Hugo Shorter, meeting the couple, whom the country has called “national security” suspects.The published photo shows that a meeting on Wednesday was held in the presence of a Kerman prosecutor, Mehdi Bakhshi, and the Kerman governor’s deputy for security and law enforcement, Rahman Jalali.The latest post on the Foremans’ Facebook page, from Isfahan in Iran on 3 January, includes selfies apparently showing the couple, with the caption: “What a wonderful place.”A Foreign Office spokesperson said: “We are providing consular assistance to two British nationals detained in Iran and are in contact with the local authorities.”The UK government advises that British and dual nationals are at significant risk of arrest, questioning or detention in Iran, and that a British passport or UK connections “can be reason enough” to be detained by Iranian authorities.At least 66 foreign and dual nationals have been detained by Iran since 2010, according to research published by the University of Essex in 2022, as part of a growing practice of “politically motivated arrests” that has been decried by Human Rights Watch.After the death in September 2022 of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian of Kurdish origin who had been arrested three days earlier for allegedly breaching the Islamic dress code for women, at least 40 foreign and dual nationals were arrested.Ratcliffe said of the Foremans: “The top priority for the government should be to make sure they get to visit and that they are not being kept in solitary. It will be important they do not feel alone. A court process may soon come. It’s not a real court. But it will be a form of brutal theatre to get the government’s attention.”Mehran Raoof, a dual national and labour rights activist, has been in prison in Iran since 2020 facing national security-related charges.Explore more on these topicsForeign policyIranNazanin Zaghari-RatcliffeMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Sado Junaid, whose sister and brother-in-law were detained and tortured in the squat facility’s underground prison, sided with Mahmoud al-Bashar, who as they spoke sometimes held the black coil of wire and a black-and-white rod once used to beat him and other detainees.They clashed with another young recruit about whether they should be allowed to torture officers from the deposed regime ofBashar al-Assadbefore any accused of crimes face trial, or whether suspects should be immediately delivered to Syria’s nascent justice system.“I just want to meet one of them and torture them as they did to me,” said Bashar.“If you saw someone who tortured your father, your brother, your loved one, can you really say you would deal with them peacefully?” said Junaid. He only wanted to hurt those who had harmed his family, he said, although he conceded he would not recognise their names or faces if he passed them on the street.Homs was known as the cradle of the uprising against Assad, where Syria’s Alawite and Sunni communities have long lived in close quarters.View image in fullscreenA boy carrying a small child passes a clock tower, a well=known symbol of Homs, draped with the new Syrian flag.Photograph: David Lombeida/The GuardianThe diverse city has grown tense since Assad’s fall, as security forces loyal to the new caretaker government conduct sweeping raids targeting groups loyal to the deposed dictatorship. Homs’ Alawites, including many who once filled the ranks of Assad’s army and security forces, say they are terrified of reprisal attacks, and whisper about kidnappings and violence targeting members of their sect.Junaid was quick to say he had no issue with the Alawite people, but he hoped to see justice served “for those who committed crimes”, even as the identities of those he wanted to stand trial remained opaque.“The good Alawites who committed no crimes can live peacefully, as long as they don’t establish sleeper cells,” he said, in a nod to the frequent spasms of violence that continue to plague Homs. From the perspective of Homs’ Sunnis, the source of the problem was remnants of the former regime. For Alawites, it is armed extremists they say are targeting civilians, accusing the new government of turning a blind eye.“We live in constant fear and instability now,” said Abu Mohammed, an Alawite former three-star captain in Assad’s army. He had barely left his house since the Assad regime fell, he said, instead spending his days frantically scrolling social media where descriptions of attacks on Alawite villages outside Homs were rampant, although often difficult to verify.View image in fullscreenMembers of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the group that toppled Assad, stand guard in central Homs.Photograph: David Lombeida/The GuardianMohammed and his former army colleague Mahmud Ibrahim said they felt abandoned by the upper echelons of the military who had either fled or were in hiding, leaving them facing an uncertain future.Mohammed had been to one of the settlement centres set up by the new authority, where security and military personnel turn in their weapons in exchange for papers saying they have surrendered and regularised their status. He described witnessing Sunni militants assault an Alawite student who they had pulled from a nearby bus as he waited in a queue outside the settlement centre. He had since avoided the checkpoints staffed by fighters that ring the city, fearing the piece of paper he obtained from the settlement centre would do little to protect him.“Both of us want to return to the army – but also to get a salary,” said Ibrahim, frustrated at being out of work despite his former status as a military recruiter. Mohammed scoffed at the idea they could volunteer for the new local security forces like Junaid and the others, who earn the equivalent of £80 a month in foreign currency. Guarding buildings, he said, was beneath their former military status.For the people of Homs, the violence of the Assad regime was intimate. Security services largely made up of Alawites raided the homes of their neighbours in majority-Sunni neighbourhoods, often a short drive from the imposing detention centres ringed with barbed wire, where the officers surveilled their neighbours. Officials worked house by house to crack down on anyone accused of joining protests against Assad’s rule that began in 2011, with Homs witnessing the largest demonstrations in Syria, as well as mass arrests in response.View image in fullscreenA young boy walks in the Baba Amr district of Homs, where many buildings are still damaged or destroyed from bombing and raids during the Assad regime.Photograph: David Lombeida/The GuardianSwaths of the city bear the scars of the civil war that followed, when the Assad regime attacked its own citizens with airstrikes and shelling. Neighbourhoods whose names became synonymous with destruction by Assad’s forces, such asBaba Amr, where Bashar said he once fought, contain whole blocks ground into little more than pockmarked foundations and dust.Some residents such as Bashar say they know the identities of those who abused or surveilled them, raising the spectre that victims of the Assad regime’s violence against its own people could one day encounter those responsible on the streets of Homs. While many of the notorious names such as the former head of the political security directorateHusam Loukafled with Assad to Moscow, many of the lower-ranking officers and security personnel who could not afford to leave the country are now in hiding, either in Homs or the nearby Alawite heartland of Latakia.“All those remnants of the former regime are hiding in their homes, down to the former traffic police,” said Salman Shbeeb, an Alawite former politician who said he had encouraged changes from the Assad regime and had been detained and questioned under Assad and his father, Hafez, who was president until his death in 2000.“They’ve even got new, Sunni recruits directing the traffic now,” he added.View image in fullscreenAn Hayat Tahrir al-Sham soldier directs traffic in Homs.Photograph: David Lombeida/The GuardianAt busy intersections across city, these tensions were laid bare as fighters from Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the group that toppled Assad, stood guard. At the entrance to one majority-Alawite neighbourhood, militants loitered next to an anti-aircraft missile mounted on a flatbed truck. Elsewhere in the city, fighters ringed a roundabout near a Sunni neighbourhood, saying they were there to keep the Alawite and Sunni communities apart after an Alawite protest got out of hand when a militia joined in.“Our goal is to stop the fighting,” said Abu Salem Hawash, a HTS fighter standing guard. Their presence was intended “to push the Sunnis away and protect the Alawites”, he said.Another fighter, Abu Mossah Kermaz, said he was among the forces raiding Alawite homes, and was adamant that suggestions of reprisal attacks were lies. The militants had been careful to treat people with respect when they went inside looking for people, he said, adding that they had directed all the women in the house to one room and asked homeowners to keep hold of their valuable items and electronics.“The new government will solve all these problems soon, god willing,” he added. What the new authority in Damascus may do other than target remnants of the former regime remained unclear.Ibrahim and Mohammed said they had attempted to establish a kind of neighbourhood watch group, but said local Sunni forces had prevented this. Confined to their homes and fearful, they were desperate to find something to do.“Maybe they will allow us to protect our neighbourhoods, without guns, but we’re not even allowed to gather in big numbers,” said Mohammed.Ibrahim was bolder with his frustrations. “If the Sunnis continue like this for another few months, maybe the Alawites will call for the return of a president like Assad. Maybe they’ll even call for his return,” he said.Explore more on these topicsSyriaBashar al-AssadMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Rubio and Netanyahu blamed Iran for the violence in the Middle East and insisted Tehran would be stopped from developing nuclear weapons.Trump’s shock proposal earlier this month for a “Riviera of the Middle East” has been condemned around the world as a blueprint for ethnic cleansing, but Rubio and Netanyahu insisted it would proceed.“We discussed Trump’s bold vision for Gaza’s future and will work to ensure that vision becomes a reality,” Netanyahu told reporters after the meeting, which overran by an hour. “We have a common strategy, and we can’t always share the details of this strategy with the public”.He did say, however, that it included opening “the gates of hell” on Gaza, a phrased used by Trump, if all the Israeli hostages held by Hamas and other militant groups were not released.Rubio promoted the Trump plan as a breakthrough. “It may have shocked and surprised many,” he said. “But what cannot continue is the same cycle where we repeat over and over again and wind up in the exact same place.”Neither Rubio nor Netanyahu answered questions at their press event in Jerusalem. Israel’s finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, said on Saturday night that he hoped the mass transfer of Palestinians from Gaza endorsed by Trump could begin soon. He said he expected Palestinians would be forced to leave by a resumption of bombing.“It’s a process I hope will begin in the coming weeks,” he told Israel’s Channel 12. “Even if it’s slow at first, it will gradually pick up pace and intensify. There won’t be anything for the Gazans in Gaza for the next 10 to 15 years. After we go back to fighting, and all of Gaza looks like Jabaliya, there definitely will be nothing for them there.”Smotrich was referring to Jabaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza, which was flattened by blanket bombing during 15 months of conflict.View image in fullscreenThe destruction caused by Israel’s attacks on Jabaliya in northern Gaza.Photograph: Abed Hajjar/APHe said that ultimately the vast majority of Palestinians would want to leave, and that the challenges for Israel would be finding countries willing and able to take 2 million Palestinians, coupled with “the huge logistical operation to get such vast numbers of people out of here”.The planned removal of Palestinians from Gaza is a potential crime against humanity. The international court of justice is already examining allegations of genocide against Israel, and the international criminal court (ICC) has issued arrest warrants against Netanyahu and his former defence minister, Yoav Gallant, for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza.Netanyahu denounced both courts for what he called “lawfare”, thanked theTrump administrationfor placing sanctions on the ICC, and suggested more joint action against international judicial institutions was being planned.“The secretary and I discussed working together to formulate a common strategy to deal with the threat of lawfare and neutralise this threat once and for all,” he said.Neither Netanyahu nor Rubio addressed the terms of the Gaza ceasefire, other than to demand the return of all hostages. The Israeli prime minister depends on Smotrich’s party for his governing coalition to survive, and the latter restated his opposition to the current deal and his desire to see it collapse.“The current deal is bad but I very much hope it is temporary,” Smotrich said in his Saturday night interview.The Israeli government is reportedly seeking to change theterms of the agreementwith Washington’s backing. It is calling for the six surviving hostages who remain in Gaza scheduled to be released in the first phase of the agreement to be freed all at once next Saturday, rather than in two groups of three over the final two weeks of the first phase, which ends on 1 March.Netanyahu’s office said on Sunday he had told US Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, that Israel’s security cabinet would convene on Monday to discuss the second phase. The agreement had envisaged the talks would start in the first week of February, but he had so far prevented negotiators from discussing the issue.Israeli political analysts say he fears that the implementation of the second phase could trigger the collapse of his coalition, leading to new elections and increasing his legal jeopardy in his trial on corruption charges.In an embodiment of the Trump administration’s unconditional support for Israel, a shipment of US-made heavy bombs arrived in the port of Ashdod on Saturday night.The Biden administration had suspended delivery of the 2,000lb (907kg) MK-84 bombs on the grounds that they were too indiscriminate and could cause too many civilian casualties in a densely populated area such as Gaza. Trump immediately lifted the ban when he assumed office.The Israeli defence minister, Israel Katz, said in a statement on Sunday morning: “The munitions shipment that arrived in Israel tonight, released by the Trump administration, represents a significant asset for the air force and the IDF, and serves as further evidence of the strong alliance between Israel and the United States.”At Sunday’s press statement in Jerusalem, Netanyahu and Rubio began their presentations on Iran, which they said was primarily responsible for all the instability and violence in the region. Netanyahu said they agreed that Tehran could never have nuclear weapons and that “Iran’s aggression in the region has to be rolled back”.“There can never be a nuclear Iran, a nuclear Iran that could then hold itself immune from pressure and from action. That can never happen,” Rubio said. “Behind every terrorist group, behind every act of violence, behind every destabilising activity, behind everything that threatens peace and stability for the millions of people who call this region home, is Iran.”During Trump’s first administration, Netanyahu failed to convince him to participate in joint strikes against Iran’s nuclear programme, but the heightened rhetoric of the new administration has raised questions about whether the Israeli prime minister might succeed this time.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warIsraelUS foreign policyMarco RubioTrump administrationPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

Israel has also accused Hamas of ceasefire violations.Netanyahu credited “President Trump’s firm stance” with ensuring Saturday’s releases went ahead.The freed hostages – the Israeli-American Sagui Dekel-Chen, the Israeli-Argentinian Iair Horn and the Israeli-Russian Sasha Troufanov – returned to emotional reunions with their families.Israel freed 369 Palestinian prisoners, mostly Palestinians detained in Gaza during the war, but some were serving life sentences for attacks on Israelis.Footage aired by Israeli media showed Palestinian prisoners in sweatshirts bearing a Star of David and the slogan: “We will not forget and we will not forgive”.They tore them off upon reaching Gaza and burned them in a bonfire at the reception point in Khan Younis.Ibrahim, 61, a freed prisoner who declined to give his full name, said he was shocked by Gaza’s devastation.Arrested in northern Gaza’s Jabalia refugee camp, he said he still did not know why he had been jailed for nine months.Since the truce began last month, 19 Israeli hostages have been released in exchange for more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners.Out of 251 people seized in Hamas’s 7 October 2023 attack on Israel that sparked the war, 70 remain in Gaza, including 35 the Israeli military says are dead.The second phase of the ceasefire, still to be negotiated, is expected to include the release of the remaining hostages and discussions on ending the war.Trump’s Gaza plan has heightened tensions.The US president has warned of repercussions for neighbouring Egypt and Jordan unless they accept displaced Palestinians in Gaza.Diplomats say Egypt is leading efforts to propose an alternative within weeks, focused on training a new security force and appointing local Palestinian leaders.Rubio said he believed Arab states were “working in good faith” but insisted Hamas must have no future role.Agence France-Presse and Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaIsraelHamasMarco RubioPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Pilgrims and politicians explain why it’s bigger than everHannah Ellis-PetersenandAakash Hassanin PrayagrajSun 16 Feb 2025 04.00 ESTShareThey sat quietly together on the banks of the Ganges river, heads bowed in sombre meditation. Some men were naked, their bodies smeared grey with ash. Others had a simple saffron cloth tied around their waist. Nearby, barbers balanced on their haunches, shaving the head of each man clean with a flick of their knives, save for a small strand at the back.This ceremony, in which millions of pilgrims seek to cleanse their sins to break the cycle of reincarnation has been taking place at theKumbh Mela festivalfor centuries. It is mandatory for thousands ofsadhus – Hindu holy menwho live an austere life of strict spiritual discipline. Among the most sacred events in the Hindu calendar, the festival occurs every 12 years across four sacred locations in India where it is believed the Hindu god Vishnu once spilled drops of the nectar of immortality.This year, the scale and political prominence of the festival, held in the north Indian city of Prayagraj, is set to exceed previous records. According to the government’s own estimates, it is expected that more than 400 million devotees will attend the festival by the time it ends, in late February, making it the largest gathering of humanity on earth.For the akharas, the 13 ancient Hindu sects into which all the sadhus are initiated, this year’s Kumbh Mela has been particularly significant, marking a shift in their own cultural and political prominence in India.View image in fullscreenGaurav Giri, a sadhu who used to work for British Telecom in Brentford and loves Downton Abbey.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianThe akharas, monastic orders that date back as far as the sixth century, each follow different gods. Earlier, they were training grounds for warrior-ascetics who would defend the Hindu holy sites and traditions, and today they are revered as essential custodians of ancient Hindu traditions and rituals. An estimated five million sadhus form the akharas.This year, according to Mahant Ravindra Puri, president of the governing body for the akharas, “the number of sadhus which have been initiated in this Kumbh is manifolds higher than in previous ones”. He said the number exceeded 10,000.High priests from several orders, some which boast upwards of half a million sadhus, said they too had recently witnessed a swelling in the ranks of those committing to the disciplined life of a Hindu ascetic, despite it being seemingly at odds with India’s rapidly modernising society.“I would say it’s the beginning of a new era,” said Swami Shiv Premanand, a senior priest in the 8th-century Mahanirvani Akhara. “There has been an awakening, particularly among the youth, toSanatana Dharma[the principles of Hinduism], and we see more are committing to become sadhus than ever before.”In a view echoed by several of the akhara high priests, Premanand credited the rising prominence of the akharas with the Hindu nationalist government ofprime minister Narendra Modiand his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).Modi’s 10 years in powerhave been marked by a concerted ideological push to move India away from its secular foundations and towards the establishment of the country as afully fledgedHinduRashtraor Hindu state.Under this Hindutva project, there has been a merging of state with religion, while the prime minister has often positioned himself as a high priest figure preaching the virtuesSanatana Dharma,a term referring to a more traditional form of Hinduism.Yogi Adityanath, the BJP chief minister of the state of Uttar Pradesh where this year’s Kumbh Mela is held, is himself a hardline Hindu monk who is only ever seen in his religious saffron robes.“We cannot deny the extraordinary role that the government has played in this awakening across the country,” said Premanand. “Modi and Yogi are completely devoted to theSanatana Dharma. They work for us, so naturally we work for them.”View image in fullscreenIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi takes a holy dip at the confluence of the Ganges, Yamuna and Saraswati rivers.Photograph: APThis year’s Kumbh Mela became as much as a political as a religious event, serving as a symbol of Hindu might in India for the BJP. The government spent a record 70bn rupees (£640m) on putting on the festival, as well as launching a nationwide publicity campaign around it bearing the faces of Modi and Adityanath. Modi was among those who took a holy dip at the festival in the Triveni Sangam, the sacred confluence of the Ganges, the Yamuna and the Saraswati rivers, at the Kumbh Mela.This PR campaign extended to the akharas. A press release sent out by the Uttar Pradesh government during the Kumbh Mela spoke reverentially of the akharas as “spiritual powerhouses” and spoke of their “enduring relevance in the spiritual life in India”.The close relationship between the government and the akharas was apparent after tragedy struck this year’s Kumbh Mela in late January, whenat least 30 people died and 90 were injuredduring a crowd crush as tens of millions tried to reach the banks of the sacred rivers to bathe. The akharas did not criticise the government for the death of devotees and disruption of their holiest bathing ritual but instead publicly praised Adityanath for his “dedication” to Hindu culture.How joy turned to horror as Kumbh Mela festival crowd crush unfoldedRead moreSakshi Maharaj, a religious leader of the Shri Nirmal Panchayati Akhada sect, is among those now pushing for political representation for the heads of the akharas and said he was in discussion with other akhara heads to put forward a proposal to the government. He is a BJP member of parliament.“No government in the past has recognised and respected akharas and sadhus like the Modi government,” said Maharaj. “A consensus is building among us that all akharas should have some formal political representation in parliament to put forward our issues. People tend to trust sadhus more than traditional politicians.”Nonetheless, the akharas have a troubled past of working together and throughout history have turned on each other in bloody massacres at the festival as they compete for status. At a meeting of senior ahkara figures last year, an angry dispute broke out and several seers had to be separated.There has been some effort to diversify the ranks of sadhus in the akharas, which have traditionally have been predominantly male, patriarchal environments that exclude lower castes, particularly Dalits who were once known as “untouchables”.For the first time, 1,000 women are expected to be initiated as sadhus at this year’s Kumbh Mela. And in 2015, the Kinnar Akhara was created for transgender people. Despite initial resistance by the sadhu community, the Kinnar Akhara is allowed to take part in the holy bathing rituals. However, it was recently embroiled in a public spat within their own ranks over the decision to allow a female Bollywood actor to join.Many who become sadhus are committed to priests at birth by their parents, but increasing numbers of graduates and elderly figures who had found their spiritual calling later in life being are being initiated at the Kumbh Mela. Some observers credited the growing sadhu numbers with the renewed reverence for Hindu religious practice in India, while others speculated that India’s high youth unemployment rates and lack of employment opportunity could also be driving young men towards the ascetic life.The enduring popularity of the sadhus, often referred to as “babas”, was highly apparent at the festival, with many drawing crowds of tens of thousands of devotees in a single day. Pilgrims came in their droves to pay their respects, often with a deep prostrating bow and a fistful of cash – followed by a selfie. Some of the more popular babas distributed cards with QR codes for devotees to scan to receive further information and a link to their social media account. it was also a popular approach among sadhus tooOthers directed devotees to YouTube to find the answers to spiritual questions.View image in fullscreenKhadashvari Baba has committed to staying upright for 12 years as part of his religious practice.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianAmong the celebrated sadhus was 25-year-old Khadashvari Baba, who has committed to standing upright for 12 years, having done three years so far. Wearing nothing but his dark sunglasses and smoking his chillum of hash, Khadashvari leaned on a perch to keep him always standing on a single foot, even as slept.With his own sizeable social media following, Khadashvari was adamant sadhus should be committed to tradition but also “move with the times – we can not just stay completely in the past”. As was evident among many sadhus, his rejection of earthly goods did not extend to a mobile phone – though he lamented that his had just been stolen at the festival.Crowds were often the largest for the naked, ash-smeared Naga sadhus, who follow a particularly stringent life of devotion, renunciation and meditation, including celibacy and sometimes martial arts training and are rarely seen in public.Sitting beside smoking coals and smeared in ash, Gaurav Giri, 44, a Naga sadhu, said he had seen a shift in how people viewed his fellow holy men and the kind of crowd at the Kumbh Mela. Before committing to the life of being a Naga ascetic, Giri’s previous employment had included working for British Telecom in the London suburb of Brentford and he confessed to being a “huge fan” ofDownton Abbey.“There is a lot of unwanted crowd at the Kumbh who are disturbing our peace, always wanting to take picture for the social media reels,” said Giri.“But the PR is also good. More young people are coming here interested in becoming sadhus or just to praise us – we cannot complain about that.”Explore more on these topicsIndiaThe ObserverReligionNarendra ModiHinduismFestivalsSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

They don’t have any open injury. Most [likely died from] hypoxia or maybe some blunt injury but that would only be confirmed after an autopsy.“There are also 11 others who are injured. Most of them are stable and have orthopaedic injuries.”Broadcaster NDTV reported three more dead from the crush, quoting an official of another hospital in the city.“I have been working as a coolie since 1981, but I never saw a crowd like this before,” a porter at the railway station was quoted as saying by the Times of India newspaper.“People started colliding and fell on the escalator and stairs” when a platform for a special train departing for Prayagraj was suddenly shifted, the porter said.The railways minister, Ashwini Vaishnaw, said a “high-level inquiry” had been ordered into the causes of the accident. Vaishnaw said additional special trains were being run from Delhi to clear the rush of devotees.Narendra Modi, the Indian prime minister, said on X: “My thoughts are with all those who have lost their loved ones. I pray that the injured have a speedy recovery. The authorities are assisting all those who have been affected by this stampede.”The defence minister, Rajnath Singh, said he was “extremely pained by the loss of lives due to stampede” at the Delhi railway station.“In this hour of grief, my thoughts are with the bereaved families. Praying for the speedy [recovery] of the injured,” Singh said in a social media post.The governor of the capital, Vinai Kumar Saxena, said disaster management personnel had been told to deploy and “all hospitals are in readiness to address related exigencies”.The six-weekKumbh Melais the single biggest milestone in the Hindu religious calendar, and officials said about 500 million devotees have already visited the festival since it began last month.More than 400 people died after they were trampled or drowned on a single day of the festival in 1954, one of the largest tolls in a crowd-related disaster globally.Another 36 people were crushed to death in 2013, the last time the festival was staged in Prayagraj.Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsIndiaKumbh MelaHinduismReligionSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

It ended up with four awards: for best picture, outstanding British film, adapted screenplay and editing.Accepting the second of those, Berger – who swept the board at the awards two years ago with his remake of All Quiet on the Western Front, which won seven prizes – said: “We live in a time of a crisis of democracy. Institutions used to bringing us together are used to pull us apart. Sometimes it’s hard to keep the faith, and that’s why we make movies.”Berger, whose film depicts a battle between liberals and traditionalists that threatens to destroy the Catholic church from within, ended his speech by quoting Leonard Cohen: “There’s a crack in everything, that’s how the light gets in.”View image in fullscreenAdrien Brody accepts the leading actor award for The Brutalist.Photograph: Stuart Wilson/BAFTA/Getty Images for BAFTAThe Brutalist, Brady Corbet’s epic drama about a Hungarian modernist architect working in post-war America, went home with best director, leading actor, cinematography and score.In his speech, starAdrien Brody, who recently appeared on the West End stage in The Fear of 13, thanked the British public for “embracing me and my creative endeavours”, saying “England has felt quite a lot like home lately”.He then went on to thank his partner, designer Georgina Chapman (who is also the ex-wife of Harvey Weinstein), calling her an “angel” and adding: “If it wasn’t for you and for my wonderful parents I wouldn’t be here.”Brody fought off competition from Timothée Chalamet, the star of Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown – which went home empty-handed – and from seven-time Bafta nominee (and one-time winner) Fiennes.‘Karla Sofía I kiss you’: Emilia Pérez director extends Bafta olive branch to absent starRead moreBut there was a surprise in the best actress category, as Anora’s Mikey Madison – who was also beaten by David Jonsson to the rising star award on Sunday – took the prize over frontrunnerDemi Moorefor The Substance and much-loved Hard Truths star Marianne Jean-Baptiste.In Sean Baker’s Palme d’Or winner, which also won best casting, Madison plays an exotic dancer who begins a romance with the son of a Russian oligarch. On the podium she gave a shout-out to the “sex worker community”, saying: “I see you, you deserve respect and human decency. I will always be a friend and an ally and I implore others to do the same.”Meanwhile, Emilia Pérez, Jacques Audiard’s musical about a Mexican cartel leader who transitions while escaping the mob, took two awards (from 11 nominations) despite the ongoing fallout from offensive unearthed social media posts from its star,Karla Sofía Gascón.View image in fullscreenMikey Madison accepts the leading actress award for Anora.Photograph: Stuart Wilson/BAFTA/Getty Images for BAFTAGascónhas taken a vow of media silence since tweets surfaced three weeks ago in which she aired Islamophobic and racist views. She apologised repeatedly, including on a tearful hour-long interview on Spanish TV, but was shunned by many of her colleagues on the film, including her director, who 10 days ago said: “I haven’t spoken to her, and I don’t want to.”Yet Audiard, whose film is up for a record-breaking 13 awards at the Oscars, appeared on Sunday to extend an olive branch toGascónin his acceptance speech for best film not in the English language, dedicating it to the “wonderful artists” from the film who were present in the room, before adding “also you, my dear Karla Sofía, who I kiss”.Accepting the supporting actress award for the film, Zoe Saldaña echoed Audiard, creditingGascónin her speech, before going on to tearfully thank her mother “for being such a selfless person” and her husband: “you are God’s favourite and I hate it – you are so beautiful.”Saldaña has won all the supporting actress awards so far handed out this season and is now considered a lock for the Oscars in a fortnight. Likewise A Real Pain’s Kieran Culkin solidified his status as the inevitable winner of the supporting actor Oscar with a Bafta win for his performance as Jesse Eisenberg’s erratic cousin on a tour of Jewish history in Poland in A Real Pain.Eisenberg picked up the prize on Culkin’s absence – it was, he said, the fifth such award he’d collected for his co-star, “which just confirms my theory that we have a similar life but his is about 27% better than mine”.The Succession star wasn’t present, Eisenberg said, because he wanted to be with a family member who is “quite sick” – an impulse to be with his family no matter what that, continued Eisenberg, had meant Culkin tried to drop out of A Real Pain two weeks before the shoot.“It’s real and it’s beautiful and it’s admirable,” he said. “Kieran is one of these lovely people who’s brilliantly talented but by some random luck of the cosmos has his priorities in order.”View image in fullscreenSaldaña with her award.Photograph: Isabel Infantes/ReutersEisenberg also wrote and directed the film, and appeared to be the person in the room most surprised by his victory in the original screenplay category, saying he didn’t expect to win, nor – apparently – did the person who assigned him his seat in the auditorium.He dedicated the award to his wife, “who didn’t come because she didn’t think I’d win”. Describing himself as an “idiot”, he said his wife, who he met in 2001, had, “dragged me around the world reluctantly” and used “strict Marxist Leninist principles” to teach him that his “grief is unexceptional” compared to the rest of the world.“Anna, you put every worthwhile thought into my head over the last 20 years and I love you so much.”Another double winner wasAardman’s Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl, which beat the likes of Inside Out 2 and The Wild Robot to the animation award, as well as proving a popular winner of the inaugural family film award.Rich Peppiatt converted just one of his six nominations for uproarious semi-fictionalised rap biopicKneecapinto an award, for outstanding debut by a British director. In his speech, Peppiatt said he had met his wife 15 years ago to the day; they moved to Ireland a decade ago and he met the hip-hop trio who became the subject of the film within a week.Kneecap, who hail from west Belfast and whose lyrics mix Irish and English and contain republican rhetoric are, he said “a movement. It’s about how everyone should have their language respected, their culture respected and have their homeland respected. This award is dedicated to everyone out there who’s fighting that fight.”Meanwhile,Super/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story, about the late actor’s career before and after his devastating accident and the impact of it on his children, took best documentary. The film is not nominated for an Oscar, where the frontrunner is No Other Land, about the destruction of Masafer Yatta, made by a Palestinian-Israeli collective.The evening’s most emotional speech was delivered by Warwick Davis, veteran of the Star Wars and Harry Potter films, who received the Bafta fellowship and said it was “probably the best thing that’s happened to me”. He thanked his mother and then paid tribute to his late wife, Sammy, who died almost a year before in what the actor has described as “medical negligence”.His voice cracking, Davis thanked cinema for giving him hope, and “helping me to laugh and to love again”.The ceremony was hosted by returning emcee David Tennant, who landed a few gentle blows on President Donald Trump – some of which were cut by the BBC in their broadcast – and who opened proceedings with a rousing version of I’m Gonna Be (500 Miles), accompanied by Hollywood stars in assorted states of familiarity with The ProclaimersBaftas 2025: the full list of winners – live!Read moreTheBaftasare the final significant film awards ceremony before the Academy Awards in two weeks and many regard them as a last-gasp audition for the Oscars. There is considerable overlap between the 8,000-odd voting members of the British Academy and their 10,000 US counterparts – many of whom wait to complete their ballots, which are due on Tuesday, until they’ve seen how the Baftas unfold.However, although last year’s choices were in almost total lockstep, with Oppenheimer dominating proceedings, the Baftas have become a less reliable Oscars bellwether since they introduced a raft of radical backstage measures in the wake of the #BaftasSoWhite controversy five years ago, when all of the 20 acting nominees were white.Quotas at longlist stage, strict inclusivity criteria for contention in certain categories and a compulsory menu of randomised viewing for each voter has led to a striking diversity among their choices.Explore more on these topicsBaftasAwards and prizesThe BrutalistRalph FiennesConclaveDemi MooreAdrien BrodynewsShareReuse this content"

That’s why we haven’t seen much in the way of sunshine in most of the UK recently.”Snow fell in parts of East Anglia on Saturday, with 2cm in Norfolk and 1cm in Suffolk.According to the Met Office, parts of the UK may continue to have snowfall throughout Sunday evening and into Monday.The Met Office meteorologist Ellie Glaisyer said: “Over the weekend so far we’ve seen a couple of centimetres in the east.“We could see between 1cm and 3cm in parts of Scotland above 100 metres and the same in the north of the UK [from] Monday into Tuesday. In the highest areas, above 300 metres, Scotland could see up to 20cm.”Explore more on these topicsUK weatherEnglandScotlandWalesNorthern IrelandnewsShareReuse this content"

It was not clear whether FDA employees who review drugs were exempted.US Forest Service and National Park Service to fire thousands of workersRead moreOn Friday, the US Department ofHealthand Human Services announced plans to fire 5,200 probationary employees across its agencies, which include the National Institutes of Health, the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.People who spoke with the AP on condition of anonymity on Friday said the number of probationary employees to be laid off at the CDC would total nearly 1,300. But as of early Sunday afternoon, about 700 people had received notices, according to three people who spoke on condition on anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. They said none of the CDC layoffs affected the doctors and researchers who track diseases in what’s known as the Epidemic Intelligence Service.The FDA is headquartered in theMarylandsuburbs outside Washington DC and employs nearly 20,000 people. It’s long been a target of newly sworn-in health secretary Robert Kennedy Jr, who last year accused the agency of waging a “war on public health” for not approving unproven treatments such as psychedelics, stem cells and chelation therapy.Kennedy also has called for eliminating thousands of chemicals and colorings from US foods. But the cuts at FDA include staffers responsible for reviewing the safety of new food additives and ingredients, according to an FDA staffer familiar with the firings.An HHS spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sunday afternoon.Nearly half of the FDA’s $6.9bn budget comes from fees paid by companies the agency regulates, including drug and medical device makers, which allows the agency to hire extra scientists to swiftly review products. Eliminating those positions will not reduce government spending.A former FDA official said cutting recent hires could backfire, eliminating staffers who tend to be younger and have more up-to-date technical skills. The FDA’s workforce skews toward older workers who have spent one or two decades at the agency, and the Government Accountability Office noted in 2022 that the FDA “has historically faced challenges in recruiting and retaining” staff due to better money in the private sector.Trump administration fires 20 immigration judges with no explanationRead more“You want to bring in new blood,” said Peter Pitts, a former FDA associate commissioner under George W Bush. “You want people with new ideas, greater enthusiasm and the latest thinking in terms of technology.”Mitch Zeller, former FDA director for tobacco, said the firings are a way to “demoralize and undermine the spirit of the federal workforce”.“The combined effect of what they’re trying to do is going to destroy the ability to recruit and retain talent,” Zeller said.The FDA’s inspection force has been particularly strained in recent years after a wave of departures during the Covid-19 pandemic, and many of the agency’s current inspectors are recent hires. It was not immediately clear whether those employees were exempted.FDA inspectors are responsible for overseeing thousands of food, drug, tobacco and medical device facilities worldwide, though the AP reported last year that the agency faced a backlog of roughly 2,000 uninspected drug facilities that hadn’t been visited since before the pandemic.The agency’s inspection force have also been criticized for not moving faster to catch recent problems involving infant formula, baby food and eyedrops.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationFood & drink industryDonald TrumpUS politicsMarylandHealthCoronavirusnewsShareReuse this content"

In south-easternKentucky, a 73-year-old man was found dead in floodwaters in Clay county, county emergency management deputy director, Revelle Berry, said. There were a total of four deaths in Hart county, Beshear said.Meanwhile, in Hart county, Kentucky, the state department of fish and wildlife said an investigation into a death and a rescue operation was under way, WNKY-TV reported. The stationreporteda youth died and a second victim was missing in flooding on Saturday evening.The fish and wildlife department and the Hart county sheriff’s office did not immediately respond to a request for more information from the Associated Press.View image in fullscreenCars sit in floodwaters at a railroad underpass in Louisville, Kentucky, on Sunday.Photograph: Timothy D Easley/APSevere storms also swept through parts of Florida and Georgia, where tornado watches were in effect early on Sunday, the National Weather Service (NWS) said.Severe storms in Georgia were responsible for a ninth death in this latest bout of harsh winter weather. In Atlanta, a person was killed when a large tree fell on a home early Sunday, according to Atlanta fire rescue Capt Scott Powell. Heavy winds and rain have left thousands without power across the Atlanta metro area.Elsewhere, bone-chilling cold is expected for the northern plains with low temperatures into the -30s F near the Canadian border. Dangerously cold wind chill temperatures in the Dakotas and Minnesota of -40F (-40C) to -50F are expected.Heavy snowfall amounts were expected in parts of New England and northern New York. In some areas, wind gusts could reach 60mph (about 97km/h) and create “hazardous whiteout conditions”, the NWS said.In Kentucky, water submerged cars and buildings – and mudslides blocked roads in Virginia. Both of the states were under flood warnings, along with Tennessee and Arkansas. The NWS warned residents to stay off the roads.Beshear said at least 146 national guard members were helping rescue people from floodwaters in that state. Similar rescues werereportedin Rives, Tennessee, after the failure of a levee along the Obion River there.View image in fullscreenA road is closed due to flooding in Louisville, Kentucky, on Sunday.Photograph: Timothy D Easley/APThe Kentucky governor pre-emptively declared a state of emergency in Kentucky. He also said that he had written toDonald Trump’s White House requesting an emergency disaster declaration and federal funds for affected areas.The president had approved the request, the Kentucky congressman James Comer said.“We want to specifically put assets in places that flood and have flooded in the past,” Beshear said on social media.He said shelters were opening in Pike county and Jenny Wiley state resort park in Prestonsburg.The Kentucky River medical center in the city of Jackson said it had closed its emergency department and was transferring all patients to two other hospitals in the region. The hospital said it would re-evaluate conditions on Sunday morning to determine when it can safely reopen. The north fork of the Kentucky River was forecast to crest nearly 14ft (4.3 metres) above flood stage that afternoon, the weather service said.Flash flooding hit some roads in Bowling Green, and parts of western Kentucky could face up to 8in (20cm) of rain.Meanwhile heavy snow was expected to blanket much of New England and then transition to sleet, making travel nearly impossible. The heaviest accumulations, possibly a foot or more, were expected in upstate New York and portions of northern New England.Snow and Arctic temperatures swept much of the midwest and upper plains, covering roads in eastern Nebraska, northern Iowa and much of Wisconsin. Winter weather advisories were issued for parts of those states and Michigan, with up to 4in of snow predicted throughout Iowa, southern Wisconsin and most of Michigan by Sunday evening.View image in fullscreenA person struggles with heavy, wet snow in Lewiston, Maine, on Sunday afternoon.Photograph: Russ Dillingham/APMeteorologists said the US was about to get its 10th and coldest polar vortex stretching event this season, with the northern Rockies and northern plains first in line. Weather forces in the Arctic are combining to push the chilly air that usually stays near the north pole into the US and Europe.In Denver, where temperatures were expected to dip as low as 14F over the weekend, the city opened shelters for those living on the streets.Dry weather returned to southern California after the strongest storm of the year. But the risk of rock and mudslides on wildfire-scarred hillsides continued because dangerous slides can strike even after rain stops, particularly in areas where vegetation that helps keep soil anchored has burned away.Water, debris and boulders rushed down the mountain in the city of Sierra Madre on Thursday night, trapping at least one car in the mud and damaging several home garages with mud and debris. Bulldozers cleaned up mud-covered streets in the city of 10,000 people.A storm in the Sierra Nevada dumped 6ft of snow over 36 hours. Two Mammoth Mountain ski patrol workers were injured in an avalanche during avalanche mitigation work on Friday, the resort said on Facebook.Guardian staff contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsUS weatherKentuckynewsShareReuse this content"

Will Trump defy them?Read more“He is the most lawless president in US history,” Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor,wrote on Wednesday in the Guardian.“This is bonkers. In our system of government, it’s up to the courts to determine whether the president is using his power ‘legitimately’, not the president.”Trump laid out his position in the tweet posted on Saturday afternoon, aftera round of golfat his Florida resort. The quote, as internet sleuths soon discovered, is a version of a phraseattributed to Napoleon“Celui qui sauve sa patrie ne viole aucune loi,” translated as: “who saves his country violates no law”.Another version appeared in the1970 movie Waterloo, starring Rod Steiger as the dictator who rode roughshod over the French constitution to declare himself emperor and pursue world domination before his comeuppance at the pivotal 1815 battle from which the film’s title is derived.Senior Democrats led the criticism of Trump. The Virginia US senator Tim Kaine, Hillary Clinton’s running mate in the 2016 presidential election that Trump won, told Fox News Sunday that occupation of the White House was not a mandate to ignore the courts.“The president has authority, but the president also has to follow the law,” he said.“There’s this law that, you know, the Empowerment Act, that says once Congress has appropriated dollars for a particular purpose the president is not allowed to say: ‘Yeah, I don’t like that. I’m going to spend this money, but not that money.’“That’s why, so far, there’s a whole lot of lawsuits that have been successful. They’ll go through appeals courts, but a lot of the president’s extreme executive actions that hurt folks are being challenged in court right now.”According to the Associated Press, the administration is facing at least 70 lawsuits nationwide covering actions from the attempted elimination of birthright citizenship to the freezing of federal grants and funds – and the accessing of sensitive computer systems and databy unofficial entities.Trump’s wrecking ball approach since his 20 January inauguration continued this week with deeper infiltration by Elon Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) into federal institutions – and the latest firings of vast numbers of employees.On Sunday, Bloombergreported a wave of new dismissalsat health department agencies including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Other agencies where the workforce has, or will be, slashed include thehomeland security department, theFood and Drug Administration,US Forest Service and National Park Service, the US Agency for International Development (USAid), and the Department of Education.Critics believe that a hollowing out of many essential taxpayer-funded services, especially in healthcare, support for veterans, and military and defense expenditure, will come with alucrative corresponding financial windfallfor private companies, including those owned by Musk.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That is a shutdown unauthorized by Congress, against the law.“My outrage is about who they’re hurting. I don’t like unelected officials, those Doge guys,posting classified information on their website. You shouldn’t let people run rampage through offices that have classified information.”More turmoil came with the administration’s decision to ban Associated Press journalists from the Oval Office and Air Force One for refusing to comply with Trump’s executive order attempting to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the “Gulf of America”.The White House sought to justify the punitive move by insisting that it was “alawful geographic name change”. The AP pointed out that the agency served an international audience, and while it recognized Trump’s order, it would continue referring to the body of water by its globally accepted name.Ina statement, Axios said the right of news organizations to report how they saw fit was “a bedrock of a free press and durable democracy”. Nonetheless, it also said it would use the name Gulf of America because “our audience is mostly US-based compared to other publishers with international audiences”.The Atlantic’s viewwas that it was a spat the AP should have avoided. “To cave now would be to surrender on the constitutional issue. But this is a fight that Trump is clearly happy to have, especially to the extent that it draws attention away from his more egregious affronts to the public interest and the rule of law,” it said.Meanwhile, economic headwinds continue to mount for the fledgling Trump administration as it prepares toimpose new tariffs on trading partnersthat analysts predict will lead to an international trade war and job losses. Inflation rose to 3% in January, according to government figures, despite Trumppromising during election campaigningthat prices “will come down, and they’ll come down fast”.By Thursday, the message had changed. “Prices could go up somewhat short-term,” Trump said as he laid out his tariffs plan, before promising they would go down again at some point.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsElon MusknewsShareReuse this content"

We hope to be provided the opportunity to review the files as a family prior to its public release.”However, according to a White House official speaking to Axios, theTrump administrationrefused that request from King’s family, though it claimed the refusal did not stem from “animus toward the family”.Speaking to the outlet, a second source who spoke with one of King’s two surviving adult children said that “there are deep concerns” within the family over the ordered release.“They know the right wing wants to smear Dr King, and one way to do it is by putting these smears in the public under the guise of transparency. If there are assassination records, release those. But smears are not assassination records,” the source told Axios.King dedicated his life’s work to advancing civil rights across the United States before assassin James Earl Ray fatally shot him at the Lorraine motel in Memphis, Tennessee, on 4 April 1968.A 2020 documentary by US film-maker Sam Pollard titledMLK/FBIexplores the agency’s pursuit of King via state-sanctioned surveillance.Explore more on these topicsMartin Luther KingTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsJohn F KennedyRobert F Kennedy JrnewsShareReuse this content"

Then the wildfires came, and I realised, in an era of disasters, how vital trained neighbors areAudrey Grayin Los AngelesSun 16 Feb 2025 11.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 16 Feb 2025 11.02 ESTShareKelley McIntosh is the kind of person who gives her friends fire extinguishers as housewarming gifts. In other words, my kind of person: as a climate journalist who’s spent eight years reporting on adaptations critical to life in our burning, storming, fevered world, I’ve been known to gift-wrap prepper items, too. Loved ones have sighed and nodded as they opened solar lanterns, flashlights and emergency radios none of us quite understand how to “crank”.Shockingly for two hypervigilants, neither Kelley nor I had ever actually pulled the pin and shot a fire extinguisher until the day we met last September inLos Angeles.We’d both signed up for community emergency response team (Cert) training, a federallyadministered, locally organized program that has, for decades, taught disaster preparedness and response skills to volunteer civilians for free. More than 20 of my neighbors and I enrolled for three day-long sessions. Would it be geeky or depressing to immerse ourselves in worst-case scenarios, three beautiful LA Saturdays in a row? Perhaps. But our desire for some sense of agency or usefulness as more climate-intensified disasters hit took precedence. Why not at least try to avoid being caught pants down when the next “unprecedented” event slammed in?That was all just four months ago. After our training, Santa Monica’s chief resilience officer thanked us for a willingness to “ease the burden on our community during disasters”.Too soon, we’d find out if we could.View image in fullscreenMembers of the Cert team in Hawthorne, California, on 11 April 2009.Photograph: MediaNews Group/Orange County Register/Getty ImagesFor Kelley, fire was the disaster that unnerved her most. She had grown up in rural Pennsylvania, where tall barns would light up in a flash and take out the homes around them. When she moved to LA more than two decades ago to work in entertainment marketing, the caution came with her.“Fire is just something you lose control of so fast,” she told me. “I’ve always been a little crazy about it.”Cert trainings happen in all 50 states and on tribal lands, but they’re only offered when local leaders have enough funding to run a class. Most of us spent months on Santa Monica’s waitlist before our local office of emergency management finally announced a 2024 class.That first Saturday, we gathered in an air-conditioned classroom at the city’s fire-training facility. The resilience officer, Lindsay Barker Call, and two local fire marshals talked us through hazards particular to our daily stomping grounds. My impression was that earthquakes topped the list. Wildfires and smoke inundation were of course mentioned, becauseCalifornia, but walkable Santa Monica felt somehow insulated from the fire-prone canyon country around us. Still, since earthquakes sometimes set off urban fires, we learned basic protocol – how to pry open doors with crowbars, shut off a leaking gas valve (at Cert graduation, we’d each be given our own wrench for this), or command the power of a home extinguisher to vanquish a spot fire.I remember cheering for Kelley that afternoon as a firefighter in full gear set flame to a pan of diesel fuel on the lot. It was a hot day. Kelley was wearing loose joggers and a short-sleeve T-shirt, her ponytail tucked under a baseball cap. The fire was instantly as tall as she was, and a thick column of smoke rose even higher. I watched Kelley aim the extinguisher at her worst fear and put her whole body into killing it in under 10 seconds.It felt empowering to practice, to understand “go bags” and what to do before first responders got to you, from blood staunching to “psychologically stabilizing survivors”.We trained hard. After three weeks, we took a group photo, exchanged phone numbers and promised to look after our neighbors. We felt as ready as civilians could be without going full bunker.View image in fullscreenKelley McIntosh, a Santa Monica homeowner, attacks a test fire during her first day of Cert training last September.Photograph: Audrey GrayView image in fullscreenThe September 2024 cohort of Santa Monica Cert trainees on their graduation day.Photograph: Audrey GrayOn Tuesday, 7 January, smoke was visible in Santa Monica well before lunchtime. I’d just left a doctor’s appointment and joined the office staff out on the sidewalk as they pointed, wondering what the hell was happening just north of us. A monster plume of churning black smoke looked like it was only blocks away.I don’t have words yet for the wind-whipped hours that followed. I remember sending a quick video to the family group chat. I know I careened home, pulled my file marked “Documents” and set out a solar battery pack, hoping it would charge in the smoke-veiled sun. I remember strategizing with my neighbors, and the moment we saw flames.As prepared as I’d tried to be, I evacuated that night with my phone and battery pack but no cord to connect them. True disaster had messed with my brain, shredding my focus on anything smaller than moving our bodies away, fast.A couple of miles south-east of my block, Kelley readied her go bags just as we’d been trained, one for her and one for her 90lb German shepherd/great dane mix, Bucky. She’d already texted her neighbor Linda Mansolillo, an air force reservist with a subspecialty in disaster response (and quite likely the most qualified human ever to graduate from a Santa Monica Cert training). They activated a messaging chain Mansolillo had organized during summer block parties and began assessing who needed help.Kelley was busy, but as scared as she’d ever been, too.“We had no inkling of the devastation happening in the Palisades at that point,” she said. “But you could see flames on the hillside, and I was thinking, if that wind changed … ”It was a sleepless night for Kelley, as it was for many of the 9.6 million of us in LA county. For those on the west side who’d spent the day watching or fleeing the Palisades fire, horror was magnified by early evening reports of the Eaton fire exploding in the east. These weren’t canyon wildfires. They were the most damaging urban firestorms in American history, and they’d keep coming, day after day, relentlessly sparking up with new names.The second night of the disaster, Kelley was finally able to close her eyes.“I knew that between Santa Monica’s systems and my neighbors, there was no danger I’d sleep through an evacuation order,” she said. “We didn’t feel safe from the fires exactly, but we felt like we had each other’s back.”A couple of days later, after I returned to a blessedly standing apartment building and then left again when my chest constricted from toxic air and ash, I dialed Kelley’s number. We didn’t even say hello. She picked up immediately with: “You’ve been on my mind, too.”View image in fullscreenPeople evacuate from Pacific Palisades in January.Photograph: Mike Blake/ReutersTrained Cert volunteersin Malibuwere mobilized recently at the Malibu pier to help fire officials prepare and protect residents returning after evacuations, but in Santa Monica, the emergency management team made the decision to keep us where we were, focused on our neighbors. Ever the trainer, Barker Call sent mea study published in 2024finding that every $1 of investment in resilience and disaster preparedness reduces the damage and cleanup costs of a disaster by $6. Intrigued, I began reaching out to other disaster-recovery researchers.“I’m a big fan of Cert,” said the University of Southern California civil engineering professorCostas Synolakis, who has studied responses to tsunamis and wildfires around the world. “I like the idea of self-organizing. You saw it in this fire. The fire department was clearly spread way too thin. In post-fire emergency response, you need trained volunteers who already know the neighborhood.”We saw this happen in western North Carolina last autumn as well, after Hurricane Helene wiped out roads and infrastructure, leaving people cut off from first responders. Thousands of people were on their own for the hours, days and sometimes weeks it took for outside assistance to make it in, and thousands more lived without power or water longer than they ever had before. Emergency response systems at all levels are stretched thin by a quickening drumbeat of climate-intensified “events”, from killer heatwaves to floods, windstorms and wildfires. Over the entirety of the 1980s, the US experienced33 billion-dollar disasters. In the last two years alone, we’ve endured more than 50.“To adapt and mitigate for climate change … you need people,” Synolakis told me. “If you don’t train them, they’re going to get in trouble.”I heard the same from Samantha Montano, an emergency management professor at the Massachusetts Maritime Academy who once taught a Cert class to teenagers at a high school in rural North Dakota.“They understood the material completely,” she said. “I think it’s a really smart and logical thing to do.”But she talked about the limitations of the program, too, including the relatively few people who have even heard of Cert training, not to mention the lack of federal and local funding.Cert is by no means the only way neighbors organize to protect each other after the unthinkable happens. Grassroots mutual aid and environmental justice groups have repeatedly stepped up when government agencies have failed. I do fear that the types of disasters we’re experiencing now will continue to outpace anyone’s adaptation efforts. But having lived through the last month in LA, I can tell you that local organizing helped me and my neighbors cope in ways that may never show up in budgets or studies.One of the youngest trainees in my Cert cohort was Manny Apilado, a soulful and tattooed 31-year-old who works as a bartender and manager at a local beach club. Sunset Boulevard ends at the beach, and on that incomprehensible afternoon when people from the Palisades left their cars on Sunset Boulevard and ran for their lives, some of them ran into Manny.“It was like after 9/11, like they were just out of a war,” he told me on the phone later. “The ashes, the dust on their faces. Some were wearing ski masks or goggles. Two people just fell to the floor.”One man in his 70s fell into Manny’s arms.We’d been taught a section in Cert about “what not to say” to someone in crisis. Things like: “At least you still have … ” or: “Everything will be OK.” Empathy in the moment always trumps talking a survivor out of their feelings.Manny said he had stood there overwhelmed, wanting to provide refuge as he was realizing any foolproof zones of safety were gone.“There were no words,” Manny told me. “All I could say was: ‘I’m here for you.’”Explore more on these topicsCalifornia wildfiresLos AngelesCaliforniaWest CoastWildfiresfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A specialist liaison CPS prosecutor in the United States has been working with international partners to obtain material which may be relevant. We are thankful to the US Department of Justice and the FBI for their ongoing assistance, and the importance which they have placed upon our request.”According to reports, investigators hope to recover deleted searches from Rudakubana’s Google and Microsoft accounts within weeks.Rudakubana fatally stabbed Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine, at a dance class at the Hart Space in Southport just after 11am on 29 July last year.Police discovered a number of devices during a search of Rudakubana’s home in Banks, Lancashire, after the attack, but he had deleted his internet history 10 minutes before he left home to carry out the killings.A search on X made minutes before he left home, about the stabbing of Mar Mari Emmanuel, a bishop who was injured in a terrorist knife attack on an Australian church in April last year, was the only thing that remained, police have said.It is believed the data could hold vital clues about why he targeted the dance class for young girls five miles from his home. Officers believe he must have seen the class advertised, but they have been unable to prove their theory.He bought the 20cm (8in) kitchen knife used in the attack on Amazon days after the class was advertised on 7 July.To uncover what Rudakubana had been searching for in the days and months before the attack, detectives said they had to go through Microsoft, which owns the search engine Bing, and Google, which owns the browser Chrome. Both are US companies.The senior investigating officer, DCI Jason Pye,previously saidthe process of retrieving the information was ongoing and that it could take years.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The murders were not declared terrorism because police have been unable to find any clear evidence that they were carried out to advance any political, religious or ideological cause.“Our case has always been, based on the evidence, it’s not counter-terrorism. There is nothing in terms of ideology. So I couldn’t go down that path to try and get that information any quicker,” he said.“There is a process of getting it quicker, but because it’s in the serious organised crime, major crime category, unfortunately, I can’t get it as quick as we would like.

Some of those moves, among them hobbling the National Labor Relations Board, will help Trump’s billionaire business friends, most notably Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos.In his first few weeks back in office, Trumpfired the acting chair of the National Labor Relations Board(NLRB), leaving the US’s top labor watchdog without a quorum to enforce laws that protect workers’ right to unionize. Trump has designated Musk, a vehemently anti-union billionaire, to launch an all-out war against the federal bureaucracy and workforce, and Trump and Musk have essentially treated the country’s 2 million-plus federal employees as if they were disposable.Not stopping there,Trump firedtwo members of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), leaving it without a quorum to carry out its mission of fighting against discrimination. In his crusade to downsize the government and demolish the “deep state”, Trump and his administration havefired thousands of federal employees– moves that union officials sayhave violated laws and rulesthat require due process and a finding of poor performance before workers can be dismissed.“Donald Trump is showing that his promises to be a champion of workers are hollow,” said Judy Conti, government affairs director of the National Employment Law Project, a worker advocacy group. “He surrounds himself with people who are anti-worker. He has a history of being anti-worker, but he tries to put a nice face on it. He says he’s a champion of workers. He’s just not.”What does Elon Musk believe?Read moreIn a move that many federal workers found distasteful, Trump asked them to snitch on each other, to inform on co-workers engaged in diversity, equity and inclusion activities. The Trump administration further angered federal employees, as well as the labor movement, by announcing that itwould nullify contractsreached with federal employee unions in the final weeks of the Biden administration.Last month, just hours after an American Airlines jet collided with an army helicopter over Washington DC, killing 67 people, Trumpdissed and angeredFederal Aviation Administration employees, when he denounced diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies as fostering incompetence and suggesting that many FAA employees were unqualified. In another move upsetting worker advocates, Trump namedRussell Vought, one of the architects of the controversial rightwing blueprintProject 2025, to run the White House budget office. Project 2025 isbrimming with anti-worker recommendations, among them abolishing all government employee unions across the US.“Trump has already shown that he’s not a friend of working people,” Liz Shuler, president of the AFL-CIO, the country’s main union federation, said in an interview. “Project 2025 is playing out exactly as we feared, and America’s workers are right at the heart of those attacks.”One Trump move that particularly upset labor leaders was his order to fire Gwynne Wilcox, the NLRB’s acting chair and a Democrat, even though her term ran until 2026 and even though the labor board is an independent agency. That left the five-member board with just two positions filled and thus without a quorum to make decisions (although its regional offices can still operate).View image in fullscreenProtesters gather at a rally organised by the American Federation of Government Employees near the US Capitol on Tuesday.Photograph: Will Oliver/EPACalling her dismissal “unprecedented” and a “blatant violation” of the law,Wilcox is suing Trumpand asking to be reinstated. “He does not have the authority to remove a board member unless they have engaged in neglect of duty or malfeasance,” Wilcox said in an interview. She noted that Trump never gave any reasons for firing her and failed to give advance notice or allow for a hearing.“Their practical point was to prevent any work from being done,” Wilcox said. “It’s counter to what the agency is supposed to do, which is to protect the rights of working people and enforce the law.”In defending that firing, theTrump administrationasserted that Trump had the power to dismiss any executive branch employee he wishes. That claim is expected to be litigated all the way to the supreme court.The AFL-CIO’s Shuler said: “The illegal firing of Gwynne Wilcox – we’re fighting that tooth and nail. It did exactly what Trump wanted to do, which was stymie the one agency that workers rely on when they’re in an organizing drive and taking risks and getting fired. They no longer have the board they need to protect them.” Ben Sachs, a Harvard labor law professor, added: “If you believe in unions and in workers’ rights to organize and bargain collectively, then dismantling the NLRB is not the way to show one’s support for workers.”Musk’s company SpaceX – which theNLRB has accused of firingseveral workers illegally – has brought suit in federal court tohave the NLRB declared unconstitutional. Amazon, which was founded by Jeff Bezos, hasbrought a similar lawsuitafter NLRB officials found that Amazon broke the law numerous times in fighting against unionization.“We know the corporations that Musk and Bezos run have expressed a clear interest in shutting down the NLRB and have deployed teams of lawyers to accomplish that,” Sachs said. “Now they’ve got their way, at least temporarily.” If federal courts order Wilcox’s reinstatement, the NLRB would again have a quorum, enabling it to operate.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He also fired members of two boards that hear cases in which federal employees assert they have been improperly fired or treated: the Merit Systems Protection Board and the Federal Labor Relations Authority.“All of these are agencies where workers who believe their rights have been violated can go to get remedies,” said Conti of the National Employment Law Project. “They’re essentially freezing the ability of these boards to remedy workers’ problems.”View image in fullscreenHundreds protest against the Trump administration’s planned closure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in Washington DC.Photograph: Allison Bailey/NurPhoto/Rex/ShutterstockMark Gaston Pearce, executive director of the Workers’ Rights Institute at Georgetown University, said it was disturbing that Trump, instead of firing one of the NLRB’s two white members, fired Wilcox, the only African American woman to serve on the NLRB in its 90-year history. Pearce asserted that Trump’s and Musk’s firing of hundreds of federal workers involved in DEI programs was disproportionately hitting workers of color. “It’s all code for getting rid of people of color,” Pearce said.An African American official who worked at the Department of Education for more than 15 years and who insisted on anonymity said she was recently put on paid administrative leave merely because she had once participated in a DEI training. She said she had no idea whether she would be reinstated. “They’re vilifying the civil service,” she said. “It feels like a betrayal.”Linda Ward-Smith, president of an American Federation of Government Employees union local representing 4,000 Veterans Administration workers in Las Vegas, said many federal employees were disgusted with how they had been treated. “Workers are telling me it’s a hostile work environment due to all the emails they’re receiving” – includingMusk’s “Fork in the Road” emailto 2 million federal employees suggesting they take buyouts and messages saying the Trump administration wants loyal employees. “They’re scared,” she said. “They feel the sky is going to fall.”Ward-Smith said Trump’s and Musk’s attacks on DEI were making many workers of color anxious and thinking of leaving their government jobs. Several African American and female workers said they felt even more unwelcome when Trump appoints people like Darren Beattie, a former Trump speechwriter, to a top state department position even though Beattieonce said: “Competent white men must be in charge if you want things to work.”Conti defended the federal government’s longtime effort to promote workforce diversity. “It is to promote true, full meritocracy,” Conti said. “It is not about quotas. It is not about not hiring white people. It is about removing the barriers that people of color, women, LGBTQ and other disadvantaged people face to compete for jobs for which they are qualified.“What people need to know,” Conti continued, “is this is not some sort of targeted campaign against employment practices that have gone too far. It is a broad-based campaign to roll back our country’s civil rights protections. Full stop.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS unionsProject 2025US politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

But it’s no wonder that tensions boiled over when the US finally met Canada on the iceColin HorganSun 16 Feb 2025 04.30 ESTLast modified on Sun 16 Feb 2025 10.34 ESTShareAs usual, Canadians approached the latest international hockey tournament, the 4 Nations Face-Off, with worry. Despite top-tier talent and historic winning pedigree, the feeling thatCanadacould be off its game is a perennial concern. But in 2025, it is particularly profound – mostly because of the Americans.Since the last time Canada played the US at an elite tournament in 2016, Canadians have watched the American program grow stronger and deeper, while Canada’s own has lost focus. Among the most pressing going concerns has been goaltending. Canada – or Québec more accurately – produced dominant goalies in excess for decades. No longer. They’re all Americans now.Three fights, nine seconds: USA beat Canada to reach 4 Nations Face-Off finalRead moreThe world juniors two months ago didn’t help things. Canada crashed out of that tournament on home ice with a squad few thought accurately represented the country’s top talent (which Hockey Canada, in typical national fashion,all but apologized forthis week). Then the Americanswon the whole thing (again), with a team that was about as stacked as they could make it.So, if reputation redemption, or a simple recalibration of hockey dominance, was all that was at stake during Saturday night’s spicy contests between Canada and the US – the Americanscame from behind to win 3-1– it still would have been a doozy. And make no mistake, bragging rights were on the line. But there was more to it.When it designed the 4 Nations Face-Off tournament, the NHL could never have predicted that this marquee matchup would land at a time of such bilateral political acrimony, nor that the atmosphere both inside and beyond the Bell Centre would be so febrile, nor that everyone would be so worked up about a trade issue that, on the surface, has nothing to do with hockey players. But, thanks toDonald Trump, here we are.audible boos for the US National Anthem in Montreal before the USA-Canada 4 Nations Face-Off hockey gamepic.twitter.com/fowMNsTrWO— Aaron Rupar (@atrupar)February 16, 2025Hockey has never been separate from cross-border economics. One way or another, whether in the exchange rate, team relocation or taxes (to name a few recurring issues) the geopolitical Canada-US relationship always echoes around the game. In fact, you could argue that the reason there are such vehement boos of the Star-Spangled Banner – includingin Montreal on Saturday– when disputes between the countries arise, is because the relationship is felt even more acutely in hockey than anywhere else. For it is in hockey where the Americans owe Canada the most.Of all the Canadian exports to the US, the one with the greatest impact to the Canadian psyche is hockey. Oil matters to the Albertans, hydro-electricity to the Quebecois, potash to the Saskatchewanians, and so on. But hockey, well, that’s Canada’s. Nobody else would have it if it weren’t for us. But since its creation, hockey has never been totally Canada’s, because the Americans have always been there. Playing it, sure, but more than anything, monetizing it, commercializing it, and using this Canadian resource to become a powerhouse in their own right. And it has never really seemed fair.View image in fullscreenMatthew Tkachuk of Team USA, right, fights with Brandon Hagel of Team Canada during the first period of their 4 Nations Face-Off game on Saturday night at the Bell Centre in Montreal.Photograph: Minas Panagiotakis/Getty Images“The Canadian community invests a great deal in the production, as it were, of good hockey players: it creates the social environment that encourages young players to aspire to greatness in the sport and to devote the necessary long hours of practice; it provides him with arenas in which to play and coaches to perfect his skills. The size of the investment is often considerable,” Canadian Olympian and academic, Bruce Kidd,wrote in 1970. Player development (which of course now includes many young girls and women) is a communal investment that should be enjoyed most by that community – but it’s not, he wrote. Instead, the game is sold back to Canadians by Americans. “If not exported directly for sale in the United States, the best games are sold here in Canada under monopoly conditions at outrageous prices.” Canada pumps out hockey players, and the Americans get rich.In many respects, nothing much has changed in the last 45 years. Canada still maintains a hockey surplus, but it always seems like the Americans benefit from it more than Canadians do. Maybe if we’re talking about retaliatory measures that Canada could take against the US in the near future, hockey should be part of the conversation – say, a 25% tariff added to every Canadian player on an American team, payable to the government of Canada. That’s obviously ridiculous. But so is all of it: the tariff war, the talk of annexation, the canard of cross-border crime. Yet, silly as it is, it has soured things though one hopes not irreparably. After all, we’ll still need someone to play hockey with. Because, as much as hockey belongs to Canada, it would be a lot less fun, and a lot less interesting, if we just kept it to ourselves. It’s why we’ve always shared it with our best friends, forever in each other’s (hockey) debt.Explore more on these topicsIce hockeyTrump tariffsUS sportsTrump administrationDonald TrumpCanadafeaturesShareReuse this content"

All the therapists said Tucker’s actions occurred between 2012 and 2016.Ravens kicker Justin Tucker denies claims of sexual misconduct towards massage therapistsRead moreThe Banner first reportedallegations against Tucker late last month, saying it had spoken with six massage therapists who recounted their first-hand experiences with him. The number of accusers has more than doubled since.The initial accusations include claims that Tucker exposed his genitals, brushed some of the therapists with his penis and left ejaculate on treatment tables. Two spas told the Banner they had banned Tucker from returning. One therapist who spoke to the Banner described Tucker’s alleged behavior as “really degrading”. Another said that “I can’t watch sports anymore. I see his face everywhere.”Sunday’s allegations were similar to the accounts that had previously been published. The fresh claims include an allegation Tucker used his erect penis to move a sheet covering him.Tucker said after the initial allegations emerged that he has never received any complaints from a massage therapist or been told he was not welcome at a spa or other place of business. On Sunday, his lawyers directed the Banner to their previous statements on the allegations.“Mr Tucker has never behaved inappropriately during any massage therapy session, and certainly never in the manner described … Any suggestion to the contrary is a fictitious and utterly baseless claim,” attorneys Thomas A Clare and Steven J Harrison told the Banner last month.TheNFLhas said it will look into the matter. “They are obviously serious issues, and he is taking that seriously as are we,” the league’s commissioner, Roger Goodell, said in the run-up to the Super Bowl. The Ravens issued their own statement last month, saying that: “We take any allegations of this nature seriously and will continue to monitor the situation.”Tucker is considered by many to be the greatest kicker in NFL history, and holds the records for longest field-goal and career field-goal percentage. He has been named to the Pro Bowl seven times since he joined the Ravens as an undrafted free agent in 2012. The 35-year-old is one of the few kickers to become a well-known name in the US, and is also known as an amateur opera singer.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But wait! He pulled out another one. A minor scuffle ensued. Police intervened. The marchers cheered, then milled off to their high-priced seats inside this spectacular mega-drome, monument to Levy’s commercial brilliance, there to watch their team take on Manchester United, thegreat ailing zombified giant of English football.That energy outside the ground was visceral and entirely real, as it was inside where the travelling United fans chanted, as they always do, for the Glazers to go, which is also prima facie an excellent idea.Tottenham hold off Manchester United as Maddison return boosts PostecoglouRead moreIn the buildup, this game was cast as a kind of Jeremy Kyle Clásico, football as a daytime TV-style theatre of dysfunction, grudges and grievances on show, familial poison to be let. You half expected to see gum-chewing bouncers at the edge of the pitch, cutaway reaction shots to stunned members of the crowd, a scoundrel nephew swaggering on stage halfway through.In the event the reaction of both sets of supporters felt like an entirely reasonable note of resistance and dissent. These two football clubs often seem to be asking the same question these days. What does this sport mean now? Who owns this thing? What is its energy for? What are these protests about, really? Transfer decisions. Poor governance. Modern life. The hyper-capitalism of spectator sport. A world where endlessly loyal supporters of these cultural institutions are made to pay through the nose to act as monetised passion, the commodified backdrop to a so-so game inside a dazzling multi-purpose piece of real estate. Here, it felt as though the energy off the pitch was as vital as the action on it.And this was a good afternoonin the end for Tottenham, 1-0 winners of a breezy, fun, medium-grade game that looked for long periods like what it was, a lower mid-table arm-wrestle. It was a good game for Ange Postecoglou, who had some players back, and found in United the perfect opponents, a visiting club that makes his own look a deeply functional, happy, settled place, with an entirely sensible playing squad.View image in fullscreenAfter the protests, it turned out to be a good game for Ange Postecoglou (left) but not so good for Manchester United’s Ruben Amorim.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianOne of the odd things about Spurs’ season is the sense of individual players performing really well, even as the team stalls. Djed Spence had another fine, wholehearted game. Dejan Kulusevski was excellent again. Lucas Bergvall is a wonderful midfielder. It was genuinely entertaining watching Bergvall repeatedly skip around Casemiro in central midfield, a spectacle with its own kind of mismatched grace, like one of those Strictly Come Dancing pairings where some twirling professional is teamed up with a 25-stone middle-aged newsreader.United began with a very closed team, a flat defensive five with Casemiro chugging about carefully just in front in thick black woolly gloves like a dad at the swings. They struggled to deal with James Maddison from the start. The Amorim structure is easiest to learn when it has parts to press itself up against. Maddison finding those odd little half-spaces presents a problem for players learning this on the hoof.And it was Maddison who scored the only goal after 13 minutes. What does it take to score againstManchester United? A cross from the right. sloppy marking. A deflection. A shot half-saved. Nobody running back except Maddison, who finished neatly. No devil was required here, no clever play, nothing unexpected. It was like leaning on a door that was already open.United had their chances over the next 80 minutes or so. But most of the time they looked like a team learning to play from a leaflet, which is essentially what they are. Has anybody ever thrown half a season away like this, trying to ingrain patterns of play? It presupposes an absolute belief that there is only one way to do this, that 3-4-3 really is the grail. Are wing-backs this important? It feels like having a house party where you get so obsessed with the lasagne being ready you forget to dance, have a good time, buy any booze or say happy new year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Rasmus Højlund expended energy quite near the action, like a photographer covering some other men playing football. Joshua Zirkzee played close to him up front, rumbling about usefully, eager to be of service, like a friendly scaffolding tower.Even the bench here was a jaw-dropper, like an A-level geography trip waiting for the train to Lyme Regis, a row of eager haircuts on best behaviour. The worst part is that there is nothing jarring or startling about this, just a sense they are extremely lucky Ipswich, Leicester and Southampton are so far behind the rest of the field.For Spurs there was at least hope here. For the rest of us, hope just in the energy outside the game, of resistance to the world that brought both of these clubs to this strange place.Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurManchester UnitedAnge PostecoglouanalysisShareReuse this content"

And afterward, all everyone wanted to know was who came up with the plan.“I did,” Wembanyama said. “I don’t regret it. I think it was a good idea.”The challenge included bounce passes, chest passes, shots from three different locations on the floor and dribbling. On the shots – from the corner over an automated defender, near the top of the arc and at the elbow – players had to either make one or shoot three, whichever came first.Wembanyama read the rules and determined that if he and Paul simply flipped the three shots from each location forward they would save a lot of time.And they did. Their time in the first round was 47.9 seconds, easily the best. It just didn’t count after theNBAevidently thought their effort wasn’t in the spirit of taking “valid” shots, like the rules state.Chris Paul and Victor Wenbanyama found the hack in the Skills Challenge.pic.twitter.com/lP5CzssATS— Steve Jones Jr. (@stevejones20)February 16, 2025“We had the best time,” Wembanyama said. “Numbers speak for themselves.”It was a most unconventional approach, but Wembanyama didn’t surprise other competitors with his plan. Golden State’s Draymond Green, who paired up with Warriors teammate Moses Moody in the event, said Wembanyama asked people beforehand if his plan was acceptable.“It definitely sucked to see them throwing the ball like that,” Green said. “But what I will say is Wemby walked around the court asking everybody, ‘Make one or three attempts?’ And Wemby said, ‘Oh, so I can get all three of them up there?’ So, he asked. Now, he may not have asked the right people. But I will say, in Wemby’s defense, he did ask a lot of people.”Green and Moody lost to the Cleveland duo of Donovan Mitchell and Evan Mobley in the final of the skills event. Mitchell reacted by waving two-thumbs-down when Paul and Wembanyama finished, as some in the crowd booed.“If they weren’t disqualified, I think we probably would have just did the same thing, to be honest with you,” Mitchell said. “Play to win, I guess.”Mobley indicated that he had similar thinking as Wembanyama.“I feel like my first round I tried to do a similar thing but made it look like a real shot,” Mobley said. “But that didn’t work really well, so I switched up my strategy.”Paul also said Wembanyama asked about the strategy beforehand. He said he had a good time nonetheless.“We tried something that we thought could win,” Paul said. “To see if we had the best time, so ... it was fun.”Green said Paul warmed up taking conventional shots, presumably before Wembanyama – a second-year player and the league’s reigning rookie of the year, who’ll play in his first All-Star Game on Sunday – presented his time-saving plan.“The old man followed the rookie,” Green said, “right off the cliff.”McClung pulls off first dunk contest three-peatMac McClung pulled off four perfect dunks for an unprecedented NBA dunk contest three-peat.The G League star and dunk maven put on a remarkable show at NBA All-Star Saturday night by recording perfect scores of 50 on all four of his jaw-dropping, creative dunks to become the first player to win three straight dunk contests.Nate Robinson is the only other player to win the dunk contest three times, taking it in 2006 and then repeating in 2009-10.EVERY MAC MCCLUNG DUNK FROM THE 2025#ATTSlamDunk🤯He scored a 50 on EVERY dunk 📈pic.twitter.com/AZ1tLQXHuF— NBA on TNT (@NBAonTNT)February 16, 2025McClung needed to be nearly perfect to top San Antonio’s Stephon Castle in the final round after Castle followed up a 49.6 with his first dunk with a 50 on his second when he went behind his back to switch from his right hand to left before the slam.But McClung was up to the task and now has as many dunk contest wins in his career as he does dunks in NBA games, according to Sportradar, as he has only played five games in the NBA.For his final dunk, McClung stationed 6ft 11in Evan Mobley on a platform in front of the basket. With Mobley holding the ball behind his head, the 6-2 McClung jumped over him, tapped the rim with the ball before slamming it home to the delight of the crowd and judges.McClung’s first dunk in the final round featured him taking one ball in midair for a windmill dunk with his right hand while slamming home another stationed near the rim with his left.McClung also received two perfect scores in the opening round. On the first, a car was parked in the lane with a person standing through the sun roof with a ball. McClung jumped over the car, took the ball and did a reverse, behind-the-head dunk drawing gasps from the crowd and a 50.McClung didn’t disappoint on his next try despite having already clinched a spot in the final. He jumped over a person holding the ball and did a twisting, no-look dunk, getting baseball star Barry Bonds to jump out if his seat for another 50.Castle advanced with more traditional dunks that earned him a total score of 95.Chicago’s Matas Buzelis and Milwaukee’s Andre Jackson Jr were eliminated in the first round.Miami’s Herro wins three-point contestMiami’s Tyler Herro edged out Golden State’s Buddy Hield to win the three-point contest at the NBA’s All-Star Saturday night.Damian Lillard missed a chance to join Larry Bird and Craig Hodges as the only players to three-peat as three-point champions with his score of 18 falling one point short of Herro for the final spot in the three-person final.Herro followed up his third-place performance in the opening round to set the pace in the final with 24 points. He made both special shots worth 3 points and then three of five from the money ball rack worth two points each to end it.Hield followed up a scintillating opening round with 31 points but missing his first six shots in the final. But he got going after that to the delight of his home crowd and had a chance to pull out the win by making six straight money balls to end it.He made four in a row before one shot rimmed out. He made the final shot to end with 23 points.“Just happy, enjoying the moment, happy to be here,” Herro said. “I was definitely nervous going into the first round. But I thought I shot it pretty well in the second round, and then Buddy had the chance to tie it at the end. Obviously a great competition, a bunch of great shooters. Like I said, just happy to be here.”Darius Garland came in third with 19 points in the final round.Brooklyn’s Cam Johnson, Norman Powell of the Clippers, Detroit’s Cade Cunningam and New York’s Jalen Brunson also all failed to advance out of the first round.Explore more on these topicsNBABasketballVictor WembanyamaUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Konaté could have increased their problems when, having been booked for dragging back Matheus Cunha, he collided late with the Wolves playmaker shortly before the interval. The referee, Simon Hooper, ignored Wolves’ appeals for a second yellow and thus a red card. “I cannot change anything now but in my opinion it was a second yellow card,” Vítor Pereira, the head coach, said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I saw him getting his first yellow – that for me was a soft yellow. If he got his second one for a shoulder push that would have again been a soft yellow so he would have been sent off for two soft yellows. I think the referee felt the same and that’s why he didn’t [book him again].“But I’ve watched football so many times in my life and I know that a player and the referee is then under pressure. So the next foul will lead to a referee thinking that maybe he should give it. It is so difficult to play 45 minutes against a strong Wolves team so I had to take Ibou off because you can’t play football knowing in your head you can’t make a foul against such good players as Wolves have.”Cunha’s strike set up an anxious finale for Liverpool yet Slot praised the mentality of his team, particularly after events at Goodison Park on Wednesday. “I don’t think the nerves were too much, it had more to do with how Wolves came out [in the second half]. We showed immense mentality on Wednesday in the most difficult circumstances we faced this season. Then today at 2-0 up we think we have made it 3-0, but it was the correct decision to disallow it for offside, then we thought we had a penalty and again it was the correct decision to overturn it, and then they scored. Mentally that is not easy.“For the first time this season, it looked like we were thinking: ‘Oh.’ That’s why these wins are probably more important than when you outplay Tottenham like we did heretwo weeks ago for 4-0.

He was then taken to a local hospital.“Sands suffered a complex ankle injury with a torn medial ligament as well as a broken fibula,” the club said Sunday on the social network Bluesky. “Our midfielder has already undergone surgery at the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf and will be out for an indefinite period.”Again in the margins at Dortmund, Gio Reyna in danger of being an ‘eternal prospect’Read moreSt Pauli coach Alexander Blessin already feared the worst after the game.“It looks really bad,” Blessin said. “At first I thought, the knee. But it doesn’t look good for the ankle.”Sands had made his fifth consecutive start for St Pauli in his seventh appearance since joining in the winter transfer period, indicating how important he had become for the promoted team in just over a month.“It really hits me to the core,” Blessin said of Sands’s injury. “He was very strong in challenges and brought Jackson Irvine into a better position beside him. That’s why it hurts very, very much. The hope is that he’ll be back as soon as possible.”Sands had only last week told journalists how he hoped his move to St Pauli could help put him back in the mix for a national team place before next year’s World Cup. He will now be ruled out for the upcoming Concacaf Nations League finals in March, in which the US will face Panama in the semi-final before facing either Canada or Mexico in the final or third-place game.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The complaints are persistent,well-documented, and mainly attributed to a single factor: players’ lack of effort. An absence of defensive activity, in particular, is said to make All-Star Games almost unwatchable.For some players,the lack of effort is not an accident– the game falls in the middle of the NBA’s All-Star Break, a six-day pause in competitive play that serves as the only meaningful time off during the league’s 82-game regular season. Indeed, many of the players not named to All-Star teams use the break to go on holiday. Despite this tendency, however, the league’s leadership regularly alters its All-Star Weekend program in an (often ineffective) effort to encourage competitive play.In the last decade alone, the NBA has introduced playground-style team selections (in lieu of players being assigned a team based on conference), clock-freeElam endings(too complicated to explain here), and even monetary bonuses, all in an effort to encourage players to take the All-Star Game more seriously. The results have been underwhelmin; evenNBA commissioner Adam Silver seemed boredwhen presenting the winner’s trophy after last year’s game.Big money, star talent and glam rooms: will Unrivaled transform women’s basketball?Read moreThis year, the league is ditching its traditional two-team, single-game All-Star format in favor of a four-team, three-game mini-tournament. Whether this innovation will translate into quality basketball, however, remains to be seen. Given the All-Star Game’s recent history, it seems unlikely.Further tinkering with the All-Star Game format continues to be limited by multiple factors, including the game’s relative rarity – as an annual event, fans andNBAexecutives alike must wait 12 months between each iteration, making trial-and-error innovation a time-expensive process. Fortunately, the NBA is no longer the only league experimenting the professional basketball space.Unrivaledis a professional 3-on-3 women’s basketball league currently in the middle of its first season. With its recognisable coaches and nomadic structure (ie teams are not tied to specific cities), Unrivaled at first appears to be the women’s version of the Big3, the men’s 3-on-3 leaguefounded in 2017by Ice Cube. There are, however, several critical differences. Unrivaled, for example, features full-court play while the Big3 is a half-court game. The most important distinguishing feature, however, is in the type of players each league attracts – while the Big3’s rosters are filled out mainly by a mix of retired NBA players and younger, not-quite-NBA-level teammates, Unrivaled’s teams entirely consist of active WNBA players.There are a few notable absences—neither superstarCaitlin Clarknorreigning WNBA MVP A’ja Wilsonare playing in this year’s competition. Many of women’s basketball’s other leading names, however, are present: Brittney Griner, Sabrina Ionescu, Aliyah Boston and Breanna Stewart are just the most known among themanyother WNBA All-Stars currently playing on Unrivaled squads. Even if Unrivaled’s only contribution to professional basketball was the concept of an off-season 3-on-3 league featuring the world’s best players, it would a worthy addition to the sporting calendar. The league’s greatest innovation, however, is found within one of its side competitions.In addition to its core 3-on-3 competition, Unrivaled also incorporated a 1-on-1 tournament into its inaugural season and, in doing so, may have introduced a competition format that is exactly what the NBA (and its players) are looking for in an annual event tied to All-Star Weekend. The 1-on-1 tournament, which ended Friday when forward (and Unrivaled cofounder) Napheesa Collier defeated rookie Aaliyah Edwards in the best-of-three finals, offers a level of competition that many fans would love to see in an NBA All-Star setting.View image in fullscreenA general view in the fourth quarter during the 2024 NBA All-Star Game at Gainbridge Fieldhouse in Indianapolis, Indiana.Photograph: Justin Casterline/Getty ImagesDespite being one of the most common forms of playground basketball, the game’s 1-on-1 variant has never taken off as a spectator sport. Red Bull, the energy drink company,sponsored tournaments a decade agoand NBA Hall of Famer Tracy McGrady’sOnes Basketball Leaguewas won by a minor-league men’s basketballer in 2022, but neither featured the world-class talent or high-profile media coverage of the Unrivaled tournament (indeed, in the US the finals of Unrivaled’s 1-on-1 tournament was broadcast in primetime on TNT, a channel associated with professional basketball owing to its decades-long association with the Emmy-winning programmeInside the NBA). Based on the players’ exhausted demeanours, they took the tournament seriously and, with a few tweaks, so too could NBA players.Perhaps unsurprisingly for a novel format, Unrivaled’s first attempt at 1-on-1 tournament stumbled into a few areas for improvement. The league employed a “make it, take it” rule (ie a player who scores also starts the next play with possession of the ball) that, while appropriate among amateurs on the playground, probably provides an unsporting advantage to professional players – the player who scored first won 19 of 24 games in the tournament. Similarly, the purposefully-designed short games (the first player to reach 11 points wins) are made a bittoobrief by the use of a two- and three-point basket scoring system. Switching to a one- and two-point system (common in informal basketball) would give each game more room for drama.Additional rule changes could also circumvent one of the less spectator-friendly truisms of 1-on-1 basketball – the format favours big, post-style athletes who play with their back to the basket. There was only one guard, for example, among the four semi-finalists of Unrivaled’s tournament and, while precise footwork in the post is attractive to basketball afficionados, casual fans are more likely to tune in to see flashy handles and difficult jump shots. Unrivaled’s rules allowed for two neutral individuals to stand on either side of the court and receive passes from (and return passes to) players after defensive rebounds. Removing these neutral intruders would change gameplay in favor of players with advanced ball-handling skills.The biggest hurdle in translating Unrivaled’s 1-on-1 concept to the NBA’s All-Star Weekend, however, would be a familiar one: motivation. In addition to prestige, the champion of the Unrivaled’s tournament won $200k,nearlythe amount that theWNBA’s highest-paid players earn in an entire season. To offer a similar incentive to NBA players, a tournament would have to include prize pool worth tens of millions of dollars.There is a scenario, however, in which money isn’t the only motivator. Players seem to care more about theNBA’s two-year-old (and confusingly formatted) NBA Cup, for example, with each passing year. The intrinsically individual nature of a 1-on-1 tournament could appeal to that same competitive instinct, especially among the league’s legacy-aware superstars. Moreover, the introduction of an individual-focused subsport would give the NBA a new tool which rival leagues like the NFL, MLB or Premier League would struggle to replicate with their respective sports. And, of course, fans andsports television’s talking heads alike would have a new vein of basketball debate at which to mine.Kobe Bryant oncesaid that he’d never lost a 1-on-1 game. Such statements (and Bryant’s face as he made it) demonstrate how important such claims are to many players. Based on Collier’s win in the Unrivaled tournament, a player with Bryant’s skillset (especially his turnaround jumper) in a forward’s body would probably do well—think Kevin Durant, or well-known Kobe-fan Jayson Tatum. Such predictions, however, remain unproveable within the context of current All-Star Weekends.Were the NBA to adopt Unrivaled’s 1-on-1 tournament, it wouldn’t be the first time the league has looked to outside competitions for inspiration. Indeed, the three-point line so important to modern basketball was first made popular by a 1970s rival, the ABA – even more relevantly, theABA also popularized the dunk contest, now an All-Star Weekend mainstay. Nearly 50 years later, perhaps it’s time to once again look outward for a solution to the NBA’s All-Star problem. Until then, Unrivaled’s thrilling 1-on-1 tournament remains … well, unrivaled.Explore more on these topicsBasketballNBAUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And the crowd, just a great night for our sport and a great night for this rivalry.”Played at a blistering pace with physicality throughout, the most anticipated game of 4 Nations round-robin play did not disappoint, from the fisticuffs off the opening faceoff to big hits from Charlie McAvoy on Canadian star Sidney Crosby and Connor McDavid and more than a few vital saves by Connor Hellebuyck among his 24. And the US showed they could keep up with Canada’s speed, skill and talent in the first international tournament with the NHL’s best players in nearly a decade.The US and Canada broke out into fisticuffs three times in the first nine seconds of Saturday’s game.“What an incredible hockey game,” US coach Mike Sullivan said.It all unfolded against the backdrop of uneasy tensions between the North American neighbors and longtime allies, with many fans in the sellout crowd of 21,105 at Bell Centreloudly booingthroughout the pregame rendition of the US anthem. That spilled onto the ice as soon as the puck was dropped, with Matthew Tkachuk asking Brandon Hagel to drop the gloves and the fourth-line Canada winger engaging in the fight two seconds in.Brother Brady Tkachuk did the same with Bennett the moment the puck was dropped on the ensuing faceoff three seconds in. Miller cross-checked Parayko and the two went at it to make it a trio of bouts in the early going.The idea came from a group chat involving the Tkachuk brothers and Miller. Canada coach Jon Cooper called the first minute purely “mayhem.”“It was, I guess, 10 years of no international hockey exhaled in a minute and a half,” Cooper said.The old-school pugilism did not go great early for the US, with the Tkachuks in the penalty box for the first five minutes. McDavid accelerated around the top defensive pair of McAvoy and Zach Werenski and roofed a backhander over Hellebuyck that few goaltenders around would be able to stop.But Canada’s questions in net continued when Jake Guentzel beat Jordan Binnington five-hole midway through the first period to tie it. And the perpetually reliable captain Canada, Crosby, made a rare mistake with a turnover that, combined with a bad line change, paved the way for Larkin to score on a 2-on-1 past the midway mark of regulation.“He’s not afraid to shoot it,” Brady Tkachuk said. “He’s got a great shot, and it ended up being the game-winner.”Binnington around that play made some timely stops, and Canada – without top defenseman Cale Makar because of illness – had plenty of chances to tie it but could not get the puck past Hellebuyck again. Guentzel scored into an empty net with 1:19 left to seal it, and the result puts an all-world roster led by McDavid, Crosby and Nathan MacKinnon in a must-win situation Monday against Finland.“It’s kind of like a Game 7,” McDavid said. “A lot of guys in this room have been in that situation before. Got to get a win.”The US have nothing to play for against Sweden that night, but there is concern about Matthew Tkachuk after he did not finish the game because of what Sullivan called a lower-body injury.“I feel good,” Tkachuk said, brushing off the injury. “Definitely way better after a win. Should be all good.”Explore more on these topicsIce hockeyUS sportsCanadaShareReuse this content"

Just next game’Maddison scores winner to ease pressure on PostecoglouEd Aaronsat Tottenham Hotspur StadiumSun 16 Feb 2025 15.28 ESTLast modified on Sun 16 Feb 2025 18.02 ESTShareRuben Amorim has insisted that he will “stick with my beliefs” after watching his injury-hit Manchester United side endure a12th Premier League defeatof the campaign that leaves them 15th in the table.A first-half goal from James Maddison, who celebrated by putting his finger to his lips in response to criticism he received last week from Roy Keane, sealed Tottenham’s first win at home in the Premier League since they beat Aston Villa here in November. On his return from injury, Guglielmo Vicario produced a brilliant save to deny an Alejandro Garnacho shot in the second half.It meant that United have now lost the most times after 25 games since they were relegated in 1974, with only 12 points separating them from the bottom three. But while Amorim refused to criticise his side’s efforts after Kobbie Mainoo, Manuel Ugarte and Amad Diallo were all ruled out with injury, he acknowledged that results must improve quickly.Tottenham 1-0 Manchester United: Premier League – as it happenedRead more“You grow and you learn a lot of things. We just need to face it and not run away, that is my feeling,” the United manager said.“Today will hurt, it is a tough pain to lose so many games, but then you can change things in a week. I have a lot of problems, my job is so, so hard here. But I stick with my beliefs. We need to stop focusing on the big picture. Just focus on the next game. Let’s do everything to finish the season well and then think about the big picture. That is our goal. In this moment it’s about not even looking at the table or the schedule. That is my part.”The defender Victor Lindelöf was the only substitute on United’s bench who had made a first‑team appearance and Amorim admitted losing three key players had not been ideal preparation. “At the beginning of this week we tried to train but day by day we were losing players. I don’t want to use that as an excuse because a lot of teams are suffering like that. Sometimes you have to face up to the challenge.”More than 1,000 Spurs supporters gathered before kick-off in a protest against the chairman, Daniel Levy, that was organised by the Change for Tottenham action group. But while some remained after the full-time whistle to take part in a planned sit‑in protest, the numbers were significantly reduced.“I thought the fans were great and they got behind the team. They contributed to us getting the result we needed,” saidAnge Postecoglou, whose side have now moved up to 12th.“It’s unacceptable that we are in the position that we are but the circumstances have dictated that. Today was an important game if we are going to start that process of improving. We certainly feel that we have an opportunity to climb up the table.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The generally optimistic mood, though, is somewhat at odds with the gloomy feel across much of the rest of the club amid the latest reportsof a further 200 job losses.Five-star Arsenal hammer Tottenham in WSL derby as Chloe Kelly makes returnRead moreOn the pitch this team have put smiles on faces. Enjoying a pastry before the lunchtime kick‑off, Martyn, who goes to around 10 men’s games a season at Old Trafford but enjoys bringing his six‑year-old daughter to WSL games at Leigh, joked before kick‑off: “It’s nice to come to a United game where I can look forward to winning, for a change.”His confidence was not misplaced, as the Norway striker Elisabeth Terland slotted in low to give Marc Skinner’s side the lead. Crystal Palace, bottom of the table, did manage to level before half‑time through Mille Gejl on the counterattack – Manchester United conceded to a team in the WSL’s bottom half for the first time this season – but Terland rolled in her second for the dominant hosts after the Sweden international My Cato inadvertently knocked the ball into her path. The England midfielder Grace Clinton headed in the hosts’ third late on, from a free‑kick whipped in by an in-form Ella Toone.Despite the good results on the pitch, there was still a lingering feeling of frustration among some United supporters, summed up by home fan Aimee, who had travelled up from Wales to see this game. “These girls are amazing. Just imagine how good they could be with a bit more support from Jim.”View image in fullscreenSir Jim Ratcliffe at Old Trafford in January 2025.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAIt would be unfair to say the dislike of Ratcliffe is universal: many fans were keen to point out “he’s better than the Glazers”. Yet there is frustration at some of Ratcliffe’s comments in interviews that suggested the women’s side is not his priority. Andy Slater, editor of the Manchester United women’s team fanzine Barmy Article’, who is sad about the job cuts changing the “family feel” of the club, said: “It’s just baffling, the things he comes out with. It’s more about attitudes.“Even without putting Chelsea levels of money into it, it [the women’s side] doesn’t take a whole lot to let it run itself – give the women’s side the tools to do what it needs to do, and let it run. Since the winter break, we’ve really turned things around [in the WSL] and now we’re playing this way, if we can keep it going, it’s a really exciting team to follow.”Another fan who has followed the women’s side since it was re-formed in 2018 is presenter and content creator Mina Ibrahim, who said she has seen pros and cons. “The most important thing is, the women were backed sufficiently in last summer’s transfer window to bring in talent, like a proven goalscorer. That was needed.“I’ve also been disappointed with the public comments made. He’s kind of suggested multiple times that the women’s team is not on the forefront, and it would be nice for fans and players to feel like they’re standing side-by-side with the ownership and being supported publicly as well as privately.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ratcliffe is yet to attend any women’s matches at Leigh Sports Village – something that even Michael Owen managed to do earlier this season as a fan – although the chief executive, Omar Berrada, and other senior club figures have done so.There was an attendance of 4,761 for this game, many hundreds of whom were determined to stay outside the players’ entrance for well over an hour after full time in the hope of a selfie. Maybe one day, Ratcliffe will be among them.Explore more on these topicsManchester United WomenCrystal Palace WomenWomen's Super LeagueWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The game was stopped in the 16th minute when the referee discussed the issue with the two captains and match delegate.Spanish media reported that the match was halted for three minutes as part of the anti-racism protocol, and announcements were made asking the crowd to stop chanting. The referee warned that he would stop the game if the incident was repeated.After the game resumed, Espanyol’s Roberto Fernández scored in the 62nd minute and Oihan Sancet equalised in the 77th.Espanyol and Athletic condemned the abuse on Sunday.Eintracht Frankfurtended their run of three draws and consolidated third place in the Bundesliga with a 3-1 win over relegation threatenedHolstein Kiel.

You can see she’s smiling a lot and is very happy with where she’s at,” Slegers said. “It’s important that you have players in a good place, feeling good and feeling motivated. That is when you get the most out of yourself and we can keep building with Chloe.”Fans of Manchester United women’s team want more input from RatcliffeRead moreThe bar denied Kelly a dream return late on, but it mattered little. In front of an Emirates Stadium crowd of 56,784, Arsenal asserted their north London derby dominance, securing their ninth win in 11 league games against their local rivals.Slegers had promised that they would make things “uncomfortable” for Tottenham at a packed-out stadium and they delivered. In the first half the Gunners kept Spurs pinned in their half, dominating with more than 72% possession, 15 shots to Spurs’ two and 31 touches in the opposition box to Tottenham’s two.Slegers rested five players for the defeat of London City Lionesses in the FA Cup fifth round last weekend but the big news was on the bench, with Kelly prepared to make her second debut after being cup tied in the FA Cup and ineligible to play against her parent club Manchester City in the league and League Cup semi-finals following her move in January. There was a roar from the crowd as a grinning Kelly limbered up early in the first half, 2,815 days since her previous game for Arsenal before she joined Everton on loan in search of first‑team football.View image in fullscreenAlessia Russo celebrates after her header deflected in off Tottenham’s Clare Hunt to give Arsenal the lead.Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images/ReutersThe home side’s press was relentless, the Australian midfielder Kyra Cooney-Cross particularly energetic, forcing turnover after turnover and providing the assist for the opener. It took 15 minutes for Arsenal to make the breakthrough against a Tottenham side that seems to have lost its way this season – Cooney‑Cross delivered from the right and a glancing header from Alessia Russo deflected off the thigh of the defender Clare Hunt and in. It was a deserved opener, and they should have been three or four up by the time the second goal arrived. Mariona Caldentey was the provider, her shot blocked by Hunt only for the Spain international to leap forward and rifle the loose ball past the goalkeeper Lize Kop.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sonia Bompastor's side rallied with Mayra Ramírez equalising just after the hour mark in what was the leaders' first real chance of note.The visitors looked good value for a point until the third minute of added time when James [pictured] unleashed a long-range effort with her left foot that clipped the post and found the back of the net to break Everton hearts.West Hammoved clear of the relegation battle with an impressive 3-1 home win over fifth-placedBrighton. Shekiera Martínez opened the scoring for the hosts from close range in the 11th minute, but Nikita Parris quickly hit back for Brighton, sweeping home Rachel McLauchlan's low cross.Rehanne Skinner's side emerged stronger after the restart and Riko Ueki restored their lead after 64 minutes, with Viviane Asseyi scoring a penalty four minutes later after being brought down by McLauchlan as West Ham climbed to eighth.Leicestereased to a 3-0 win over Aston Villa to leapfrog their opponents, who slip back down to 11th in the table. The Leicester captain, Janice Cayman, opened the scoring after 29 minutes and smashed in a superb volley just after half-time, with Julie Thibaud bundling home on 50 minutes to seal victory.PA MediaPhotograph: Andrew Couldridge/REUTERSWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Robert Vilahamn had stressed before kick-off the importance of Spurs being strong defensively, and there could be a modicum of solace in the two-goal margin, with the home side arguably complacent in front of goal. By the hour, though, Arsenal had doubled their tally, first a Frida Maanum effort took a heavy deflection off a beleaguered Hunt and sailed in and then Russo fired low into the far corner.The stadium rose soon after, as Kelly was introduced to the pitch for her first minutes in red since 2017. That was the same year Arsenal beat Tottenham 10-0 in the FA Cup with Kelly on the scoresheet. Since then, the chasm between the two sides had seemingly narrowed, a 1-0 defeat of Arsenal in December 2023 giving Spurs a first Women’s Super League win against the Gunners. However, that was perhaps a false dawn. At the Emirates Stadium the visitors struggled to escape their own half, a first of only two shots on target coming in the 65th minute when Drew Spence’s header from a corner was palmed away by Daphne van Domselaar, before Emily Fox added Arsenal’s fifth in style with a rising long-range effort.“Most teams will lose away at Arsenal, but if you lose 5-0 that’s not good,” Vilahamn said. “You can look at why you play too many short passes and try to have this buildup. We want to develop that game, but we need to find the right balance. To find the right level with that is to be brave. When we don’t succeed, of course I’m sitting here looking a bit stupid, I get that. That’s the part of my journey with this team and what we want to do so I’m still going to do that, but I’m also going to analyse what we can do better because I’m not going to be stupid – but I also want to make sure we have an identity that we follow.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueArsenal WomenTottenham Hotspur WomenWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The referee, José Luis Munuera Montero, dismissed Bellingham in the 39th minute for dissent, but the 21-year-old insisted after the game that he was wrongly sent off.European football: Bellingham says his red card was wrong after Madrid drawRead more“I do not want to go into the details of what was said, but I didn’t insult the referee,” Bellingham said in quotes reported by Spanish media. “I hope they review the footage because it was a misunderstanding, but I am here to apologise to the team as I put them in a difficult situation.”TheReal Madridmanager, Carlo Ancelotti, backed Bellingham in clear terms at his post-match press conference on Saturday. “I think the referee did not understand Jude Bellingham’s English,” the Italian said. “He said fuck off, not fuck you – that’s way different. I won’t talk more about the referee as I want to be on the bench next week.”View image in fullscreenHansi Flick can bring his Barcelona team level with Real Madrid if they win against Rayo Vallecano on Monday.Photograph: Alberto Estévez/EPAFlick, whoseBarcelonaside host Rayo Vallecano on Monday evening, criticised Bellingham’s actions when asked about the incident on Sunday.“It is disrespectful, but I’m not the one who should comment on it,” Flick said. “That’s what I’ve always told the players. Why waste time and energy arguing with the referee regarding the decisions he makes?”“There is a player, who is the captain, who has the right to argue with the referee,” the German continued. “I don’t like the behaviour I saw yesterday and I told the players that today. It’s a weakness when you get a red card.”Luka Modric was captain for Saturday’s fixture, starting alongside Bellingham in midfield. The league leaders’ dropped points – and Atlético’s 1-1 draw at home to Celta Vigo – gives Barça the chance to move level with Real at the top with a win over Rayo, who currently sit sixth in the table.Athletic Bilbao’s match at Espanyol on Sunday was briefly interrupted because of fans’ racist chants. The match referee activated the anti-racism protocol and stopped Sunday’s game in Barcelona about 20 minutes in. The interruption lasted for about three minutes before the game resumed.The Athletic forward Iñaki Williams denounced the chants after the match, saying they were targeted at his teammate Maroan Sannadi. Williams has previously been subjected to racist chants at Espanyol. The match ended in a 1-1 draw.Explore more on these topicsJude BellinghamReal MadridBarcelonaLa LigaEuropean club footballnewsShareReuse this content"

The Austrian defender Michael Steinwender scored his firstHeartsgoal on his home debut to equalise, heading in from a corner in the 49th minute.The Czech winger Vaclav Cerny restored the visitors’ lead in the 61st minute before the unfortunate McCart, who signed from Rotherham at the start of January, put into his own net again 12 minutes later.Victory cuts Celtic’s lead over Rangers at the top of the league back to 13 points. Hearts are in ninth place in the table after suffering their first defeat in nine matches, although they will feel the outcome could have been so different without Butland.Hearts enjoyed a let-off in the second minute when Harry Souttar drove a cross from Hagi past keeper Craig Gordon only to see the offside flag raised. The hosts almost took the lead in the 17th minute when Kabangu, on loan from Belgian club Union St Gilloise, shot from 14 yards but Butland made a crucial save.View image in fullscreenJack Butland produced a number of saves to keep Hearts at bay in the first half.Photograph: Jane Barlow/PAMoments later, Hagi collected a pass from Cerny down the left and drilled in a cross which was tipped by Gordon on to the helpless McCart, who turned the ball into his own net. Hearts tried to hit straight back but Butland twice denied Kabangu, then tipped over a dipping volley from Hearts captain Lawrence Shankland.Gordon saved another drive from Raskin just before the break and then had to react quickly to prevent McCart scoring another own goal from a Hamza Igamane header. The defender also had a chance to score at the right end for Neil Critchley’s side, but headed over the bar from a corner.Hearts were level from a set-piece soon after the break, James Penrice floating his corner to Steinwender who glanced his header past Butland. Kabangu then hesitated when presented with an opportunity at the back post, before Cerny curled a shot inches wide of the post at the other end.Cerny made no mistake when Igamane’s drive came off Adam Forrester and into his path, dispatching the ball past Gordon – with the home fans still complaining about a penalty appeal ignored seconds earlier when Gers defender Nsiala clashed with James Wilson inside the box.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "Content": "4h ago17.08 ESTMatch reportMary Fowler made WSL history as Manchester City cruised to a 4-0 win over Liverpool at the Joie Stadium. The in-form winger assisted both of Khadija Shaw’s first-half goals to become the first player to record at least two goal involvements in four successive league games.City dominated the match from the off but did not break the deadlock until the half-hour mark. Having been played onside by Jenna Clark when receiving a clever pass from Fowler, Shaw took the ball out of her feet with a quick touch before slotting into the bottom-right corner. That effort was followed by another brilliant touch and finish from the striker just before half-time.Things could have been very different at the break had Ceri Holland converted her one-on-one shot in the 18th minute, but instead the midfielder fired her effort directly at Rebecca Knaak.The hosts continued their dominance in the second half and came close immediately after the restart through Aoba Fujino. But the match was quickly put to bed following a post-and-in effort from Jill Roord. Things went from bad to worse for Liverpool when Gracie Prior netted her first WSL goal on her first league start with a bizarre cross-cum-shot which nestled perfectly in the top-left corner.Gareth Taylor, the Manchester City manager, was thrilled with his team’s performance. “It was good, I think the girls delivered the game plan really well,” he said. “We knew Liverpool would be aggressive and they had some moments, probably more than we would like, but I think sometimes you’re going to do that. I thought the way we were getting players forward into the box early on was really good.”Meanwhile, Matt Beard, the Liverpool manager, admitted he made mistakes. “In the first-half I did get it wrong, we needed to adapt things quicker but I felt tonight we had so many chances to score. It could’ve been 6-4 to be honest with you, we were too passive in the first half and we were too slow to get in positions to play and we were too transitional. We were worried about turning the ball over and getting countered on. The second half we did that a little bit better. It’s a frustrating night for us.”Share"

Workers had fallen foul of those rule changes, leading to written warnings and the threat of dismissal, they claimed.“A lot of people are not even aware of these adjustments and changes,” he said. “If you were not performing well you used to get a message saying ‘come and talk to managers’ within 48 hours. Now they let it stack up for a significant time and they are really tough with us.”He said delays in dealing with queries meant workers often could not remember why they had stopped work for a few minutes – whether it was equipment failure, a trip to the bathroom or a chat with a manager or colleague.Amanda Gearing, a GMB senior organiser, said the number of disciplinary actions had increased significantly since the ballot andAmazonwas “clearing out what they see as troublemakers” as it tried to win new government contracts.She said a recent GMB survey of union members working for Amazon found that 81% were unhappy working for the company.It emerged last year that Amazon’s cloud services arm was awarded contracts with the Home Office, HMRC and Department for Work and Pensions worth more than £1bn in the 12 months to September.“Amazon is one of the globe’s wealthiest corporations, taking revenge against their own workers for daring to stand up for better pay and safer conditions,” Gearing said. “They’re hoping the new government will look past their record of poverty pay, unsafe conditions and union busting and write more blank cheques for taxpayers’ money”.Amazon said it did not monitor toilet breaks and there had been no changes in the amount of break time staff receive.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Organisers said the protests took place in dozens of locations.While the protests were scattered, they highlighted therisks to the car company of Musk’s close association with Trump’s radical rightwing agenda. Many of the protesters carried placards likening the Trump administration to Nazis – a characterisation that Musk has previously emphatically denied.Musk is leading the US president’s “department of government efficiency”, or Doge, its name deriving from an internet dog meme. Doge’s actions, rapidly dismantling government agencies and firing federal workers en masse across the US, have beencriticised as illegal by some constitutional experts.Some Tesla investors have queried whether Musk’s association with the Trump administration, including spending more than $200m on the presidential election campaign, will dent its sales – particularly in liberal areas of the US. Places including California have tended to be the biggest markets for electric cars in the US, while the Republican party and theTrump administration are actively opposed to the technology.View image in fullscreenProtest outside a Tesla dealership in New Yorkon Saturday.Photograph: Justin Lane/EPAAmerican musician Sheryl Crow posted a video of herself on Saturday waving goodbye to aTeslabeing towed away on the Instagram social network. She said she had sold the car and donated money to US National Public Radio station (NPR), which “is under threat by President Musk”.“My parents always said … you are who you hang out with,” she wrote. “There comes a time when you have to decide who you are willing to align with. So long Tesla.”People within the Tesla business insist the company is separate from its chief executive. However, its surging valuation – thanks to previously fast-growing sales – has played a key role in building Musk’s wealth used to fund Trump’s election campaign.Shares in Tesla account for about a third of Musk’s wealth, according to Bloomberg. His ownership of private rocket company SpaceX accounts for another third, while the rest is linked to stakes in xAI, the X social network, the Boring Company, a tunnelling business, and brain-computer interface company Neuralink. Musk has used his shares in Tesla and SpaceX to secure personal loans worth billions of dollars.Tesla reported itsfirst ever annual decline in sales in 2024, amid tough times for the global car industry. It is not yet clear whether Musk’s rightwing politics contributed to that decline, and the company could conceivably make up for lost leftwing customers with new enthusiasts on the right.Some commentators have linked a steep decline in Tesla sales in Germany with his December declaration ofsupport for the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD). German Tesla sales fell 60% year-on-year in January, although delivery schedules can be affected by other factors beyond demand.Tesla could also be vulnerable in other ways to political backlash. In the UK, Ed Davey, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, this week said the Labour government should impose tariffs on Tesla cars in retaliation for the White House imposing levies on steel imports.Tesla was approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsTeslaDonald TrumpElon MuskElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsUS politicsGreenhouse gas emissionsMotoringnewsShareReuse this content"

While the immense cuts are framed as a means of removing waste, they may also become a boon to private companies – including Musk’s own businesses – that the government increasingly relies on for many of its key initiatives.Musk and his allies in the “department of government efficiency” (Doge), the unofficial committee acting as the operations arm of his cost-cutting efforts, have targeted a range of major government departments. They have moved to close the United States Agency for International Development, slashed the Department of Education and taken over the General Services Administration that controls federal IT structures. Doge staffers have also gained access to the treasury department, as well as set their sights on the Department of Defense, energy department, Environmental Protection Agency and at least a dozen others.While Doge begins to make deep cuts throughout the government, Musk and those acting on his behalf have called forimplementing new artificial intelligence systemsin federal agencies andcompletely overhauling American weaponsprograms. As humanitarianaid groups reelfrom Musk’s cuts, tech and defense firms are seeing a chance to integrate themselves deeper into the newTrump administration’s agenda.Trump and Musk launch mass layoffs at several US federal agenciesRead moreMusk’s plans have already excited Silicon Valley mainstays such as Palantir, whose executives praised Doge on an earnings call last week and talked about how the disruption by the billionaire’s strike squad was good for the company. Palantir already has won hundreds of millions of dollars inUS military contractsin recent years for AI-related projects.“I think Doge is going to bring meritocracy and transparency to government, and that’s exactly what our commercial business is,” Palantir’s chief technology officer, Shyam Sankar, said on the call. Sankar claimed the cost cutting would target straggling software projects, which he called “sacred cows of the deep state”.“This is a revolution, some people are gonna get their heads cut off,” Palantir’s CEO, Alex Karp, added. “We’re expecting to see unexpected things and to win.”View image in fullscreenFrom left, Priscilla Chan, Mark Zuckerberg, Lauren Sanchez, Jeff Bezos, Sundar Pichai and Elon Musk attend Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration in the US Capitol in Washington, on 20 January.Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/APOther CEOs and tech executives have similarly praised Musk and told investors that Doge’s plans represent an opportunity for their companies. Brian Armstrong, CEO of the multibillion-dollar cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase,lauded Dogelast week for its “great progress” and suggested putting government expenditures on blockchain technology. Defense contractors like Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grummanspoke favorably of the efforton recent earnings calls, while the Predator drone-maker General Atomics Aeronautical Systemswrote a letter directly to Musklast month asking him to speed up the way the Pentagon handles defense contracts.As companies seek to benefit from Doge’s reshaping of the government, Musk also has extensive contractsworth billions of dollarsthrough his own companies like SpaceX that are potentially set to expand under the new administration.Musk’s decimation of government agencies hasdrawn comparisons to the frenzied cuts he made after acquiring Twitterin 2022, but the long-term effect of Doge may more closely resemble how SpaceX enmeshed itself with Nasa to the point where itnow handles the majorityof the United States’ space launches. Already, products like Musk’s satellite communications provider Starlink have become so integral to government programs that the US nowrelies on themfor everything fromuse in foreign conflictsto domestic disaster relief.SpaceX won its first Nasa contract in 2006,receiving $278mto help with cargo flights to the International Space Station. The company’s innovations in rocket technology allowed for cheaper spaceflights and more launches, undercutting older aerospace competitors. As Nasa increasingly outsourced its needs to private companies in the late 2000s, SpaceX continued to partner with the agency on about $15bn worth of contracts in the years since. The Pentagon awarded the firm hundreds of millions of dollars in satellite contracts, expanding its influence and creating a crisis at the agency when Muskrefused to let Ukraine use Starlinkto launch an attack on Russia.SpaceX nowcontrols over 60% of the world’s active satellites, while last month Nasatapped the companyto rescue two of its stranded astronauts. What began as outsourcing supply runs turned into some of the United States’ marquee agencies depending on Musk, even before he became a fixture of the Trump administration.Removing checks on Musk’s conflictsDonald Trump has given Musk enormous power to reshape the government, including on Tuesday issuing an executive order that requires agencies tocoordinate with Dogeon staffing decisions and cuts.Musk’s influence in the White House also puts in peril the numerousfederal investigations against his companiesfor a range of alleged wrongdoings that includes violating federal labor and securities laws. Trump has alreadydissolved one watchdog agencyinvestigating Tesla. Government accountability groups have warned that Musk’s myriad of potential ethical conflicts and a lack of transparency around his actions in government carry the risk that he will use his power for political corruption.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Unions have also sued, but a judgeallowed Musk and Trump’sbuyouts to continue.Elon Musk’s six major conflicts of interest with the federal governmentRead moreMusk and Doge’s takeover of federal agencies has coincided with Trump removing many of the government officials that act as checks on ethical conflicts and malfeasance. Shortly after taking office, Trump fired18 inspectors generalat different agencies whose role was to act as guards against abuses from government officials.“Trump got rid of the independent watchdogs who could investigate what Musk and his minions are doing at these agencies and then has let him run amok,” Sherman said.Musk holds the role of “special government employee” which also allows him to sidestep the usual financial disclosures that would pertain to an official at his level of power, andon Tuesday White House officials statedthat while Musk plans to make such a filing it will be confidential and not available to the public.TheTrump administrationhas repeatedly dismissed any concerns over ethical concerns with Musk’s role. Speaking with reporters last week, the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, stated: “If Elon Musk comes across a conflict of interest with the contracts and the funding that Doge is overseeing, then Elon will excuse himself from those contracts.”Procurement laws prevent government officials from self-dealing to their own businesses and awarding contracts that come with ethical conflicts. But these laws are nuanced and may only apply to the people with direct decision-making power over who gets those government contracts, Sherman of Crew said. This leaves open a gray area where Musk’s sprawling influence could pressure government officials to greenlight contracts that benefit him or decide against those that reward his competitors.“That portion of the law is not designed for the level of capture of our government functions that President Trump has allowed Mr Musk to accomplish,” Sherman said.Explore more on these topicsElon MuskDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsUS domestic policySpaceXnewsShareReuse this content"

It now has an estimated 150 million users.One of those users, since 2012, was Odunayo, a software ­engineer and developer from London. Six years ago, she sat down to ­create what she imagined might be a companion app to Goodreads.After building a demo for a few friends, she quickly realised it was more likely to be a competitor, ­offering readers’ tracking tools and trends – using AI – that could help recommend their next book. And as of this week,The StoryGraphhas 3.8 million active users, many of whom have ditched Goodreads.In a blogpost entitled “Leaving Goodreads in 2025!” just before Christmas, a blogger and reviewer going by the name Books With Bunny wrote: “I don’t love that Goodreads is owned by Amazon. There’s so much about the company that I don’t agree with … Goodreads feels outdated. Its interface looks clunky, and the features are limited … I’ve found Goodreads’ recommendations underwhelming and heavily skewed toward popular titles.”I think people love the different types of data we give. We just have a lot of really cool features, and the buddy read-alongs. But I think the number one thing is that it’s just not owned by Amazon’Nadia OdunayoBunny announced she would be using The StoryGraph going forward: “I’ve been loving it so far! Not only is it woman-owned, but it also offers so many fantastic features.”A Goodreads spokesperson said on Saturday that in 2024 it “welcomed millions of readers and we saw strong year-over-year growth in book tracking with our community adding hundreds of millions of books to their want to read, currently reading, and read shelves”.Odunayo, 33, said: “I think people love the different types of data we give. We just have a lot of really cool features, and the buddy read-alongs.“But I think the number one thing, if people are comparing us with Goodreads, is that a lot of ­people do go: ‘It’s just not owned by Amazon.’”Goodreads has struggled with a perception that there can be malicious reviewing and even personal attacks on authors from users. In 2023, debut author-to-be Cait Corrain wasdropped by her publisher, Del Rey, and her planned publication was scrapped after she admitted creating fake Goodreads accounts to boost the ratings on her own work and attack other debut authors with books due out at the same time as hers.In the wake of the Corrain incident, Goodreads released a statement saying that while it welcomed both positive and negative reviews, it “prohibits reviews that are not ­relevant to the book, harass readers or authors, or attempt to artificially deflate or inflate the overall rating of the book”.It added: “We continue to invest in improvements to quickly detect and moderate content and accounts that violate our reviews or ­community guidelines.”The StoryGraph has tried to head off such problems by not allowing private messaging or comments on reviews. Odunayo said she wanted to avoid a situation “where anyone can just comment on your review and you’ve got to deal with being scared to put reviews up there”.Odunayo never had ambitions to work in tech when she was younger. She studied philosophy, politics and economics at the University of Oxford and had an offer to work for Deutsche Bank.But after winning a competition for a place on a coding course for women – “just a nice skill to have in my back pocket” – the tech industry became her home.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Why did the US let a safety bill die?The Kids Online Safety act passed the Senate 91-to-3 but died in the House. Advocates on both sides say they won’t give upKari PaulSun 16 Feb 2025 08.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 16 Feb 2025 10.15 ESTShareWhen Congress adjourned for the holidays in December, a landmark bill meant to overhaul how tech companies protect their youngest users had officially failed to pass. Introduced in 2022, the Kids Online Safety act (Kosa) was meant to be a huge reckoning for big tech. Instead, despite sailing through the Senate with a 91-to-3 vote in July, the bill languished and died in the House.Kosa had been passionatelychampionedby families who said their children had fallen victim to the harmful policies of social media platforms and advocates who said a bill reining in the unchecked power of big tech was long overdue. They are bitterly disappointed that a strong chance to check big tech failed because of congressional apathy. But human rights organizations had argued that the legislation could have led to unintended consequences affecting freedom of speech online.What is the Kids Online Safety act?Kosa was introduced nearly three years ago in the aftermath of bombshell revelations by theformer Facebook employee Frances Haugenabout the scope and severity of social media platforms’ effects on young users. It would have mandated that platforms like Instagram and TikTok address online dangers affecting children through design changes and allowing young users to opt out of algorithmic recommendations.“This is a basic product-liability bill,” said Alix Fraser, director of Issue One’s Council for Responsible Social Media. “It’s complicated, because the internet is complicated and social media is complicated, but it is essentially just an effort to create a basic product-liability standard for these companies.”US parents: how much do you spend on childcare?Read moreA central – and controversial – component of the bill was its “duty of care” clause, which declared that companies have “a duty to act in the best interests of minors using their platforms” and would be open to interpretation by regulators. It also would have required that platforms implement measures to reduce harm by establishing “safeguards for minors”.Critics argued that a lack of clear guidance on what constitutes harmful content might prompt companies to filter content more aggressively, leading to unintended consequences for freedom of speech. Sensitive but important topics such as gun violence and racial justice could be viewed as potentially harmful and subsequently be filtered out by the companies themselves. These censorship concerns were particularly pronounced for the LGBTQ+ community, which, opponents of Kosa said, could be disproportionately affected by conservative regulators, reducing access to vital resources.“With Kosa, we saw a really well-intentioned but ultimately vague bill requiring online services to take unspecified action to keep kids safe, which was going to lead to several bad outcomes for children, and all marginalized users,” said Aliya Bhatia, a policy analyst at the Center for Democracy and Technology, which opposed the legislation and which receives money from tech donors including Amazon, Google and Microsoft.Kosa’s complicated historyWhen the bill was first introduced, more than 90 human rights organizations signed a letter in opposition, underscoring these and other concerns. In response to such criticism, the bill’s authors issued revisions in February 2024 – most notably, shifting the enforcement of its “duty of care” provision from state attorneys general to the Federal Trade Commission. Following these changes, a number of organizations including Glaad, the Human Rights Campaign and the Trevor Projectwithdrew opposition, stating that the revisions “significantly mitigate the risk of [Kosa] being misused to suppress LGBTQ+ resources or stifle young people’s access to online communities”.But other civil rights groups maintained their opposition, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), the ACLU and Fight for the Future, calling Kosa a “censorship bill” that would harm vulnerable users and freedom of speech at large. They argued the duty-of-care provision could just as easily be weaponized by a conservative FTC chair against LGBTQ+ youth as by state attorneys general. These concerns have been reflected in Trump’s FTC chair appointment of the Republican Andrew Ferguson,who said in leaked statementshe planned to use his role to “fight back against the trans agenda”.Concerns around how Ferguson will manage online content is “exactly what LGBTQ youth in this fight have written and called Congress about hundreds of times over the last couple of years”, said Sarah Philips of Fight for the Future. “The situation that they were fearful of has come to fruition, and anyone ignoring that is really just putting their heads in the sand.”Opponents say that even with Kosa’s failure to pass, a chilling effect has already materialized with regards to what content is available on certain platforms. A recentreportin User Mag found that hashtags for LGBTQ+-related topics were being categorized as “sensitive content” and restricted from search. Legislation like Kosa does not take into account the complexities of the online landscape, said Bhatia, of the Center for Democracy and Technology, and is likely to lead platforms to pre-emptively censor content to avoid litigation.“Children’s safety occupies an interesting paradoxical positioning in tech policy, where at once children are vulnerable actors on the internet, but also at the same time benefit greatly from the internet,” she said. “Using the blunt instrument of policy to protect them can often lead to outcomes that don’t really take this into account.”Proponents attribute the backlash to Kosa to aggressive lobbying from the tech industry, though two of the top opponents – Fight for the Future and EFF – are not supported by large tech donors. Meanwhile, major tech companies are split on Kosa, with X, Snap, Microsoft and Pinterest outwardly supporting the bill and Meta and Google quietly opposing it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Though Trump has not directly indicated his views on Kosa, several people in his close circle haveexpressed supportfollowing last-minute amendments to the bill in 2024facilitated by Elon Musk’s X.The congressional death of Kosa may seem like the end of a winding and controversial path, but advocates on both sides of the fight say it’s too soon to write the legislation’s obituary.“We should not expect Kosa to disappear quietly,” said Prem M Trivedi, policy director at the Open Technology Institute, which opposes Kosa. “Whether we are going to see it introduced again or different incarnations of it, more broadly the focus on kid’s online safety is going to continue.”Richard Blumenthal, the senator who co-authored the bill with Senator Marsha Blackburn, has promised to reintroduce it in the upcoming congressional session, and other advocates for the bill also say they will not give up.“I’ve worked with a lot of these parents who have been willing to recount the worst day of their lives time and time again, in front of lawmakers, in front of staffers, in front of the press, because they know that something has to change,” said Fraser. “They’re not going to stop.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsSocial mediaChildrenUS politicsDigital mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

In other words, that some of that stuff that we’re finding is very fraudulent, therefore maybe we have less debt than we thought.”The suggestion was that opening up the US Treasury’s data to Elon Musk’s “department of government efficiency” team had identified a money-saving wheeze: why not walk away from some of America’s debt obligations – a “selective default”, as economists call it.Like so many of the serially erratic president’s pronouncements, this one had to be “walked back”, as the Americans call it. Kevin Hassett, his economic adviser, stressed the next day that Trump was referring to other payments that the US Treasury had been making, not its$36tn (£28.6tn) in debt obligations. Hassett suggested the Treasury “had been “sending money out without flagging what it was for”.Yet just entertain for a moment the idea that a US administration might decide it could unilaterally default on even a small portion of its debts. The result would be catastrophic. Because of the dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency, the yield on US Treasuries – US government bonds – is perhaps the most important benchmark in global financial markets.Donald Trump sees his trade war as a show of strength. In fact, it’s the opposite | Larry ElliottRead moreIf investors suddenly began demanding a higher yield – in effect the interest rate – as insurance against the risk they would not get their money back, the effects would ripple through the trillions of dollars of other assets worldwide priced with reference to supposedly super-safe Treasuries.Hassett made clear this is absolutely not an outcome the saner elements of Trump’s administration were aiming for. Indeed, the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, has said the president wants to bring down the yield on 10-year US government borrowing costs.Yet as a result of Musk’s crazed takeover of the financial plumbing of the state, the US is already welching on its obligations – moral and financial – all over the world.Every day seems to bring fresh examples: health clinics in the developing world being closed because of the dismantling ofUSAid; researchers whose projects funded by the National Institutes of Health have been put on hold.Officials from the city administration in New York have even claimed the government in effectdipped into the city’s bank accountto claw back $80m in federal grants that had already been made.This fast-track austerity is ostensibly aimed at improving the government’s balance sheet – putting the US through “the private equity wringer”, asWired’s Brian Barrettput it last week.But the Musk/Trump takeover simultaneously risks shattering confidence in US institutions, in a way that is liable to have long-lasting and unpredictable consequences.Five former treasury secretaries warned in an extraordinaryNew York Times editoriallast week of the risks of letting Musk loose on the nation’s financial system.“Any hint of the selective suspension of congressionally authorised payments will be a breach of trust and ultimately, a form of default. And our credibility, once lost, will prove difficult to regain,” they said.Musk has faced legal action and is targeting arms of government with which he has a particular beef, meaning the chances of anything that looks like a formal default remain low.View image in fullscreenPresident Donald Trump speaks as Elon Musk carries his son X on his shoulders in the Oval Office.Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/ReutersBut the whole performance – as exemplified by a rambling Oval Office briefing involving Trump, Musk and his son X (who has the same name as the social media platform formerly known as Twitter) – screams “political risk”, as analysts would call it if it was happening elsewhere in the world.It would not be surprising if efforts to spur the development of alternative global reserve currencies and payments structures – such as those proposed by nations in the global south – are given added impetus by the shenanigans in Washington.The sheer insularity of the Trump administration’s approach was illustrated on Friday when Bessent – supposedly one of the more sensible figures in the administration – said: “The US has a strong dollar policy, but because we have a strong dollar policy it doesn’t mean that other countries get to have a weak currency policy.”In the short term, the most immediate impact of Trump’s plans on the global economy is likely to be via his long-trailed tariffs plan, which will throw sand in the wheels of the international trading system.All of this is likely to dampen growth, and if trade analysts are right that Trump’s latest idea of “reciprocity”, based on each country’s existing tariff and VAT rates, is the opening bid in a negotiation, it may be weeks or even months before any clarity emerges.Given this corrosive uncertainty, markets have so far been remarkably quiescent in the face of Trump’s wayward trade policy, and appear to be relatively unconcerned about Musk’s slash-and-burn mission, for now.They have been putting their faith in the mighty US consumer, and the economy’s powerful and innovative tech sector, to feed the narrative of US “exceptionalism”.But every week of the Trump/Musk show in Washington surely increases the threat of a structural shift in how investors view theUS economy– which would ultimately be felt around the world.Explore more on these topicsGlobal economyEconomics viewpointUS economyTrump administrationElon MuskBondsEconomicsUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

But remarks from JD Vance and Elon Musk echo authoritarians worldwideSun 16 Feb 2025 07.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 16 Feb 2025 20.32 ESTShareWill theTrump administrationdefy the courts?JD Vance’s tweet last weekend that “judges aren’t allowed to control the executive’s legitimate power” has sparked widespread concern that the Trump administration might become the first in US history to do so. At least at this stage, it is not clear that it will come to that, notwithstanding the president’s proclivity for asserting limitless executive power. But as other countries’ experiences show, if he were to adopt the position of the US vice-president, Trump would be crossing perhaps the most fundamental line demarcating constitutional democracy from autocracy.Consider just a few examples. In Venezuela, Hugo Chávez spent years undermining the country’s supreme court, declaring that itlacked “legitimate and moral authority”. The former president laterrefused to comply with a 2003 orderto demilitarize the Caracas police force, instead tightening military control over law enforcement to entrench his power. In Hungary, afterfailing to enforce rulings of the constitutional court, Viktor Orbán’s governmentopenly defiedthe European Union’s highest court’s ruling finding Hungary’s restrictive asylum scheme in violation of EU law. Likewise, in Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan systematically ignored domestic and European court of human rights rulings that ordered the government torelease journalistsand otherpolitical activistscritical of his government.Nothing is more challenging to an authoritarian than an independent judiciary ready to hold the leader accountable. When would-be authoritarians perceive judicial oversight as a threat, they respond by dismissing and defying court rulings or otherwise undermining judicial independence. By the time the authoritarian takeover is complete, the judiciary is rendered toothless. Courts are especially vulnerable to such moves because they do not have their own enforcement arms.To be sure, we are not there yet. But Vance seems to see these examples not as object lessons in what not to do, but as models for the US president to follow. In 2021, Vance said his “one piece of advice” to Trump for a second term would be to “fire every single mid-level bureaucrat, every civil servant in the administrative state, replace them with our people … And when the courts – because you will get taken to court – and when the courts stop you, stand before the country like Andrew Jackson did and say: ‘The chief justice has made his ruling. Now let him enforce it.’” (It is disputed whether Jackson even said this, but in any event he never defied the court.)In Trump’s last term, he had a worse won-lost record in the supreme court than any president since Franklin Delano Roosevelt – yet he abided by all court orders. And in the wake of concern about Vance’ s comments, Trump said he always obeys courts, but will pursue appeals. Thus far, that seems to be the case. But no responsible government official – much less the No 2 official in the executive branch – should even suggest that defying the courts is appropriate.View image in fullscreen‘In Venezuela, Hugo Chávez spent years undermining the country’s supreme court.’Photograph: Carlos García Rawlins/ReutersTrump’s right-hand man, Elon Musk, is also fanning the flames. On 8 February, hours after a federal judge in New York temporarily blocked Musk’s team from accessing sensitive personal information held by the Department of the Treasury on millions of Americans, Muskshareda tweet from another user saying: “I don’t like the precedent it sets when you defy a judicial ruling, but I’m just wondering what other options are these judges leaving us.” The next day, Muskposted: “A corrupt judge protecting corruption. He needs to be impeached NOW!”On 12 February, Musktweeted: “Bravo!” in response to a claim by El Salvador’s autocratic president, Nayib Bukele, that he had impeached judges in 2021 “and then proceeded to fix the country”. Muskadded: “We must impeach judges who are grossly undermining the will of the people and destroying America. It is the only way.” Bukele’s removal of five constitutional court judges in 2021 is widely regarded as a “technical coup” that paved the way for him to seek re-election in violation of constitutional term limits. Musk is no lawyer, but he should know that in the US, impeachment is reserved for “high crimes and misdemeanors”, not decisions Musk does not like.Government officials are of course free to criticize court decisions. But Vance’s and Musk’s comments echo those of authoritarian regimes around the world, which often seek to undermine the legitimacy of any institution that might constrain their actions – the courts, the press, the non-profit sector. The criticism is often the first step in a campaign to sweep away all constraints.The federal courts in the US system are given independence and final say on legal disputes so that they can act as a check on the political branches. In 1975, the supreme court explained that “all orders and judgments of courts must be complied with promptly.” Indeed, the chief justice, John Roberts, in his annual end-of-year report on the federal judiciary in 2024, identified “threats to defy lawfully entered judgments” as one of the core issues that “threaten the independence of judges on which the rule of law depends”.The moment of truth may come soon. More than60 lawsuitshave been filed challenging Trump’s initial measures – from seeking to revoke birthright citizenship to freezing federal funding. Nearly every court to rule thus far has ruled against the administration.Were the Trump administration to follow Vance’s and Musk’s advice and defy the supreme court, the fallout would be swift, widespread – and justified. The supreme court has limited formal resources to compel the president to follow its dictates, because the president, not the courts, oversees federal law enforcement. Despite that formal reality, defiance would be an impeachable offense – and if the Republican party stood behind the president at that point, it would pay greatly at the polls. That’s because few principles are as fundamental to the American system as the notion that the supreme court has final say on constitutional and statutory issues and its orders must be obeyed. Trump would cross that line at his own, his party’s, and the country’s peril.Amrit Singh is a law professor and executive director of the Rule of Law Impact Lab at Stanford Law School.

When he returned to office, the House of Representatives was already under his heel. Many of the House Republican leaders had been his sidekicks during January 6, and one, Mike Johnson, had since become the speaker. The Senate, however, still retained, for the most part, its club-like atmosphere where the members considered themselves powers unto themselves. Senators with a toga complex have always looked down on House members as rabble. Trump viewed the independent character of the upper body as a thorn in his side. The subservience of the House of Representatives was the model that Trump envisioned for the Senate. It could no longer pretend to be the greatest deliberative body of legislators in the world, but a vassal fiefdom subject to his whims.Trump’s opportunity to crush the Senate appeared at once. As soon as he made his nominations for his cabinet, the Senate would hold confirmation hearings. His misfit nominees gave him his chance. In any previous time, just a tincture of the alcoholism, serial sexual abuse, playing footsie with a Russian-backed despot, hawking of snake oil, doodling enemies lists and bilking non-profit organizations, quite apart from plain incompetence, would have been enough to knock them out before they ever approached a seat in a hearing room.The senator John Tower, of Texas, very much a member of the club of his day, but a drunken sexual harasser of the old school, groping in elevators, was exposed when George HW Bush nominated him as secretary of defense, and dropped out. But shame in the Trump orbit is as antiquated a notion as virtue.The patent unfitness of Trump’s nominees put the senators on the spot. It was the senators, not the obviously disqualified nominees, who had to pass the test. They were not the ones sitting in judgment; they were in Trump’s dock. If Trump could break the lords of the Senate over his cabinet of curiosities, he could reduce them to being his serfs. By transforming their duty to advise and consent into shut up and obey, Trump would trample more than unstated norms. He would be obliterating a constitutional responsibility of the Senate and removing a further check and balance on his power.Subverting the institution was not an abstract exercise. If individual senators looked like they might stand in the way, it was not enough that they be defeated on a roll-call vote. They had to be personally violated. The part of themselves that they held to be at their core both as public officials and private persons had to be soiled. They had to be made examples before the others. Their humiliation had to be performed as a public demonstration. By voting in favor of nominees they knew in their bones should never be approved, whose disqualifications crossed the senators’ deepest principles, their intimidation made them Trump’s subjects. Once the method of defilement was established, it would be applied again and again. It would loom as an ever-present threat over any others’ wavering. Trump’s degradation would be sufficient to cow the rest. But he would not stop. After the first victim, then there was the next, and the next, one after another, until Trump was the master of the Senate. Trump began with one senator whose vulnerability he could twist to make her writhe.That senator was Joni Ernst, of Iowa.View image in fullscreenJoni Ernst during a confirmation hearing in Washington DC on 23 January 2025.Photograph: Laura Brett/Zuma Press Wire/Rex/ShutterstockAfter attending Iowa State University, where she joined ROTC, Ernst enlisted in the army, served during the Iraq war in Kuwait in charge of a transport unit, and attained the rank of lieutenant colonel. Running for theUS Senatein 2014, she said she had been sexually harassed in the military and pledged that, if elected, she would make independent investigation and prosecution of sexual crimes her signature issue.Once she entered the Senate, Ernst was for the most part a down-the-line conservative Republican, yet was also among the fewRepublicanswho consistently sponsored and voted for bills to protect victims of domestic violence and sexual assault, especially focusing on women in the military.When Ernst divorced in 2019, her painful story of emotional and physical abuse became public – her husband’s dalliance with a babysitter, his long-term affair with a mistress and, after she confronted him, how he suddenly “grabbed me by the throat with his hands and threw me on the landing floor. And then he pounded my head.” Her husband responded by accusing her of having an affair herself, which she said was a “lie”. She also revealed at that time that she had been raped as a college student, reported it to the counseling service, but chose not to go to the police, and had kept it a secret. “I couldn’t stomach the idea that my rape would become public knowledge,” shewrotein a memoir published in 2020. “I was sure my boyfriend would find a way to blame me.”Ernst’s divorce complaint disclosed for the first time that she had turned down candidate Donald Trump’s offer to be his vice-presidential running mate in the 2016 campaign. She attributed her refusal as vaguely not being “the right thing for me or my family”. It is uncertain whether Trump ever made the actual offer. He took Mike Pence, who was pressed on him by his campaign manager Paul Manafort to represent the evangelical right.When Trump nominated Pete Hegseth to be secretary of defense, stories instantly surfaced that the Fox News weekend host had been accused of rape, paid hush money, had a history of sexual abuse in two of his marriages, impregnated a girlfriend and was a raging alcoholic who drank on the job. He also opposed women serving in combat roles in the military, as Ernst had.“I am a survivor of sexual assault,” Ernst said in her initial response to Hegseth’s nomination. She insisted that she wanted “to make sure that any allegations have been cleared, and that’s why we have to have a very thorough vetting process”.But the “vetting process” was warped. Witnesses were hesitant to come forward, afraid they would be subject to the reign of terror that Christine Blasey Ford endured when she publicly testified in Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing to be on the supreme court he had sexually assaulted her. But the woman who claimed that Hegseth had raped her was willing to speak privately with Ernst. So were two other witnesses, both female soldiers who would also talk to her in private about his drunkenness and sexual harassment.Ernst was then subjected to waves of “Maga” attacks. Facing re-election in 2026, she was threatened with a primary challenge from a local rightwing talkshow host, Steve Dease, who posted: “Joni Ernst sucked as a Senator long before this … I am willing to primary her for the good of the cause.” Elon Musk forked over a half-million dollars to blast ads that wallpapered Iowa TV, hailing Hegseth as a “patriot” and “warrior”, and warning that the “deep state” (ie Ernst) opposed him. Donald Trump Jr unleashed a storm on social media against Ernst, saying that if any senator criticized Hegseth, “maybe you’re in the wrong political party!” An online squadron of winged monkeys swarmed her. The phrase “She’s a Democrat” trended.Ernst succumbed to the smear campaign. She refused to meet with the alleged rape victim, according to areportby Jane Mayer in the New Yorker. She also would not see the other women with first-hand accounts. Ernst hid. The witnesses, however, told their stories to Senator Tammy Duckworth, a Democrat of Illinois and a combat veteran who lost both of her legs. From her isolation, Ernst finally released an announcement that she would support Hegseth. Duckworth said that Ernst and other Republican senators had refused to put “the national security of America over their own political survival”.Then came the turn of Thom Tillis, the senator of North Carolina. He, too, was wary of Hegseth. He heard first-hand from a witness about his drunken behavior. TillistoldHegseth’s former sister-in-law that if she provided an affidavit about Hegseth’s abuse, he would vote against him. So, she came forward despite the slings and arrows of the Trump mob. The evening before the vote, Tillis quietly told the Republican leader John Thune he would oppose Hegseth. Tillisspokewith both JD Vance and Trump. Unlike Ernst, none of his drama was conducted in public. When the time came to vote, Tillis, who faces a tough re-election in 2026, voted “yes”. Tillis turned on a dime.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

Cassidy is a physician who has devoted much of his career to public health and educating people about the importance of vaccinations. He was the decisive vote on the Senate finance committee on the nomination of Robert F Kennedy Jr to become secretary of health and human services, the leading vaccine skeptic who has made millions off his crank conspiracy theories and whose cousin, Caroline Kennedy, called him “a predator”.Cassidy attempted to coax Kennedy into committing to the scientific truth that vaccines work.“I’m a doc, trying to understand,” Cassidy said. “Convince me that you will become the public health advocate, but not just churn the old information so that there’s never a conclusion.” No matter how many times he tried, Kennedy would not give him a straight answer.Cassidy was already vulnerable. He had voted to impeach Trump after the January 6 insurrection. A far-right primary opponent, the representative Clay Higgins, was preparing to run against him. After Cassidy’s questioning of Kennedy, the winged monkeys descended on him. And Higgins posted on X: “So, vote your conscience Senator, or don’t. Either way, We’re watching.” Cassidy replied with a biblical quotation: “Joshua said to them: ‘Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged. Be strong and courageous. This is what the LORD will do to all the enemies you are going to fight.” But when the vote came, Cassidy crumpled.They came for Todd Young, the senator of Indiana. He is something of Hoosier Republican royalty, married to the niece of former vice-president Dan Quayle. Young was poised as the decisive vote on the Senate intelligence committee on the nomination of Tulsi Gabbard to be the director of national intelligence. In addition to “parroting false Russian propaganda”, as the former senator Mitt Romney put it, and visiting Syrian dictator Bashar al Assad, whom she declared was not a “torturer” and “murderer”, she had urged a pardon for “brave” Edward Snowden, who stole massive amounts of data from the National Security Agency and absconded to Russia. When Young asked her whether Snowden had “betrayed the American people”, she acknowledged he had broken the law, but would not go beyond that formulation. Young appeared edgy about her nomination.“Todd Young is a deep state puppet,” posted Elon Musk. His ears had pricked up when he had learned that Young was on the board of directors of the National Endowment for Democracy, created by Ronald Reagan and funded through USAid to promote the rule of law and democracy around the world. Musk tweeted that the NED was “an evil organization [that] needs to be dissolved”. The Trump X mob swarmed. Besieged, Young spoke with JD Vance. The US vice-president arranged a call with Musk. Young announced he would back Gabbard. The noise disappeared.The novel Advise and Consent, by a Washington reporter, Allen Drury, published in 1959 and produced as a movie in 1962, described a cold war melodrama in the Senate over the confirmation of a nominee to become secretary of state who had a left-wing background in his youth. One senator, with a secret gay past, caught up in the fight, fearing exposure, commits suicide. (The scene depicting a gay bar was a movie first.) But the suicide was not over any great principle. The victim was collateral damage. And the president in Advise and Consent was not attempting to use the process to coerce the Senate into vassalage.Hegseth, Kennedy and Gabbard are now all confirmed. The advise and consent responsibility of the Senate was twisted. The senators came to kneel before Trump – and Musk. Musk praised Young, the former “puppet”, as “a great ally”. Cassidy posted: “After collaborative conversations with RFK and the White House, I voted yes to confirm him.” Tillis gave a floor speech extolling Musk and Doge: “Innovation requires pushing the envelope and taking calculated risks.” Ernst wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal entitled USAid Is a Rogue Agency.Meanwhile, the $2bn in USAid purchases of agricultural products for humanitarian aid were suspended. The Iowa Soybean Association, dependent on a $95m grant supporting more than 1,000 farms that was now not being paid, protested. Ernst, a member of the Senate agriculture committee, was silent.“I was embarrassed,” Ernst told the Des Moines Register about speaking about being raped. “I didn’t know how to explain it. I was so humiliated. And I’m a private person, when it comes to those things.” After that incident, she found herself in an abusive relationship and the victim of domestic violence. As a senator, she used her position to break with her past of victimhood and established herself as a champion of those who had been victimized as she had been. But then she found herself in another abusive relationship, with Donald Trump. She was threatened with being completely stripped of everything she had striven for and her status as a senator destroyed. She had a choice to stand up against her transgressor or to subject herself to him. She decided to submit to the humiliation. And afterward she became the enabler of the abuser.Sidney Blumenthal, former senior adviser to President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, has published three books of a projected five-volume political life of Abraham Lincoln:A Self-Made Man,Wrestling With His AngelandAll the Powers of EarthExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionRepublicansUS politicsUS SenatecommentShareReuse this content"

Until it’s clear they can’t work. At which point, the monkey must toss again.But this month, Trump, whose morning ablutions increasingly appear to consist of dousing himself in sachets of the kind of cheap hot chocolate powder I steal from three-star hotels, like a flightless bird stuck in the machine that glazes Magnum lollies, declared he wanted tobuild his hotels on the mass graves of Gaza. Hasn’t Trump seenThe Shining? It won’t end well. Pity those whose children have the misfortune to die next to a monetisable stretch of shoreline. And hope humanity’s next wave of mass killings happens somewhere uneven and way inland that hopefully wouldn’t even make a decent golf course.IsUkrainethe frontier upon which the future of European democracy hinges, or is it just a massive stretch of undeveloped fairway, its leisure/conference utility value currently compromised only by the desire of some losers to continue living in the country they consider home? Where we see the falling domino chain that starts with Poland and ends in your back garden, does Trump see only a succession of 18-hole courses full of men in caps and enormous flapping flares brokering manly deals at the tee? Drive your golf carts over the bones of the dead!But maybe Trump’s horrible mouth-cack is just continuing evidence of his former acolyte Steve Bannon’s advice to “flood the zone with shit”? Does Trump really hate all sea creatures so much that he has toreinstate the plastic strawsJoe Biden successfully, and commendably, outlawed? Perhaps he was once told to keep his hands to himself by a mermaid. “These things don’t work,” Trump said of paper straws. “I’ve had them many times, and on occasion, they break,they explode.” Must millions of seabirds, turtles, manatees and dolphins die because Trump imagines that paper straws explode? Or so he can suck up his Diet Coke fast enough to amuse Elon Musk, Pete Hegseth and JD Vance by burping a smelly chorus of YMCA in Biden’s face next time there’s a gathering of ex-presidents.Like some kind of infantilised diaper king, Trump has genuinely had a special Diet Coke-summoning button installed in the Oval OfficeBecause Trump, a fully grown man with unlimited funds, loves Diet Coke, and it’s tempting to wonder how many of his seemingly incomprehensible policy decisions can be traced back to his desire to be continually saturated by the soft drink. Maybe there is a subterranean lake of the stuff somewhere deep beneath the Greenland tundra that the climate crisis, which doesn’t exist, will soon make accessible to Trump’s deep Diet Coke drills? Delighted Inuit strip off their sealskins and dance in the showering liquid as they realise they have just struck a rich seam of their new master’s black gold. Like some kind of infantilised diaper king, Trump has genuinely had a special Diet Coke-summoning button installed in the Oval Office. Hopefully, he won’t get it mixed up with that other button. It will be a shame if all life on Earth is fatally irradiated just because Trump wanted a 500ml bucket of fizz to swill down his Big Mac and fries.But are we meant to take Trump’s erratic announcements seriously? While the last concerned voices of the dying liberal press pen outraged articles to their dying liberal readers aboutGazahotels, the invasion of Canada and Trump making it compulsory to drink everything through a Trump Plastic Freedom Straw Company Deluxe Plastic Freedom Straw ™ ®, even cauliflower cheese soup, his homunculus Musk has been quietly dismantling the infrastructure of American government as you knew it. There are cup-and-ball tricksters on Parisian street corners with more subtle moves.Half a dozen of Musk’s own hand-harvested incels-in-waiting, the kind of people who under normal circumstances would have got rich by inventing a way in which hardcore digital pornography could have been mainlined directly into the bloodstream in liquid form, have, under the spurious authority of Musk’s imaginary “department of government efficiency”, gone in andstolen all the dataabout everyone and everything in the US ever. Never mind. I am sure they will use it responsibly. What can possibly go wrong?Some people gathered at the scenes of Musk’s cost-cutting exercises andwaved placards. Others sat and gawked at news footage ofKanye West’s naked wife’s arseor enjoyed disappointing trailers for thenew Captain America movie, while the world as they knew it crumbled beneath their king-sized sofas. Keir Starmer backed away, as one might from a neighbour’s unpredictable weapon dog, avoiding direct comment,dodging a commitment to the AI declarationlike a coward and hoping for the best, while Trumpy growls and foams. Which simply won’t do.Look. I’m as disappointed as the next metropolitan liberal elitist champagne socialist by Starmer’s government. While I accept, for example, the migration crisis must be addressed, I didn’t expect Starmer, who once left his “village and went to the city of Leeds” and “discovered a whole new world of indie bands – like Orange Juice and the Wedding Present”, to do it with Nigel Farage-style performative cruelty. Address the migration crisis, by all means, but don’t be a c*** about it. Did Orange Juice suffer the indignity of their eponymous third album not even entering the top 50 in 1984 just so, 41 years later, Starmer could sendYvette Cooperout to downgrade the desperate, like Paul Golding in heels.Currently, asPutin puffs upunder Trump’s protection and unregulated AI threatens to rewrite history in real time, Starmer is on his knees sucking the paper straw of Trump’s presidency. I fear it may be about to explode in his mouth.Stewart Lee toursStewart Lee vs the Man-Wulfthis year, with a Royal Festival Hall run in JulyDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Many Australians are watching in horror as tech billionaires wieldunbridled powerin the US. Understanding how tech – both the tools and the industry – is changing, and working to fight the worst of it has become a key responsibility of any government worth its salt.This is what makes Australia’s track record on tech so disappointing. Looking back over the past three years of tech policy under the current Albanese government, it’s hard not to cringe. It’s been a period of huge technological upheaval; what do we have to show for it?A misinformation messOnline misinformation is often cited as a grave concern for democracy, national security, online safety and, well, the very notion of truth itself – coming from all sides of politics. Misinformation wasrampantin the lead-up to the voice referendum, with some believing itplayed a key rolein its defeat. Given this, it was baffling to watch the government’s attempt to combat it.An exposure draft bill was met withsignificant pushbackin 2023. This includedvalid criticisms(like overly broad definitions and letting mainstream media off the hook), as well as a flurry of outrage that was – ironically –fuelled by misleading commentsthat framed the bill as censorship. The government then revised the draft, only todump it entirely later.The government still doesn’t care about your privacyPrivacy law reform may not sound like the sexiest tech policy issue but it’s one of the key ways that we can rein in corporate power, reduce things like harmful online profiling and advertising, and build a safer and more fair digital future for everyone.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailWith that in mind, the government has fumbled the ball on privacy reform. Australia’s Privacy Act pre-dates the web and falls embarrassingly behind on the world stage. The 2022 Optus breach was the opportune moment to finally make the long-overdue changes to better protect everyone. Instead, a small bill was passed which focused on increasing fines; giving the privacy commissioner a bigger stick if companies don’t follow the rules but doingnothing to fix the rules themselves. It was functionally flaccid but allowed the government to pat themselves on the back for Doing Something.The government has managed to get through a handful of privacy reforms, with the biggest changes being achildren’s online privacy codeand a statutory tort – most simply this means that people can sue for serious invasion of their privacy. While these are positive steps, the real story is the swathe of other, more significant and impactful proposals that wereleft to languishon the sidelines.A ‘world leading’ teen social media ban that ignores expertsWhile Australia may be lagging behind on privacy, politicians love to claim we’re “world leading” in online safety. We should ask though: where exactly are we leading the world toward? Is it somewhere good?In the case of the government’s flagship tech policy – the teen social media ban – the answer is no. In developing the Social Media Minimum Age Act the government blatantlyignored expertsacross the fields ofdigital wellbeing,digital rights advocacy,youth mental healthandmore than 140 academics and 20 Australian civil society organisations. Even concern from thehuman rights commissionerand doubt from theeSafety commissionercould not slow this train down. Investigative reporting revealed the government was internally aware of alack of evidencein its last-minute lawmaking.In a spectacular display of policymaking theatre, the public was givena single dayto provide feedback – a pointless exercise given it was impossible for the committee to even read the15,000 submissionsbefore tabling a reportfour dayslater. The government only seems to engage in genuine public consultation when there’s no real motivation to follow through. When evidence-based, long-term tech policy proposals contradict their agenda, they literally have no time for it.Other (dis)honourable mentionsLet’s not forget the cruel decision toconfiscate phones from people in immigration detention, cutting people off from loved ones and stymying government accountability for detention centre practices; pretty lacklustre moves onregulating AI; kneejerkcriminalisation of doxing, which sounds good on the surface but rushed past concerns; and dragging their feet on overdueimprovements to Australia’s online safety regime.Taken together, despite a handful of small positives scattered over the years, it has overall been a pitiful term for tech policy. But it’s worth remembering that the Coalition’s latest stint was no better:alarming increased surveillance powersin the Identify and Disrupt Act,notoriousanti-encryption legislation, an invasivemetadata retention scheme, and the absurd and ultimately failedanti-trolling bill.We are in desperate need of leaders who take technology seriously, who engage meaningfully with research, and who recognise the importance of a tech future centred on people, not profit. Australians deserve better than lacklustre on the one hand, or actively dangerous on the other.Samantha Floreani is a digital rights activist and writer based in Melbourne/NaarmExplore more on these topicsTechnologyOpinionSocial mediaAnthony AlbaneseAustralian politicsLabor partyAustralian election 2025commentShareReuse this content"

That’s why our jails are overflowingSamira ShackleFor 20 years, the UK has been inflating sentences despite little evidence it deters crime. But a new review offers a glimmer of hopeSun 16 Feb 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 16 Feb 2025 12.59 ESTShareWe’ve heard a lot about prisons in recent months; specifically, the factthat they were fullwhen the new government took office last summer. Labour introduced emergency measures torelease thousands of prisonersearly, which eased the immediate pressure. The government has committed tobuilding four new prisonsas well as adding blocks to existing prisons,creating14,000 new prison spaces over the next seven years. But when the prison system gets bigger, so do the problems within it. And none of this answers the more complicated question of what happens next.So far, we have seen sticking-plaster solutions to a systemic crisis that has been created, in no small part, by the desire of successive governments to appear tough on crime. Any serious attempt to turn things around requires consideration of how we got here. The UK’s prison populationis at record levels; it hasalmost doubledin the past 30 years. England and Wales have thehighest per capita prison populationin western Europe, and in the wider continent, only Russia and Turkeyjailmore people. Amid endemic overcrowding and understaffing, conditions are often poor, with inmates routinely confined to their cells – usually shared – for23 hours a day. The suicide rate in our jails istwicethe European average. Waiting lists for rehabilitative work – behaviour courses, education, training – are so long that some inmates mightnever accessthem at all. Most people would probably agree that none of this is desirable; it certainly doesn’t do much to lower the crime rate.So how has this situation come about? The crucialissue is sentence inflation. In short, over the past 20 years, more people have been handed prison sentences, and they have got longer and longer over time, despite no corresponding increase in crime. In 2023, the average custodial sentence given at crown court was25% longerthan in 2012. This isn’t solely a case of more serious offences being tried – it’s also true that longer sentences are being handed out for the same crime. Sentences for robbery, for example, were13 months longeron average in 2023 than in 2012, anincrease of 36%.In the Netherlands, we’re closing our emptying prisons. What can other countries learn from how we did it? | Renate van der ZeeRead moreThese longer sentences kept the prison population flat over the 2010s, despite falling numbers of people being tried and convicted for crimes overall. In September 2024, the Howard League (which advocates for penal reform)published a paperby five senior former judges, calling for an “an honest conversation about what custodial sentences can and cannot achieve” and a return to “more modest proportionate sentences across the board”. The judges wrote that in the 50 years they’d been involved with the law, sentence lengths had doubled and so had the prison population, and called for a reversal of this trend.There was no single moment where sentences became longer; it has been a slow creep, the result of decades of small changes to the law. But one crucial turning point was the Blair government’s 2003 Criminal Justice Act, which introducedstatutory starting pointsfor minimum terms for murder. The change was implemented only in England and Wales, where sentences for serious offences haverisenmuch faster than in Scotland, demonstrating how one seemingly small legislative change can have a cascade of consequences. When sentences are made longer, or minimum terms are introduced for one crime, it can lead to calls for similar conditions on other crimes. More recently, thePolice, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022increased the maximum sentence for death by dangerous driving from14 years to life imprisonment, while other legislation has increased minimum sentences for crimes such asfirearms offencesanddomestic burglary. Emotive campaigns by victims or pressure groups to create new offences or lengthen sentences to address specific issues or problems can have a similar effect.Imposing longer sentences for specific crimes can feel intuitively like a satisfying and fair solution to specific instances of injustice. But a prison system already swollen by years of successive sentencing increases was not in a position to accommodate new, successive crises. Over the past decade and a half, austerity has meant drastic cuts to the probation service and court systems. Since 2017, the number of people beingrecalledto prison after being released on probation hasgone up 85%. Massive crown court backlogs have led to more people beingheld on remandawaiting trial – an84% increasesince 2019 (with two-thirds of those people yet to be convicted of a crime).For too long, the emphasis, by successive governments, has been on sending people to prison without much thought for what happens while they are there. Equally little consideration is given to what is actually effective. In 2022, theSentencing Council concludedthat there was no strong evidence that severe sentences deter people from committing crime.Could this approach change? There are some glimmers of hope. Alongside the push to expand prison places, the government isconductingan independent review of sentencing policy, due to report in the spring. It’s expected to recommend that more people are given community orders or suspended sentences – meaning that they are served outside prison. This is a way to ease pressure on prison spaces, but it might also prove effective; at present, offenders given noncustodial sentences have lower levels of recidivism, perhaps because it is easier to access support and rehabilitation outside prison than inside.If we actually want to reduce crime, we might shift from looking at the length of sentences to what people are doing while serving them – and instead of judging criminal justice policies on whether they sound “tough” or “soft” on crime, considering whether they work.Samira Shackle is a freelance journalist and the author of Karachi ViceExplore more on these topicsPrisons and probationOpinionUK criminal justicecommentShareReuse this content"

He was the kind of man who prided himself on his ability to keep it together, no matter the situation. A busy father of two, working long hours in a demanding corporate role, he believed stress was simply part of the job – a badge of honour in today’s relentless grind.But then, out of nowhere, the panic attacks began.The first time it happened, James was in the middle of a meeting. His heart started racing, his palms were drenched in sweat and he felt a sudden tightness in his chest. He excused himself, thinking perhaps he was coming down with a virus, or worse, having a heart attack. But the symptoms didn’t go away. If anything, they worsened.“It felt like I was dying,” James admitted in our first session. “I couldn’t breathe, my chest was tight, I was dizzy and I was convinced something was seriously wrong. I wasn’t in bad shape but I wasn’t sleeping well and felt like I was burning the candle at both ends between work and family commitments.”Sandra was estranged from her mother after experiencing childhood trauma. The grief when she died was complicated | Ahona GuhaRead moreAfter multiple visits to his GP and even a trip to the emergency room, all of which ruled out any physical issues, James was told by a doctor that it may have been a panic attack. James became aware, after some discussion with his GP, that panic attacks are quite common. In fact, 40% of Australians can experience a panic attack once or twice in their lives, and 5% may experience the more debilitating panic disorder. The difference is that a panic attack will happen irregularly and usually only once or twice a year, whereas those diagnosed with a panic disorder will experience repeated and regular panic attacks.At first, James was confused. Stress was normal, wasn’t it? Everyone dealt with it. Why did he feel his body was suddenly giving up? A few weeks went by until he finally decided to book in for a therapy session. It wasn’t until then that he began to understand the deeper layers of his panic disorder. He realised that his panic attacks came on quickly and felt as though they lasted for an eternity, leaving him with a sense of dread. They would often last for up to 30 minutes, with the first 10 minutes being the most extreme.The pressure cooker: work and familyFor years James had been juggling an unmanageable workload alongside the pressures of fatherhood, with a six-year-old and four-year-old. His banking job demanded long hours, constant travel and unrealistic deadlines. At home he often felt as though he was failing. “I wanted to be present for my kids but I was always too tired or distracted,” he said. “I felt like I wasn’t enough.”James’s wife had tried to talk to him about the toll it was taking but he brushed her off. “I’d say, ‘I’m fine. It’s just a busy season.’ But the truth was I didn’t want to admit that I was drowning.”Unpacking the pastIn therapy, we began to explore not just his stressors but also his childhood. He grew up in a household where emotions were rarely discussed. His father, a strict disciplinarian, dismissed vulnerability as weakness. “Crying wasn’t an option,” James recalls. “You just had to get on with it and, from an early age, my father drilled into me the importance of success and hard work. If I didn’t win a footy match as a boy, he wouldn’t talk to me for the rest of the day, then he would say that I needed to train harder.”This stoic mindset carried into adulthood, where James learned to bury his emotions rather than confront them. But the unresolved tension didn’t disappear. Instead, it simmered beneath the surface, waiting for the right conditions to boil over.From carer to carefree? How to move on from years of devotion after a loved one dies | Gaynor ParkinRead moreIn one session we looked at how early trauma could shape his brain’s response to stress. The constant pressure at work and home had triggered his fight-or-flight system, leading to panic attacks.Moving forwardRecovery for James has been slow and non-linear. He now prioritises self-care – something he used to scoff at. Regular exercise, mindfulness and setting boundaries at work have become non-negotiable. He’s also learning to be more open with his family and prioritise quality time with his two children.While initially James was resistant to the thought of therapy, with support from his family and close friends, the process has helped him unpack his life history, his unexpressed emotions and to speak openly with those he trusted about his life and his concerns. The rumination and overthinking, which would often lead to him feeling overwhelmed and result in a panic attack, has now subsided.“The first time I told my wife how overwhelmed I was, I felt so relieved,” he said. “I didn’t realise how much I’d been holding in and I realised it actually made my life and relationships more authentic and real. It has been a learning curve but now I feel more comfortable about sharing how I feel about myself, my life and my relationships.”James’ story is a reminder that stress isn’t something to dismiss or power through. It can be the body’s way of asking us to stop and listen. And while addressing it can be uncomfortable, it’s also the first step toward healing. “I used to think asking for help was a sign of failure,” James said. “Now I see it as strength. You don’t have to carry it all alone.”*All clients discussed are fictional amalgamsDiane Young is a trauma specialist and psychotherapist atSouth Pacific Private, a trauma, addiction and mental health treatment centreIn Australia, support is available atBeyond Blueon 1300 22 4636,Lifelineon 13 11 14, and atMensLineon 1300 789 978.

It centres on theNHS, our strained systems of social care and an ever-more toxic and hateful conversation about immigration. Without hundreds of thousands of people who have come to the UK from abroad, the most basic aspects of how we look after old, infirm and ill people would simply collapse. Politics, however, increasingly seems to demand that this truth has to be denied – and the result is a level of hypocrisy that is remarkable even by modern standards.Three weeks before last Christmas, my dad – who turns 89 next month – fell down a flight of stairs, and broke his hip. After a terrifyingly long wait for an ambulance, he was admitted to hospital in Macclesfield, Cheshire, and operated on. In the midst of yet another awful NHS winter, the treatment he received felt faintly miraculous. And there was another aspect of his stay that seemed no less remarkable. Macclesfield is hardly the most diverse place in the world, but most of the doctors and nurses who so carefully looked after him were first-generation immigrants, mostly either from African countries, or India: people regularly overburdened and rushed off their feet, but who answered my endless questions and queries with an amazing grace and patience.My dad was on the orthopaedic trauma ward for six long weeks. And from my first visit onwards, my mind began boggling at the scenes quietly playing out around us, which are surely similar all over the country. When I glanced at my phone, or heard a news bulletin blaring from another patient’s iPad, the headlines were often about the current political obsession with immigration and integration. Each morning, a trolley laden with newspapers would appear, and the most popular choices were the Mail and Express, whose pages were – as ever – regularlyfull of warningsabout influxes of foreigners, and a country supposedly falling apart. In the most visceral way imaginable, what was happening in front of our eyes disproved just about all of it, but the contradiction simply sat there: one more howling British inconsistency, in a country brimming with them.Midway through January, I began to get acquainted with another place: a care home in the outer Mancunian suburbs, to which my dad was transferred for physiotherapy and rehab. I have been there a lot lately. Just about all the clients and patients are of the ethnicity we classify as white British – while, once again, most of the staff are from abroad. My dad’s most regular care worker came to the UK from the Indian state of Kerala. The people in charge are mostly from the Philippines. They carry out duties that would leave most of us wondering where to start: lifting people out of bed and easing them into long and painful days; providing constant friendship and comfort; answering endless cries for help.Why does Labour think bashing migrants is the way to defeat Reform? Look abroad: the tactic never works | Owen JonesRead moreTwenty-eight per cent of NHS nursesarenon-UK nationals; among doctors, the figure is 35%. In London, the relevant share of health-service personnel is 30%. The figure among English social care workers is reckoned to beas high as 32%. But as of March last year, migrants in that line of work have been subject to acruel new rule, whereby they cannot bring any dependents to live with them: the result has beena sharp declinein both the number of approved health and care worker visas, and applications for them. You can join the dots from that development to another story. Aroundone in sevenNHS beds is said to be occupied by someone well enough to be discharged, but waiting for social care. In the latter sector, the most recent estimates suggest that there are130,000 job vacancies. The chief executive of Care England, Martin Green,says the dependents banis “shortsighted and profoundly damaging”. This is the proof.But the grim Westminster mood music continues; in fact, it is rapidly turning completely poisonous, across the political board. Last year, Kemi Badenoch was asked about her stance on immigration, and her answer reduced care work toa crass cartoon: “We need to make sure we are thinking about the next generation, not just who’s going to wipe bottoms for us today.” She now wants to force people from abroad towait 15 yearsbefore they can apply for British citizenship, while also denying permanent residency to anyone who has claimed benefits or social housing. Clearly, this is what happens when conservatism is dragged constantly rightwards by Reform UK, a party that wants “net zero” immigration, and whose leader wasrecently heard telling farmersprotesting about changes to inheritance tax that the government wants to acquire “lots of land because they’re planning for another 5 million people to come into the country”.The Labour party is obviously feeling the same pull. The last couple of weeks have illustrated what Keir Starmer and his colleagues think is going to get them out of their current hole: pursuing his promise to “reduce immigration–legal and illegal”, charging the Tories with running what he rather mendaciously calls an “open borders” experiment, and making sure eyes are averted from the practical consequences of a tacit return to the so-called hostile environment. With the prospect oftightened public spending, the possibility of a more constructive agenda – reducing the political salience of immigration by building social housing, ending local austerity, or finally reforming and boosting a threadbare care sector so more British-born people take jobs in it – feels like it is falling away. Instead, the UK may be about to learn the same lesson awaiting large swathes of Europe, and the US: that particularly in ageing societies, effectively hanging up a sign that reads “migrants not wanted” is never the cleverest move.When human beings are dependent on others for the most essential needs, the most moral response ought to be gratitude. But dependency also tends to trigger resentment and anger, which I think is part of the contemporary British condition. It is not that long since millions of us stood outside our houses and gave “key workers”a vast round of applause; now, our politicians seem set on telling a lot of them that they are either not wanted, or only allowed to be here on the basis of miserable and inhuman restrictions. Westminster, in fact, seems to be fixed on a future that Badenoch, Starmer and Nigel Farage may eventually be old and infirm enough to directly experience. I keep picturing a care home call button being frantically pushed, and no one coming to help.John Harris is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumOpinionNHSCare workersLabourReform UKConservativesHealthcommentShareReuse this content"

Why is it only offering us crumbs from the south?Peter HetheringtonNeglect of schemes like the Tyne Bridge restoration contrasts sharply with bullishness over southern projectsSun 16 Feb 2025 07.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 16 Feb 2025 12.59 ESTShareIt’s a tale of two river crossings, and of two nations: a defining national landmark across the Tyne in need of an extra £6m from the government, and an ambitious plan being pushed by the chancellor for a Lower Thames Crossing at an estimated cost of at least £6bn. Together, they speak volumes about two-speedEnglandand government priorities.Somewhat forlorn, partly covered in scaffolding, the majestic, rusting Tyne Bridge linking Newcastle upon Tyne and Gateshead is undergoing along-delayed, four-year restorationmeant to be completed for its centenary in 2028. The last government initially promised £35m towards the £41m cost – and while the prime minister recently described the structure as an “iconic part of the Newcastle and Gateshead skyline”, he refused to offer any assurance that the remaining £6mwould be forthcomingin a review of infrastructure projects being undertaken by the Department for Transport. Local councils, cash-strapped and facing another round of austerity, are dismayed.But there’s no such reluctance for the proposed Thames crossing, involving a 2.6-mile tunnel – the longest of its kind in Britain – from the chancellor, Rachel Reeves. She says it represents “infrastructure the country desperately needs”. But surely that could also be said of the 13-mile upgrade of the A1 inNorthumberland, north of the Tyne Bridge, from single to dual carriageway. Yet plans, approved by the last government, have been abandoned because its £500m cost apparently offers “poor value for money and limited economic benefits”.Putting aside the obvious question as to whether a safer, free-flowing road, rather than a dangerous mix of dual and single carriageway, might actually encourage investment in a less-favoured region, the political messaging from ministers is dreadful. People feel betrayed,when £68m has already been spent on preparatory workand buying land. Labour stalwarts in “red wall” seats are angry and restless.Once again, a skewed Whitehall “cost-benefit” analysis – crudely calculating that the greater south-east will assuredly grow while much of the north will inevitably lag behind – has played down the potential for regional growth. Decent infrastructure, after all, sends out positive signals to investors while underpinning the foundational, social economy and the services that sustain vibrant communities, particularly in areas that have barely recovered from the recession of the early 1980s, let alone subsequent financial crises and further mass redundancies.For much of my working life, not least as regional affairs editor of the Guardian, I’ve been chronicling the injustices of what was – and remains –one of the most divided nations in the OECD, with only Turkey, Colombia and Hungary languishing below us.Our deep regional inequalities can be traced back to Victorian times, with north-south divisions intensifying in the 1920s-30s, prompting governments to respond with a series of measures from targeted help for “special areas” – notably, the north-east, Scotland and Wales – to directing new industries to regions labelled less-favoured. This brought some stability until the early 1980s, when the gap between the greater south-east and the north widened considerably. It has stubbornly remained so, in spite of valiant efforts byLabourafter 1997.It’s 20 years since I chaired a cross-party commission –Connecting England– which examined in detail the uneven economy of a divided nation and put the case for a national framework to identity “future development needs and priorities”. It immediately caught the attention of the late John Prescott, former deputy prime minister, who created nine regional development agencies in England with substantial budgets to create jobs, renew older industrial areas and clear derelict land.I noted, in the introduction, that without a national framework to guide key projects – road and rail investment, the location of ports and airports, for instance – the country would “drift directionless, reinforcing a belief … that the winner takes all”. And so it is now proving again.Prescott took on board our case for greater emphasis on regional economies away from London, producing a “northern way” growth strategy around a trans-Pennine corridor and a specialist team to take it forward. But in 2010, a Tory-Liberal Democrat government scrapped the regional development agencies, regional planning strategies and all. Eric Pickles, then local government and planning secretary, famously labelled regional direction “Stalinist”.‘Symbol of our pride’: Newcastle city council vows to restore Tyne BridgeRead moreOn taking office seven months ago, the Labour government inherited a country denied a regional policy and the essential institutions capable of addressing the north-south divide. I assumed it had a plan to address England and its profound regional inequalities. Sadly, I was wrong. Ringing in my ears were comments in an interview two years ago with the late Bob Kerslake, former head of the civil service and, before that, chief executive of Sheffield city council, that “comprehensive long-term intervention” was needed to begin turning round the economies of post-industrial areas, away from the big cities: areas – dare I suggest, like the communities in “red wall” constituencies not far from the cancelled A1 dual carriageway in Northumberland.It took Rachel Reeves to confirm recently there was no meaningful strategy, aside from promising to go “further and faster” to drive growth in the greater south-east:backing expansion of Heathrowwith a third runway; reviving plans for a multibillion-pound Oxford-Cambridge hi-tech arc with new communities plus rail link and, of course,supporting that Lower Thames Crossinglinking the M2 in Kent with the M25 in Essex.Not surprisingly, many in the north are now asking if, yet again, a government grasping at old Treasury straws is assuming London and the greater south-east will drive national growth in the faint hope it will filter down to other regions – no matter that there’s precious little evidence trickle-down – or in this case up – from south to north has worked in the past.We are left, then, with the dismissive tones of National Highways, which runs major roads in England, suggesting that the new Thames crossing will unlock growth by doubling road capacity east of London “to better link the north and the Midlands with the ports of the south-east”. Pull the other one.“Regional policy?” mused an old friend, a leading academic who has spent much of his working life studying regional disparities in Europe and beyond. “It’s called London and the greater south-east.” With the odd exception, it’s same as it ever was.Peter Hetherington writes for Society Guardian on communities and regenerationExplore more on these topicsNorth-south divideOpinionNorth of EnglandNewcastleNorthumberlandInfrastructureTransportLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

They are vital scrutinySonia SodhaRather than rush through such a high-stakes law, it’s essential to listen to all sides of the debateSun 16 Feb 2025 03.30 ESTLast modified on Sun 16 Feb 2025 08.34 ESTShareYou can glean a lot from the way someone characterises their opponents in a debate. Do they engage with them constructively, assuming the best about their motives? Or imply they are acting out of bad faith? It’s telling that Kim Leadbeater, the MP who’s brought forward the bill tolegalise assisted dying, seems to have gone for the latter approach.There could not be more at stake: legalising the prescription of lethal drugs to terminally ill people raises the spectre of vulnerable people being wrongfully subjected to anassisted death with state assistance. It is critical that the bill’s proponents engage constructively with the doctors, psychiatrists, social workers, lawyers and domestic abuse experts who have this concern. Yet Leadbeater appears affronted by the opposition to her bill; she hascharacterised it as “noise”, described those who oppose her change in the law asunconstructive, and has complained about their “clear mobilisation”. (Yes, when people are worried that legislation could have tragic consequences, that’s what they do.) The implication seemingly being that, unless you agree with her on the principle, there’s no legitimate role for you in scrutinising her bill.This attitude seems to be driving the way the bill’s proponents are approaching its scrutiny. Leadbeater picked the bill committee and on the opposition side left off seasoned MPs with relevant experience, such as the psychiatrist Ben Spencer, instead selecting a relatively inexperienced group. The committee heard just three days of oral evidence, heavily skewed to those infavour of the bill. It took no evidence from experts in domestic abuse, and had to be shamed into allowing the Royal College of Psychiatrists to give evidence. Almost400 pieces of written evidencehave been published just in the last couple of weeks; when are the MPs on the committee supposed to read and digest them? Meanwhile, the bill’s proponents appear to be cherrypicking evidence from those who agree with them while ignoring the medical experts pointing out therisks of their approach.And now Leadbeater has abruptly proposed a big change to the bill that will almost certainly be rammed through, despite denying it was on the cards until the moment it was announced. Until last week the bill’s safeguards were talked up as the strongest in the world because assisted deaths would be signed off by a high court judge. This was criticised by legal experts both for and against the bill because the process was essentially a tick-box exercise, with the judge having no scope to hear cross-examination onwhether the right decision has been made. For it to function as a safeguard, the judge’s role would have needed significant beefing up.Leadbeater has watered it down by removing the judicial element altogether; instead, panels consisting of a senior lawyer or a judge, a social worker and a psychiatrist will sign off. They can sit in private; they don’t appear to have powers to compel witnesses to give evidenceunder oath; and not only is there no way for relatives to challenge approvals if they feel they have been given on the basis of incomplete evidence, there is also no obligation to let family members know, raising the possibility that someone’s adult child or parent might embark on an assisted death because they don’t want to be a burden, and the first their loved one hears of it is after they’ve killed themselves.Important opposition amendments that would strengthen the bill’s safeguards have already been rejectedHer amendments also remove the role of the chief medical officer in monitoring assisted dying, replacing it with an assisted dying commissioner who has the dual job of appointing the panels and reporting on safety, marking their own homework. Neither panel members nor the commissioner will be acting in a judicial capacity, but this hasn’t stopped proponents dishonestly branding the proposal as “judge plus”.Important opposition amendments that would strengthen the bill’s safeguardshave already been rejected. There are more on the table, including requiring someone requesting assisted dying to have an independent psychiatric assessment, and opponents will try to remove the bill’s extraordinary provision that there should be no civil liability, including for negligence, for doctors prescribing lethal drugs to citizens. But unless something big shifts, the status quo will stand.This approach appears to be underwritten by the prime minister.Keir Starmerhas made no secret of the fact he supports this bill. Two ministers on the committee are voting with the bill’s proponents despite the government’s purported neutrality, rather than abstaining, as they ought. The government has said it will not publish an impact assessment, including cost estimates, until after committee stage, effectively handing its proponents a blank cheque, in sharp contrast to the frugality ministers are expected to exercise in other areas.At the heart of this is a dispute about whether a neat line can be drawn around those making an autonomous, empowered decision to end their own life to relieve their suffering. The bill’s proponents believe against the evidence that this is relatively easy; its opponents believe people who are vulnerable through mental illness, abuse and poverty will inevitably be caught up in it. You can see this in the policing of language; proponents have tried tostop critics using the term “suicide”, with Kit Malthouse MP preposterously trying to redefine it as a “healthy person taking their own life”. Yet the government’s suicide prevention adviser is clear in his view that there is no clear line to be drawnbetween suicide and assisted dying.If this bill passes, some people will be wrongly prescribed lethal drugs by the state. No state system of regulation is infallible: to take just one example, the Human Tissue Authority, with a considerablymore independent assessment processthan that proposed by this bill, has approved victims of organ trafficking for organ donation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the middle of last month, he flew to Kyiv to double-down on the commitment to back Ukraine’s struggle for freedom, a pledge he first made a defining feature of his leadership when Labour was in opposition. Hands were warmly clasped with Volodymyr Zelenskyy, wailing air raid sirens greeted a Russian drone attack, financial promises were made, and signatures were inscribed on a100-year partnershiptreaty. The prime minister solemnly intoned the western mantra about backing the resistance to Russian tyranny “for as long as it takes” for Ukraine to become “free and thriving once again”.All of which now sounds for the birds, thanks to Donald Trump. It was with his trademark contempt for his country’s traditional allies that the US president blindsided them by announcing thathe had initiated peace negotiationswith Vladimir Putin over the heads of Ukraine and the European members of Nato. The UK received no more warning of this bombshell than anyone else. So much for the vaunted “special relationship”. The US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, then unleashed another punch to the solar plexus of European security bypublicly declaringthat Ukraine would have to accept the surrender of large chunks of its territory and should forget about becoming a member of Nato. The future defence of Ukraine, he went on to declare, would be down to Europe, because the US wouldn’t be sending any of its troops to sustain a security guarantee.Humiliated and anguished, European leaders are crying “betrayal”. The UK government is not adding its voice to that charge in public, but it privately agrees. There is astonishment that the US presidentblithely conceded to several Russian demandsbefore negotiations have even begun. “What happened to the Art of the Deal?” asks one flabbergasted minister. There is disgust at theKremlin’s undisguised gleewith what it interprets as a vindication of the barbarity it has inflicted on its neighbour. There is fear of the consequences for the Baltic states and others by rewarding Russian predation. There is horror at Trump’s subsequent suggestion thatPutin be invited to rejoin the G7, as if the bloody slate of war crimes perpetrated by the Russians can simply be wiped clean.A hideous idea doing the rounds is that Trump will make a state visit to Moscow timed to coincide with the May Day parade, which celebrates Russia’s military. What a grotesque spectacle: the supposed leader of the free world sitting with the Kremlin’s tyrant watching a march across Red Square by the army that has committed so many atrocities inUkraine.The biggest surprise is that so many people claim to be surprised. We knew that this US president despises America’s historic allies among the European democracies as he disdains the architecture of international security that his predecessors built. His geopolitics is one in which carnivorous great powers cut deals with each other and the smaller ones fall into line or get crushed underfoot. If you are genuinely shocked by these developments, I can only assume you haven’t been paying much attention.The perils are acute. A dictated peace will embolden Putin and other predators by sanctifying the redrawing of international borders by force. Were the US in concert withRussiato dismember Ukraine over the protests of Kyiv and European capitals, the transatlantic alliance would be mortally fractured.Europeans are right to be angry with Trump, but they should also be furious with themselves. They are to blame for leaving their continent so vulnerable to this danger-infused turn in world events. Trump has always had a point when he’s railed about Uncle Sam being treated as Uncle Sucker and he isn’t the first US president to tell Europe to take more responsibility for its security, even if none before have been so brutal about it. Under the lazy assumption that the US would always ultimately have their backs, European countries have spent too little on their own defence. The Russian invasion of Ukraine was often described as a wake-up call, but too much of Europe responded by hitting the snooze button. Three years on, thelatest authoritative reportfrom the International Institute for Strategic Studies finds that Moscow is feeding more resources into its war machine than the entirety of non-Russian Europe is spending on defence. Some frontline Nato countries, notably Poland, haveramped up their military budgetsin response to the ravaging of Ukraine. The Poles grasp that the cost of deterrence is worth paying to avoid the far greater price of leaving yourself exposed to devastation. Others are still asleep. Last year, eight of Nato’s 32 members were still failing to meet the modest obligation to spend at least 2% of GDP.The perils are acute. Dictated peace will embolden Putin by sanctifying the redrawing of international borders by forceIt is not that Europe lacks the resources to protect itself without US assistance.Russia’s populationis about 144 million. The total population of Nato countries, excluding the US, is over 636 million and their combined economic heft is about 12 times that of Russia. The means are there; what’s been lacking is the will.Defence spending is about to become a lively issue in British politics. George Robertson, defence secretary during Tony Blair’s time at Number 10 and subsequently a secretary general of Nato, has been leading a strategicdefence review. Lord Robertson is a shrewd Scot who has overseen a serious piece of work that has come to conclusions which will be jolting. His grim findings have just been delivered to the desks of the defence secretary and the prime minister. They will have landed with a thump.The Robertson review will add further detail to an already alarming picture of escalating threats out-matching inadequate protections. It suggests innovations designed to extract more bangs for taxpayers’ bucks by improving the efficiency of defence spending. It also recommends the reprioritisation of roles and activities. It makes the argument that it’s not just how much you spend that matters, it is also how well you spend. Yet the bluntest message of the review will be that Britain is not adequately resourcing its security. John Healey, the defence secretary, haseffectively concededthat already by decrying the “hollowed-out” armed forces left behind by the Tories, a “dire inheritance” which includes the smallest army since the Napoleonic wars and an air forcelosing pilotsfaster than it can train replacements.One of Mr Healey’s junior ministers has said that the British armycould be wiped outin as little as six months if it engaged in a war on the scale of the conflict in Ukraine. In the realm of cyberwarfare, the head of the National Cyber Security Centrerecently warnedthat Britain’s shields aren’t strong enough to protect from the myriad bad actors who are menacing us.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At an imminent meeting with the prime minister at Number 10, the heads of the armed forces are expected to argue that there will be more cuts to our enfeebled capability unless they get an additional £10bn a year than has been budgeted for.People in a position to know tell me that Sir Keir is becoming swayed by the case to spend more. For that to happen, three big obstacles will have to be overcome. One is the Treasury, which has ever viewed the MoD as a prodigiously wasteful spender, as it often has been. When money is already tight, Rachel Reeves is going to take a lot of persuading to make a special case of defence. There will be baulking by the many Labour ministers and MPs who will flinch at more money for missiles when it will mean less for public services. There’s also a job of persuasion to do with the British public for whom defence and security has not recently been a priority. At last summer’s election, just one in 50 named it astheir top issuein deciding how to vote.It is going to take a lot of effort to shift the dial, but the need to do so is becoming pressing. There’s an old diplomatic saw: “If you’re not at the table, you’ll probably be on the menu.” In this era of international relations, exemplified by Trump seeking to do a strongman-to-strongman deal with Putin to carve up Ukraine, the law of the jungle is beginning to prevail. If the UK and the rest of Europe don’t want their vital interests to be on the menu, we’re going to have to stump up the cost of a seat at the table.Andrew Rawnsley is the Chief Political Commentator of the ObserverExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionVladimir PutinKeir StarmerUkraineDonald TrumpUS politicsEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

(“No woman should be forced to change her clothes in front of a male colleague”, Comment)The issue here is not about being anti-trans but being pro women’s rights. We have established protected female-only spaces not because all men pose a risk, but because some, indeed many, do. As it is not possible to know which men pose that risk, we exclude them all. The reality is that a man remains a man, irrespective of his gender identity, and should not therefore be allowed access to places that for very good reasons are designated for women only. It seems extraordinary at a time when violence against women and girls is so high, we should even contemplate violating this boundary.Gerison LansdownLondon N10As a trans person, I was appalled to read Sodha’s column. The consistent misgendering of Dr Upton, alongside [references to sex crimes], lent a cruel and offensive tone to what I assume was intended as a piece on the very necessary debate around single-sex spaces.The debate around single-sex spaces can never be constructive without those on all sides accepting that sex is not a binary experience, and chromosomes do not dictate gender, as Sandie Peggie reportedly suggested. Both of these women contribute to a very necessary, life-saving role.Women need to fight patriarchal oppression in a united format, accepting both cis and trans experiences, instead of punishing each other for a perceived lack of adequate “femaleness”.MSpringBath, SomersetThe victims of surrogacyThere is no doubt in my mind that surrogate mothers are largely influenced by the prospect of transactional gain (“Sorry, Lily Collins, but when people outsource childbirth, their motives really count”, Comment). Surrogacy tourism is particularly distasteful because willing candidates are often financially desperate. Surrogacy cannot be justified as a career and offering a large sum of money and supervised care where the state fails is not a benevolent act, it is a calculated trade-off in which the surrogate feels they have little choice if they are to survive.Lily Collins’s reasons for using surrogacy are her own business and while I’m not making any judgment about her wish for a family, people who think it is acceptable to exploit those with the least in life should harbour no illusions they are helping the surrogate mother.Mona SoodSouthend-on-Sea, EssexSaved from the NazisI was fascinated to learn of the belated recognition of Sally Carson, whose 1934 novelCrooked Crosspredicted the rise of the Nazis (“English writer’s forgotten ‘masterpiece’ predicting rise of Nazis gets new lease of life”, News).I am reminded of an equally prescient, yet unsung hero, John Sturge Stephens, member of a prominent Cornish Quaker family. In 1929, he wrote a book,Danger Zones of Europe: A Study of National Minorities, warning of the dangers to world peace of fascism and of the unfair treatment of cultural minorities. Working from the Quaker office in Vienna in the late 1930s, he wrote to his father, “countless gifted… people ruined simply because of their Jewish… blood. The cultural life of Vienna will be annihilated.”Stephens helped to save the lives of numerous Viennese Jews, including those of artist Albert Reuss and his wife Rosa, to whom he offered a home in Cornwall. Like Carson, Stephens deserves recognition for his visionary and humanitarian work.Susan SoyinkaPenzance, CornwallThe treasures of TahitiIn your story on Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander you say that in 1769 they became the first European botanists to explore the island of Tahiti (“Groundbreaking botanical discoveries on Captain Cook voyage were thanks to Indigenous people”, News). In 1767, the French botanist Philibert Commerson had visited the island as part of Louis Antoine de Bougainville’s circumnavigation. On board was a woman called Jeanne Barret, disguised as Commerson’s valet, who became the first known woman to sail around the world.Barret was crucial in assisting Commerson with collecting thousands of plant specimens and her significance in French history was marked by her being one of the golden statues that emerged from the Seine during last year’s Olympic ceremony in Paris.Doina CornellDursley, GloucestershireComfort was aware of AidsI was delighted to learn that Sharon Maguire will be directing a film about the making of Alex Comfort’sThe Joy of Sex(“‘They were trying to do 200 different poses during power cuts’: Bridget Jones director takes onThe Joy of Sex”, News) but I take issue with the statement that “he was completely blindsided by Aids”.As a physician and research biologist, Comfort was aware of the Aids epidemic from the start and was determined to act responsibly. Research for my biography of him shows that when he and his UK publisher were considering an updated edition in 1984, he wanted to revise it thoroughly and have a warning added to all copies of the original edition. If he were alive today, Comfort would be encouraged that new generations are nevertheless finding new paths to explore their needs and desires in loving and collaborative ways.Eric LaursenCharlemont, Massachusetts, USTaking on TrumpIt is right that Donald Trump and his actions must be challenged and it is imperative that all non-rightwing media and individuals take a stand (“Vengeful and reckless, Donald Trump must not go unchallenged”, Editorial).We cannot wait for the ships of governments to start moving. Echoes of the past remind us of the dangers of complacency. Platforms were used to manipulate vulnerable individuals into believing that their lives would be transformed if they brought a potential despot into power. Meanwhile, the powers that be cower in their wealth, afraid to disrupt the new status quo. Unlawful orders are being followed and this is not the first time in recent history that such events have unfolded. It is crucial that we wake up and the media is our main hope in this endeavour.Marie BrysonDownpatrick, County Down, Northern IrelandA better way back to workIn the 1970s, there was a much more humane and effective mechanism to help the long-term unemployed into work (“Labour to ‘fix benefit system to get people back into work’”, News,).I was an occupational psychologist in a ministry of labour industrial rehabilitation unit (IRU) where people had their abilities assessed in supervised work settings, tests and interviews, helped by a disability resettlement officer and social worker. This is much better than punishing people with sanctions or benefit withdrawals, a “carrot” rather than “stick” approach.Michael MillerSheffieldJust the exciting bits, pleasePenalty shootouts? Great idea (“Straight to penalties? Greed is football’s real shortcoming, not extra time”, Sport). Just do away with tedious 90 minutes of kickabout first. The whole season’s league could be condensed into a weekend of thrilling TV. Good for the environment, too.

Within weeks he was dead.Photograph: Alexander Zemlianichenko/APThe ObserverAlexei NavalnyThe Observer view: A year on from his death, Alexei Navalny still shines bright in a dark landObserver editorialPrincipled, charismatic and humorous, the murdered Russian opposition leader was everything Vladimir Putin is notSun 16 Feb 2025 01.30 ESTLast modified on Sun 16 Feb 2025 03.43 ESTShareIt is exactly one year since Alexei Navalny, Russia’s best-known opposition leader and anti-corruption activist,was murderedin an Arctic penal colony by Vladimir Putin’s regime. Countless other political opponents, critics and dissidents have been killed, jailed or exiled since Putin first became president 25 years ago.All vestiges of an open society, democratic accountability, independent media and free speech in Russia have been eviscerated in that time. Accused of war crimes in Ukraine, which he invaded three years ago this month, Putin poses an undeniable threat to Europe and Britain – as well as to his own people. Yet this is the man with whomDonald Trumpnow wants to be friends.Navalny’s fate was terrible, and instructive. No radical, he tried to reform Russia from within. His Anti-Corruption Foundation published factual investigations into official wrongdoing. He ran for mayor of Moscow in 2013. But increased prominence brought increased persecution, and he was barred from the 2018 presidential election. More than anything, perhaps, he was a patriot, principled, charismatic, popular andhumorous– everything Putin is not. In 2020 Navalny almost died, poisoned by a Novichok nerve agent. In 2021, he was rearrested, jailed, removed to the Polar Wolf Arctic camp, isolated,silenced and killed.The illegitimate victor of numerous gerrymandered elections, Putin felt so threatened by Navalny during the latter’s lifetime that he would not say his name in public. With its habitual lies, the Kremlin denied any responsibility for his death. The official cause, typically cruel and mocking, was given as “sudden death syndrome”. Navalny was 47. And yet Putin did not feel any more secure. New crackdowns on opposition figures followed, at home and abroad.Does Donald Trump have any idea how he is manipulated by this cynical ex-KGB thug?Yulia Navalnaya has taken up her husband’s cause, bravely leading protest campaigns in exile. Last July, she wascharged with “extremism”, a potential death penalty offence. In March last year,Leonid Volkov, Navalny’s former chief of staff, was badly beaten in Vilnius, Lithuania.At home,Amnesty International reports, government critics routinely face “arbitrary prosecution, lengthy prison terms, violent attacks committed with impunity, and other reprisals”. An anti-war activist,Aleksei Gorinov, received an additional three-year jail sentence in November. A journalist,Natalya Filonova, who opposes conscription, has suffered ever harsher jail conditions since 2022. Amnesty is demanding their release. Yet they are two among many detained for exercising their human rights.Putin’skilling spreesdate back at least to his genocidal campaign against Chechen separatists in the early 2000s. They include the murders of the ex-spy Alexander Litvinenko, the investigative reporter Anna Politkovskaya and the opposition politician Boris Nemtsov. Out-of-favour Russian oligarchs and businessmen frequently expire in mysterious circumstances. Soon after the Wagner mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin challenged his boss, he died in an unexplained plane crash. Yet Putin’s biggest homicidal exploits are geopolitical: his 2008 invasion of Georgia, 2014 annexation of Crimea, 2015 intervention in Syria – and Ukraine, again, in 2022. Many tens of thousands have died.When Trump calls Putin a “genius” whoexhibits great “common sense”, does he understand – does he care – that he is dealing with a ruthless killer? When, shattering the western consensus that Putin is an aggressor to be repulsed at all costs, Trump proposes a chummy tete-a-tete on Ukraine, does he have any idea how he is manipulated by this cynical ex-KGB thug? Does JD Vance, Trump’s ignorant vice-president, realise what a dangerous game he plays when he flirts with Europe’spro-Putin neofascist far right? It seems not. Navalny would put them straight. Except he’s dead.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It ended up with four awards: for best picture, outstanding British film, adapted screenplay and editing.Accepting the second of those, Berger – who swept the board at the awards two years ago with his remake of All Quiet on the Western Front, which won seven prizes – said: “We live in a time of a crisis of democracy. Institutions used to bringing us together are used to pull us apart. Sometimes it’s hard to keep the faith, and that’s why we make movies.”Berger, whose film depicts a battle between liberals and traditionalists that threatens to destroy the Catholic church from within, ended his speech by quoting Leonard Cohen: “There’s a crack in everything, that’s how the light gets in.”View image in fullscreenAdrien Brody accepts the leading actor award for The Brutalist.Photograph: Stuart Wilson/BAFTA/Getty Images for BAFTAThe Brutalist, Brady Corbet’s epic drama about a Hungarian modernist architect working in post-war America, went home with best director, leading actor, cinematography and score.In his speech, starAdrien Brody, who recently appeared on the West End stage in The Fear of 13, thanked the British public for “embracing me and my creative endeavours”, saying “England has felt quite a lot like home lately”.He then went on to thank his partner, designer Georgina Chapman (who is also the ex-wife of Harvey Weinstein), calling her an “angel” and adding: “If it wasn’t for you and for my wonderful parents I wouldn’t be here.”Brody fought off competition from Timothée Chalamet, the star of Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown – which went home empty-handed – and from seven-time Bafta nominee (and one-time winner) Fiennes.‘Karla Sofía I kiss you’: Emilia Pérez director extends Bafta olive branch to absent starRead moreBut there was a surprise in the best actress category, as Anora’s Mikey Madison – who was also beaten by David Jonsson to the rising star award on Sunday – took the prize over frontrunnerDemi Moorefor The Substance and much-loved Hard Truths star Marianne Jean-Baptiste.In Sean Baker’s Palme d’Or winner, which also won best casting, Madison plays an exotic dancer who begins a romance with the son of a Russian oligarch. On the podium she gave a shout-out to the “sex worker community”, saying: “I see you, you deserve respect and human decency. I will always be a friend and an ally and I implore others to do the same.”Meanwhile, Emilia Pérez, Jacques Audiard’s musical about a Mexican cartel leader who transitions while escaping the mob, took two awards (from 11 nominations) despite the ongoing fallout from offensive unearthed social media posts from its star,Karla Sofía Gascón.View image in fullscreenMikey Madison accepts the leading actress award for Anora.Photograph: Stuart Wilson/BAFTA/Getty Images for BAFTAGascónhas taken a vow of media silence since tweets surfaced three weeks ago in which she aired Islamophobic and racist views. She apologised repeatedly, including on a tearful hour-long interview on Spanish TV, but was shunned by many of her colleagues on the film, including her director, who 10 days ago said: “I haven’t spoken to her, and I don’t want to.”Yet Audiard, whose film is up for a record-breaking 13 awards at the Oscars, appeared on Sunday to extend an olive branch toGascónin his acceptance speech for best film not in the English language, dedicating it to the “wonderful artists” from the film who were present in the room, before adding “also you, my dear Karla Sofía, who I kiss”.Accepting the supporting actress award for the film, Zoe Saldaña echoed Audiard, creditingGascónin her speech, before going on to tearfully thank her mother “for being such a selfless person” and her husband: “you are God’s favourite and I hate it – you are so beautiful.”Saldaña has won all the supporting actress awards so far handed out this season and is now considered a lock for the Oscars in a fortnight. Likewise A Real Pain’s Kieran Culkin solidified his status as the inevitable winner of the supporting actor Oscar with a Bafta win for his performance as Jesse Eisenberg’s erratic cousin on a tour of Jewish history in Poland in A Real Pain.Eisenberg picked up the prize on Culkin’s absence – it was, he said, the fifth such award he’d collected for his co-star, “which just confirms my theory that we have a similar life but his is about 27% better than mine”.The Succession star wasn’t present, Eisenberg said, because he wanted to be with a family member who is “quite sick” – an impulse to be with his family no matter what that, continued Eisenberg, had meant Culkin tried to drop out of A Real Pain two weeks before the shoot.“It’s real and it’s beautiful and it’s admirable,” he said. “Kieran is one of these lovely people who’s brilliantly talented but by some random luck of the cosmos has his priorities in order.”View image in fullscreenSaldaña with her award.Photograph: Isabel Infantes/ReutersEisenberg also wrote and directed the film, and appeared to be the person in the room most surprised by his victory in the original screenplay category, saying he didn’t expect to win, nor – apparently – did the person who assigned him his seat in the auditorium.He dedicated the award to his wife, “who didn’t come because she didn’t think I’d win”. Describing himself as an “idiot”, he said his wife, who he met in 2001, had, “dragged me around the world reluctantly” and used “strict Marxist Leninist principles” to teach him that his “grief is unexceptional” compared to the rest of the world.“Anna, you put every worthwhile thought into my head over the last 20 years and I love you so much.”Another double winner wasAardman’s Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl, which beat the likes of Inside Out 2 and The Wild Robot to the animation award, as well as proving a popular winner of the inaugural family film award.Rich Peppiatt converted just one of his six nominations for uproarious semi-fictionalised rap biopicKneecapinto an award, for outstanding debut by a British director. In his speech, Peppiatt said he had met his wife 15 years ago to the day; they moved to Ireland a decade ago and he met the hip-hop trio who became the subject of the film within a week.Kneecap, who hail from west Belfast and whose lyrics mix Irish and English and contain republican rhetoric are, he said “a movement. It’s about how everyone should have their language respected, their culture respected and have their homeland respected. This award is dedicated to everyone out there who’s fighting that fight.”Meanwhile,Super/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story, about the late actor’s career before and after his devastating accident and the impact of it on his children, took best documentary. The film is not nominated for an Oscar, where the frontrunner is No Other Land, about the destruction of Masafer Yatta, made by a Palestinian-Israeli collective.The evening’s most emotional speech was delivered by Warwick Davis, veteran of the Star Wars and Harry Potter films, who received the Bafta fellowship and said it was “probably the best thing that’s happened to me”. He thanked his mother and then paid tribute to his late wife, Sammy, who died almost a year before in what the actor has described as “medical negligence”.His voice cracking, Davis thanked cinema for giving him hope, and “helping me to laugh and to love again”.The ceremony was hosted by returning emcee David Tennant, who landed a few gentle blows on President Donald Trump – some of which were cut by the BBC in their broadcast – and who opened proceedings with a rousing version of I’m Gonna Be (500 Miles), accompanied by Hollywood stars in assorted states of familiarity with The ProclaimersBaftas 2025: the full list of winners – live!Read moreTheBaftasare the final significant film awards ceremony before the Academy Awards in two weeks and many regard them as a last-gasp audition for the Oscars. There is considerable overlap between the 8,000-odd voting members of the British Academy and their 10,000 US counterparts – many of whom wait to complete their ballots, which are due on Tuesday, until they’ve seen how the Baftas unfold.However, although last year’s choices were in almost total lockstep, with Oppenheimer dominating proceedings, the Baftas have become a less reliable Oscars bellwether since they introduced a raft of radical backstage measures in the wake of the #BaftasSoWhite controversy five years ago, when all of the 20 acting nominees were white.Quotas at longlist stage, strict inclusivity criteria for contention in certain categories and a compulsory menu of randomised viewing for each voter has led to a striking diversity among their choices.Explore more on these topicsBaftasAwards and prizesThe BrutalistRalph FiennesConclaveDemi MooreAdrien BrodynewsShareReuse this content"

Conclave wins best filmEveryone expected Edward Berger’s classy thriller to win outstanding British film; in a slightly mediocre year for that prize, it was the clear frontrunner. But few tipped it for the best picture award.The Brutalistseemed to have too much chewy critical adoration; A Complete Unknown is well-loved, especially amongst the boomer demographic which still makes up a considerable portion of the Bafta votership; Anora (see below) was the dark horse emerging into the limelight. But Conclave? Isn’t it a bit … middlebrow? A bit too … enjoyable? And wasn’t that mic-drop ending slightly polarising?Apparently not. What might have propelled it over the finish line other than home advantage? Might the late whiff of controversy have benefited it, with Vatican bigwigs – and US evangelists – suggesting it was the work of Satan? In a year when films need a few hot headlines to be really successful (see The Brutalist) but not too many (see Emilia Pérez) that smattering might have given it much-needed edge. Does it have a real shot at the Oscar? Perhaps one needs to look to theBaftastwo years ago, when Berger’s previous film, All Quiet on the Western Front, won seven awards (picture, director, foreign language, cinematography, adapted screenplay, score and sound). At the Oscars, that went down to – a still very respectable – four (international, cinematography, production design and score).Snub! Ralph Fiennes loses best actorView image in fullscreenFiennes arrives.Photograph: Dave Hogan/Hogan Media/REX/ShutterstockIf Conclave can win best picture and outstanding British film – what’s wrong with the man who is in nearly every scene? Ralph Fiennes’s troubled Cardinal Lawrence is the beating heart of Conclave, its moral centre and the one whose troubled puffing also provided much of the soundtrack. Yet it’s also a performance light on heavy emoting and big stricken speechifying. Might that have cost Fiennes his gong? (It’s worth noting, perhaps, that Timothée Chalamet’s much-admired turn as Bob Dylan has a striking scarcity of Big Acting clips ripe for ceremony airing.) But you do have to feel slightly sorry for Fiennes – it’s been nearly 30 years since his last and only Bafta win, a supporting nod for Schindler’s List, and this marks his sixth defeat.Surprise! Mikey Madison wins best actressView image in fullscreenMikey Madison with her leading actress award.Photograph: Isabel Infantes/ReutersShe might not have managed to secure the rising star award, which is voted for by the public, but Mikey Madison scored a huge coup by taking the best actress prize. Demi Moore’s comeback narrative for The Substance had been assumed to be powerful enough to woo even Bafta voters – and those unmoved might well be expected to go for Marianne Jean-Baptiste, cruelly overlooked at even the Oscar nominations stage but toweringly brilliant in Mike Leigh’s Hard Truths. To celebrate either of those actors would have made a lot of sense, but the 8,000-odd voters instead went for a 25-year-old who plays a sex worker – quite an eyebrow raiser, given that even after their massive voters’ overhaul, Bafta membership still skews fairly old and conservative.Yet Sean Baker’s Palme d’Or winner has accrued considerable momentum over the past week or so, with best picture wins at both the directors and producers’ guild awards in the US – both of which have many active Academy Award voters. Anecdotal reports increasingly suggest that while many people in the industry deeply admire The Brutalist, lots of them really loveAnora. Might that push it over the edge on 2 March? Expect a flurry of fresh bets.Surprise! Christopher Reevetriumphs over No Man’s LandView image in fullscreenThe team behind Super/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story.Photograph: Dave Hogan/Hogan Media/REX/ShutterstockFor the past two years, the Baftas have established an impeccable track record when it comes to celebrating excellent documentaries that engage with chewy issues ripped from the headlines. Last year they chose the devastating Ukrainian war film 20 Days in Mariupol; the previous year it was a study of the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. This year No Other Land was right there: a critically adored look at West Bank devastation by a Palestinian-Israeli collective. And Bafta went for amediocre film about the children of Christopher Reeve. Honorable in itself, of course, and not a film without considerable heft and upset, but a slight chance of direction none the less.Surprise! Emilia Pérez actually wins some awardsView image in fullscreenZoe Saldaña with her Bafta.Photograph: David Fisher/Rex/ShutterstockJacques Audiard’s stitched-together mob musical drama has had the awards season from hell, one that its team wouldn’t like to just forget but to have the faintest memory of surgically removed from their skulls. Right when all hope seemed utterly lost, salvation came in the form of the surprisingly munificent Bafta voters.Emilia Pérez may have only won two awards from 11 nominations, but many would have expected fewer: its win for best film not in the English language, ahead of a strong field including the much admired Kneecap and Oscar best picture nominee I’m Still Here felt genuinely unlikely.And Zoe Saldaña’s victory for supporting actress suggests that she might be untainted by the general toxicity around her film. But will Oscar voters be quite so generous?Snub! The BBC trims the hottest speechesView image in fullscreenHair-raising … David Tennant arrives.Photograph: Ben Perry/REX/ShutterstockA risk-averse BBC tried to head off any issues by dropping potentially tricky quotes – though it’s all relative, as none would have hardly torn the roof off. David Tennant got in a few fairly tame jabs at Donald Trump, including a line about summoning him by saying his name three times – but in the edit only one of his gags survived: “Talking of villains …” And the BBC also deleted a significant news story: Emilia Pérez director Jacques Audiard’s peacemaking “kiss” to his errant star Karla Sofía Gascón, who as the world knows blew up most of the film’s award chances after some loathsome past social media activity was discovered. It might be a bit much to cry censorship, but definitely adds to the impression that all the BBC want is a bland, drama-free two hours of Sunday night TV.Highlight! Three doses of Jesse EisenbergView image in fullscreenJesse Eisenberg accepts the original screenplay award for A Real Pain.Photograph: Stuart Wilson/BAFTA/Getty Images for BAFTAIn so far as the Baftas act as an advert for a movie as much as an audition for the Oscars, A Real Pain must surely be seeing a bit of an uptick – thanks to Jesse Eisenberg’s three brilliantly winning appearances. He manages to be somehow funny and also sincere in all of them – as well as vastly faster than most of the people on the podium. In the first (winning original screenplay) he calls himself a loser and fanboys his wife. In the second (picking up Kieran Culkin’s prize) he is sweet about a person and cutting about the industry all at once. And in the third – presenting animated film – he and co-star Will Sharpe manage to find a category-appropriate riff to joke on that is, remarkably, both funny and plugs their film. For fans of those performances, A Real Pain won’t disappoint.Snub! A Complete Unknown goes home empty-handedView image in fullscreenChalamet on the red carpet.Photograph: Andy Rain/EPAIn a field that for much of awards season has lacked a true frontrunner, some have wondered if A Complete Unknown might do a Coda, and triumph through sheer crowdpleasing charm. That theory had a major hole blown in it at the Baftas, where none of its six nominations resulted in awards wins. If the likes of best film always looked a stretch, there was genuine hopefulness about Chalamet’s best actor chances, particularly given the minor controversy around the use of AI in his awards season rival Adrien Brody’s Brutalist performance. But that clearly wasn’t enough to dissuade Bafta voters from coronating Brody. Instead all A Complete Unknown’s star received were a handful of tired jokes from host David Tennant about Timothée Chalamet lookalike contests.Surprise! Wallace & Gromit beats Inside Out 2View image in fullscreenRichard Beek, Nick Park and Merlin Crossingham, plus plasticine friends, at the Baftas.Photograph: Dave Hogan/Hogan Media/REX/ShutterstockOf all this year’s contenders, the one likely to have been seen by the most people who watched the ceremony on BBC One was the one also on BBC One a month and a half ago: Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl. It scooping both best animation (a competitive field, with Pixar’s box office behemoth Inside Out 2, plus critical favourites Flow and The Wild Robot) and the inaugural family film prize was none the less a big win not just for Aardman but also the Beeb, and Netflix, with whom it shares producing and broadcast rights. Nick Park’s bumbling acceptance speeches, despite having done this for almost 40 years now, adds to the on-brand appeal.Explore more on these topicsBaftasAwards and prizesConclaveRalph FiennesAnoraThe BrutalistShareReuse this content"

The film marks Universal’s 11th best opening, just behind Jurassic World Dominion.Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy review – giant laughs for Hugh Grant but weepie sequel is strangely dazedRead moreThe film, which opened alongside new titles such as Captain America: Brave New World, accounted for 45% of the UK box office take over the weekend, while exhibitor Everyman delivered their largest ever three-day opening, beating the record previously set by the most recent James Bond film, No Time to Die.However, while pre-sales werereported last week to have outstripped Barbie, in the end Michael Morris’s fourquel fell short of that £18.5m opening enjoyed by Greta Gerwig’s satire.Mad About the Boy, which sees Renée Zellweger’s heroine now widowed with two young children, and choosing between suitors Leo Woodall and Chiwetel Ejiofor, also opened strongly in territories such as Australia and Mexico, as well as across Europe. In the US, however, it has gone straight to streaming through Peacock.Explore more on these topicsFilmBridget Jones' DiaryRenée ZellwegerRomance filmsComedy filmsUniversal PicturesComedynewsShareReuse this content"

Her lover, Mark Antony, had earlier taken his own life, dying in Cleopatra’s lap.“I came home and told Michael about the snakes,” Dench told BBC Radio 4, in a new documentary,Roleplay, to be broadcast on 24 February. Her husband, Michael Williams, who died in 2001, was also an actor. “He said, ‘Jude, you know what you should do. Give them names.’ We came up with Wilson, Keppel and Betty.” They were a well-known vaudeville act from the mid- 20th century, noted for their ancient Egyptian “sand dance”.Even though the three starring reptiles were garter snakes, which are quite small and not of significant danger to humans, Dench felt more at ease with the nicknames, as if they were pets. It enabled her to cope while playing her death scene, after her maid placed a snake into a sack behind her throne. After Cleopatra’s suicide, her body was then carried, on high, by servants into the audience before returning on stage for the curtain call.View image in fullscreenJudi Dench with Anthony Hopkins as Mark Antony.Photograph: Rex/Moviestore Collection“One night, the boys taking me kept hissing,” Dench said. “I was wondering what on earth was going on. Then, back on stage at the very end of the play, the snake fell out of my wig as I did my bow. I was so scared I lost my voice for two days.”TheNational Theatrealso used snakes during its production of the play in 2018, with Sophie Okonedo as Cleopatra. While there were no reports of the actors being scared, some in the audience reportedly took fright. There was a warning of “real snakes” on the booking website.Dench, who has recently turned 90, told other stories from her production in the documentary. In one scene, she, along with her two maids, is ensconced inside a room, unseen by the audience. “One evening I was quietly asked by them what was my favourite supper. I replied, ‘lobster and champagne’. On the last night, in the dark, they put out three plates of lobster and some champagne.”She saidAnthony Hopkins, who was playing Mark Antony, would sometimes whisper to her as he lay dead at the end of act IV. “I’m off now for a nice cup of tea while you do act V,” Dench recalled he said.Dench was initially surprised to be cast as the Egyptian queen: “I turned to Peter, aghast, and said, ‘You can’t have this extremely dwarfish and menopausal woman as Cleopatra – as she was very tall.” Dench, just over 5ft, was then in her early 50s.“But Judi’s size didn’t matter,” said Michael Billington, then chief theatre critic of theGuardian. He saw the 1987 production, which he hugely admired. “Judi’s Cleopatra was sharp and intelligent, and, when needed to be, witty.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Shakespeare had read about her that she had a very beautiful voice and was a very interesting character.”Suzman, however, accepts that the1963 film, Antony and Cleopatra, shaped many people’s view: “Everybody saw the cleavage and flesh of beautiful Elizabeth Taylor.”Roger Lewis, author of a new book,Erotic Vagrancy, about Taylor and Richard Burton, told the programme how she “would even wear her high heels in some scenes”. He added: “There wasn’t much acting involved. Nor was it about ancient Egypt. It was a film about celebrity, which, while being shot in late 1962, knocked the Cuban missile crisis off the front page.”Explore more on these topicsJudi DenchThe ObserverWilliam ShakespeareAnimalsAntony and CleopatraAnthony HopkinsNational TheatrenewsShareReuse this content"

If he wins, he will probably give one of his startled, free-wheeling and characteristically funny speeches, though by now he may struggle to express surprise, given his extended run of triumphs at these events.In 2024, he picked up a Golden Globe for best actor in a television drama series for his performance as Roman Roy in Jesse Armstrong’sSuccession. Last month, he nabbed the Golden Globe for best supporting actor for his role as Benji Kaplan in Jesse Eisenberg’sA Real Pain(he seems to respond well to direction from men called Jesse), which also landed him the four major American film critics awards, made him an odds-on favourite for an Oscar next month, and accounts for his Bafta nomination.‘Every day is 24 hours of panic to just get out the door’: Jesse Eisenberg on self-indulgence, candid aunts and his Oscar-tipped Holocaust comedyRead moreAll this attention may seem rather sudden, as though he were an overnight sensation, but Culkin, who appeared inHome Alonealongside his then famous older brother Macaulay, has been in the acting business for over 35 years. He is still only 42.If he has spent most of the intervening four decades flying under the radar, it may have something to do with witnessing close up the effects of premature stardom. His brother was one of the biggest box office stars of the early 1990s but was in danger of burnout by the time he was 14. “I don’t personally know anybody that has hit a level of fame that likes it,” he said recently. “I did have a somewhat unique perspective of having been around it in my childhood, watching that being like, ‘Oh, I get it. That sucks’.”View image in fullscreenKieran Culkin, far right, with his older brother Macaulay, centre front, in Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, in 1992.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamySuck it may, but fame also has a tendency to suck in all but the most determinedly resistant once the acclaim and money start rolling in. When he was 19, Culkin was nominated for a Golden Globe for his performance as a prep school dropout inIgby Goes Down. It drew offers for bigger films but he rejected them. “I was definitely not ready,” he has admitted. “I would not have been able to handle it.”He’s still wary of accepting major parts, although now his concern is more to do with being taken away from his wife, Jazz Charton, a Londoner, and their two young children. His rule is no more than eight days of separation. For that reason, he nearly pulled out ofA Real Pain, which involved filming in Poland.While there’s little risk of Culkin snatching lead roles from Leonardo DiCaprio, he has made it very difficult for casting agents to look anywhere else when it comes to idiosyncratic characters with an unfiltered way with words.InA Real Pain, a deftly observed comic drama following two awkwardly matched cousins on a Holocaust tour in Poland, Eisenberg (playing one of the cousins) gives a moving speech to his fellow tourists about what it’s like being closely related to Benji (Culkin). He loves and hates him, he explains, and is often infuriated by his unpredictable ways, but he’d give anything to experience what it’s like to light up a room the way Benji can with his unbounded personality.It’s a film that, for all Eisenberg’s sharp script and thoughtful direction, is close to unimaginable without Culkin’s unique charm – as engaging as it is unsettling. Yet with it, it all seems so utterly natural that it couldn’tnotbe made.That it was made is, in its own way, a minor miracle. It’s not just that Culkin came close to withdrawing several times, and Eisenberg was uncertain of his participation until he turned up on set, but also that he isn’t Jewish. Taking into account the story’s emotional underpinnings, and the debates surrounding ethnicity and casting, Culkin could have been a controversial choice. He immediately raised the issue with Eisenberg, who told him that it didn’t matter. One measure of his success is that Eisenberg was right –it doesn’t.A potentially more challenging hurdle was that the writer-director had never seenSuccessionand didn’t even ask Culkin to audition. When Armstrong heard this, he was so confounded that he thought Eisenberg must be lying. In fact, it was the director’s sister who advised him to hire Culkin after she read 30 pages of the script.View image in fullscreenKieran Culkin as Roman Roy and J Smith-Cameron as Gerri Kellman in the TV series Succession.Photograph: HBO/Kobal/ShutterstockShehadwatchedSuccession. And, once seen, Culkin’s Roman can’t easily be forgotten. How do you play a potty-mouthed billionaire nepo-brat with delusions of competence, a father-fixation, a contorted parasexual obsession with a much older colleague and a comic knack for exposing others and humiliating himself? Again the only conceivable answer is exactly like Culkin did it. Or rather, how he learned to do it.His absurdist sensibility was always there, perhaps shaped by a childhood of which he speaks fondly but which was, by conventional standards, decidedly weird. The fourth of seven children, he began auditioning for acting parts when he was six. He not only glimpsed the warping effects of Hollywood at an early age but also hung out at Michael Jackson’s Neverland ranch, taking helicopter rides with the singer, who, he says, was only ever warm and friendly.His father, Christopher “Kit” Culkin, was a former New York stage actor who, Macaulay alleged, “was physically and mentally abusive”. He walked out when Culkin was 12, and there followed a bitter custody dispute. The children remained with their mother, and father and son have not spoken for over a decade.An older half-sister died of a drug overdose when he was a teenager, and another sister, to whom he was very close, died in car accident when he was in his mid-20s. He remains devoted to his mother, Patricia Brentrup, herself one of 11 children. Culkin never completed high school.Yet if all that frenzy and dislocation informed his restless-sarcastic schtick, it was his five-year stint onSuccessionthat really developed his spontaneity. At first, he was reluctant to improvise, which was the way the showrunner Armstrong sometimes liked to work. But once he came round to it, he made impulsiveness his own thing, arguably his defining talent.View image in fullscreenKieran Culkin, left, and Jesse Eisenberg in a scene from A Real Pain.Photograph: APAt the end of the first season, Culkin, who’d then been acting for 30 years, came home and said to himself: “This is what I want to do with my life. I think I want to be an actor.”The unrehearsed creativity that Armstrong helped unleash at first confused and alarmed Eisenberg, a natural worrier who plans every detail in advance. By contrast, Culkin prefers to arrive on set not knowing what scene he’ll be doing so that he can stay fresh and in the moment. Although he learned his lines, he refused to say them out loud until they were shooting.Kieran Culkin on pranks, parenting and why his famous family doesn’t need therapy: ‘Us siblings, we’re already cooked’Read moreThe two approaches seemed as antagonistic and fraught as their characters in the film. Eisenberg called his co-star “mercurial, unknowable, unpredictable”.Yet they managed to find a compromise that, like the ill-paired cousins they played, worked a dream. The director would call Culkin’s “the greatest performance I’d ever seen”. That may be the hyperbole of man who’s keen to sell his film, but itisa remarkable performance, as close to charismatic chaos and disinhibited truth-telling as anyone viewing it would want to get.Of course, it’s only acting, a fact that sometimes gets lost amid the celebrity industrial complex of film promotion. Luckily, one of the people most likely to keep that reality in mind is the man who is the focus of all the praise. He says he doesn’t care if a film he is in flops – he has done his job and it’s not his responsibility. That only makes sense if it works the other way too, and he doesn’t care if it’s a hit either.All things considered, Culkin may just be that most rare of creatures: an actor who doesn’t take himself – or anything else – too seriously.Explore more on these topicsKieran CulkinThe ObserverSuccessionA Real PainMacaulay CulkinTelevisionJesse ArmstrongJesse EisenbergprofilesShareReuse this content"

Folded into a slightly-too-small chair in the regal-looking cafe of north London’s St Pancras Renaissance hotel, he shakes his head in dismay, causing his mass of tight curls to jiggle. “Rooke. Is. Gay,” he slowly repeats when reminded of the three words that make up the entirety ofhis Wikipedia page’s “personal life” section. “There’s a guy I’m currently dating who has mentioned it no less than four times. I’m like, ‘Can somebody just delete that?’”But while Wikipedia’s summation of Rooke’s personal life may be reductive, its section headed “works” is expansive. It culminates inBig Boys, the 31-year-old comedian and writer’s Bafta-nominated, semi-autobiographical coming-of-age comedy, which has just returned to Channel 4 for its third and final season. Based on Rooke’s 2015 Edinburgh fringe show,Good Grief, about the death of his father from cancer, and his 2020 memoir-slash-advice guide,Cheer the F**k Up, it follows grieving, gay student Jack (Dylan Llewellyn) as he navigates life at Brent University and tries to lose his anal virginity.By his side is straight best friend Danny (Jon Pointing), his geezer-y bluster and banter masking a struggle with depression. Both are buffeted by a support cast of strong, straight-talking female characters including Jack’s hilarious cousin Shannon (Harriet Webb).At its best,Big Boysmixes the soulful pathos ofThe Royle Familywith the top-tier cringe comedy ofFleabag. It’s about life and death, but with jokes involving eye-opening gloryhole injuries, the perils of downing poppers and niche 2010s pop culture – Jack’s pet fish is called Alison Hammond – littered throughout. Rooke himself acts as narrator, often speaking directly to Danny – a character “based on four of my friends”, he says, “three of them are still here and one of them isn’t”. The fact that Danny is addressed in the past tense adds an undercurrent of melancholy.View image in fullscreenLife and death and niche pop culture: Big Boys series three.Photograph: Patch Dolan/Channel 4/Matt CrockettRooke, today sporting a shirt stolen from theBig Boyscostume department, had trouble letting go of his creation. “I spent a lot of time crying in the car on the way [to set],” he says. “And then, because the budgets got so bad, later I was also crying on the tube on the way to set because I thought ‘every little helps’,” he laughs, pulling off a very Rooke/Big Boystrait of mixing humour with something more serious: acashflow catastrophe hitting homegrown TV productionand UK culture more broadly. “But while I was there, I had the happiest, best time.”Some of the best days were spent filming with the likes of Rylan Clark and the actual Alison Hammond, who both have cameos. Rooke says he was certain neither would agree to appear, which seems strange given the show’s glowing reviews, litany of awards (in 2023, Rooke won a Writers’ Guild of Great Britain award) and celebrity fans such as Kylie Minogue, who was recommended the show by a friend of a friend (“I think if you’re a gay man and Kylie Minogue doesn’t have your number, then you’re not gay,” Rooke quips).So why the lack of confidence? “I still don’t see it as a hit show,” he says, sipping a mint tea. “I see what huge hit shows get in terms of budget and marketing.” He references cash-rich Netflix productions promoted by flashy immersive experiences housed in warehouses. “I’m like, ‘Can’t we do that withBig Boys? Go to a warehouse and there’s gloryholes everywhere, but you have to put a love letter through the hole instead of a cock.’”Even the big set piece that opens series three – the gang jet off to Greece after Shannon wins big-ish at bingo – was done on a budget. “It wasn’t actually Greece,” Rooke laughs. “It was Malta, because of the tax cuts. Also, there’s a whole Greek gay bar section that we shot in a hotel in Edgware called the Madonna hotel. It’s the campest place ever.”Rooke has always been able to improvise if necessary. As a kid, growing up in Watford, he was obsessed with magic and would sleep with a homemade magic wand (actually a stick covered in masking tape). He struggles to pinpoint exactly what it was about magic that he loved, but is wary of linking it to his sexuality, or upbringing, as part of some Sad Gay Past he had to escape from.“I am the product of two working-class parents that had a kid in their mid-40s and by that point had a bit of money,” he says. “I was born into a council flat but then we moved to a house so I feel like I had a foot in the working-class experience of growing up and not having much, and then a foot in the middle-class experience. I also don’t really know how much of my youth I spent worrying about being gay.”Even series one’s crowning moment – whenJack tells his mum he’s gay– was never supposed to be a big event. “I used to get very annoyed on set when people called it the coming out scene,” he says. “For me, it’s about the fact his dad’s dead and he can’t tell him something about himself that’s new. That was the emotional drive. It wasn’t about the shame of sexuality.” The scene was later shown onCelebrity Goggleboxand hit a nerve, going viral on TikTok. “I was trying not to do the grand cliche of gay writers who write the coming out scene, but of course it was a fucking coming out scene. I needed to just accept that.”I was around a lot of women taking very little shit from anyone for anythingRooke says there was always “the presumption that I was [gay] from very masculine, geezer-y figures in my family”. But his dad, “a bit of a Danny”, would take him to places that “had some gay presence”, like Camden market, and would also support his childhood obsession with the Spice Girls, replacing a Baby Spice doll after Rooke chewed its head off. Even before his dad died when Rooke was 15, he was supported by a strong feminine energy. “I was around a lot of women taking very little shit from anyone for anything,” he smiles. He mentions his auntie Jill, a 74-year-old painter and decorator, and his auntie Marion, who drove buses. “They all grafted a lot, because they had to. The men I spent a lot of time with in my earlier years were either in crisis or violent. And I don’t mean constantly abusive, constantly bad people, but they dealt with their aggression through punching walls or kicking something.”In his late teens, Rooke did work experience atCalm, a charity aimed at offering support for those in crisis. “Everyone who called in the first week I was there was a wife, sister, mother or girlfriend, worried sick about a man in their life,” he says. The experience inspiredBig Boysstorylines involving Danny’s girlfriend Corinne (Izuka Hoyle) and his hapless university mentor Jules (Katy Wix), who attempt to put Danny back together. “The reason the male mental health conversation has occurred is because women have encouraged men to open up,” Rooke says. “I want this series to celebrate those women.”View image in fullscreenJack Rooke performing Love Letters at the Edinburgh fringe in 2019.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The ObserverI ask Rooke why he suggested we meet in the Renaissance hotel. I assume, perhaps, it was a Spice Girls reference (theirdebut video for Wannabewas filmed here). It turns out it’s to do with where he’s heading next, post-Big Boys, with the hotel featuring in not one but two future projects. “One is a film I want to write and direct, and the other is a comedy drama.”He’s tight-lipped about the latter but, likeBig Boys, the film is a personal story tinged by loss. In 2020, Rooke’s older brother Dean lost his partner to cancer. The day they found out it was terminal Dean proposed underneath Tracey Emin’s “I want my time with you” neon sign that hangs at the back of the hotel. “Dean is a real geez, like a lad’s lad, and I remember thinking it was the most touching, thoughtful, emotionally resilient, brave thing I’ve ever seen anyone do ever.”Writing, however, isn’t necessarily where Rooke’s future lies. He much prefers being on a set, running things, feeding into every detail. He’s disarmingly honest about his book, calling it “awful. Dreadful.” He was inspired to write it after reading too many books about mental health written by “a thirtysomething middle-class person who would then say, ‘I did have a private therapist subsidised by both my parents as well as the income that I’d made in my 20s being a FTSE 100 company leader’”. He lets out a loud cackle. “I got so fucking fed up of reading those shitty books that I was like, there has to be one that’s written by someone like me on the NHS waiting list who thinks they might be gay and whose friend’s killed themselves. But I don’t think I’m a very talented longform writer. Did I do the book for the money? Yes. Did I also hope it would be useful and that it would have advice for young people? Yes.”An increasingly powerful figure in TV – he recently signed with the prestigious American agency UTA, whose other clients include Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Greta Gerwig – Rooke is keen for his work to continue to help people. It’s this altruistic trait he admires in others, too. He tells me his current celebrity crush is financial journalist and unlikely hunk Martin Lewis. “I don’t know why,” he laughs. “There’s something about him wanting to help people not get scammed that really makes me go fucking feral.” Another line for the Wikipedia page, perhaps.Big Boysseries three isavailable to streamon the Channel 4 websiteExplore more on these topicsTV comedyThe ObserverComedyTelevisionChannel 4LGBTQ+ rightsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

It now has an estimated 150 million users.One of those users, since 2012, was Odunayo, a software ­engineer and developer from London. Six years ago, she sat down to ­create what she imagined might be a companion app to Goodreads.After building a demo for a few friends, she quickly realised it was more likely to be a competitor, ­offering readers’ tracking tools and trends – using AI – that could help recommend their next book. And as of this week,The StoryGraphhas 3.8 million active users, many of whom have ditched Goodreads.In a blogpost entitled “Leaving Goodreads in 2025!” just before Christmas, a blogger and reviewer going by the name Books With Bunny wrote: “I don’t love that Goodreads is owned by Amazon. There’s so much about the company that I don’t agree with … Goodreads feels outdated. Its interface looks clunky, and the features are limited … I’ve found Goodreads’ recommendations underwhelming and heavily skewed toward popular titles.”I think people love the different types of data we give. We just have a lot of really cool features, and the buddy read-alongs. But I think the number one thing is that it’s just not owned by Amazon’Nadia OdunayoBunny announced she would be using The StoryGraph going forward: “I’ve been loving it so far! Not only is it woman-owned, but it also offers so many fantastic features.”A Goodreads spokesperson said on Saturday that in 2024 it “welcomed millions of readers and we saw strong year-over-year growth in book tracking with our community adding hundreds of millions of books to their want to read, currently reading, and read shelves”.Odunayo, 33, said: “I think people love the different types of data we give. We just have a lot of really cool features, and the buddy read-alongs.“But I think the number one thing, if people are comparing us with Goodreads, is that a lot of ­people do go: ‘It’s just not owned by Amazon.’”Goodreads has struggled with a perception that there can be malicious reviewing and even personal attacks on authors from users. In 2023, debut author-to-be Cait Corrain wasdropped by her publisher, Del Rey, and her planned publication was scrapped after she admitted creating fake Goodreads accounts to boost the ratings on her own work and attack other debut authors with books due out at the same time as hers.In the wake of the Corrain incident, Goodreads released a statement saying that while it welcomed both positive and negative reviews, it “prohibits reviews that are not ­relevant to the book, harass readers or authors, or attempt to artificially deflate or inflate the overall rating of the book”.It added: “We continue to invest in improvements to quickly detect and moderate content and accounts that violate our reviews or ­community guidelines.”The StoryGraph has tried to head off such problems by not allowing private messaging or comments on reviews. Odunayo said she wanted to avoid a situation “where anyone can just comment on your review and you’ve got to deal with being scared to put reviews up there”.Odunayo never had ambitions to work in tech when she was younger. She studied philosophy, politics and economics at the University of Oxford and had an offer to work for Deutsche Bank.But after winning a competition for a place on a coding course for women – “just a nice skill to have in my back pocket” – the tech industry became her home.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Even going to Oxford, there weren’t many people around that looked like me,” she said. “So I know not everyone like me has that experience.”The StoryGraph, despite its ­climbing user numbers, is still run by Odunayo, who puts videos on Instagram and social media, talking about the app and her own reading, and answers direct messages personally.‘It’s totally unhinged’: is the book world turning against Goodreads?Read moreBut given the rate of growth, can that continue? And what if Amazon comes calling with a briefcase full of cash to buy out its Goodreads competitor?“That’s not something we’re interested in,” says Odunayo. “We had zero investment in The StoryGraph. It’s a completely bootstrapped ­company. Anything can happen in life, obviously, but right now we’re happy and we’re enjoying it. We see The StoryGraph as our life’s work.“I don’t think there’s a limit to how big we can get and ­maintain what we’re doing now. I just want more people to know about us. I want us to be the most popular book app in the world.”For Odunayo, the reason she started all this in the first place – the books – is more important than ever. “I remember a friend ­posting on social media that he’d had a busy year and only managed to read 45 books,” she said. “And I was ­thinking: ‘Wait a minute – I’m ­single, I don’t have any kids, the company I was running at the time was a 9am until 6pm situation, and I’ve only read 13 books this year.’“So I set myself a target of 30 or so books a year. It’s funny, because people always say to me: ‘Your ­reading must have plummeted since you set up The StoryGraph, being a one-woman development team’ – but it’s shot up.”In fact, Oduyano now reads 70 or 80 books a year, split between nonfiction and novels. Her current read isThe Ministry of Timeby Kaliane Bradley. “I was exposed to so many more books through interacting with readers that I was like: ‘Oh, I need to read this; I want to read that.’ But I’m now the CEO of a company that’s a reading tracking app. So reading is now part of my whole identity.”Explore more on these topicsBooksThe ObserverAmazonInternetPublishingAppsnewsShareReuse this content"

He is chewing gum, sipping coffee, talking through his recent career, and a certain serendipity that has rendered him reflective. At 36, he’s fresh from his turn as likely-lad love interest Fiyero in Hollywood’s blockbuster adaptation ofWicked; as a child, seeing the stage show was a milestone for him. “I remember thinking Fiyero was such a good part.” Later this year he will star inJurassic World Rebirthalongside Mahershala Ali and Scarlett Johansson. “I saw the originalJurassic Parkwith my family, aged six, at the cinema,” he says. “It was the first time we all went together to something like that. It was seminal, but so rare for us.”I didn’t go to drama school and there was a common belief that if you hadn’t, you wouldn’t be able to do classical textsJonathan BaileyAnd this month, Bailey will star inRichard IIat the Bridge Theatre, directed byNicholas Hytner. Bailey is its protagonist. It is another example of full-circle career moment. In 2013, he appeared on stage in Hytner’sOthello. Same playwright, same director, same city – Bailey can’t help but consider all that’s changed in the intervening years. “Back then I was too young,” he says. “I came into the rehearsal process not mature or confident enough.”Landing the role of Cassio, one of Othello’s lieutenants, had been so important to him then. “I didn’t go to drama school,” he says, “and there was a common belief that if you hadn’t, you wouldn’t be able to do classical texts, or perform in the big theatres. There are all these stories we are born into that we have to unpick. For me, one of those was how limited I felt.”Bailey remembers the day that changed. “It was late December,” he says, “and I was walking along London’s South Bank.” He was on his way to the National Theatre to meet Hytner for a callback. “I’d worked so hard and for so many reasons it felt…” He cuts himself off, then goes on, “Working at the National was beyond my wildest dreams.”View image in fullscreen‘It was beyond my wildest dreams’: Bailey as Cassio inOthello, with Olivia Vinall as Desdemona, at the National Theatre in London, 2013.Photograph: Donald Cooper/AlamyBailey performed the two scenes he’d prepared. Then, Hytner unexpectedly suggested a third, which Bailey hadn’t rehearsed. “I’m not very good at just reading and going,” he says. “I can’t really come up with… Anyway, I went with instincts. He offered me the job in the room. It was a defining moment in my career.”All sorts of opportunities followed for Bailey:American Psychoat the Almeida; Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s TV debutCrashing;King Learopposite Ian McKellen; BBC satirical sitcomW1A. He was made very famous for playing a leading Lothario inBridgerton, the Netflix behemoth. “Now being back with Nick,” he says. “I have a much fuller and more cherished understanding of him as a human as well as a director. Getting back into a room with him now, with all that’s happening, just felt obvious.”Hytner’s praise for Bailey is just as high: “He can speak Shakespeare like it’s his first language… The stage is his element.”It’s Wednesday lunchtime, early January, in a central London studio space. We’re meeting halfway through five weeks ofRichard IIrehearsals in full swing a few floors below us. In front of him is a bulky script covered in yellow highlights. “It’s only half,” he says, flicking through, playful panic in his voice. “Not only that, I’ve thinned it, and taken out the scenes I’m not in, which feels very Richard II.”It’s Bailey’s first stage production since 2022. ThroughBridgerton, he has been exposed to a global audience. But theatre is where it all began. “So returning to the stage, now, just felt so right. And I don’t think I’ve changed at all, even if certain things around me have.” It has taken some adjustment, this new level of “Black Mirror-esque” notoriety that he’s experiencing. It’s why he likes the intimacy of these rehearsals, after months spent on sprawling film sets. And he’s enjoying being based in London for an extended period, close to friends and family.View image in fullscreen‘I was contending with how things would change in my life’: In season 2 ofBridgertonwith Golda Rosheuvel.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyBailey is charming, handsome and self-effacing as we talk, but doesn’t seem entirely at ease. That gum chewing is fervent now; he’s fiddling with what’s in front of him. He habitually self-edits as he speaks. There’s a vagueness that, at times, feels purposeful. At regular intervals, he simply stops mid-sentence.Take the play itself. “It’s such an incredible, searing interrogation of power, government and monarchy…” he says. “You have someone with the cast-iron right to rule, who is absolutely unfit to lead, emotionally underdeveloped… And Shakespeare wrote to be played, not published. There are so many references and nuances to what an Elizabethan audience would have understood… It’s about translating it from that, and delivering it to a modern audience, so the effect hopefully has the same vivid fervency and front-footedness especially politically and especially in this instance with monarchy and leadership.”It sounds interesting. So where is he turning to for inspiration for his tyrannical overlord? I ask. Trump? King Charles? The Saudis?“That’s for the viewer to see. I have very clear ideas and I hope the audience will, too…”He won’t be drawn. I’m curious as to why. He shakes his head.“You’ll have to come and see it.”Later, over email, Hytner is more forthright: “The play wonders what happens when an entirely legitimate leader is set on ruining the country he leads. No good options. Submit or resist – either way you end up with chaos.”Ahead ofWicked’s late-November release, there was a preview screening in Sydney. “It was part of this massive press tour, but for me it only lasted two weeks. The girls are incredible,” Bailey says of his co-starsAriana GrandeandCynthia Erivo, plugging the project for months on end. “And they’re still at it, still shining.”View image in fullscreen‘The girls are incredible – they’re still at it, still shining’: Cynthia Erivo, Jonathan Bailey, and Ariana Grande at theWickedLos Angeles Premiere November 2024.Photograph: Gilbert Flores/Variety/Getty ImagesIn Oz, Bailey went along with one of his sisters and her two daughters in tow. It was the first time he’d sat back and watched the film properly. “I was so overwhelmed,” he says. “Even now, it makes me quite emotional. If there was the purest form of joy I had as a kid, it was singing and dancing.”His family was based between Reading and Oxford. Bailey has three older sisters. As a child, he’d be dropped at basketball club at the local village hall. “From outside, I could see my sister’s ballet lessons through the window. I wanted to be in there with them. I’d go and wait at the back of their class in my Velcro trainers.” He enrolled. “I was obsessed and loved it. Dancing and singing felt like a vocation.”Music also filled the family home. By the time Bailey was 10, his sisters would go out clubbing. “The next morning, they’d come back, and I’d get them, hungover, to do impressions of their different friends dancing.” It was a family affair. “We loved 90s club classics. Me, Mum, Dad and my sisters went through a phase of going into the new room – we had an extension, then called it that for 20 years – and we’d put on vinyls and dance, all of us.”One day, he stopped. “I don’t know what happened,” he says, “for whatever reason, I didn’t confidently carry through the dancing. I got self-conscious in my teens that it was signalling something else. It just didn’t feel… I probably just knew it was better to be playing rugby than dancing. I became really self-conscious. There weren’t other dudes dancing.” One teacher called Bailey a “fairy” in front of his entire class. “In your teenage years it’s so raw. You lose your skin. And there are certain things in life,” he says, “that allow people to think they know something about you, and those assumptions mean you stop doing something you love. You curb or you police yourself. You don’t make the joke, or say the quip. You don’t stand up and advocate for yourself or your friends. And you start to slowly crumple. That’s purely on the basis of this idea of signalling. These stereotypes.”One teacher called Bailey a “fairy” in front of his entire class. “In your teenage years it’s so raw”One becomes fearful, he continues, of the immense hurt that others can cause. “Even more pain than binding yourself up slowly and creating a space of safety and refuge in your own mind or heart. That’s where it gets dangerous and people stop doing the things they’re supposed to. And how brilliant that we…” He pauses, surprised, concerned even – it seems – by how much he’s sharing. “It’s a scary time, isn’t it. On the one hand, I do think there’s such a… People are so much more open-minded about what defines masculinity now. What defines heterosexuality. What defines gender. But on the other hand, there’s a swing, obviously, towards… Anyway, that one will have to be a dot-dot-dot for you.”It’s not that Bailey dropped performing as a child, only that things took off in a different direction. Back in ballet class, there’d been a callout from the Royal Shakespeare Company. “They needed young boys to play Tiny Tim inA Christmas Carol.” He was seven years old. “My parents weren’t sure. It was so outside their world.” His mum worked in the NHS. “And Dad was a DJ, basically, in Piccadilly Circus at [70s nightclub] Snoopys.” But a child actor? “It’s a big ask, from a kid. I was really protected by them, but they gave me this opportunity.” He was cast, and continued to be through school. “It was extraordinary, really. I didn’t miss any lessons. By 13, I’d done three productions for the RSC, and a stint in the West End. All before I hit puberty.”Then came his first Shakespeare production: Prince Arthur inKing Johnat the Barbican with the RSC. “I was 12 or 13, and that set me on another course. ‘Fuck, OK, you can also dothis.’” The memories are visceral, even now: “The sickly, sweet smell of fake blood. Dry ice. All those senses. I was taken. That’s maybe where my creative juices were channelled more, over singing and dancing.”He has worked solidly since his teenage years.Bridgerton, though, catapulted him to stardom. Afterwards, says Bailey, “I was contending with how things would change in my life.” The press introduction, a growing, global fandom, interest in his personal life and sexuality…“On one hand,” he says, “the success ofBridgerton, being able to play that role, and for who I am not to affect people’s perceptions; the love story between a man and a woman.” He pauses, again. Oh, actually.” Some nervous laughter.“It’s just, I’m cautious. I’m who I am and always will be. It’s an extraordinary thing to see and hear the word ‘gay’ next to your name all the time. It’s something I’m incredibly proud of, but it’s also not something anyone else would be defined by. So to go straight fromBridgerton, where inevitably that was talked about, to do a series likeFellow Travellers? It came along like some sort of beacon.”View image in fullscreen‘I’m who I am and always will be’: Bailey (left) with Matt Bomer inFellow Travellers.Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/AlamyFellow Travellers, a Showtime series in which Bailey and Matt Bomer star, follows the romance between two American politicos, from the 1950s to 1980s. Production started as series one ofBridgertonstarted streaming. Among a predominantly queer central cast, cocooned on set, Bailey’s sexuality was entirely un-noteworthy. “All with our own experiences,” he says, “coming together. And learning about the history… The men who endured and experienced such horrendous and extraordinary things.”Simultaneously, he was inundated with requests from charities followingBridgerton’s success. “I felt frozen by wanting to help.” The sheer scale of what was being asked and what he might do with his platform, connections and cash felt overwhelming. So, he founded theShameless Fund. “Raising cash and erasing shame to support the global LGBTQ+ community. We’re giving grants this year. I’m so proud of it. It was all in theory. It seems so obvious and clear. We’ve raised a lot of money for initiatives that need cash and a platform.“And the thing is,” he says, “I can’t be a mouthpiece. I’m an actor.” As is clear through our conversation so far, he’s impassioned and engaged, but being outspoken doesn’t always feel comfortable. It must be challenging, I say. So many eyes and ears pointed in his direction.“The noise is turned up,” he says. “And when it’s about your family, or your identity… And nobody is going to question that headline, in a different outlet with their own agenda. That’s what’s left and it isn’t true. That’s why I’m really protective. I’ve seen something so specific about my identity be twisted. Ultimately you want peace within yourself, because the world is wild enough as it is. It’s too important now, with rights being stripped away. What’s so obviously looming…”Back toWicked, I suggest.View image in fullscreenBailey in a scene fromWicked, with co-star Cynthia Erivo.Photograph: Landmark Media/Alamy“OK,” he says, relieved, “so I was doingCock[his West End stint in Mike Bartlett’s comedy about sexual identity] and I knew a film ofWickedwas happening.” In the dressing room before curtain up one night, Bailey recorded a self-tape. “As I was singing, doing a karaoke version of [Fiyero’s big number] Dancing Through Life, I got called to stage on the Tannoy. Fuck it, I just sent it.” There were some positive noises. “Then the dates didn’t look to be working out.Wickedsaid they couldn’t be sure about what they wanted…” Bailey made other plans. Then, out the blue, dates shifted: the part was his. The months that followed were hectic: during one stretch, while jugglingFellow Travellers,BridgertonandWicked, he was filming for 34 days straight.“I’d come from set, sleep on a flight, go straight to aBridgertonball, then the next day be dancing with Ari and Cynthia. Everyone else forWickedhad three months of rehearsal. I had three days.”There’s a knock at the door: Bailey is being summoned back down to rehearsals. “The conclusion to that,” he says, “isWickedhappened and I’m so proud. Before I knew it I was Dancing Through Life…” Suffice to say, he’s thrilled to be.Richard II is at the Bridge Theatre until 10 May,bridgetheatre.co.ukExplore more on these topicsJonathan BaileyThe ObserverActingCelebrityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Undocumented Palestinian refugees living hand to mouth in Athens, they subsist on what they can scrape from petty crimes. Chatila has a plan – to save enough to reach Germany, where they will open a cafe. Reda, meanwhile, has a drug habit. Clean for a month, his addiction continues to get in the way of his view of the future. Clinging to his smarter, stronger cousin, Reda asks again to hear about the cafe, like a kid pleading for a bedtime story. When a scheme to make money backfires, Chatila snatches opportunity from the jaws of disappointment and comes up with a plan to earn enough to escape Athens.

It is sung and acted with blazing conviction by English National OperaTim AshleySun 16 Feb 2025 10.58 ESTLast modified on Sun 16 Feb 2025 11.00 ESTShareThe final new production ofEnglish National Opera’s season isThea Musgrave’s Mary, Queen of Scots, directed by Stewart Laing and conducted by Joana Carneiro. It was last heard in London at Sadler’s Wells during a 1980 tour by Scottish Opera, who premiered it in Edinburgh in 1977.It’s a bleak, uncompromising piece, in many ways. Musgrave is having none of the still prevalent Romantic view of Mary as the passionate martyr of Fotheringhay, focusing instead on her years in Scotland between 1561 and her abdication in 1567, and probing her relationships with the three men who jostled to control her: her illegitimate half-brother James, a fierce Protestant, whose fixation with his sister, it is implied, may have been incestuous; Henry Darnley, her profligate second husband; and Bothwell, the Catholic mercenary, whose ostensible loyalty masks a tendency to coercion and sexual violence.The score has a certain unyielding hardness of edge. Musgrave is good on plots and counter-plots, as alliances are formed and dissolved in ballrooms, and omnipresent slithering woodwind suggest there is no firm ground anywhere. Arguably the finest scene in the entire work, relentless in its tension, comes when the earls of Ruthven (Ronald Samm) and Morton (Jolyon Loy) conspire with Darnley (Rupert Charlesworth) to murder Riccio (Barnaby Rea). Elsewhere, much of the drama is advanced in a mixture of recitative and arioso, with vocal lines turning notably angular at moments of crisis. Lyrical passages are beautiful but rare, and a lovely chorus marks the arrival of Mary in Scotland. Darnley later woos her to music at once impressionistic and exquisitely insubstantial.View image in fullscreenAlex Otterburn (earl of Moray) and Darren Jeffery (Cardinal Beaton) in Mary, Queen of Scots.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianLaing, meanwhile, reimagines the piece in terms of 20th-century sectarianism. Protestants and Catholics, fanatics alike, are effectively indistinguishable from each other until allegiances are declared, but are also tacitly united by suspicion when Heidi Stober’s Mary arrives, elegant yet out of place in a couture trouser suit. It’s a telling idea, but can obscure our awareness of the underlying power dynamics: in particular, Mary’s insistence on a divine right to absolute monarchy doesn’t carry as much weight here as it should.Sung and acted with blazing conviction across the board, though, the performance itself is tremendous. The title role lies high, and Stober is all thrilling top notes and terrific moments of defiance or self-assertion. Alex Otterburn makes a charismatic, lethally persuasive James. You really understand Mary’s initial attraction to Charlesworth’s elegantly sung if vapid Darnley, and the dissipation and degradation of his later scenes are disquietingly vivid. John Findon’s Bothwell masks steely brutality beneath the trappings ofheldentenorheroism, while Rea makes a sonorous, unusually sympathetic Riccio. Carneiro, meanwhile, drives it all forwards with inexorable momentum, and the playing and choral singing are both superb.It’s not always an easy work to like, but it’s powerfully done.At theColiseum, London, until 18 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsClassical musicOperaEnglish National Opera (ENO)live music reviewsShareReuse this content"

Now the North Yorkshire writer has trained her focus inward with a coming-of-age memoir that recounts the story of growing up with a complex mother and how she herself became a “reckless daughter”. Authors who turn to memoir face certain dilemmas. They must wrestle with precisely how much to reveal and what to conceal; which are the most resonant parts and how to avoid self-indulgence. The best in the genre manage such issues with invisible aplomb, while others can seem like leafing through family photo albums whose pictures mean more to the subject than to anyone else.The fact that Stripe has elected to write hers in the second person is jarring. Second person can work effectively in fiction, but memoir is all about intimacy, disclosure. “Come in,” she seems to be saying here, “but stay overthere. No, further back.”Her mother runs a hairdressing salon, struggles with her weight and maintains myriad airs and graces. She wants to mould the young Stripe accordingly. “Stop dropping your aitches,” she scolds. “It makes you sound common, like all the rest.”She realises that in order to find herself, first she must get lostNot unusually for children of overbearing parents, Stripe considers herself a square peg. Familial deference remains in short supply. When her grandmother, a devout Jehovah’s Witness, tells her that one day God will help her rise from the soil, Stripe responds: “What, like zombies?”She realises that in order to find herself, first she must get lost. That self-styled “recklessness” is really what the French would call joie de vivre, but Stripe lives in a world where problematical people are everywhere; anything resembling adventure can bring danger. As a young teen, she is sexually assaulted by a footballer after she agrees to his offer of a lift home. Later, in her 20s, she flees to New York intent on staying at the fabledChelsea hotel, only to find it full, then eagerly takes up the shifty doorman’s offer of his spare room. When his kindness comes with certain conditions, she self-admonishes. “Your fault,” she tells herself. “Your fault.”Such awful incidents aside,Base Notesmostly describes the fairly typical trajectory of someone establishing their autonomy via leaving home, early jobs, numerous flats and friendships. Many of the more intriguing-sounding memories, though, are skimmed over, like stones on water. Within the space of a single sentence, she announces that “you had fallen pregnant with a man you hardly knew … the lowest ebb”, and reveals nothing more. Elsewhere, there’s the time when “you were flown to a foreign country with a group of strangers for a new experiment called reality TV”. Which programme? What happens? She won’t say. When, late in the book, she announces that she is now “Dr Stripe”, I wondered whether I’d glossed over an earlier throwaway line explaining she’d retrained as a GP, before realising the more likely reason: that her mature-student university course culminated in a doctorate.Throughout, she relies upon smell to summon up nostalgic remembrance. Her mother is redolent of “basil and bergamot … lemon … peach … oak moss … cyclamen … vetiver … rose”, and walking into a room her nostrils pick up “orange blossom … gardenia … a splash of cedarwood”. It’s when she first meets the writerBenjamin Myers, whom she will later marry, claiming to note whiffs of “pennyroyal tea … golden delicious … buttery sage … sawdust snacks … freshly torn basil”, that it becomes clear she doesn’t actually possess an olfactory awareness to rival Patrick Suskind’sPerfume, but simply enjoys rococo flourishes.Nevertheless, there is some lovely, tender writing here, about how confusing life can be, and how meandering the path before, in this case, “you” finally find peace. What starts out as a rail against family shackles becomes, ultimately, a fond tribute. “A slow acceptance of your differences have emerged,” she writes, her mother at last accepting that Stripe – married, middle-aged, happily child-free – is her own person. “Now that 264 miles separate you, your chalk and cheese characters are hardly noticeable. You are finally able to enjoy each other’s company. An entente cordiale has been reached.”Base Notes: The Scents of a Lifeby Adelle Stripe is published by White Rabbit (£20).

This was its UK premiere by theBBC Singersand National Youth Voices under Sofi Jeannin.A work of unwavering spiritual certainty lasting just over an hour, it derives from the allegorical morality play of the same name by Hildegard of Bingen, dating from about 1150, in which personifications of the Christian virtues (Humility, Faith, Chastity, Hope, and so on) wage war with the devil for the human Soul, which is assailed by temptation yet all the while conscious of its longing to return to the God who created it.Hildegard’s use of plainchant to illustrate her drama finds echoes in the shapes and contours of MacMillan’s own thematic material, and the way his sometimes complex polyphony suddenly coalesces into unisons or monotones from which new ideas evolve and emerge. This is music that frequently aspires to timelessness, as numinous tone clusters usher the Soul into God’s presence, and chordal chants and bass drones echo the hieratic ceremonials of eastern orthodox church music.At home with Simon Rattle: ‘There are still things I feel are beyond me’Read morePercussionist Andrew Barclay’s steady drumbeats anchored the score in ritual, but elsewhere there was a startling physicality to some of MacMillan’s textures, and moments of chromatic bewilderment when the Soul is faced with temptation, which really threw us off balance.The Soul was sung by soprano Emma Tring, her voice soaring rapturously upwards before sinking down towards a darker, lower register that seems very much of the world in which she finds herself. Rebecca Lea, as Humility and Chastity, stayed in the stratosphere, sounding exquisite. Her fellow Virtues, each sung by a chorus member, were all sharply and astutely characterised. The devil, however, who is beyond any kind of harmony, speaks rather than sings (MacMillan follows Hildegard here), and Charles Gibbs’s voice, reverberantly amplified, echoed balefully round the auditorium.Jeannin forged the disparate elements into a seamlessly unified whole. The choral singing, meanwhile, was breathtaking and glorious.To be broadcast on BBC Radio 3 on 20 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsClassical musicBBC SingersJames MacMillanreviewsShareReuse this content"

From emperors’ heads on coins to Picasso’s anti-war masterpiece,Guernica, and Banksy’s street art, power and visual culture have been closely and sometimes combustibly associated. This relationship is explored in essays by the distinguished art historian TJ Clark, professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley. Many of them first appeared in theLondon Review of Books, where the academic is given room to dilate in its rather airless pages. He brings a wide scholarship and unflagging scrutiny to his task. That said, his introduction includes the discouraging spoiler: “art-and-politics [is] hell to do”. From time to time, the reader finds themselves recalling this damning admission.Clark writes from a “political position on the left”. He reflects on epoch-making events such as the Russian revolution, which spawned socialist realist art. He says the Dresden-born artist Gerhard Richter, 93, maker of abstract and photorealist works, is “haunted by his past” in the former East Germany. But there are also dustier subjects, including the Situationist International, a group of avant-garde artists and theorists who were active from the 1950s to the 1970s.Clark’s take on art and power is timely, though. Donald Trump’s friends the tech bros are a new class of fabulously rich patrons with political clout to match. They are sponsoring a revolution in image-making through AI and social media. Clark writes about widely shared and often manipulated photographs ofrioting in England in 2011(and calls the typical subject of these visuals “the un-elated looter”). But his pieces, the oldest of which dates back 25 years, have been overtaken by leapfrogging developments in the digital sphere.Velázquez’s Mars is seen in what looks like a French firefighter’s helmet and little else, like an exhausted strippergramHis definition of what constitutes political art is broad; or better, say, elastic. One chapter examines a crucifixion done in grisaille, or shades of grey, by a northern Renaissance master. Is this political art? According to Clark, the painting expresses “a Christian nihilism… lacking the consoling vehemence of the isms to come”. In fact, the picture was made in the immediate aftermath of a pretty vehement ism: a monk called Savonarola was responsible for the fanaticism of tossing books and paintings on to the Bonfire of the Vanities in Florence. Clark examines faces painted by Rembrandt. These are “political” in the sense that the artist became the society portraitist of a new class in Dutch society, the bourgeoisie; but then the entire golden age of art in the Netherlands was paid for by their wealth.Confronted in a gallery by the alchemy that transforms pigment, canvas and mark-making into a canonical work, some of us are content to attribute this to genius or serendipity. We imagine a silken thread connecting the artist’s eye, hand and the picture. But to an art historian such as Clark, it’s more of a Gordian tangle, and untying it is correspondingly knotty. He worries away at the inscrutable expression on the face of Mars byDiego Velázquez, with the god of war seen in what looks like a French firefighter’s helmet and very little else, like an exhausted strippergram. Clark finds a similar look on a rifleman inThe Surrender of Breda, also by Velázquez, who was painter to Philip IV of Spain. “Mars’s expression still eludes us,” Clark concedes, though one reading he offers of this poker face is that it was the default look at Philip’s court, and that went for his tame artist and his portraits, too: “Keeping things superficial, and therefore not subject to malicious misinterpretation, may be a virtue, not to say a survival skill.”View image in fullscreenA Situationist International pamphlet from 1967.Photograph: Courtesy the authorClark doesn’t indulge himself or the reader with the felicities of a stylist such as the critic Robert Hughes (who beautifully draws our attention inThe Surrender of Bredato Velázquez’s “palisade of lances” and makes Clark’s point about the artist with effortless succinctness, calling him “the greatest impersonal painter who ever lived”).There are moments when Clark’s inquiries are beneath his considerable dignity. Art historians have something in common with mediums and spiritualists: they attempt to get in touch with the other side. While there’s a certain amount of empirical data about an artwork – its age, the materials it was made from, its provenance and so on – some commentators like to round out their appreciation with a kind of seance involving the artist. What was he thinking as he made his masterpiece? (See the art historians pitch up at the National Gallery in their gaudy headscarves and Romany caravans!) Clark divines the intentions of HieronymusBosch(who died in 1516) from the tiniest lick of paint on the face of a small figure on one of four panels now in Venice: “I’m very sure that Bosch had an idea from the start how the man’s mouth might serve his purposes.”This communing with long-dead artists to channel what was going through their heads made me think of a British film star who once played a badly wounded war hero. He nailed a heartbreaking scene in which he woke up in hospital to find his leg had been amputated, and his co-stars begged him to reveal how he did it. He said: “I just thought: ‘I hope they’ve still got some beef sandwiches in the trailer.’” Is it bathetic, or simply an acknowledgment of human nature, to imagine that Velázquez, Bosch and the rest sometimes thought of beef sandwiches, so to speak? After all, the old masters were hired hands, working to commission. They were fulfilling the wishes of a client – often a demanding one – rather than expressing themselves or chasing a muse.The sign of a good painting, it used to be said, was that the eyes follow you around the room. For Clark, indefatigable scrutiniser of facial features, the hallmark is thathefollows the eyes around the room instead.Those Passions: On Art and Politicsby TJ Clark is published by Thames & Hudson (£40).

There was nothing for it but DIY: new houses, like Testard’s Fitzcarraldo Editions, and new prizes for new authors shut out by the risk-averse mentality that prevailed after the 2008 recession. Leading the way was Liverpool-born, Ireland-raised writerEimear McBride, whose 2013 debutA Girl Is a Half-Formed Thing, a looping soliloquy published by Norwich startup Galley Beggar Press, won the inaugural Goldsmiths prize for experimental fiction as well as the Women’s prize (then known as the Baileys), traditionally a more commercial award, in a sign that the thirst for novelty perhaps wasn’t so niche after all.McBride’s new novel,The City Changes Its Face, is a stand-alone sequel to her second book, 2016’sThe Lesser Bohemians, which was told by teenage drama student Eily, who comes to London from Ireland in the mid-90s and falls for Stephen, an actor 20 years her senior, with an estranged daughter Eily’s age, living overseas after her mother couldn’t hack Stephen sleeping around – a snag for Eily, too.The action resumes here in 1995, yo-yoing between the recent past – in particular, a momentous visit by said daughter, Grace – and a narrative here and now in which Eily hasn’t been leaving the house after a breakdown and Stephen is in a West End show, kissing his female co-lead on stage, something Eily’s sort-of not-quite OK with. McBride’s cutting between time frames repeatedly leaves us poised on one ticklish moment only to switch to another – whether Stephen has returned from work to find Eily and Grace drunkenly quizzing each other, or he’s just been left bloodied by a shattered jar of piccalilli during a row with Eily at home, where innocuous-sounding exchanges about sandwiches and tea can’t mask the volcanic undertow bubbling up from the individual miseries of their past (addiction, abuse, self-harm).The novel’s drama lies ultimately in the dance of Eily’s thoughts as she decodes Stephen’s wordsWhat unfolds is a two-for-one trauma plot involving love between bruised souls who aren’t walking on eggshells so much as tiptoeing blindfold across a tripwired minefield. This being McBride, it’s the telling that’s as important as the story; in seeking to portray what it’s like to live in a body and a mind, she operates at a frequency most novelists ignore, intuitively able to recognise how something so apparently insignificant as the position of type on a page – indentation, spacing, line breaks – can be pressed into communicating nuances of thought and emotion. And as inThe Lesser Bohemians, frequent interruptions in a tiny font are deployed to show Eily quibbling with herself (there are more conventional tools for that, but McBride fights shy of commas and speech marks, never mind brackets).The novel’s drama lies ultimately in the dance of Eily’s thoughts as she decodes Stephen’s words, calibrates her own, watching his gestures, craving, ultimately, for the validation she finds in his desire. Anything that makes that place harder to reach, whether Grace’s arrival or his refusal to ignore the marks on Eily’s wrists, fuels tension. For Eily, Stephen’s solicitousness for his daughter represents a threat, even though she likes Grace, who likes her too. The novel is most alive in that humanly messy tangle of almost unaccountable selfishness and anger, not least when her hopes of getting back into bed with Stephen – who is plagued by anxieties of his own – are stymied by Grace throwing up after one too many whiskies with Eily in the pub.While it’s not period fiction – there are mentions of Kwik Save and the bookseller Samuel French but not John Major or Britpop – there’s an elegiac quality to the still-ungentrified dossiness of its north London setting, where any problem can be eased for a time by the discovery of a forgotten four-pack, a cadged ciggie or nipping out for chips. And while the end of the book leaves us hanging, true, the ceaseless friction to its central relationship means it carries far more oomph than McBride’s previous novel, 2020’s unsatisfyingly waftyStrange Hotel. You sense that in revisitingThe Lesser Bohemiansshe’s continuing a project that’s far from done, and this reader, at least, would be glad if she decides the life of Eily is the place to be.The City Changes its Faceby Eimear McBride is published by Faber (£20).

At the bottom of which, somewhere between the compost heap and the wheelbarrow, would be a patch of rhubarb; scarlet stalks hidden under vast emerald leaves and, occasionally, when everyone had enough crumble, left to sprout plumes of creamy white flowers. In winter, the crowns would sleep under upturned buckets whose bottoms had rusted to a lacework of tiny holes and would no longer hold water.The juice of the blood orange will startle us back to life in the morningMy current garden refuses to give a home to rhubarb, just as it does to wild garlic, and I am resigned to buying my stalks at the greengrocers. I crave the cosy glow of rhubarb on a grey winter’s day, be it under a crust, stirred into a cake or sitting in a pool of its own jewel-bright juice for breakfast. Rhubarb also makes an entrancing granita, served in a pile of glistening pink crystals with a spoonful of vanilla-infused cream as a contrast.The other beacon of light this month is the blood orange, whose juice will startle us back to life in the morning and whose garnet-freckled flesh makes the prettiest addition to a ceviche, crisp winter salad or dessert. I offer it with slices of buttery cake, the crumb studded with pistachios and scented with orange blossom.Rhubarb granita with vanilla creamFor this ruby red granita, the frozen block of juice is transformed into a mound of sparkling crystals by running a good strong dinner fork across its surface. Leaving the granita out of the freezer for 20 minutes or so before you start will make the job easier. You can grate the whole block, pop it back into the freezer, tightly covered, then dip into as you wish.Serves 8. Ready in 4 hoursFor the granita:rhubarb700gwater500mlcaster sugar125gblood oranges3, small and juicyFor the vanilla cream:mascarpone250gdouble cream125mlvanilla paste or extract1 tspRemove and discard the leaves and white ends of the rhubarb. Cut each stalk into short lengths about the size of a wine cork, then put in a stainless-steel or enamelled saucepan. Pour in the water and add the caster sugar.Finely grate the zest from 1 orange, taking care not to remove any white pith, and add to the rhubarb. Squeeze the juice from the oranges and add to the rhubarb.Bring the rhubarb to the boil, then lower the heat and leave to simmer for 5 or 6 minutes, until the sugar has dissolved and the rhubarb has softened.Place a large sieve over a wide jug or bowl, spoon in the rhubarb and its juice and leave to drain. Pour the juice into a plastic freezer container, cover with a lid and freeze for 4 hours, or until firm. Refrigerate the rhubarb from the sieve.For the vanilla cream, whip the cream until it sits in soft mounds. (Don’t be tempted to beat until stiff.) Gently stir in the mascarpone and vanilla paste.Put the chilled rhubarb in a food processor or blender and process to a purée. Pour into a bowl.Once the granita is frozen, scratch the surface firmly with the tines of a fork, pulling up furrows of ice crystals. Spoon the purée into serving dishes, then add heaps of the granita on top along with spoonfuls of vanilla cream.Blood orange and pistachio cakeView image in fullscreenBeacon of light: blood orange and pistachio cake.Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin/The ObserverIf you cut the cake into squares, you should get nine servings. I often use a round biscuit cutter, which I find more pleasing than a straight-edged block of cake. The leftovers from cutting into rounds make good snacking, or freeze them for a trifle later. The cake will keep for a couple of days in an air-tight container.Serves 6. Ready in 1 hourFor the cake:butter225ggolden caster sugar225gblood orange1lemon1self-raising flour110gground almonds60gpistachios60geggs3, largeFor the syrup:granulated or caster sugar100glemon1, largeblood orange1orange flower water1 tspTo serve:blood orange1crystallised orange1, to decorate (optional)You will need a square cake tin 20-22cm in diameter, lined with baking parchment. Heat the oven to 180C/gas mark 4.Using a food mixer, beat the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Finely grate the orange and lemon, taking care not to include any of the bitter white pith. Mix together the flour and ground almonds. Grind the pistachios to a powder, but less finely than commercial ground almonds; they should be a little nubbly.Break the eggs into a bowl and beat with a fork. With the beater turning, slowly introduce the eggs to the butter and sugar. Should the mixture curdle even slightly, add a little of the flour. Mix in the remaining flour and nuts. Transfer the mixture to the lined tin, lightly smoothing the surface. Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes till springy to the touch.To make the syrup, squeeze the juice of the lemon and orange into a small saucepan, add the sugar, then bring to the boil. Let the mixture cook for a couple of minutes until slightly syrupy, then remove from the heat and stir in the orange flower water. Using a metal skewer, pierce about 20 holes in the surface of the cake, then spoon the citrus syrup over. Leave to cool then use a round cookie cutter to make 6 discs of cake.Carefully remove them from the paper with a palette knife on to dishes or plates.Remove the peel from the blood orange and slice the fruit thinly. Place a couple of slices on the side of each cake and, if you wish, garnish with a slice of crystallised orange on each.Follow Nigel on Instagram@NigelSlaterExplore more on these topicsFruitNigel Slater recipesFoodDessertrecipesShareReuse this content"

In fact, Shamil has been (fondly) banned from using it by his cousin Kavi, with whom he co-foundedDishoom, the hugely successful group of Bombay-inspired restaurants, 15 years ago.But palimpsest is an apt word to describe Bombay – or Mumbai, as it is known internationally – the port city on India’s west coast, where multicultural influences eternally trickle in without erasing the layers of what came before. Two eras of imperial rule, two waves of Persian migration, a Hindu majority and a large Muslim community, people from every Indian state, language and ethnicity rubbing shoulders with one another, Maharatis, Gujeratis, Punjabis, Goans; 19th-century gothic architecture alongside art deco, neoclassical opposite mid-century, and the onward march of new development along every major road. And it is absolutely its own place, of itself: “Everything has coalesced here and become ‘Bombayified’,” says Shamil, as we wander around Colaba, the southernmost tip of the old city.In Mumbai, the port city on India’s west coast,  multicultural influences trickle in without erasing what came beforeFor the first time since Dishoom opened in 2010, the restaurant where “all Bombay’s communities jostle on one table” has introduced new dishes to its menu, and I’ve come to India with the team to see the palimpsest in its most edible form. “You can eat an Irani breakfast, Gujerati lunch and a Muslim dinner here” says Kavi, “and every single dish will be distinctly from Bombay.”It was all these elements of the city’s melting pot, and the stories which came with them, that inspired the birth of the first Dishoom, in London’s Covent Garden. Back then, says Kavi, “people thought of India in stereotypes: there were curry houses with their take on ‘Indian food’, a great tradition, but a very British one, or the lovely but not representative Michelin establishments. We felt there was something to say which was intrinsically Indian, but new to the UK: somewhere all-day, democratic, and which hinged on Bombay’s comfort food and stories.”View image in fullscreenA flower market in Mumbai’s Dadar West district.Photograph: Ram BalmurSince then, Dishoom has opened a further 12 restaurants, employs 1800 people and serves some 100,000 people a week. At a time when running a restaurant in London has never seemed more precarious, Dishoom is a wild and wonderful success story, and makes its name – Bollywood’s word for “kapow!” – particularly resonant. Dishoom has garnered devotion both on home soil and internationally; an 11 day pop-up in New York’s Meatpacking district last summer was a sell-out, with hungry wannabe diners queuing way past the High Line in hope of sitting down to their renowned black dahl or chicken ruby. Queues are par for the course, as are unlimited free cups of deliciously sweet, spiced milky chai to keep punters happy as they wait.“Seva, the Hindu word for ‘selfless service’, informs everything we do,” Kavi tells me, “I don’t care about how much bottomless chai is going to cost us: I care about how you go away feeling. You touch someone’s day with that chai, and that builds a culture around us.”Kavi comes to Bombay about five times a year, either to research food or furnishings for their new restaurants, or with the Dishoom workforce on “Bombay Bootcamp”, a trip earned after five years service at the company. In 2023, he brought 200 staff to stay in the Taj Mahal Palace hotel, an institution in Colaba, and to eat at many of the spots we visit: Mohammed Ali Road for Bombay’s Islamic street food, like chicken kathi rolls; K Rustom & Co near Marine Drive, for guava ice-cream sandwiches sprinkled with chilli and salt; andan evening of beer, hard liquor and peanut masala at the permit rooms in Bandra.Seva, the Hindu word for ‘selfless service’, informs everything we do. I care about how you go away feelingKavi Thakrar“It would be very easy to look at the bottom line in the P&L and think these trips are mad, but they are core to what we do,” says Kavi. “You can have an idea of how a business should work, but you need to have hospitality at your core. We do everything in a big-hearted way.”True to form, Kavi commits entirely to whatever he does – be it sleep (he has a slightly obsessive regime), exercise (he’s a 6am spinner), or eatingvada pau, the deep-fried, spiced potato patty sandwich, which comes stuffed with several chutneys and little nuggets of deep-fried batter on the side. He can put away double what anyone else can.There are 10 years between the cousins, who are often assumed to be brothers. They consider themselves a generation closer than they are, though, because they grew up in the same house in north London’s Barnet, with their grandparents, parents, siblings and other cousins. Their paternal grandfather, Rashmibhai, was twice a refugee – first from Gujerat to Uganda, where he traded in salt and corrugated iron, then in the 1970s, from Uganda, when Idi Amin expelled the Indian minority. He came to the UK where he founded a brand which would go on to become a household name, Tilda rice.In Dishoom’s early days, keen to forge their own path, Kavi admits that the pair were reticent about the family business, which was sold in 2014. Both worked for a time at Tilda, Kavi for several years in sourcing (he can still go granular on the subject of basmati clones), and both lived for a period in the US, Shamil for an MBA at Harvard, and Kavi in Washington D.C. where he worked for the World Bank.At the end of the noughties, Shamil was a disillusioned management consultant who’d had a brainwave: a restaurant which told stories about the city in which he’d spent so much time as a boy. The eldest grandchild, he often accompanied his grandparents to Bombay on Tilda research trips; Kavi, too, spent every school holiday with them there, and both the cousins remember vividly the likes of sweet, nuttymalai kulfion Chowpatty beach at dusk. They share genes and much experience, but the magic of Dishoom is, I’m sure, in their differences. As Shamil says, “we can compare notes, but those notes won’t even have a word in common.”View image in fullscreen‘We do everything in a big-hearted way’: Kavi (left) and Shamil Thakrar at Gables restaurant.Photograph: Ram BalmurShamil might love the word palimpsest because it is also a fitting description of his brain. While we are in Bombay, he describes his existential conversations with Chat GPT, how his favourite novel is Vikram Seth’s The Golden Gate (“it covers everything I ever cared about: Keats, The Doors, Tintin, Scrabble”) and reveals his deep knowledge of Indian history. “His mind is a treasure trove of information, and he’s brilliant at intertwining stories, which he diligently brings into our physical spaces,” says Kavi, “whereas my joy is in sharing and understanding the food – and editing it for a UK audience. He likes history, I like chilli cheese toast!”As we wander around old Bombay, Shamil points out the Parsi temples, built by these early settlers from Persia, in which a fire is always lit. We visit Bombay Green, headquarters of the city’s cotton bubble, where he describes some of the enterprising and often brutal characters who got rich here under the British East India Company; “Bombay has always been full of people on the make,” he says, citing cotton, commerce, opium and land reclamation as all formative to the city’s historic wealth. He talks about how, in the 1940s, India began as a secular state, and that now it is run by a group of hardline Hindu nationalists in the BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party).We walk to Oval Maidan, a massive public cricket green surrounded by the rounded pastel contours of art deco flats which face gloomy Victorian government buildings, like the Bombay High Court, its dark geometry softened by palm trees at the front. “There is so much of Britain strewn around Bombay,” he muses, “statues of men with moustaches, gothic architecture. We thought it was time to do the opposite: to take Bombay and strew it around London.”View image in fullscreenDishoom’s restaurant in London’s King’s Cross, where the Victorian building tells the story of India’s independence.Photograph: Ashok Saxena/AlamyWith this in mind, each Dishoom restaurant has a different theme pertaining to Bombay, around which Shamil writes a story complete with vivid characters. At King’s Cross, inside a Victorian industrial building on Granary Square, it is Indian independence; in Kensington, Bombay jazz; pirates at the Permit Rooms (in Brighton, Cambridge and Oxford); a financial swindler in Canary Wharf. The menu might be the same across most sites, but the decor never is, each poster or photograph, bentwood chair or lamp in some way speaking to the story of that specific restaurant. Shamil remembers how his father, Rashmi, said that “for something to truly succeed, it has to have poetry at its heart”, and is determined that, as Dishoom continues to grow, it keeps the depth of these stories.Shamil’s commitment to storytelling initially made him resistant to Dishoom doing home delivery. But when the pandemic struck, the business pivoted almost overnight, bringing customers their Bombay comfort food at home, right when they needed it most – and, crucially, keeping their staff engaged. They now have 12 delivery kitchens which bring in 15% of the business, and in November,a reportby Deliveroo revealed Dishoom’s chicken ruby to be the 12th most ordered item in the UK. It seems delivery is a more natural brand extension than Shamil first thought. “It does stay true to seva,” says Kavi, “connecting to communities, albeit in their home environments.”Each Dishoom restaurant has a different theme pertaining to Bombay, around which Shamil writes a storyAlso true to seva is Dishoom’s “Meal for a Meal”, charitable program: for every meal sold at one of their restaurants, they donate one to Magic Breakfast in the UK, orAkshaya Patrain India, a charity which feeds children at schools in 12 states across the country. We visited one in Thane, just outside Bombay, and while serving chana dahl and rice to a hundred or so primary school kids, Shamil tells me that the endeavour is about more than just nutrition; that it quietly tackles societal misogyny. “People are more likely to send their daughters to school, rather than make them work, if they know they will be fed there,” he says.What did the Thakrars’ own community think about them opening Dishoom, I wonder? “Our parents’ friends thought we were mad,” says Shamil, “it was the anti-immigration story to them.” For Indians of a particular generation and class, he explains, it would have seemed bizarre for two public-school educated boys from a successful family to open a restaurant. “I think our grandparents, who were strict Hindus, were a bit shocked by all the meat and fish on our menu,” he continues, acknowledging that while the likes of sheekh kebab (marinated and grilled minced lamb), Goan monkfish curry andpau bhaji(buttery-spicy mashed vegetables with home-made buns) wouldn’t share a table in Bombay, they do share a city of origin. Even the fish curry, originally from Goa, has been “Bombayified”, as we see at Gable’s restaurant in Colaba, where three generations of the Fernandes family have served the likes of fish in a red hot spicyrecheadomarinade, or prawns fried in semolina batter. Likewise, pau (or pav), the white pillowy buns we see everywhere, and which are used in all manner of dishes, originated with Portuguese imperialists (pãomeaning ‘bread’), but have become Bombay’s own.View image in fullscreenThe ‘Bombayified’ Goan fish curry at The Gables restaurant in Colaba.Photograph: Ram BalmurOne of the earliest inspirations for Dishoom was the city’s Irani cafes, something of an institution in Bombay. Clammy after a dawn visit to the fish market at Sassoon Docks, we visited one – Olympia coffee house – for a restorative breakfast of eggbhurjee(scrambled with green chilli and onion) andbrun maska– a tutti-frutti-flecked pauspread with butter then dipped in chai. Started by a later wave of Persian migrants who came to Bombay some 200 years ago, and usually occupying the corner sites which superstition precluded Hindu business owners taking, “Irani cafes were our jumping-off point”, says Kavi, “because they are all-day, have a democratic ethos, and some of the dishes make up the backbone of Dishoom’s menu”.But they are now a dying breed; in the 1960s, there were many hundreds in Bombay, now there are only around 30. “Kids want frappuccino and WiFi,” says Kavi, surveying the interior of beautifully preserved Café dela Paix over a cup of Persian-style, dried-mint-infused chai. Hardwood panels, bevelled mirrors and signs prohibiting the likes of smoking and fighting – typical of Irani cafés – share space with the onward march of Westernisation: a Pepsi fridge and plastic tubs of sweets. Too little, too late, I fear.On our last night, we bar hop around Bandra, a bohemian, middle-class neighbourhood to the north of the city. Over plates ofbheland bottles of Kingfisher, we reflect on how Bombay’s cosmopolitanism is at odds with, says Shamil, “extreme inequalities and Hindification”. While here, we have seen abject poverty alongside gross wealth, like the luxury skyscraper that is theAmbanifamily home. “We definitely look at Bombay with rose-tinted spectacles,” Shamil goes on, “it’s a consciously nostalgic, romantic relationship with the place.”When we arrived here, I assumed Mumbai to be the correct name for the city in its post-imperial chapter, but its nationalist connotations were quickly explained to me. I remark that while I might have left London for Mumbai, it is from the Thakrars’ Bombay, a palimpsest of open-doors and democratic street snacks, that I will return.View image in fullscreen‘A consciously nostalgic, romantic relationship with the place’: sunset at Chowpatty Beach.Photograph: Ram BalmurKavi Thakrar’s Bombay bitesFor breakfast of champions:Olympia Coffee House forkeema per eedu(minced mutton with a fried egg on top), or egg bhurjee (spiced scrambled egg), washed down with copious chai, for a 100% Bombay Irani cafe experience.Olympia Coffee House, Rahim Mansion 1, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Colaba.For puris all day:Pancham Puriwala, where you can watch giant, golden, puffy puris being fried before sitting down to – curried chickpeas, sweet semolina, pickles and a great big puri.Pancham Puriwala, 10 Perin Nariman St, Borabazar Precinct, Ballard Estate, Fort.For ice-cream: K Rustom & Co, this institution of an ice-cream parlour is run by two Parsi women. You come for ice-cream sandwiches, with original flavours in between thin wafers. “Everyone’s favourite is the guava with chilli and salt.

The ambience is divey, the food divine – chilli cheese toast, chicken lollipops, chaat or bhel to accompany cold beers and hard liquor.Explore more on these topicsIndian food and drinkThe ObserverFood and drinkRestaurantsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Snacks and small plates £5-£14, large plates £18-£29, desserts £9, wines from £36Don’t Tell Dad in London’s Queen’s Park is a self-declared neighbourhood restaurant in a knowingly dishevelled neighbourhood. It sits on a part-cobbled, mews-style lane which was once home to stable blocks and very much looks like it. If you want to snoop at the red-rust frontage on Google Street View, however, you can’t. It’s a private street, through which Google’s cars may never pass. Lonsdale Road, once the property of the Church Commissioners, is now owned by a single landlord, Feldberg Capital, which is gently turning it into an ever-so-random-on-purpose leisure destination.Josh Katz’s Middle Eastern-influenced grill restaurant Carmel is here, as is the Australian-inspiredMilk Beachand an outpost ofPizza Pilgrims, alongside a micro-brewery, a yoga studio, co-working spaces and a macrobiotic deli where they crochet their own fermented sea-vegetables. Perhaps I made the last one up.Anywhere which tops a heap of oxtail with fried bread crumbs, puts it on a crumpet and calls it a snack, is fine by meThis reads like an eye-roll at the tastes of the infuriating, lotus-eating middle classes and the sort of businesses which pander to them. As I’m one of those infuriating people, I’m basically rolling my eyes at myself. Lonsdale Road has a lovely, rackety Copenhagen vibe and I would be thrilled if it were part of my neighbourhood. By day, Don’t Tell Dad is a bakery serving brown butter hazelnut croissant, and pear and whisky Danish, by head baker Keren Sternberg, formerly of Layla. By night it is a restaurant serving many other things. It fits in here perfectly.View image in fullscreen‘It takes experience to cook a wild duck like this’: mallard.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverThe restaurant was founded by local Daniel Land, the former banker behind quick-service pasta chainCoco di Mama, and is named in memory of his sister Lesley, who died suddenly not long ago. As a child, Lesley was always good for skulduggery of which their parents should know nothing. She came up with plans and urged her brother not to tell dad. It’s a sweet back story to a restaurant of innocent if serious pleasures; the kind only the most puritanical of fathers could find it in themselves to disapprove of. Anywhere which braises oxtail down until it is a sticky mess of uber-gravy-slicked meaty threads, tops a heap of it with dripping-fried breadcrumbs, and then puts all of that on a small crumpet and calls it a snack, is fine by me.View image in fullscreen‘A sticky mess’: oxtail crumpet.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverA few years ago, perhaps pre-Covid, a restaurant like this in London would most likely have been found in what my kids call Central and I call the West End. (Sidebar: when did this change? How dare the young people come up with a name which makes so much more sense?) But the gravitational pull of the capital has shifted, from the middle to a little further out. Why drag into town if it can be avoided? It has the feel of somewhere you might stumble into and then out of again. There’s an open kitchen, soft lighting, cosy banquettes and booths, and a beautiful tiled floor, all of it picking up the colours from outside, as if bathing you in the glow of a guttering hearth. The orange ducted ceiling is, like the music, low (gentle club beats in the dining room; showtunes by the loos). Try to get a table, rather than a seat at a counter. The curve-backed stools look comfortable, but aren’t quite. No worries. An oxtail crumpet will quickly soothe the wriggling.View image in fullscreen‘Impressively deep-filled’: crab tart.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverHead chef Luke Frankie, formerly of Noble Rot and the Drapers Arms, has written a menu I’m going to call Cosmopolitan English: these are dishes which are both rooted very much in the here, but also reference over there. Among the small plates there’s an impressively deep-filled crab tart of white and brown meat in a thin, flaky pastry shell, spun through with green herbs, which tastes like something straight out of Jane Grigson’s cookbookEnglishFood. But there is also a shuddering cairn of fritto misto which, with its inflated, glowing batter, is more Tokyo tempura than Italian antipasto. This one is announced as a fritto misto of winter vegetables, so you can feel good about your life choices, while celebrating the delicate art of deep-fat frying. There may have been slivers of squash and torn cabbage leaves hiding under the carapace. Who cares? It comes dribbled with a little honey, and dusted with chilli flakes. Abandon cutlery. This is work for fingers.View image in fullscreenMonkfish.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverAs a foil against the fried goods, order the panzanella of impeccable, taut-skinned tomatoes with torn pieces of their own dense sourdough to soak up the dressing, topped with snowy fleshed fillets of fried sardine. It’s a summer afternoon on the beach, here amid a London winter. After which Don’t Tell Dad stops being one of those small-plates restaurants you’ve started whining to your tolerant friends about, and just serves up plates of dinner. A piece of sea bass, cooked so the bronze sear has edged deeper into the fillet, lies on a textured purée of nutty Jerusalem artichokes.View image in fullscreen‘Impeccable, taut-skinned tomatoes’: panzanella.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverOr there’s what amounts to the whole of a thumping mallard, complete with shot, for an extremely keen £28: both legs, slow-cooked then crisped, and both breasts, spiced, roasted and rested. Cooking wild duck like this isn’t something to which you can turn your hand. It takes experience to make sure it doesn’t tense up as it cooks, like aMastermindcontestant in the black chair. The skin is dark and rendered, and there’s a sweet carrot and date purée which is the ideal foil to the gamey meat. For salt there are bacon lardons. For greens there’s kale. Like the crab tart, there is something very English about it, a pleasing whiff of damp field and meadow under glowering skies.View image in fullscreen‘Baked to order’: madeleines.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverFor dessert they offer madeleines. Make sure to leave time because, just as at St John where I first came across this proposition, they will be baked to order. I watch the tray being slipped into the oven. They arrive 10 minutes later, hot and crisp-edged, with a little orange cream to drag them through. The wine list by Bert Blaize, author of the bookWhich Wine When, is concise, big on bottles by small producers and has a good choice by the glass and 500ml carafe. Have one each. Daniel Land, responsible for feeding a lot of City workers, has talked effusively about now wanting to create something for where he lives: an adaptable space that changes through the day. The result may not always be cheap. It may feel like a neighbourhood restaurant for well-heeled neighbours. But that doesn’t change the fact that it’s a class act. Trust me, this is one you can mention to your dad, and anyone else for that matter.News bitesThe big news in the London restaurant world this week is the announcement that cult Leytonstone Thai restaurant Singburi will end its recent sabbatical by reopening in Shoreditch. The new venture, which has been described as Singburi 2.0, is a joint enterprise by head chef Sirichai Kularbwong (son of the original founders who have now retired), Nick Molyviatis of Kiln and Oma, and Alexander Gkikas of Catalyst. The new incarnation will open later in the spring.Meanwhile Shaun Moffat, formerly of Manteca in Shoreditch, and more recently of the Edinburgh Castle in Manchester’s Ancoats and then Maya, is staying in the city to open a restaurant called Winsome on Princess Street. It will, he says, serve ‘thoughtful British cooking’. He’ll be joined in the business by Owain Williams, one of the team behind Liverpool’s Belzan and more recently Medlock Canteen.The Midland Grand Dining Room at the St Pancras Renaissance Hotel, formerly the Gilbert Scott, is being taken over by Victor Garvey of Sola in Soho. ‘A dining room of this stature deserves a menu that matches its grandeur,’ Garvey has said, describing his plans for the room as ‘Old world, new ideas, to honour the foundations of classical French cuisine while embracing modernity.’ The opening menu includes tuna with white peach, duck with boudin noir and calvados apples, and guinea fowl with Armagnac prunes. Three courses will cost £75 and it opens on 25 February (midlandgranddiningroom.com).Email Jay at jay.rayner@observer.co.uk or follow him on Instagram@jayrayner1Explore more on these topicsRestaurantsJay Rayner on restaurantsFoodreviewsShareReuse this content"

There’s far more to southern hemisphere wines than thatDavid WilliamsSun 16 Feb 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 16 Feb 2025 04.14 ESTShareNeudorf Rosie’s Block Moutere Chardonnay, Nelson, New Zealand 2022 (from £34.99,tauruswines.co.uk;bowlandforestvintners.co.uk;thefinewinecompany.co.uk)If you asked wine-drinkers in Britain to pick a red and a white grape variety to represent each of Australia and New Zealand, I reckon most would plump for chardonnay and shiraz for the Aussies, and sauvignon blanc and pinot noir for the Kiwis. But there are plenty of winemakers on either side of the Tasman Sea who make fantastic wines from the neighbouring country’s specialities – a fact that was confirmed at a tasting in London recently in which 10 examples of each of those big four varieties, five from New Zealand and five Australian, were lined up for comparison. Standout wines for me were evenly spread across the two countries, and included the pure, fluent Seifried Estate Aotea Nelson Sauvignon Blanc 2023 (£17.75,farehamwinecellar.co.uk) and the luminous peach and crème-fraiche savoury complexity of Neudorf chardonnay from New Zealand; and, from Australia, the mouthwateringly taut, clean lines of Ministry of Clouds Adelaide Hills Chardonnay 2023 (£39.95,vincognito.co.uk) and the tranquil soft red fruit of Mac Forbes Yarra Valley Pinot Noir 2023 (£28.95,fieldandfawcett.co.uk).Agricola Ebenezer Syrah, Barossa Valley, Australia 2023 (£70,swig.co.uk)The comparative tasting was just one feature of an event that illustrated the new spirit of cooperation between the New Zealand and Australian wine industries in the UK: for years each had hosted their own large-scale tasting for the trade in January, but this year brought dozens of importers and producers representing each country under one roof. A sign of just how hard things are getting for exporters to the UK amid the mounting costs of spiralling post-Brexit red tape, and ever-more complex and expensive duty regulations? Perhaps. But it also made for a much more compelling (and busy) event, with some outstanding wines dotted among the inevitable also-rans. At the top of my list the next time I’m planning a special occasion, are the wines of the Barossa Valley producer Callum Powell. Powell, who is steeped in Barossa wine culture as the son of the founder of the excellent Torbreck and who spent time working at the top Rhône Valley producer JL Chave, makes a handful of tiny-production wines from very old vines, among them the enchantingly, endlessly fragrant, elegant, rosehip-tangy Ebenezer Syrah.Vasse Felix Classic Shiraz, Margaret River, Australia 2023 (£12.50, Tesco)Of course, you don’t need to spend a fortune to find good and characterful wine from either New Zealand or Australia – although, like most countries these days, the quality-value sweet-spot does tend to be in the £10 to £20 range (exceptions such as Aldi’s darkly spicy Specially Selected Australian Shiraz 2022 at £6.99 notwithstanding). Antipodean wines that hit that spot that I’ve tried recently include the plump, juicy but freshly balanced shiraz from Western Australia’s Vasse Felix; Yealands Estate Grüner Veltliner Reserve, Awatere Valley, Marlborough 2023 (£12.99, Waitrose), a bright, gently herbal and spicy, lime-citrussy New Zealand version of Grüner that shows how the country’s winemakers are increasingly getting the hang of Austria’s signature white grape variety; the gently beetroot-earthy, strawberry-juicy, light, fresh red of Kumeu River Village Auckland Pinot Noir 2023 (£12.50,thewinesociety.com); and the gracious but vivaciously citrussy, subtly sweet but refreshing Pegasus Bay Riesling, North Canterbury 2020 (£19.50, Waitrose).Explore more on these topicsWineDavid Williams's wines of the weekFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"
