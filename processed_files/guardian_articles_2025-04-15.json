Those were among thekey findings of the Strong-HF trialinvolving 87 hospitals in 14 countries.About 1 million people in the UK have heart failure, which is incurable. It means that the heart can no longer pump blood around the body effectively and leaves sufferers breathless and tired.St George’s hospital in London and Morriston hospital in Swansea have begun treating patients with the innovative method, which those involved say “is a total gamechanger” for the condition.Clinical staff likened the approach – known as “rapid titration” – to how cancer patients are given a full dose of chemotherapy medication from the start of their treatment to improve their chances of recovery.“Heart failure is a silent killer, so this new way of treating patients is a total gamechanger that I never thought I’d see in my lifetime. It will save many lives and bring hope to so many families,” said Matthew Sunter, the lead heart failure nurse at St George’s.“In days gone by, we would start patients on a very low dose and increase it by very small doses. It could take nine to 12 months to reach the optimal dose.“Strong-HF has allowed us to think completely differently. For the first time ever, we offer patients a review one week after discharge and we can catch them before they get sick enough to need to come back into hospital.“And we can get them on to the recommended therapy for their heart failure within two to three weeks instead of nine to 12 months.”The global trial showed that “once we establish patients on those drugs, we reduce their chance of dying by 62% and their chances of rehospitalisation for heart failure by 30%. That is huge and means we can prevent avoidable deaths while easing the pressures on our hospital,” Sunter added.Prof Simon Roy,NHSEngland’s national clinical director for heart disease, said: “This treatment could transform the health outlook for thousands of people affected by heart failure. It is yet another example of how the NHS is delivering on its commitment to ensure patients have access to the latest and most effective treatments to help improve their quality of life.”St George’s has used the approach with 14 patients who have been taken to hospital with heart failure and plans to use it with 100 more such cases a year. Morriston plans to treat 500 people from Swansea and Neath Port Talbot that way this year.Dr Parin Shah, a consultant cardiologist at Morriston specialising in heart failure, said the drugs patients receive are so strong that they will have their blood pressure and kidney function checked before joiningtheir trial to assess their suitability.“Not everyone will be eligible for this. Some people may not be able to tolerate such intensive treatment. We knew it would suit relatively few people, but it would benefit them considerably,” Shah said.Emily McGrath, a senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said the treatment “looks hugely promising”.The government has announced its aim to reduce avoidable deaths caused by Britain’s biggest killers, such as heart disease, stroke, cancer and diabetes.A Department ofHealthand Social Care spokesperson said: “We commend the brilliant team at St George’s for this extraordinary breakthrough which showcases that the NHS is at the forefront of global medical innovation.”Explore more on these topicsHeart diseaseHealthMedical researchDrugsNHSnewsShareReuse this content"

These fixed daily charges, which also include the cost of fitting smart meters and other policy costs, are applied to energy bills whether you use any energy or not.This means cash-strapped households who are unable to heat their homes still bear the full brunt of covering energy network costs. Vulnerable consumers who are often high users of energy – for medical or health needs – also end up paying above the odds to maintain the grid.The standing charge has ballooned in recent years, and the cost could climb further as the UK prepares to invest heavily in upgrading its electricity grids to meet the government’s goal ofcreating a clean energy system by 2030. The charge averaged £182.27 a year five years ago and has climbed to an average of £334.07 a year – or nearly a fifth of the average annual energy bill.The consumer champion Martin Lewis has described the charges as “a moral hazard, disincentivising lower users from cutting their bills”, saying they are “by far the biggest single subject of complaint I get from the public about energy bills”.The network costs were initially moved into the standing charges in 2022 and 2023 so that affluent households who could afford to fit their own solar panels, and thus use less energy from the grid, would still pay their share of its maintenance.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, diplomatic efforts have often been sidelined by other crises, including the wars in Ukraine and Gaza.Two years to the day sincefighting erupted in Khartoumbetween the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, hundreds of people were feared to have died inRSF attacks on refugee campsin the western Darfur region in the latest apparent atrocity of a war marked by its brutality and wide-scale humanitarian impact.Sudan’s outsider: how a general fell out with the army and plunged the country into warRead moreThe consequences for Sudan’s 51 million people have been devastating. Tens of thousands are reportedly dead. Hundreds of thousandsface famine. Almost 13 million people have been displaced, 4 million of those to neighbouring countries.“Sudan is now worse off than ever before,” said Elise Nalbandian, Oxfam’s regional advocacy manager. “The largest humanitarian crisis, largest displacement crisis, largest hunger crisis … It’s breaking all sorts of wrong records.”There were “massive-scale” violations of international humanitarian law in the conflict, said Daniel O’Malley, the head of the International Committee of the Red Cross delegation in Sudan. “All of the civilian population, irrespective of where they are in the country, have basically been trapped between one, two or more parties. And they have been bearing the brunt of everything. The sheer numbers are just mind-boggling.”map of Sudan indicating areas of occupation by different forcesLast month, Sudan’s military recaptured thehighly symbolic presidential palacein Khartoum and it has retaken most of the capital. But in much of the country, the conflict rages on. Sources cited by the UN reported that more than 400 people had been killed in recent attacks by the RSF in Darfur, where the group is trying to seize El Fasher, the last state capital in the region not under its control.Since late last week, the RSF has launched ground and aerial assaults on El Fasher itself and the nearby Zamzam and Abu Shouk displacement camps. A UN spokesperson told Agence France-Presse that the UN’s rights office had verified 148 killings and received reports from “credible sources” that the total number of dead exceeded 400.Reuters reported that data from the UN’s International Organization forMigrationsuggested that up to 400,000 people had been displaced from the Zamzam camp alone since the weekend.In a statement the UN rights chief, Volker Türk, said the “large-scale attacks … made starkly clear the cost of inaction by the international community, despite my repeated warnings of heightened risk for civilians in the area”.He added: “The attacks have exacerbated an already dire protection and humanitarian crisis in a city that has endured a devastating RSF siege since May last year.”View image in fullscreenA video shared by the group North Darfur Observatory for Human Rights is said to show people fleeing the Zamzam camp with their belongings strapped to camels and donkeys.Photograph: X | @NorthDarfu24El Fasher is one of several areas of Darfur where a famine, affecting about 637,000 people, has been declared. Almost half the 50-million population of Sudan – 24.6 million people – do not have enough food.Leni Kinzli, the World Food Programme’s head of communications for Sudan, said the other conflicts, as well as a lack of access for journalists, and Sudan’s relative international isolation since the days of the regime of the ousted dictator Omar al-Bashir all meant Sudan was not getting the attention it needed.“We don’t see the level of international attention on Sudan as we do for other crises,” she said. “There should not be a competition between crises. But unfortunately we’re seeing with everything going on in the world, other conflicts, other humanitarian crises and other things making headlines, that unfortunately Sudan is – I wouldn’t even call it forgotten – it’s ignored.”map depicting movement of refugees and areas where they are concentratedThe origins of the war can be traced to late 2018, when popular protests broke out against the Sudanese dictator Bashir. Sudan’s army leader, Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, allied with the RSF chief,Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, a former warlord known as Hemedti, to oust Bashir in a coup in April 2019.Atrocities mount daily. Promised aid does not arrive. Why has the west turned its back on Sudan?Read moreThey then allied again in 2021 to depose a civilian government meant to transition Sudan to a democracy. However, Hemedti had long coveted ultimate power for himself, and the friction between the two spiralled into full-on war less than two years later.The RSF, a paramilitary force that grew out of the Janjaweed Arab militiasaccused of committing genocidein the Darfur region in the mid-2000s, made rapid gains in the first weeks and months, as the fighting spread beyond Khartoum.3:22Khartoum before and after: footage shows destruction wreaked by war in Sudan – videoIn Darfur thousands of people died in the first year of the war, in well-documented attacks by the RSF and allied militias on non-Arab Masalit and other ethnic groups. Masalit refugees who had fled west to Chad recounted women and girls beingtargeted for gang rapesand boys shot in the street. Militia fighters said they wouldforce women to have “Arab babies”, according to a UN report released in November 2024.The RSF and the army have both been accused of committing war crimes in the course of the conflict.In January of this year the USformally declared that the RSF had committed genocide, marking the second time in less than 30 years that genocide had been perpetrated in Sudan.The United Arab Emirates has been accused of fuelling the conflict by arming the RSF.Emirati passports allegedly foundon the battlefield last year point to potential covert boots on the ground.

It came to define his time as the manager of Paris Saint-Germain, the crazy Champions League defeat to Luis Enrique’s Barcelona in 2017 after his team had held a 4-0 first-leg lead in the last 16. Barcelona would end up needing three goals with 88 minutes of the second leg gone at the Camp Nou. They got them fora 6-5 ­aggregate win.On an epic night in the West Midlands, the roles were reversed; Emery the hunter with Aston Villa, Luis Enrique the hunted at PSG. It so nearly produced the ultimate moment of catharsis for Emery. His team were magnificent, absorbing the body blows of two concessions inside the opening half-hour that put PSG 5-1 up on aggregate and refusing to believe that this showpieceChampions Leaguequarter-final was beyond them.Barcelona sneak through after Serhou Guirassy’s treble gives Dortmund hopeRead moreVilla needed four to force extra time. When Youri Tielemans got the first on 34 minutes, it was easy to wonder whether it changed something inside of them. The truth was it did not because Villa were always resolved to leave everything on the pitch. The club’s most recent appearance in Europe’s elite competition had been in 1982-83. It had already been a campaign to remember. What happened in the second half was something else.Villa showed cut and thrust to go with their conviction and during a golden period, they got two further goals back and threatened the one to turn everything on its head, not least the notion that PSG are Europe’s best team at present, the favourites for the competition they have chased so hard for so long.With Marcus Rashford exploding to life, John McGinn and Ezri Konsa were the scorers and the goals were far from isolated thrusts. It was bedlam inside Villa Park, everybody in claret and blue willing the equaliser, feeling it was coming.What a story it would have been if Marco Asensio, who ison loan from PSGand came on as a substitute, had not been denied by Gianluigi Donnarumma in a one-on-one. Or if Konsa had not blown a header from a whipped Rashford free-kick.PSG did stabilise up to a point after that, Emiliano Martínez having to make three decent blocks to keep them out on the break. But Villa sensed there would be another chance and it came in stoppage time when another substitute, Ian Maatsen, caught a volley and watched Willian Pacho block from in front of the line. It was unclear whether Donnarumma would have got across. Pacho had seen Villa’s first two goals deflect in off him. This was a moment of redemption and how PSG ­celebrated with him. Their quest for a first Champions League title remains alive. Just.View image in fullscreenEzri Konsa wheels away in celebration after firing home Aston Villa’s third goal against PSG.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe optimism had run riot within the home supporters at kick-off time, Prince William among the believers in the stands. It did not matter that most neutrals considered PSG to have one foot in the semi-finals afterNuno Mendes’s late goalfor 3-1 in the first leg, the crowning moment of a ­dominant team performance.The atmosphere pulsed and Villa brought the storm, PSG indebted to Achraf Hakimi for the goal that helped them to settle. Marquinhos dispossessed Rashford and the visitors moved incisively from right to left and then up the flank through Bradley Barcola. His low cross caused a mix-up between Pau Torres and Martínez, who could only push the ball to Hakimi.PSG’s second also spoke to Luis Enrique’s spirit of adventure because once again it was a full-back applying the final brushstrokes to a counterattacking masterpiece. PSG won the ball inside their own area and it was a blur of blue as they moved upfield, Hakimi prominent before Ousmane Dembélé went square to Mendes. The finish was lovely; a dart away from Matty Cash and a curler that kissed a post on its way in.Villa had flickered at 1-0. Torres blasted too close to Donnarumma, while Morgan Rogers took a pass from Tielemans and curled just wide. They deserved the Tielemans goal, which was teed up by McGinn’s reverse pass after an excellent move involving Rashford.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Hard but fair, said the referee José María Sánchez. No penalty. Hakimi kicked up and out at McGinn as the pair tangled on the ground and he was lucky not to make contact. Sánchez became a target for the Villa fans. PSG might have had another before the interval only for Fabián Ruiz to scuff at Martínez when well placed.Emery challenges Aston Villa to return to Champions League ‘quickly’ after exitRead moreVilla continued to bring the intensity, to play their football. And the crowd stayed with them. How they stayed with them. Rashford had extended Donnarumma in the 51st minute before McGinn picked up the ball inside his own half and kept running, the PSG defenders backing off. So he shot, the ball looping over Donnarumma.Rashford was a man on a mission. He had cut inside to work ­Donnarumma with a vicious shot when he nutmegged Ruiz and swerved away from Vitinha before pulling back for Konsa, who curled home. Villa went for the jugular. Tielemans almost scored with a header, Donnarumma clawing over.Torres could not react in time to direct a header of his own.

The governmenttook controlof the plant after finding out its Chinese owner, Jingye, was attempting to sell the supplies and hasten the closure of the furnaces.“What we need for the long-term future ofBritish Steelis that private sector partner to work with us as a government on a transformation programme,” Reynolds said.“That might be new technology, new facilities, that might have a different employment footprint. The staff here absolutely know that, they know they need a long-term future.”He added: “These blast furnaces have given this country nearly a century of service in one case, so they know they need the future, and that might be a different model, different technology. What they didn’t want was the unplanned, uncontrolled shutdown of the blast furnaces with thousands of job losses and no plan in place for the future.“And by what we’ve been able to do, working with the brilliant team here at British Steel, is secure the possibility of that better future – and I for one am confident that we’ve made the right decision to support the people here.”Reynolds made his comments even as the GMB union called for an end to the formal redundancy programme, which British Steel began last year. Those planscould have meantthe closure of both blast furnaces and more than half of the site’s 3,500 workers losing their jobs.Charlotte Brumpton-Childs, national officer at GMB, said: “We are expecting the immediate threat of redundancies to be taken off the table, and we are looking to work with the secretary of state on planning the longer-term future for Scunthorpe and the steel making there.”Reynolds has the task both of securing immediate supplies to keep the furnaces running and looking for a longer-term bidder for the Scunthorpe site. Ministers want to find a private sector company to help the government pay for a new electric furnace at the plant, which forms the central part of British Steel’s £1.25bn decarbonisation plan.Reynolds said over the weekend he would not “bring a Chinese company into our steel sector” again, but on Tuesday he appeared to change his mind and refused to rule out the possibility that a Chinese company could take over the site once more.“I think you would look at a Chinese firm in a different way but I’m really keen to stress the action we’ve taken here was to step in, because it was one specific company that I thought wasn’t acting in the UK’s national interest, and we had to take the action we did,” he said.Reynolds’ change of tone comes amid a broader push by the UK government to limit the political fallout from the crisis surrounding British Steel.Over the weekend, the business secretary refused to rule out the possibility that Jingye’s actions might have been part of a deliberate act of sabotage to undermine the British steel industry. But by Monday, officials and ministers were insisting that was not the case, saying they believed the company had been acting purely out of commercial considerations.The government’s push to secure Chinese investment in British infrastructure has begun to alarm some senior figures within Labour.Liam Byrne, the chair of the business select committee,told the Guardianthis week: “We must now be fiercely vigilant about just who is granted the keys to the industries and infrastructure that keep our nation moving.”Explore more on these topicsBritish SteelSteel industryJonathan ReynoldsTrade unionsJob lossesnewsShareReuse this content"

Just over 6.5% of participants had a slow walking pace, 53% had an average walking pace and 41% had a brisk walking pace.Tracking these individuals for an average of 13 years showed that 36,574 participants (9%) developed some form of heart rhythm abnormality.After accounting for background demographic and lifestyle factors, an average or brisk walking pace was associated with, respectively, a 35% and 43% lower risk of all heart rhythm abnormalities compared with a slow walking pace.These higher walking speeds were also associated with lower risks of atrial fibrillation and other cardiac arrhythmias.While the amount of time spent walking at a slow pace was not associated with the risk of developing heart rhythm abnormalities, more time spent walking at an average or brisk pace was associated with a 27% lower risk.Overall, around 36% of the association between walking pace and all heart rhythm abnormalities was influenced by metabolic and inflammatory factors.Demographic and lifestyle factors accounted for by the study included that participants reporting a faster walking pace were more likely to be men and tended to live in less deprived areas and have healthier lifestyles.Atrial fibrillation is a condition where the heart’s upper chambers beat irregularly and too fast, while ventricular arrhythmias occur when an abnormal heart rhythm starts in the lower chambers.Heart rhythm problems can increase the risk of stroke, heart failure and cardiac arrest if left untreated. They can occur when there is a problem with the electrical system that makes the heart beat.The researchers noted that the study was observational, meaning that no firm conclusions could be drawn on whether walking at a brisk pace was a direct cause of a lower risk of heart rhythm abnormalities.The study was also limited by the fact the participants were self reported and did not reflect a broad spectrum of ages and ethnic backgrounds. The average age was 55, 55% were women and 97% were white.The researchers, led by Prof Jill Pell of the University of Glasgow, said: “This study is the first to explore the pathways underpinning the association between walking pace and arrhythmias, and to provide evidence that metabolic and inflammatory factors may have a role: walking faster decreased the risk of obesity and inflammation, which, in turn, reduced the risk of arrhythmia.“This finding is biologically plausible because cumulative epidemiological studies have shown that walking pace is inversely associated with metabolic factors, such as obesity, HbA1c [fasting glucose], diabetes, and [high blood pressure] which, in turn, are associated with the risk of arrhythmias.”Explore more on these topicsHeart diseaseHealthHealth & wellbeingMedical researchnewsShareReuse this content"

It was listed on the Woodland Trust inventory of ancient trees, but was not the subject of a tree preservation order.The tree was felled earlier this month by contractors working for Mitchells & Butlers Retail (MBR), which runs the nearby Toby Carvery and leases the land where the tree stood from Enfield council.The council said it had not been informed of the decision to cut down the tree and urged the Metropolitan police to investigate. The council leader, Ergin Erbil, said: “We are treating the matter as criminal damage and have reported it to the police.”It is understood that on Tuesday the Metropolitan police closed an investigation into the incident after deciding it was a civil matter.The council has placed a tree preservation order on the remaining trunk in the hope that it may grow back.A spokesperson for MBR said its contractors had warned that the tree was diseased. They said: “The tree was cut back after we were advised by our specialist arboriculture contractors that it caused a potential health and safety risk.“This was an important action to protect our employees and guests as well as the wider general public, to whom we have a duty of care.“We took necessary measures to ensure any legal requirements were met. We are grateful to our specialist arboriculture contractors for warning us of this potential health and safety risk, allowing us to act swiftly to address it.”Campaigners have expressed dismay at the incident.Writing on X, Paul Powlesland, co-founder of the Lawyers for Nature, said: “This shows the desperate need for better protections for our veteran and ancient trees. A building the same age as this tree would almost certainly be listed (council owned or not), and we should have an equivalent system for trees, with equivalent enforcement and punishment.”Adam Cormack, head of campaigning at the Woodland Trust, said it was “a reminder to all of us that not every ancient tree is in a safe place”.He added: “It is very unusual to see the felling of an oak tree of this size and age. Legally protected status for trees like the Whitewebbs oak is long overdue. This issue has widespread public support and is an open goal for the government to act upon.”The trust is campaigning for legislation that would make a list of nationally important heritage trees the subject of preservation orders.Later this month, the trial of two men accused of felling the Sycamore Gap tree is due to take place at Newcastle crown court.Experts say ancient oaks have more ecological value than sycamores because they support hundreds more species.Ablogpost by the tree company Thor’s Treessays: “Ancient trees like this one are living ecosystems in themselves. This oak was a lapsed pollard, a sign of historical land management, left to mature over centuries into a vast and unique habitat. Its sheer size and age meant it was home to hundreds of species, many of which rely solely on old trees like this to survive.”Explore more on these topicsTrees and forestsLondonLocal governmentWildlifenewsShareReuse this content"

France later saidAlgeria had expelled 12of its diplomatic staff.France’s relations with its former colony have long been complicated, but took a turn for the worse last year when Macron supported Morocco’s position over that of Algeria over the disputed Western Sahara region.Last week the French foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, had said that ties between the two countries were returning to normal.The activist and influencer Amir Boukhors is a critic of the Algerian president, Abdelmadjid Tebboune, and has more than 1 million subscribers on TikTok, where he posts as Amir DZ.He has lived in France since 2016 and was granted political asylum in 2023. Algeria has issued nine international arrest warrants against him on accusations of fraud and terrorism, but France refuses to extradite him.In April 2024, Boukhors was snatched outside his home in Val-de-Marne, south of Paris, telling France 2 television in a later interview that he was handcuffed and bundled into a car by four men wearing police armbands. He claimed he was drugged and held in a “container” for more than 24 hours before being released at 3am. “I fell into a trap,” he said.Three men were arrested and put under investigation on Friday for the “kidnap, holding and arbitrary detention” of Boukhors. France’s national anti-terrorist prosecutor confirmed that one of the men arrested worked for the Algerian consulate at Créteil, south-east of Paris.Algeria has denied the official’s involvement in the kidnapping.In a separate source of tension between the countries, Macron has also called on Algeria to release Boualem Sansal, a 75-year-old writersentenced to five years in prisonfor “undermining the integrity” of the country.Agence France-Presse and Reuters contributed to this report.Explore more on these topicsFranceAlgeriaEuropeAfricaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

InEurope, which accounts for nearly half of worldwide sales, consumption fell 2.8% last year. In France, one of the key global producers, 3.6% less wine was consumed last year. Spain and Portugal were among the rare markets where consumption increased.The OIV said production had been hit by environmental extremes such as above-average rainfall in some regions and droughts in others.Italy was the world’s top producer with 44m hectolitres, while France’s output fell 23% to 36.1m hectolitres, its lowest level since 1957.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFeastFree weekly newsletterRecipes from all our star cooks, seasonal eating ideas and restaurant reviews.

Their open coffins were laid out next to one other. Viktor wore his best suit. Olha was in a flowery blouse, with carnations heaped around her slippered feet. A priest sang prayers. Gravediggers lowered the couple into the ground, and shovelled earth on top. It landed with a percussive thud.“Give me a weapon. Any weapon. I want to kill those butchers in Moscow,” said Viktor’s brother-in-law Anatolii Prykhodko, as his wife stood sobbing next to him. “They have murdered so many people. Adults, kids, peaceful citizens. If you lose a house or a car in a war, you can get it back. If you lose a person, a loved one, they are gone for ever.”View image in fullscreenSumy state university’s congress centre building was badly damaged by the attack.Photograph: Anastasia Vlasova/The GuardianOn Sunday morning, the Boikos were on their way to church to celebrate Palm Sunday. Like most hard-up pensioners, they went by public transport. A ride costs eight hryvnia (15p). Their bus, No 62, was driving down Petropavlivska Street in the centre of Sumy, north-easternUkraine. On either side were elegant buildings belonging to Sumy state university. It was 10.23am.A Russian Iskander missile carrying cluster munitions plunged down from the sky, exploding next to the bus. Shrapnel engulfed the Boikos, other passengers and people in the street strolling past cafes and shops. The couple died instantly. Another missile hit the university’s conference centre, 200 metres away, punching through its glass atrium and balcony.Rescuers saw an apocalyptic scene. Bodies lay sprawled on the ground, cars burned, smoke billowed. The blast ripped a hole in the university’s economics and business department. It blew out the windows and wooden doors from the 19th-century institute of applied physics across the road. Fragments flew through the institute’s garden, shredding tulips and roses. The spot was a popular backdrop for wedding photos.On Tuesday, people visited the scene to lay flowers as firefighters perched on a shattered roof. “It was Palm Sunday, a holiday, a day off,” one Sumy resident, Tetyana, explained. “The weather had recently warmed up and people were on their way to church. We have a tradition in Ukraine that we buy willow branches.” She added: “This is a huge sorrow for the whole city. We are grieving. In my opinion this isn’t an act of war. It’s sheer terrorism.”View image in fullscreenTwo children are among the 35 people who were killed by the Russian cluster munitions.Photograph: Anastasia Vlasova/The GuardianAmong the dead were two children. One was 11-year-old Maksym Martynenko, who died with his parents, Mykola and Natalia. There were cuddly toys at the spot where he perished, including a bear and a hippo. Someone had left a plastic football with “To Max” written on it. The organist at Sumy’s philharmonic concert hall, Olena Kohut, was killed nearby on her way to a rehearsal. Other victims were students, teachers, a notary and the bus driver.Sumy is situated a mere 16 miles (25km) from the Russian border. It is home to soldiers and civilians. Residents are used to frequent drone and rocket attacks, and to the constant wail of air raid sirens. Sunday’s double-tap strike, though, was terrible. It was the most egregious Russian attack this year, leaving 35 dead and 129 injured. Eleven people remain in a critical condition. There are 15 wounded children.MapAsked for his reaction, Donald Trump appeared to downplay the latest Russian atrocity, calling it “a mistake”. Subsequently, he blamed Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president, and Joe Biden, the previous US president, by falsely claiming they “started” the war with Russia. Serhii Khvostov, the head of the damaged conference centre in Sumy, was unimpressed. “Trump is a mistake. This is an act by stupid and angry Russians. There’s no logic to it,” he said. “It’s easy to look away. But the world has to understand what is happening here.”Khvostov gave a tour of the ruined building. The missile blew a four-metre hole in the ground floor and careened into the basement, a community theatre space. A children’s show was due to take place there at 11am, shortly before the attack. Jagged pieces from the Iskander missile landed amid prepared sandwiches, costumes and a collection of puppets, including a dragon and Kermit the Frog. Large holes dinted the venue’s black walls.View image in fullscreenThe missiles struck at 10.23am on Palm Sunday, killing people walking in the street and riding on a bus.Photograph: Anastasia Vlasova/The Guardian“It was a miracle nobody was killed,” Khvostov said. After hearing the explosion, he called the centre’s elderly security guard. There was no answer, so he ran to the building. The guard was concussed but OK, and had managed to drag one of Khvostov’s colleagues from the administration’s office, pushing him out of a broken window. A cleaner also survived. No one else was inside. Several people drinking coffee from a mobile kiosk were injured.On Tuesday, staff swept away glass, ducking to avoid dangling bits of ceiling. Khvostov’s office was a mess. There were broken computers and desks and a toppled-over safe. “We can’t find the key,” he said. “It’s too early to say if this place can be rebuilt. I hope so.” Outside, a JCB digger scooped piles of debris into a lorry. A tow truck removed a damaged car. Its owner, Tetyana, said: “My windows blew in and my neighbour was hurt. I gave her a tourniquet.”The theatre’s founder and director, Volodymyr Niankin, said one of his friends was planning to leave Sumy due to the attack. Niankin said he himself would stay, to take care of his ailing grandmother. Of Trump and Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, he said: “I think they are stupid old men. They are representatives of a past cold war generation, when it was just the US and the USSR. It seems their plan is to divide up the world between them.”At the institute of applied physics, a clean-up was under way. Volunteers tidied the flowerbeds. The explosion damaged a chandelier in an upstairs lecture room and a charcoal portrait of a Sumy physicist, which had been hanging in a corridor. A whiteboard with an equation on it survived unscathed. Next to the entrance, a Quartz wall clock had stopped at the exact moment of impact: 10.23am and 40 seconds.Serhii Lebedynskyi, a senior researcher, examined his smashed office with his wife, Yulia. A shelf of physics books was covered in a layer of thick dust. Ornate plasterwork on the ceiling had disappeared. “We were planning to go into town with our small son on Sunday morning. He decided he didn’t want to leave the house. This probably saved us. We heard an enormous bang,” Lebedynskyi said. He added: “For more than 10 years the Russians have behaved like terrorists.”View image in fullscreenSerhii Khvostov, the head of the damaged conference centre.Photograph: Anastasia Vlasova/The GuardianAn American volunteer, Karl Ahlgren, said the Russians had known exactly what they were doing when they fired two missiles into a crowded city centre. “What Trump says is atrocious and unconscionable,” he said. “It’s clear he listens to Russian propaganda. I don’t know if it comes from Vladimir Putin or from [Trump’s special envoy] Steve Witkoff. There was no mistake here. The second strike was meant to kill rescuers.”On Tuesday, Ukraine’s armed forces carried out a form of revenge. The country’s military said it had successfully hit the headquarters of a Russian missile brigade responsible for Sunday’s carnage. “[A base] of the 448th missile brigade of the Russian occupiers was hit, a secondary detonation of ammunition was recorded. The results of the strike are being clarified,” it said in a statement.Back at Sumy’s cemetery, a gravedigger spoke fondly of Kohut, describing her as a talented and popular organist. “She was my friend. A very democratic person. She treated everyone the same way, whether you were important or not,” Valeriy Rodenko said. Rodenko said he had worked for seven years as a carpenter at the city’s philharmonic concert hall. “I got to know Olena well. She was a wonderful person. A bright spirit,” he said.He put down his spade and broke down in tears.Explore more on these topicsUkraineEuropeRussiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

But for Nigel Farage it wasquite a front page: a banner headline in the Sun proclaiming “Britain is broken”, the exact slogan Reform UK is using for May’s local elections.Inside the paper was not an actual endorsement for Reform, but something that felt as if it could be a precursor to one – details of polling that showed Farage is more trusted than Keir Starmer by “red wall” voters on key issues, with his party level-pegging withLabourfor support.This was the perfect lead-up to Farage’s biggest speech yet in the local election campaign,in which he proclaimedthat Reform’s tanks were “on the lawns of the red wall” and directly targeting Labour, with the Conservatives dismissed as finished.It has been well documented how seriously Starmer’s team, as well assome Labour MPs, treat Reform UK as a threat. But at the same time it is a more complicated picture than Farage would like to present, with arguably as many pitfalls as opportunities ahead for his party.To begin with, while Farage billed the poll as showing Reform stealing Labour voters, the detailed tables told a different story. Of people who said they would vote Reform on 1 May, just 8% had backed Labour in the 2021 local elections, while nearly 40% voted Conservative.This discrepancy was pointed out to Farage during a media Q&A after his speech, prompting a slightly peevish response, which avoided the point.Another slightly grumpy moment came when Farage explicitly took on Labour criticisms of him as untrustworthy on the NHS andfriendly to Vladimir Putin, calling the latter “the old Russia conspiracy theory”.Labour aides believe this shows Farage realises he is vulnerable on both issues. “He can try to airbrush history as much as he likes, but he said those fawning things about Putin on the record, and they have aged very badly,” one said.Another potential vulnerability, which Labour is not yet explicitly targeting, was highlighted when Farage was asked how a future Reform government would pay for its promised swathe of tax cuts. He responded with some high-grade waffle about new manufacturing jobs and abolishing quangos.This often difficult transition from insurgent political force to actual ruling party could come into early focus if, as polling suggests, Reform wins control of some councils, almost certainly more from the Tories than Labour.Expect Labour to keep a close watch on any Reform-run councils, and to pummel them as routinely as it has done when the Greens have done the same.“Saying you’ll cut diversity and inclusion to save money won’t cut it when you’ve got a council to run,” a Labour official said. “You can trim all the DEI programmes you like, but that won’t fill the potholes or magic up any SEND pupil places.”Mention of diversity programmes – which Farage did several times – brings in a particularly big imponderable: as he receives more scrutiny, how will voters take to his fairly unfiltered, high-octane UK version of Trumpism?Farage’s speech on Tuesday gave plenty of examples of this, not least his condemnation of members of the National Education Union as Marxists who are “poisoning the minds of our kids”.Going to war with the biggest teaching unionmight be popular with Reform members, but many everyday voters know and admire teachers, and might find this a bit quixotic, or insulting, or both.Similarly, some of Farage’s words on diversity, including that such policies disadvantage “white people with more history in this country” than those from ethnic minorities, will be seen by some as crossing a line from dog whistle to foghorn.Ultimately, however, Labour realises that this is a much longer game than one newspaper front page or a single set of local elections.“We will keep punching the bruises over Putin and the NHS, and while it’s probably too early in the cycle now, at some point the issue of fiscal credibility will become more and more important,” the Labour official said.“But ultimately it’s about us delivering on things that people notice, whether it’s the money in their pocket, GP appointments or potholes.”Explore more on these topicsReform UKNigel FarageThe SunLocal electionsLabouranalysisShareReuse this content"

resistanceRobert TaitIt may be a turning point in the White House’s attempt to gut allegedly liberal universities and punish law firmsTue 15 Apr 2025 13.51 EDTLast modified on Tue 15 Apr 2025 18.45 EDTShareIt might come to be seen as the moment the “woke liberal empire” of Donald Trump’s most fevered imaginings struck back.Harvard University, the world-renowned institution emblematic of the elitism that Trump and his coterie hold in contempt, received an extortive demand from the administration that it surrender the core of its academic freedoms – and promptly told it to get lost.That, in shorthand, is a summary of the exchange of letters between three Trump officials and Harvard’s president, Alan Garber, that may in time be seen as something of a turning point in relations between the administration and academia.Echoing pressures imposed on other elite colleges, notably Columbia University, the Trump team – representing the Departments of Education and Health and Human Services, and the General Services Administration – had demanded sweeping reforms in how Harvard is run, including the installation of viewpoint-diverse faculty members and the end of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programmes.The backdrop to a demand for what would be unprecedented government interference in the affairs of the world’s richest university is the alleged rise of campus antisemitism, arising from an upsurge of pro-Palestinian demonstrations that have gripped Harvard and other colleges following Hamas’s 7 October 2023 attack on Israel and Israel’s retaliatory military offensive in Gaza.Critics, however, see a more nefarious White House agenda – namely, gutting universities of what it sees as a liberal-left bias, while using antisemitism as a cudgel in an authoritarian power grab.Having seen Columbia cave in to similar demands and threatening $9bn in federal funding, the White House may have thought it was on to a winner with Harvard.“Investment is not an entitlement,” the administration’s 11 Aprilletterread, accusing Harvard of having “failed to live up to both the intellectual and civil rights conditions that justify federal investment”.The missive then set out a detailed list of 10 conditions that Harvard needed to satisfy in order to received continued funding.Bolstered by a financial endowment that reached $53.2bn in 2024 and which might cushion the blow of federal cuts, Garber called the White House’s bluff.He did so in terms clearly expressing his belief that the government’s stated goals of stamping out antisemitism – an issue Harvard had already taken steps to address, including, controversially, byadopting the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of the prejudice– masked more insidious aims.The administration’s demands made “clear that the intention is not to work with us to address antisemitism in a cooperative and constructive manner”, Garber wrote.“Although some of the demands outlined by the government are aimed at combating antisemitism, the majority represent direct governmental regulation of the ‘intellectual conditions’ at Harvard.“No government – regardless of which party is in power – should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue.”The university’s lawyers, William Burck and Robert Hur, both of whom have conservative credentials, starkly set out the broader constitutional stakes,writingthat the government’s demands were “in contravention of the first amendment” and concluding that “Harvard is not prepared to agree to demands that go beyond the lawful authority of this or any administration”.Within hours of Harvard’s rebuff, the administration retaliated by freezing $2.2bn in grants along with a $60m contract.It seemed somehow fitting that Harvard’s stand was being made on the same day that theTrump administrationwas openly defying a supreme court ruling to return a wrongfully deported Salvadorian man, Kilmar Abrego García, and El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, was visiting the White House.That posture appeared to put the onus on the supreme court to take a more forceful stand against the White House’s defiance.Now, thanks to Harvard’s stance, some establishment figures hope the court may just find the spine to do so.Michael Luttig, a conservative-leaning former federal appeals court judge who has previously accused the administration of “declaring war on the rule of law”, said Harvard’s pushback had “momentous significance”.“This should be the turning point in the president’s rampage against American institutions,”he told the New York Times.Obama and Yale faculty back Harvard as Trump cuts $2bn in federal grantsRead moreOther universities, faced with similar demands to capitulate, now have a stronger impetus to fight back, said Ted Mitchell, president of the American Council on Education, although most others lack Harvard’s financial reserves. “If Harvard had not taken this stand, it would have been nearly impossible for other institutions to do so,” he said.It may also provide inspiration for law firms – several of whom have already agreed to demands that they provide pro bono services to Trump as he seeks retribution against those who have represented his adversaries – to stand firm in the face of future intimidation.Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff and head of policy, is said to have wanted a fight with Harvard, believing it essential to break a liberal hold on higher education.But if the university’s response serves as an example to others, the battle may turn into a wider front than he envisioned.This article was amended on 15 April 2025 to correct the first name of the university’s lawyer William Burck. Also Harvard’s endowment is $53.2bn, rather than $53.2m as an earlier version said.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationHarvard UniversityUS universitiesUS politicsHigher educationanalysisShareReuse this content"

Navy Seal team alpha one is supporting marines in insurgents’ territory. And then one final, unusual detail in place of the standard “based on a true story” – “This film uses only their memories.” The “only” is an ominous indicator: this is a film working against the Hollywood tide to gloss, simplify or narrativize. Warfare, based primarily on Mendoza’s memories of that day as a former Seal, as well as those of fellow soldiers and civilians present, is as much an experiment of translation as a cinematic achievement, a movie defined by both what it shows and what it does not.Iraq veteran and film-maker Ray Mendoza: ‘Writing Warfare with Alex Garland was like going to a therapist’Read moreMuch of the press surrounding Warfare has focused on this exacting verisimilitude, its mission to create the “most accurate war film possible”. If something could not be double-checked by another account, it was not included. The intricate, fully immersive soundscape, designed by Glenn Freemantle, encompasses the vast volume spectrum of conflict – civilian chatter, a hand grazing a windowsill, burps of radio, destabilizing patters of gunfire and the sonic boom of a “show of force” military flyover that had nearly the same fetal-position effect on the theater audience as it did the characters. With the exception of a first scene observing the soldiers raucously dancing to the erotic music video for Eric Prydz’s Call On Me – underscoring just how young they are, how much pressure must be released – the movie proceeds in more or less real time. Ninety-ish minutes at a house the soldiers picked because one said “I like it”, at first tracking and then fighting nameless insurgents, with dialogue primarily in undiluted military jargon.At every turn, Warfare resists the conventions of a typical war picture, especially for the small handful offilms dealing directly with the aftermath of 9/11. From Black Hawk Down to Zero Dark Thirty, even the most technically proficient and subtly critical films boast a certain Hollywood sheen, with clear acts, story structure and legible characters for viewers to latch on to (and if not an outright satire a la Three Kings, an obligatory baseline reverence for the US military). Warfare does cast a slew of good-looking actors on the rise, including Charles Melton, Kit Connor, Joseph Quinn, Cosmo Jarvis, Noah Centineo, Will Poulter and Reservation Dogs’ D’Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai as Mendoza. But clad in camo and wraparound goggles, caked in dirt and blood, waiting in indecipherable roles or whirring in annihilating chaos, they are largely indistinguishable from the group. No backstories, no side plots, little banter. The main character is the unit itself.But perhaps what is most striking about Warfare is not its adroit simulacra of battle, but its commitment to uncinematic truth: war is hell, and also a lot of waiting around. Nearly half the movie proceeds before the firefight, the camera lingering in the dull, paranoia-inducing fact that there isn’t much to talk about when something could go wrong at any minute. When it does – a grenade tossed through a window from an unseen insurgent – it is almost comically understated, though no less deadly. The violence is arhythmic, staccato outbursts of deafening noise. But once a soldier is gravely injured, Garland and Mendoza do not provide a reprieve from the agonized screaming.This is not Garland’s first attempt at a hyper-realistic, anti-war war film.Civil War, released last year with Mendoza as a military consultant, imagined a fictional future civil conflict in the US with same detached, cool-headed commitment to realism, through the eyes of neutral military journalists trying to record the facts themselves. The film marked an achievement in unrelenting sound design and immersive combat cinema, but was undercut by a strange incuriosity as to the politics and partisan divide that would lead to war in the first place.Warfare suffers no such blurriness, though no explicit political dogma. It doesn’t need to – by adhering strictly to memory, thus acknowledging the limitations therein, Warfare circumvents the expectation of message that dogs the handful of films forming the “war on terror” canon. The vast majority of these, even Kathryn Bigelow’s Oscar-winning The Hurt Locker, imbued some moral ambiguity into the conflict, though focused primarily on the haunting effects of war on its American participants, and made little at the box office. Only American Sniper, Clint Eastwood’s 2014 film on the real-life sniper Chris Kyle, was a genuine hit, grossing $547m; not coincidentally, itpitted Good Americans v Bad Terrorists, any shades of grey subsumed by belief in the justness of the war.View image in fullscreenMichael Gandolfini in Warfare.Photograph: Murray Close/Courtesy of A24/© Real Time Situation LLCI could imagine these critiques while watching Warfare – that to focus on the US military is to inherently glorify it, that Garland and Mendoza hewing so close to the soldiers as to leave the forcibly displaced family, cowering in fear in a single bedroom under threat of a US gun, provides too limited a picture. But that would underestimate an audience’s ability to read between the lines. The fact that some of the soldiers forgot the family was even there, the fact that the Iraqi scouts were forced to evacuate first and thus died, that the family was left behind in wreckage without a word, says volumes about the entire ethos of the conflict. I cannot imagine walking away from this exquisitely rendered, fastidious account of modern warfare with an impression other than that the American invasion was an incomprehensibly costly exercise in needless violence and futility.Civil War review – Alex Garland’s immersive yet dispassionate war filmRead moreThe fact that Warfare pins its frame on the statement of memory – that this is what happened, unvarnished, these were the patterns and the suffering – is itself instructive to an American public with fewer and fewer direct ties to its military. There’s an educational undercurrent to the enterprise, a tacit understanding that most Americans know very little about the war outside of media portrayals, if they know anything at all. Less than 1% of the US populationservedin the armed forces during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, compared with roughly 10% in the second world war – not a value judgment, but a fact on personal connection. The US government was at constant war for 15 years; the vast majority of the US public was not. My understanding of the ethics and justification (or extreme lack thereof) of the invasions that began in my childhood have shifted and clarified with age, yet it was still cathartic – in a horrifying, skin-shedding way – to see a recreation, to feel closer to understanding the experience of many veterans increasingly alienated and disillusioned by the US government, disproportionately pulled to extremism.That Warfare does not introduce the other side, that the Iraqi family and scouts are even blanker to us than the soldiers, feels both unfair and refreshingly honest – acknowledgement of a failure of imagination on a grand and horrifying scale, and of the brain-shredding effects of combat on the personal level. The film ends with a jarring concession to convention and internet curiosity, presenting side-by-side photos of the real Seals with the actors. But before that, it visits, just briefly, the scene the soldiers just left – Iraqi insurgents appear on the streets as the tanks roll out; the family takes in the shattered remnants of their home. It could feel tossed-off, insufficient, but I read it as a tantalizing possibility – what would their perspective look like in real time? There are other stories not within Garland and Mendoza’s scope that we, too, should know – if only Hollywood would let someone tell them.Warfare is out in US cinemas now and in Australia on 17 April and the UK on 18 AprilExplore more on these topicsWar filmsAlex GarlandIraqAction and adventure filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Why isn’t he afraid of being replaced?Evan MoffittTue 15 Apr 2025 11.51 EDTLast modified on Tue 15 Apr 2025 12.31 EDTShareBy the time you read this article, there’s a good chance it will have already been scanned by an artificially intelligent machine. If asked about the artist David Salle, large language models such as ChatGPT or Gemini may repurpose some of the words below to come up with their answer. The bigger the data set, the more convincing the response – and Salle has been written about exhaustively since he first rose to art world stardom in the 1980s. The question is whether AI can ever say anything new about the artist and his work, or if it’s for ever condemned to generate more of the same.A similar question lingers beneath the surface of the paintings that Salle has been making since 2023, a new series of which he has just unveiled at Thaddaeus Ropac in London. His New Pastorals were made with the aid of machine-learning software, though that’s not immediately apparent from looking at them. Each monumental canvas bears broad, gestural strokes of oil paint seemingly applied by the artist’s own hand. Close study however reveals large patches of flat, digitally printed underpainting. This is the mark of the AI model which Salle has been training to generate his work – or at least something uncannily close to it.The tool can synthesise things in a matter of seconds. This evolution in painterly terms might take decadesThis machinic collaboration began with a game. Salle has long been sceptical of digital painting tools,writing in 2015that “the web’s frenetic sprawl is opposite to the type of focus required to make a painting, or, for that matter, to look at one”. Nonetheless, there is a sprawling quality to his own paintings, which layer images from such a wide range of pop and art historical references that the eye often doesn’t know where to rest. In 2021, Salle got the idea to develop a virtual game that would allow players to rearrange those painted elements using drag-and-drop tools.View image in fullscreenOne of the most highly valued painters of his generation … Salle.Photograph: Robert WrightAlthough the tech proved impractical, in the process Salle met Danika Laszuk, a software engineer at the tech startup EAT__Works, and Grant Davis, creator of the AI-powered sketchpad app Wand. Together they fed an AI image generator work by artists whose technique Salle considers foundational – Andy Warhol for colour, Edward Hopper for volume, Giorgio de Chirico for perspective, Arthur Dove for line – then asked it to produce images based on specific text prompts. “What I did was send the machine to art school,” Salle says.At first the machine was not a model student. Eerie, cartoonish figures with unnatural sheen recalled the images produced by OpenAI’s Dall-E Mini. “What’s so fundamentally unsatisfying about this kind of digital imagery?” Salle wondered. The answer, he felt, resided along the edges of its forms. “Because it’s only pixels, there’s no real differentiation between the edge of something and the thing behind it,” he explains. “There’s no way to make the edge meaningful, and in representational painting, those edges carry such a large amount of information about an artist’s style.” So he fed the machine scans of gouaches he had been making and watched the AI respond to their watery edges. “It could read the physicality of the brush stroke,” he recalls. “It fundamentally changed the machine’s way of thinking about itself.”Salle has taught at various institutions over the years, and this process felt a bit like a feedback session at an art school. Except the AI model is a very fast learner, and within a few sessions it could generate images that Salle might have come up with himself, if he’d only had more time. “The machine can synthesise things in a matter of seconds,” he says. “This evolution in painterly terms might take years or even decades.”Born in Oklahoma but raised in Wichita, Kansas, Salle was the model of precocity when he burst on to the New York scene in 1980. By 1987, he was one of the most highly valued painters of his generation, and at age 34 became the youngest artist to ever have a mid-career survey at the Whitney Museum of American Art. Such a stratospheric rise meant Salle’s market had further to fall once figurative painting was no longer in fashion, but the artist continued to labour on ever more ambitious series, including the troublesome suite of paintings at the heart of the New Pastorals. Now, figurative painting is back with a vengeance, and Salle has met the moment – or, perhaps, the moment has met him.View image in fullscreenIce Flow (2001), one of the original Pastoral paintings that Salle fed to the AI.Photograph: Robert McKeever/© David Salle/Licensed by ARS NY, NYTo produce his latest works, Salle trained the AI on the dozen sweeping Pastorals he completed between 1999 and 2000. Landscape paintings through the looking glass, they feature a couple idling by a lake, copied from a 19th-century opera scrim, rendered in harlequin colours and overlaid with inset images and designs of wildly differing styles. These vistas almost look like they were edited in Photoshop, but Salle rendered them entirely analogue. “The first thing they teach you in colour painting classes is how to establish your palette,” he recalls. “I was really showing off. I thought, ‘I can make a painting with three separate colour palettes work and you can’t stop me.’”Initial reviews of the Pastorals were mixed. Some critics described them as cold and emotionless, a charge often levied at Salle, whose demeanour can be as remote and cerebral as his paintings. “The result seems more a jumble of ingredients than a thoroughly cooked dish,” David Frankelwrote in Artforum.View image in fullscreenSuspenders (2025).Photograph: John Behrens/© David Salle / ARS New York, 2025With the New Pastorals, however, something seems to have changed. The brushstrokes are looser, faster and thicker, more abstract expressionist than anything else Salle has ever done. Their subject matter, meanwhile, is totally helter skelter, as if Salle has pulsed his older paintings in a blender. Headless bodies zoom in and out of the frame. Objects no longer seem attached to solid ground. Unnervingly, these works look more hand-painted than their referents, at least until you draw closer to their surface, where the paint is so thin in some areas that it could only have been applied by a machine.Salle always felt he hadn’t finished with the Pastorals, though he says there were other reasons why they were a good match for his AI experiment. “I realised that those paintings would give the machine material that it would understand in its own way,” he explains. “It took all these faceted shapes with different colour harmonies, and it just went to town with them – but kept the DNA of the transition, the horizon line, the mountains, the water, the couple and the figures, and then overlaid that with brushstroke edges.”Wand app creator Davis considers the introduction of the Pastorals a breakthrough moment for the model, as it required a new technique “which basically takes an image and abstracts the content on a conceptual level in order to recreate different variations”. In other words, the machine began to digest Salle’s paintings on a formal level. The Pastorals may also have been well suited to the task because the genre of landscape painting – and especially theatrical backdrops – resembles certain digital technologies in its production of illusionistic space. The New Pastorals reject the art historical imperative to create depth in a flat painting.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A floating stack of teacups anchors the composition in an otherwise turbulent space, much like the nails that Picasso and Braque painted on to their Cubist still lifes. The many fragmented, colliding bodies in Stack, on the other hand, are much harder to decode. “I’ll select an image that’s very eccentric precisely to provoke myself to do something that I probably would not have done otherwise,” Salle says.Nonetheless, the artist isn’t worried that AI will ever outpace or replace him. He sees it as another tool, like a brush or an easel. “I don’t think the machine’s taught me very much at all,” Salle declares. “I haven’t reconsidered how I think about pictorial space or composition. I’m simply taking what the machine offers after I’ve told it what I want.”View image in fullscreenWashing (2025).Photograph: John Behrens/© David Salle / ARS New York, 2025In some sense, his postmodern paintings are perfectly suited to such an experiment: sampling omnivorously from so many subjects and styles, they seem less concerned with their original sources than gleefully unbothered by the concept of originality altogether. In 1985, when Salle was at the height of his fame, the art historian Rosalind Krauss dismissed originality as a “modernist myth”; every work of art borrows from other sources, whether it acknowledges them or not. At least in their process, human artists may not differ so much from their robot kin.What AI might borrow from Salle is another question. The data collected by EAT__Works is proprietary, so his feedback won’t fuel any other artist-machines in the near future, though photographs of his new paintings, uploaded to the gallery’s public website, could conceivably be used as prompts for further AI-generated images. “In theory our model could autonomously spawn images,” Davis admits, though “the best images come from a technique that is very hands-on”. For now, AI still needs humans to train it – that is, until the student becomes the teacher.David Salle: Some Versions of Pastoral is atThaddaeus Ropac Londonuntil 8 JuneExplore more on these topicsPaintingArtArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingExhibitionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We were foster parents and not expecting a call about a newborn. Despite becoming her mom with just 12 hours’ notice – we adopted her the next year – my early months with her felt so natural.I had been disabled for six years. While on a hike, I developed dysautonomia, which is secondary to a genetic connective tissue disorder called hEDS [hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome]. I experience a great deal of daily pain and can’t stand for more than a minute or sit upright unsupported for more than five.As a result, I spend most of my day reclined. Her high need for physical contact in infancy fit my need to rest all day. She didn’t need a mom who could pace. She needed a mom who didn’t get bored lying on the sofa. We were a perfect match.After a few months with K, we started to make plans. The first was a trip to a small island called Lummi off the coast of Washington state. We flew out of Oakland; a friend drove us to the airport and helped us check the bags. David pushed me in my wheelchair, and I carried K on my lap. Once in the air, we learned the hard way that air pressure changes can contribute to diaper blowouts, but the flight was, generally, fine.When we arrived in Seattle, David pushed K and me to the corner of the baggage claim area and returned to watch for our bags while I bottle-fed her. Once David had our suitcases, he dropped them off with us in the corner and left to get our rental car. Returning an hour later with the car, he parked out front, came in and retrieved the bags, and then, finally, two hours after landing, brought K and me to the car. A few extra steps, but manageable.Our week on Lummi was heaven. I read so many books that I joined the local library so that I could check out more. At night, I drank IPAs and ate Oreos under the stars. During the afternoons, K and I lounged on a picnic blanket, listening to the waves.View image in fullscreenThe author with her daughter, K.Photograph: Jessica SliceBut the return trip was the first time I felt what would become a familiar sinking shame about my disability complicating our life as parents. Due to a few car complications, we were cutting it close to make our flight. There was no bag check. I had been using a wheelchair in airports for years and knew that an airport attendant would push me to the gate if I requested it. I suggested to David that we ask someone at the airport to push me while I carried K so that David could manage our bags.When the person arrived, they told me I couldn’t carry K on my lap. They said it was airport policy that a baby couldn’t ride on a wheelchair (never mind that it was my wheelchair, my lap, and my baby). So now David needed to find a way to push our suitcases and carry K simultaneously – which was impossible, and our flight was about to leave. The attendant left, and we scrambled for solutions.We called the attendant back and asked him to push me. I would drag our suitcases, and David would carry K. We inched our way through the airport. I am not strong enough to hold my arms out to the side and push suitcases; before long, I had moved the bags in front of me, pushing them with my feet. It was difficult – they zigged and zagged, unwieldy and slow.We made our flight. We made it home. But the humiliation of not being allowed to carry my baby continued to burn.As K grew older, the list of places she needed or wanted to go expanded.She started ballet, and I couldn’t last an hour propped on the hard wooden floor. She started daycare, and dropping her off required a long walk up a steep driveway. She wanted to visit the zoo and the playground and the children’s discovery museum.Part of how I adapted to her expanding world was to get a power wheelchair. I needed to be able to recline; the 450-lb chair does that and more. In many ways, the solution was effective. I attended ballet classes. We went to the playground. We fed the cows at the little farm in the Berkeley Hills. But a 450lb wheelchair only works in spaces that are wheelchair accessible. When we go somewhere with stairs, I can’t bring my chair. I can walk up a few stairs, but if the seating at the top isn’t accessible, I must leave after only a few minutes.For some disabled or chronically ill people, leaving the house isn’t possible at all. But for others, the barriers are structural.K is now six. Below is a non-exhaustive list of places she has gone but where, because of inaccessibility, I haven’t been able to join:Her kindergarten classroom. In fact, the entirety of the school she attended for two years.Countless hikes.Multiple preschool tours – so many schools in California, North Carolina and Ontario are up or down stairs.Field trips.Nearly every shop and restaurant in Montreal while on a family vacation.Birthday and holiday parties.Most playgrounds with sand or gravel.In an ambulance, twice.In particular, being separated on the ambulance rides devastated me. The first time we called 911, K wasn’t yet two and had been sick with pneumonia; the EMTs arrived quickly, assessed K’s status, and said she needed to get to Oakland’s Children’s hospital urgently.“Who’s coming?” they asked, looking between David and me, as they attached sensors to my tiny baby. Saying I couldn’t go with her to the hospital as she struggled to breathe felt like tearing an organ from my body. But my wheelchair wouldn’t fit inside the ambulance.David is a kind and attentive dad. K did not suffer for having David in the ambulance. But I did. I walked outside as they loaded my baby and turned on the sirens, which faded as they sped down the hill. Our house, which had minutes before been loud and busy with equipment and people and uniforms and alarms, was silent. Shaking, I went back inside to figure out how to get myself to the hospital with my wheelchair. I called my neighbor and could barely speak through my tears. He answered, and within minutes, we were en route to the hospital.About a year later, K again became sick with a minor cold that turned to be pneumonia and worsened quickly. We were different parents by that point; after a year of monitoring her respiratory rate, oxygen percentages, and trachea tugs, we knew exactly what to watch for.Even with all our vigilance, K experienced a rapid decline only hours after visiting her pediatrician. Like the first time, my gut knew before my brain, and when I called the after-hours nurse’s line, I knew what they would say: “Call 911 immediately.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

David, K and I were on our king-sized bed, thermometers and oxygen monitors surrounding us, when the EMTs entered. The paramedics checked K’s vital signs, and their demeanors changed. “Signs of sepsis,” one reported. “Hurry.”And just like that, they were running, K on a stretcher, David hurrying behind. The silence they left behind was eerie. I knew what sepsis could mean for a baby and all I wanted was to be with my child to ensure that no one made a life-threatening mistake. To demand that every person pay undivided attention to K.Alone in my apartment, I remembered that, in my 20s, I had helped the chief of emergency medicine at the closest major hospital buy a home. He and I had connected in the process, and I had joined him and his wife, an infectious disease doctor, on their boat to celebrate after. It had been years since we had talked, and a lot had changed, including my disability and becoming a parent. I picked up my phone, found his contact, and called.“It’s Jessica, your old realtor. I have a child now, and she is in an ambulance on the way to the emergency room, and the paramedics said it might be sepsis. K is in respiratory distress.” I was weeping, and my hands shook, but I got the words out. He was calm and kind and said he would call the attending on duty to make sure everyone acted quickly and would keep me in the loop. I was doing all I could to save my baby. I would have done anything.Hanging up the phone, the adrenaline took over, and I barely made it to the bathroom before vomiting.K was OK. It wasn’t sepsis, thank goodness. She recovered from the respiratory distress at home while I watched her chest rise and fall. But seeing her disappear into the ambulance had felt like someone pulling my heart up and out of my throat.Disabled parents’ caregiving abilities are optimized in our homes. But when we leave the house, the obstacles multiply. For one, the built environment is often inaccessible and inhospitable for individual bodies and minds. Secondly, when not in our homes we see other people – and people, through words and actions, create a different kind of hostile environment.View image in fullscreenDisabled parents’ caregiving abilities are optimized in our homes. But when we leave the house, the obstacles multiply.Photograph: Jessica SliceMany parents my age remember our childhoods in the 80s and 90s and compare the risks of our childhoods to the safety expectations of parents today. It’s hard to imagine a child today being tossed around in the trunk of a station wagon or roaming the neighborhood for hours before the age of 10. Risk calculation is complex, and I am certainly not one to elevate the experience of the “good old days” – good? For who? – but parents are expected to insulate their children from many harms (at least those that we can purchase solutions for).Personally, I am always wrestling with safety. I live in a body that is proof that bodies are fragile. For disabled parents in wheelchairs or on crutches, leaving the house brings risk. We cannot, despite our deepest desires, run after our kids. We cannot lift a car in a feat of superhuman strength. We cannot dive into the ocean to snatch our grade-schooler from a riptide. But we want to have big lives.Accessibility is, simply, adjusting the environment to allow disabled people to participate. The belief that it’s worse to be disabled – which dictates a great deal of public and private life – thrives in part because disability is a reminder that bodies and minds fail, always. We build entire structures and belief systems around avoiding the reality of our collective fragility. Our governing ethos is that of independence and strength, not of need. When we request an accommodation – a lighter car seat, a ramp, a Braille edition of a book – we are admitting that we are needy. And when we have needs, we confess to something we wish weren’t true, that we are mortal.What makes this manic rejection of our mortality even more fraught is that, once we become parents, we must also find a way to delude ourselves that our kids are indestructible. It is intolerable to think about the reality that our kids will be hurt, physically and emotionally. We buy into the myth of safety, as we attempt to create a force field of invincibility around our family so that we can stay safe and happy forever.Instead of worrying about safety when we see a baby riding on their parent’s wheelchair, we should consider how we can create more spaces where wheelchair users are welcome. The picture disabled parents paint while in public with our kids is beautiful and offers permission. We are showing that there are countless ways to have bodies and minds and that it’s OK to cross the border of what’s expected. We are not reminders of death – we are reminders of how full life can be.Extracted from Unfit Parent: A Disabled Mother Challenges an Inaccessible World by Jessica Slice, published by Beacon Press on 15 April.Unfit Parent by Jessica Slice (Beacon Press, £27).

Huh. Good luck with that.You seem down – is your day going badly?Honestly, it’s a mixed bag. The world is sliding into geopolitical chaos and climate collapsewhile Jeff Bezos sends Katy Perry into space, but on the plus side, I’ve just made a great sandwich.Would you like to know how to make it better?My sandwich? Impossible.No, your day.Let me guess.Is itgenerational wealth?No, there’s a new formula for how to have a good day.A formula – what is this, GCSE chemistry?It’s social science, actually. Researchers at theUniversity of British Columbiahave used machine-learning techniques to analyse data from theAmerican Time Use Surveyand work out how the amount of time people devoted to various activities determined whether they rated their day as “better than typical”.I see.So what’s the formula?Well, there’s six hours of family time and two hours with friends, plus an hour and a half of extra socialising, for a start.Exhausting. Do introverts not contribute to the American Time Use Survey?Some of them seem to: one of the findings was that, while socialising was an important part of a better than average day, there was little benefit beyond two hours of it.That makes sense – there’s a limit to how long I want to spend talking with Dave next door about the bins.“Some activities may be best in small doses, like a touch of salt when baking cookies,” the research team theorised. “While other activities may be akin to chocolate chips, where more is almost always better.”Very true. What else should I be doing?Well, speaking of chocolate chips, there’s an hour of eating and drinking in there.Easy.Anything else?Two hours of exercise.Twice as much time exercising as eating and drinking? Madness.Data doesn’t lie. Better than average days involved work, too, though not more than six hours of it.Yes, six hours of work is plenty. I need time for zoning outwatching TikToks ofmedieval dog namesandmurderous emus.Sorry, no – you should only be having an hour of screen time.So how am I supposed to relax?Well, here’s the strangest finding from this research: “Time spent relaxing was always negatively associated with having a good day.”What?Strange, isn’t it? The research team think it’s because most of that time is spent watching TV.In the age of prestige streaming? Unlikely. It’s probably because these days, we need lives stuffed with work, exercise and other people to distract ourselves from impending doom.Sssh, eat your sandwich.Do say:“Such a perfect day, drink sangria in the park.”Don’t say:“For a period not exceeding one hour, followed by a two-hour high-intensity interval training workout.”Explore more on these topicsHappinessPass notesHealth & wellbeingSocial sciencesTime managementfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Her experiences of the second world war had not been light: by the age of eight, theHolocaustsurvivor had “reached adulthood”, seen things she should never have seen, heard sounds she should never have heard, and been confronted by terrors she could neither forgive nor forget.Which is why the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Bergen-Belsen by British forces on 15 April 1945 is as much a cause for joy as for the horror to come flooding back.“But it’s also different,” Angel, now 88 and a great-great-grandmother, admitted over tea in her apartment in Athens. “Now I want to tell the whole world what happened. And that’s because I want all these men who lead us to know what war really looks like. The Germans had a zeal for death; they had turned it into a science.”Quick to smile, gravel-voiced and diminutive, Angel is among the very last of Greece’s dwindling Jewish community to have survived Bergen-Belsen, a concentration camp complex in northernGermany. Its victims included Anne Frank, the teenage diarist who would become one of the most famous casualties of the Holocaust.“What happened there was an abomination,” Angel said. “An abomination that historians will one day refer to as a dark page but which we, as the last survivors, are duty-bound to describe.”View image in fullscreenA memorial stone in Bergen, Germany.Photograph: Martin Meissner/APRetreating Nazi forces agreed to hand the camp over to the allies on 12 April. It was, by all accounts, a peaceful exchange until the 11th Armoured division of the British army, backed by the 63rd Anti-tank regiment, arrived at the complex’s barbed wire confines on 15 April.Witnesses said nothing could have prepared them for what they found. The stench of death was everywhere, in the corpses piled high, some green, almost all emaciated, lying by the thousands around the camp in various stages of decomposition. Typhus had spread. So, too, had dysentery and starvation. Of the 60,000 people locked inside, more than 14,000 would die within weeks of liberation because freedom had simply come too late. More than 70,000 people were killed on its grounds, most Jewish but also including 20,000 Soviet prisoners of war and other Nazi targets such as Roma and gay men.“In Auschwitz it was the gas chambers, in Bergen-Belsen it was death through hunger and disease,” said Angel, who can vividly recall the arrival from Auschwitz in October 1944 of thousands of “exhausted and skeletal” female inmates, including Frank and her older sister, Margot. “The Germans were losing the war. They felt they were running out of time and they knew that in Bergen-Belsen, where typhus was so rife, they’d die very soon.”The Angels were among the last Jews to be forcibly evacuated by the Nazis from Athens in April 1944, three years after the Wehrmacht had raised the swastika over the Acropolis and barely six months before the occupation would end.View image in fullscreenLola and her parents on the terrace of the Athens apartment where they were later arrested.Like others who had sought refuge in the Greek capital, Lola’s parents, both Spanish passport holders, had fled south from Thessaloniki, home of one of Europe’s oldest Sephardic Jewish diasporas, when it became clear the Third Reich had the Ladino-speaking communityin its sights.With false identification papers and the courageous support of the resident Spanish consul – credited with delaying the deportation of hundreds of Sephardic Jews – the family had avoided detection until two members of the Gestapo and a Greek collaborator knocked at the door of their small rented apartment on 25 March 1944. It was Greek Independence Day.“They appeared at dawn and dragged my father away but not before he had phoned Sebastián and Elena de Romero Radigales [the Spanish consul and his wife] who were family friends,” she recalled. “As ‘foreign Jews’ it was said my parents could be exchanged with German prisoners of war but Elena was very concerned and desperately appealed to my mother to adopt me.”The wagons of the windowless locomotive that the Angels were forced to board served both as a passenger train to Bergen-Belsen and a death convoy for those in the rear carriages who, after a stopover in Vienna, continued on to Auschwitz.Lola had not yet turned seven when she made the voyage. Time has not dulled her memory of the eight-day journey or of the train’s panic-stricken human cargo; “every so often” she still feels the lump in her throat that very soon came to symbolise fear. By the time the family arrived in the camp, the SS officers who had taken control had mastered the art of mass murder that underpinned the racial restructuring of the “final solution” envisaged by the Nazi regime.In March 1945 alone, weeks before the camp’s liberation, more than 18,000 detainees died in conditions so horrific that British relief teams felt fit to say it was difficult to discern the living from the dead.For the Angels, as so many others, there was no prisoner swap once D-day occurred. “At first they gave us Swedish Red Cross parcels and treated us reasonably well,” said the octogenarian. “But after 6 June 1944 the boxes stopped and we were given one piece of bread a day with diluted milk in the morning and a soup of water with potato peel at night. I didn’t wash in over a year. I was full of lice.”As German defeat approached and the allies homed in, forces at the camp decided to put the estimated 2,500 “foreign Jews” initially lined up for exchange on a death train headed north. Lola and her parents were among them. The train was intercepted by rapidly advancing US Ninth Army troops on Friday 13 April.“Suddenly it stopped near the lake of Magdeburg and the German guards left, leaving the train doors open. Hours later there were these Americans liberating us. I honestly believe I had two lucky stars: Sebastián and Elena who stopped us being deported earlier, and those Americans. If we had been kept in Bergen-Belsen, as was the case with my mother-in-law, it would have been the British rescuing us, without whom, of course, the war would never have been won.”View image in fullscreenLola Hassid Angel holding a Nazi dagger her mother took.Photograph: Helena Smith/The GuardianA day later US troops, commandeering the homes of villagers in the area, ensured the Angels and fellow detainees had a place to wash, sleep and eat. “An American soldier stood outside while our host, a Nazi marine commander, was forced to open up his house to us. For the first time we slept in a smooth bed with eiderdowns and were able to take a bath,” she smiled. “I’ll never forget my mother spotting a small dagger on a table, picking it up and saying: ‘Those who are victorious can take the weapons of the vanquished.’ I’m proud of that dagger and still have it even now.”These days, most of Angel’s memories are “of the good things” that followed liberation. “The fear, the terror, takes over when I’m asleep. It appears out of nowhere in my subconscious, which is why I can never forget.”In recent years, Angel has made a point of visiting Greek schools to address the Holocaust. The fresh-faced pupils listen in disbelief when she tells them that about 1.5 million children younger than 13 died in gas chambers during the war.“At the end of each talk it’s always the same,” she said. “My legs shake, my head spins, knowing what really happened not so very long ago. The Nazis finessed the art of killing people, down to how much Zyklon B gas was needed to kill hundreds at the same time. Technology has progressed so much since then. My big fear is if another Hitler comes along, the next war will be much worse.”Explore more on these topicsHolocaustSecond world warGreeceGermanyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

They are the artists at Mano Animation Studios, whose co-founder Usman Riaz is the director, animator and co-composer behind Pakistan’s first hand-drawn animated feature.The titular glassworker is Vincent Oliver, voiced by Teresa Gallagher as a child and Sacha Dhawan as an adult. With his father, Tomas (Art Malik), he works at the finest glass workshop in Waterfront town. But as war breaks out over the sovereignty of the Great Ravine, their treasured storefront comes under threat. Amid it all a budding romance sparks between Vincent and Alliz Amano (Anjli Mohindra), a talented violinist who turns out to be the daughter of the colonel who has turned their quaint town into a warfront.Most of the story unfolds in the form of childhood memories, as Vincent and Alliz grow up under the looming threat of war and try to hold on to their friendship, art and innocence, all of which are impacted by their fathers’ beliefs.Every hand-drawn frame is handled with the utmost care, much like Vincent and Tomas handling the molten glass. In an early sequence, we see the glass-making process in detail as young Vincent empties his lungs into the blowpipe to form a sculpture’s final shape; breathing life into it, in a sense. This metaphor is the core of The Glassworker: just like the glass sculpture, beautiful things take a lot of effort to form – but can shatter at just a slight touch. Later in the film, the glass sculpture breaks, foreshadowing the corruption that befalls the glassworks as Alliz’s father, Colonel Amano (Tony Jayawardena), coerces Tomas into helping build the army’s warships.Much like Tomas, Amano is a disciplinarian. His battle planes cast ghastly shadows over the lush green fields where Vincent and Alliz play, souring their blossoming companionship. As the story progresses, quiet and subtle moments reveal Amano’s tragedy. Like Vincent and Tomas, he, too, has an appreciation for the arts. He loves Alliz’s music and, more importantly, he loves her. But war drives him away from his daughter and his sensibilities. We see him at home in a red armchair, broken and tired, underneath a family portrait in which his father, a decorated general, is sitting in the same chair. Father and son are, in their own ways, also victims of the ruthless cycle of war.View image in fullscreen‘Rich and vibrant’ … Waterfront in The Glassblower, which was partly influenced by Riaz’s hometown of Karachi.Photograph: Album/AlamyThe Glassworker’s anti-war sentiment and its hand-drawn animation call to mind the works of Studio Ghibli’s Hayao Miyazaki. The film’s aesthetics possess the same emotional resonance and attention to detail that are part of Miyazaki’s distinctive style. Even the romantic score is reminiscent of Joe Hisaishi’s iconic compositions for Ghibli films. But while The Glassworker’s exploration of the hereditary nature of ideals is compelling the film’s anti-war philosophy and presentation lack the nuance that is a staple of Miyazaki’s works.Still, Riaz’s debut feature is not without glimmers of brilliance. Aside from being a landmark in the history of Pakistani cinema, what sets The Glassworker apart from its inspirations is the rich and vibrant world of Waterfront, partly influenced by Riaz’s hometown of Karachi. Although it is difficult to tell if the moral values The Glassworker tries to impart will be remembered, few will forget the bustling market Tomas and Vincent walk through, where the little glassworker is treated to one of the mouth-watering gulab jamuns that sparkle in a pot.The Glassworkeris available to stream on SBS On Demand in Australia, with UK and US streamers yet to be announced.

The reluctant stars of A New Kind of Wilderness talk about a world without MariaPatrick BarkhamTue 15 Apr 2025 05.00 EDTSharePeace hangs over a farm in ruralNorway. The last of the melting snow lingers in hummocks and bikes are strewn outside the Payne family’s small rented cottage. Nik Payne materialises from behind the barn where he has been feeding the cows. One of his three children, Falk, 12, is lying on the sofa with a fever and a Biggles novel; later, Freja, 15, and Ulv, nine (known as Wolf or Wolfie), return from school. Their home is as warm and chaotic as any family’s – boots and coats strewn in the hallway, a fridge covered in photos, shelves of books – but with a few differences: there is no television and behind the living room door is an unobtrusive, very personal shrine.The Paynes find themselves the reluctant stars of a film, A New Kind of Wilderness, which has won awards at Sundance and other festivals around the world. This documentary begins, deceptively,as Variety put it, “like Swiss Family Robinson updated for the era of Instagram cottagecore”. The children, with their older half-sister Ronja, are being raised by Nik, an Englishman, and his Norwegian wife Maria to be “wild and free”: home-schooled, creative, growing their own food, living closely and gently with nature.Then tragedy strikes. In 2019, Maria falls ill with cancer and dies, aged 41. With sensitivity and intimacy, film-maker Silje Evensmo Jacobsen follows what happens next as the grief-stricken Nik tries to stay true to the beliefs and daily patterns of living he created with Maria, home schooling his bereft children and trying to protect his family. I defy anyone to watch it dry-eyed.View image in fullscreenUlv and Maria in A New Kind of Wilderness.Photograph: Maria VatneNow the Paynes are travelling the world, attending Q&As at film festivals where the documentary has been rapturously received. At their first festival, they all watched the film again with the audience. “That was a mistake, because it still affects us in many ways and we’re fighting back the tears,” says Nik. “Now we sometimes go in for the last 10 minutes.” Is it traumatic to relive their tragedy? “I see it as good, a cathartic process, bringing it up again,” he says. “Grief is an ongoing thing. Grief changes you for ever. It’s part of you for ever but it’s not the defining part.”The film is so intensely moving perhaps because the people at its heart are not showy or spectacular. Nik, who makes yoghurt and bakes bread as we chat in his kitchen, is a private, deep-thinking man who radiates self-sufficiency. Watching him grieve on film is agonising.“At the start, the grief takes your breath away. You’re left gasping for the next breath. The only thing you can do is just breathe. It’s the contemplation of having to endure things for a long time that becomes unbearable, not the thing itself,” he says. “It was so important for me that I had the kids. You haven’t any choice but to get up. It’s impossible to be miserable all the time because they come up with spontaneous joy. They are in their grief in a different way, for shorter periods. They don’t sit in it, like we do.”View image in fullscreenNik Payne.Photograph: Elin Høyland/The GuardianHe and Maria met through a mutual friend when Nik, who had grown up on a dairy farm near Chester, worked as a flying instructor in Portugal. “We really hit it off,” he says. Soon after, he visited her in Norway. “Within six weeks, I’d moved over.” Maria’s daughter from an earlier relationship, Ronja, was four at the time, and the three of them chose to live in the countryside; 364 days after Nik moved to Norway, Freja was born. They bought a smallholding and Maria taught photography and film-making, and then started a blog about their life. “I was the one who did the farm and grew the food,” says Nik.Jacobsen saw Maria’s blog and in 2014 made a pilot film about the family living close to nature. No broadcasters picked it up, but when Jacobsen got back in touch after Maria’s death, Nik decided to let her into the family’s shattered life because Maria would have wanted it. “For me, it was a completely unnatural thing. Maria was more extroverted, more into film-making, and had wanted to start this project,” he says. “In her blog, she shared everything about our lives – the good stuff but also the hard stuff, including her own illness. She was very honest, so I decided to go for it as a kind of legacy for her. Maybe it will help someone out there.”What emerges is a series of dilemmas as harsh reality challenges Nik’s pure ideals, particularly his quest for self-sufficiency and a creative education for his children. In the absence of Maria, he tries so hard to provide everything for them: he grows food, cooks, brushes Wolfie’s long blond hair and teaches them at home even when he knows his Norwegian is not quite up to scratch. But he must also earn a living. Did he reach a point where he was overwhelmed by trying to do it all? “Probably every day, and then I had to start again the next day. That’s why I had to send them to school.”This is a climactic moment in the film. Did sending them to school feel like a defeat? Or doing the right thing? “It’s a continuous feeling of defeat or disappointment. They really did enjoy the home schooling and they would have liked to continue. I had hoped that I could give them that, but I couldn’t see a way to do it.”View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenFrom top: Freja, Falk and Ulv. All photographs: Elin Høyland/The GuardianDespite their initial fears, the children settle into mainstream education, although this forces another uncomfortable confrontation with reality when Freja brings home a school iPad (all Norwegian children are issued them). Many tech-sceptic parents will recognise the grimace on Nik’s face when his children huddle round the iPad in rapture as Freja plays a game.It’s heartbreaking how alone Nik appears at this time. He had some counselling while Maria was dying but it was halted rather abruptly and, as stubbornly self-reliant as ever, Nik vowed to become his own therapist. “Maria always talked about ‘doing the inner work’. For years, I didn’t know what she was talking about, but I started to, slowly but surely.” What about friends? Talking wouldn’t have helped, he says. “I was just alone. It’s the loneliness of the last speaker of a dead language. That’s how I felt.”It was sometimes comforting having the film-maker in their home. “Silje was very good – she came and hung out with us without filming and became a friend I could talk to off camera,” he says. But Nik worried about exposing the children. “She wanted to film how Freja was feeling, and I had to put my foot down and say, ‘I don’t want you to do any more now.’ There’s a scene where Freja has read a letter from Ronja and I came in because I just wanted to check Freja was all right. Often I’d be hiding outside the bedroom if she was being talked to by Silje, just to …” He tails off. “We all enjoyed having Silje around most of the time, but there were definitely times when it was, ‘Ohhhft, I could do without that.’”Being filmed selling their dream farm was one of those moments. Nik’s labouring and tree surgery couldn’t pay their mortgage. All this pain is leavened by beauty and humour, much of the latter provided by Wolf. When Falk mourns their farm for having everything, Wolfie chips in: “But not pet whales.”View image in fullscreenUlv on the trampoline.Photograph: Elin Høyland/The GuardianWhile Freja and Falk are cautious and thoughtful, like their dad, Wolfie is a bundle of energy, arriving home from school on his bike like a whirlwind before performing multiple somersaults on the trampoline.“You need some comedic relief in a movie like that, I think,” says Freja of her little brother, who has, according to Nik, “been eating his weight in pancakes and jam” at festival hotel buffets. “The fun part [of the festivals] is when they call up your name if you’ve won something,” says Wolfie, who points to a gold starfish-shaped gong from Egypt and another award from Hungary on their windowsill. The film has been shown on Norwegian television and is now being released in Japan, where their chic Nordic knitwear (all knitted by Granny – Maria’s mother) has proved particularly popular.For much of the two years Silje filmed the family, Nik assumed that if the project was ever finished it would play at some obscure eastern European film festival “watched by three people, one of whom is asleep”. He first saw it at home by himself and “blubbed all the way through. It was difficult to be objective, to see what sort of film it really is, but I was happy there wasn’t anything in there I couldn’t stand behind.” He had no clue it would be so well received until Sundance, when the audience whooped and whistled, giving a standing ovation when they realised the family were in the auditorium.At home, theSundance world cinema grand jury prizeis placed in the shrine beside Maria’s photograph, plus two peacock feathers and other precious objects they remember her by. Maria would be so delighted by the award, thinks Nik. “She studied film and some of the guys that she studied with have said she dreamed of winning something at Sundance.”They still remember Maria at dinner. “We light a candle before each meal and hold hands. We’re not religious as such but we give thanks for the food, the day we’ve had and each other, and we send love up to Maria,” says Nik.View image in fullscreenNik and the family cat, Raa-Tee.Photograph: Elin Høyland/The GuardianThe Paynes are perhaps closer than many families – with more chat at mealtimes – but they don’t want to be defined by their grief. Freja is happy at school; Nik rolls his eyes about her smartphone-time but she also raises and sells chickens for pocket money. Nik hopes to home-school Falk and Wolf again for a year before they start secondary. He is also writing a book about his experiences and aiming to buy a modest smallholding to pursue farming and self-sufficiency. The film may be successful but documentaries don’t tend to make much money; Nik says he hasn’t received any revenue from it. “I’m fortunate enough not to be a money-oriented person. I would actually feel uncomfortable if I was making money out of that. I like the fact that it’s something I can give.”In the film, Nik shrugs off his dad’s suggestion that he find a new partner, but now says he enjoyed a brief relationship last year – “It was good to realise that I’m still alive” – before realising they had different visions for their lives. Does he feel lonely? He pauses for a longer-than-usual thought. “Sometimes, maybe. I’m somebody who is naturally good with his own company. I read a lot, I think a lot, there are plenty of people around I can talk to, if I want to. Sometimes, at dinner time when the kids are bickering or talking about fart humour, I think, oh God, I wish there was an adult to talk to.”The children aren’t having that.“No!” says Wolf. “He wants to talk about farts. We don’t.”“It’s like being at a chimpanzee’s tea party with him,” says Freja, and the sunny Norwegian spring day is brightened by their laughter.A New Kind of Wilderness is out on 16 May. The Paynes will be at select cinemas around the UK for Q&As at preview screenings.Find one near you hereExplore more on these topicsFilmNorwayBereavementFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Among these is the all-female flight by Blue Origin, the Jeff Bezos-owned rocket tourism company, which on Monday launched a phallically shaped pod full of women – including the pop star Katy Perry and Bezos’s partner, Lauren Sánchez – on abrief trip into space.The flight, which was promoted for months in advance, was touted as a triumph of feminism, a win for science and an embrace of the kind of expansive, curious human spirit of striving and possibility that once animated both. Instead, the flight served as a kind of perverse funeral for the America that once enabled both scientific advancement and feminist progress – a spectacle that mocked these aspirations by appropriating them for such an indulgent and morally hollow purpose.Jeff Bezos takes one small step for feminism and social progress, and one giant leap for self-publicity  | Sarah ManavisRead moreBlue Origin itself is a product of state abandonment of space exploration. Founded in 2000 to fill the void left by the federal government’s effort to privatize the work of agencies like Nasa, Blue Origin has long been a pet project of Bezos, who was almost the sole funder of the company in its early years. Focused on tourism, rather than scientific inquiry, the company is best known for its slow technological development in comparison with its main competitor, SpaceX (another space tourism vehicle, launched by the Trump adviser and mega-donor Elon Musk); for the giggle-inducing obscenelook of its rockets; and for its periodic publicity stunt flights featuring celebrities (William Shatner has alsotaken the ride). Bezos’s Amazondonated $1mto Trump’s most recent inauguration, and he intervened during the 2024 election tostop the Washington Post, the newspaper he owns, from endorsing Kamala Harris; the Trump administration, for its part, just awarded Blue Origin a contractworth more than $2bn.Once, Nasa was the pride of the American experiment: a testament to how a society dedicated to legal equality and passionate hard work could expand the horizons of human possibility. Now,Blue Originis a testament to the corruption and circumscribed possibilities of the profit motive run amok. Space used to be a frontier for human exploration, a fount of innovation, and a symbol of a bright, uncertain and expansive future. Now, it is a backdrop for the Instagram selfies of the rich and narcissistic. The Blue Origin flight does not make me feel like humanity will reach new heights of achievement. It makes me feel like everything that is coming is grimly predictable, tailored to the impulses of the richest, least responsible and least morally intelligent people on Earth.But the flight, and its grim promotional cycle, might be most depressing for what it reveals about the utter defeat of American feminism. Sánchez, the organizer of the flight, has touted the all-female crew as a win for women. But she herself is a woman in a deeply antifeminist model. It is not her rocket company that took her and her friends to the edge of space; it’s her male fiance’s. And it is no virtue of her character that put her inside the rocket – not her capacity, not her intellect and not her hard work – but merely her relationship with a man. (The fact that the rocket itself looks so phallic does not help to lessen the flight’s message that the surest way for women to raise themselves in the world is to attach themselves to a man.)There are at least two women on the mission who can be credited as serious persons: Aisha Bowe, an aerospace engineer, and Amanda Nguyen, a civil rights entrepreneur whose past work withNasamakes her something closer to an actual astronaut. But most of the crew’s self-presentation and promotion of the flight has leaned heavily on a vision of women’s empowerment that is light on substance and heavy on a childlike, girlish silliness that insults women by cavalierly linking their gender with superficiality, vanity and unseriousness.In aninterview with Elle, the crew members paid lip service to the importance of women, and particularly women of color, in Stem. (The Trump administration has forced Nasa to close some offices in order to comply with its ban on the diversity, equity and inclusion programs that would recruit such candidates.) But mostly, they seemed interested in talking about their makeup and hair. “Space is going to finally be glam,” Katy Perry said, bizarrely. “Let me tell you something. If I could take glam up with me, I would do that. We are going to put the ‘ass’ in astronaut.”So Katy Perry went to space. Wasn’t there anyone else we could have sent? | Zoe WilliamsRead more“Who would not get glam before the flight?!” asked Sánchez, who evidently can’t imagine that women might prioritize anything else. “We’re going to have lash extensions flying in the capsule.” Bowe, too, joined in, saying that she had gone to extreme lengths to make sure that she would be, of all things, well coiffed for the experience. “I skydived in Dubai with similar hair to make sure I would be good,” she said. “I took it for a dry run.”It is not misogynist to say that these women do not have their priorities in order. Rather, it is misogynist of them to so forcefully associate womanhood with cosmetics and looks, rather than with any of the more noble and human aspirations to which space travel might acquaint them – curiosity, inquiry, discovery, exploration, a sense of their own mortality, an apprehension of the divine. These women, who have placed themselves as representatives for all women with their promotion of the flight – positioning themselves as aspirational models of femininity – have presented a profoundly antifeminist vision of what womankind’s future is: dependent on men, confined to triviality, and deeply, deeply silly.Is this the future that awaits women in Donald Trump’s America: one where the only way to achievement is through sexual desirability, the only way to status as an ornamental attachment on a man who really counts, the only subject on which we are qualified to speak is whether lash extensions will stay in place? If this is the future, count me out. On the other hand, the notion of being launched off of such a grim and sexist Earth is looking more and more appealing.Moira Donegan is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsBlue OriginOpinionJeff BezosFeminismAmazonTrump administrationNasaWomencommentShareReuse this content"

So why does the world feel so precarious?Tue 15 Apr 2025 07.30 EDTLast modified on Tue 15 Apr 2025 12.16 EDTShareChin up, everyone. Things may seem grim at the moment but a billionaire has swooped in to reassure everyone – particularly impecunious young people – that everything is going to be OK. Better than OK, in fact. According to JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, despite the current economic and political instability, gen Z should be grateful for what will be a very bright and AI-enhanced future.“These kids, anyone who’s depressed – as long as we don’t have nuclear war – they’re going to have an unbelievable life,” Dimon said in arecent interviewwithFox News. “People say the next generation’s in bad shape,” he added. “Really? They’re going to inherit a country that’s worth two [or] three hundred trillion dollars. They’re probably going to live to 120; AI is going to cure some cancers … They shouldn’t be bemoaning their situation.”I am not a gen Z kid by any means – I am a geriatric millennial with creaky knees – but I’m definitely depressed about the state of the world. And I’m sorry, Mr Dimon, but I’m not going to stop my moaning. To be clear, I’m not trying to say I know better than the “King of Wall Street”. I am a humble freelance journalist, not a titan of industry. I don’t know how to run an enormous financial institution that rakes in huge profits during the good times and gets bailed out by taxpayersduring the bad times. I would never presume to know more about economics than the CEO of the biggestbank in the world.But there are a few things that I do know that Dimon, for all his infinite wisdom, doesn’t seem to have fully grasped. When you are a billionaire with a collection of palatial homes, someone who crisscrosses the world in private jets fraternising with other members of the 1%, you can quickly become a teeny bit out of touch. Insulated from normal-people problems by your bags of money, you can lose sight of some very basic issues. And that means when you go on Fox News and tell everyone how great everything is, you can sound like a bit of a pillock.Since Dimon seems to have a hard time understanding why so many people are struggling to cope – and why gen Z reportsthe poorest mental healthof any generation – let me spell out a few things that should be pretty obvious. The first being that the US, along with the rest of the world, hasa housing crisis. Houses in the US arenow 47% more expensivethan they were in 2020;wages, meanwhile, are fairly stagnant. Recent graduates tend to have mountains of student debt and are entering apretty dismal job market. Food prices have gone through the roof. In short: not great!Some of these recent graduates will struggle for a bit and then inherit assets from their parents and be fine. This is the so-calledGreat Wealth Transferthat Dimon was alluding to when he was talking about gen Z inheriting trillions. But not everyone has rich parents who are going to leave them a bunch of cash. Indeed, according to one analysis, the top 1.5% in the US will account for42% of wealth transfersthrough 2045. The Great Wealth Transfer will simplyexacerbate inequality. Dimon is right that some gen Zers will lead unbelievable lives of unparalleled luxury: they’ll go on rides around space, have access to cutting-edge medicine, and may well live until they’re 120. They’ll reap all the benefits of technological advances. But the “they” that Dimon keeps referring to are going to be a privileged few. AI will be utilised to save some people’s lives and – this is already happening – be harnessed by military contractors toshorten other people’s.I think what people like Dimon really can’t understand – what his unconscionable layers of wealth insulate him from – is how precarious the modern world feels to so many of us. I live a comfortable life. I own a house in the US. I am far more privileged than most Americans. Yet it feels as if everything is crumbling around me; that every single facet of life is getting worse. On a local level, my library and public transit system are being hit with devastatingbudget cuts. More broadly, people are beingthreatened with deportationfor airing their political views. Meanwhile, the climate crisis seems to be creeping ever closer. You think I care about living to 120? Like many people, I’m just trying to get through the next 24 hours.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Welcoming a family member is a precious moment and this was going to be a special trip. But what would have become an incredible memory – seeing our grandson for the first time – wassnatched from usbefore we reached the baggage carousel.Arriving at passport control, all seemed well. I handed my passport to a polite immigration official who put it into the computer system, and then paused. At this point I realised that something had beenflagged up.After being led off to a room for questioning, I was interviewed and my luggage was thoroughly searched. After three hours I was simply told that I was denied entry, andwas bundled on to the next flight back to London. My passport was only returned after I landed in the UK and left the plane.Throughout all this, I felt two overriding emotions: anguish, at not being able to see my family and meet my grandson; and confusion. At no point was I toldwhyI was being deported. Without a satisfactory answer from the Chinese government – which hassimply affirmedthat “the Hong Kong SAR [special administrative region] government has the authority to handle individual cases of entry” – I must draw my own conclusions. The most alarming is that I was denied entry because of my role as a British parliamentarian, and one who haslevelled criticism at Beijingfor its human rights abuses.Revealed: Chinese researchers can access half a million UK GP recordsRead moreI don’t shy away from championing democracy and civil liberty. They are values that I hold dear, and whichhave shaped my life. I will never forget dancing with friends on the Berlin Wall as it – together with the dictatorship that built it –crumbled. They are values, though, that are under increasing threat. The optimism of the 1990s has been replaced by a belated recognition: that we must renew and protect our values in the face of a new, rising tide of authoritarianism.Last Thursday I saw a sliver of that newly emboldened authoritarianism. It is opaque and impenetrable, and it does not offer explanations. Its tools are intimidation and obfuscation. The implications for the UK are stark. We need to be clear-eyed about the threats posed by the Chinese government – and we must take action to mitigate these threats.Ministers should not simply accept this lack of transparency as the cost of doing business. We must be direct: if you will not be straight and don’t answer legitimate questions we cannot engage with you on the basis of mutual trust. That’s why, until we get a clear answer on why I was deported, no government minister should be visitingChinaon official business.We must also address therisks posedto us at home. This should begin with the government taking immediate steps to prevent the further expansion of China’s security apparatus in the UK by, once and for all,blocking proposalsfor anew Chinese “super embassy”. It seems obvious that a base for potential “spy dungeons” shouldnot be builton the site of the former Royal Mint, on the City’s doorstep – but this government has inexplicably refused to rule it out.Senior Labour figures call for review of Chinese investment in UK infrastructureRead moreThe crisis over the Scunthorpe steelworks should alsoraise fresh concernsabout the role of Chinese interests in our national infrastructure. The decision by British Steel’s owners, Jingye, toturn downthe government’s £500m offer to support the plant’s future precipitated the near collapse of the UK’s virgin steel production last week. We cannot find ourselves in a similar position again: scrambling to save a vital domestic industry that has been left to struggle by corporations based in foreign countries which do not share our interests or ideals.This adds urgency to Liberal Democrat proposals for an audit of UK-based assets owned by companies or officials from countries listed as Foreign Office human rights priorities, including China. The government should include a commitment to this in its ownUK-China audit– the publication of which, originally expected early this year, should now be completed urgently as we face new geopolitical uncertainties.Our response to the Trump administration’s unreliability mustn’t be to throw ourselves into the arms of authoritarian states like China. We must continue to stand up for our values and interests. If the government refuses to stand tall now, when will it?Wera Hobhouse is the Liberal Democrat MP for BathExplore more on these topicsChinaOpinionForeign policyForeign, Commonwealth and Development OfficeAsia PacificcommentShareReuse this content"

Labour must now listen to them and offer a radical alternativeTue 15 Apr 2025 10.30 EDTLast modified on Tue 15 Apr 2025 13.47 EDTShareBritish Steel isheading for nationalisation– against the will of the government. This is an important point, because it speaks to dogma colliding with practical reality. Here is a private company defeated by the “sink or swim” laws of the free market ideology that produced it, demanding instead that taxpayers come to its rescue – by threatening to make shortsighted business decisions with damaging consequences for the country’s future. What happened in Scunthorpe is not an outlier in the failed experiment of privatisation, and the government’s emergency takeover tells us that public ownership is a realistic solution if there is a political will.Here’s another example: water. Even the City editor of the Financial Times – hardly a bastion of radical socialism –concluded that its privatisationlooked like “little more than an organised rip-off”. Since privatisation in 1989, water companies have piled up more than £60bn in debt, while our water bills have continued to rise. Yet despite rivers and seas being blighted with raw sewage, and the loss of1tn litresof water from leaky pipes in 2021 alone, shareholdersraked in more than £85bnsince this most basic of human necessities was flogged off.On both British Steel and water, Nigel Farage outflanked Labour – from the left. That this Thatcherite former City trader demanded British Steel’s nationalisation as he posed with steelworkers, and called for Thames Water to go bust, is testament to how unpopular privatisation is.A poll last yearfound that 82% of Britons thought water should be publicly run – compared with 8% who believed in privatisation, which is half as many as those who think themoon landings were staged. Three-quarters believe rail and mail should be publicly run, with more than seven in 10 backing nationalised energy.But as with the banks in 2008, nationalisation is treated as a reluctant emergency measure. Starmer backed nationalisation of the natural monopolies during his leadership campaign. Indeed, he told the BBC’s Andrew Neil in 2020 thatnationalisation of those industrieswas a pledge that would appear in Labour’s next manifesto. But the following year, he told theBBC’s Laura Kuenssbergthat he “never made a commitment to nationalisation”, itself testament to his pathological dishonesty. It’s true that Labour hascommitted to nationalising rail, but after the resignation of transport secretary, Louise Haigh – who genuinely believed in public ownership – what that will mean in practice is highly questionable, especially if an increasingly austerity-driven government starves it of investment.Public ownership shouldn’t be a last resort. From the banks to the myriad private contractors feeding off state largesse – such as Serco, which wasfined more than £19mafter billing taxpayers for tagging prisoners who were dead – private ownership has repeatedly failed. What’s now missing is a positive vision of what public ownership could look like in the 21st century. A lot of the blame needs to be directed at Peter Mandelson’s grandfather – a chap named Herbert Morrison, who developed Labour’s form of nationalisation after the second world war. That model was top-down and undemocratic. Most of the board members of the newly nationalised industries were just brought over from their privately run predecessors. The first chair of the National Coal Board, for example, was a former coal baron named the 1st Viscount Hyndley. These industries were kept at arm’s length and run on a commercial basis.In 1946, one Liberal politician had a pointwhen he saidthat a miner who went to work in this newly nationalised industry “will see the same manager, the same deputy, the old roadway, the same coalface and, on Friday, he will probably be paid by the same man”. There was never any genuine public enthusiasm for privatisation, but this undemocratic system meant that Margaret Thatcher won passive acquiescence by arguing: “What earthly sense is it that families should have a millionth share in some nationalised industry which is indifferent to their needs and wishes?”Labour has done right by British Steel – now it must speed up a radical strategy for all industry | Polly ToynbeeRead moreA democratic alternative is surely possible, where representatives of workers and consumers play a key role in running industries. In French cities such as Paris, for example, the water supply was privatised from the mid-1980s onwards, and prices soared. When it was taken back under public ownership, a board of directors was installed that included elected city councillors, trade union representatives and members of environmental non-government organisations. The Observatoire parisien de l’eau is an assembly representing civil society that oversees the board’s decisions. Not only have water billsfallen by 8%andleakage levels halved, but the cityoffers taps with sparkling water.Rather than handing power to unaccountable bureaucrats, public ownership could be part of a new vision of democratising society – taking back control, if you will. The disillusionment with democracy, after all, has so much to do with governments hiving off their functions to markets, and then claiming impotence in the face of change. Privatisation never forged the popular capitalism promised by the “Tell Sid” British Gas advertising campaigns of the 1980s: by 2022,just 10.8%of UK shares were owned by individuals, down from28.2% in 1981. Rather than handing wealth and power to the people, privatisation helped forge a model defined by low growth whose diminished proceeds disproportionately swell the bank accounts of a tiny few.Handing power to the people away from the elites is a message that will resonate in an age of mass disillusionment. Alas, Labour has vacated so much space that even Farage can posture as an economic radical by comparison. That is a travesty. But asBritish Steeland flailing water profiteers underline, the old order is dying; its morbid symptoms are everywhere. What is needed now are politicians with the imagination and determination to build something else.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsPrivatisationOpinionPublic financeLabourKeir StarmerBritish SteelUtilitiesThames WatercommentShareReuse this content"

You’ve heard of one small step for man? This was one giant leap backwards for womankind. I’m kidding, I’m kidding! What could be more empowering or something than watching Lauren Sánchez make going to space sound like brunch with the girrrrrls.Sally Ridecould never.Anyway, if you missed this, Jeff Bezos’s fiancee took an11-minute trip to the edge of spaceon one of his Blue Origin craft on Monday, alongside some all-female passengers – sorry, “crew” – who included CBS anchor Gayle King and pop star Katy Perry. So yes: theWoman’s World videois no longer the most plastic feminist thing Katy’s done.Given the mixture of freebie rides and seats sold to the super-rich, the thing people always say about Blue Origin tickets is that prices range from zero to$28m dollars. A bit like a seat on a RyanAir flight to Tallinn. But these spots were all personally gifted by Bezos and Sánchez because this was an Important Mission. Which also meant the whole thing was exclusively documented by Blue Origin’s Pravda-like web channel. Here, the anchors and reporters kept explaining that – unlike when men went to space in the past – this mission was all about emotions. But look, it’s great that we’re valorising emotions above all things, because it gives me permission to say how very much I hated this entire, hilariously vacuous spectacle.Lauren already bills herself as a children’s author, helicopter pilot, journalist and philanthropist, and kept being told she was adding “astronaut” to the world’s longest multi-hyphenate. How did she find the trip? “I don’t really have the words for this, like … ?” OK but can you at least try? “I can’t put it into words but I looked out the window and we got to see the moon.”Back at the viewing platform in the West Texas desert, commentary was provided by, among others, Kris Jenner and a bottom-tier Kardashian (Khloé). Khloé glossed the moment of landing with the words: “it’s literally so hard to explain right now”. Other insights? “There’s one woman whose grandfather is back there and he is 92 and they didn’t even have transportation back then.” I mean, the guy was literally pre-horse. Historic scenes.View image in fullscreenKaty Perry kisses the ground on her return to Earth.Photograph: BLUE ORIGIN/AFP/Getty ImagesAmid extremely stiff competition, the most hardcore gibberish emanated from Perry, who served up an entire word salad bar involving the “feminine divine” and being “super-connected to love”. “It’s about making space for future woman,” she explained. “It’s about taking up space.” Imagine going to actual space and talking instead about therapy-speak “space”. When Buzz Aldrin beheld the surface of the moon, he described it as “magnificent desolation”. Honestly, if he wanted to feel desolation he could have just tuned into this corner of West Texas on Monday afternoon. When a Stem advocate came for her post-flight interview, we got to see the apparently lobotomised reporter shriek: “How do you look perfect after just going to space?!”In truth, how the women looked had been an overwhelming part of the buildup, and by their own design. In an Elle magazine joint interview with the passengers, Lauren showed off the hot space suits she’d personally commissioned, inquiring rhetorically: “Who would not get glam before the flight?” “Space is going to finally be glam,” agreed Perry. “Let me tell you something. If I could take glam up with me, I would do that. We are going to put the ‘ass’ in astronaut.” A former Nasa rocket scientist said: “I also wanted to test out my hair and make sure that it was OK. So I skydived in Dubai with similar hair to make sure I would be good – took it for a dry run.” Still want more? Because there was SO much of it. “We’re going to have lash extensions flying in the capsule!” explained Lauren. “I think it’s so important for people to see us like that,” explained a civil rights activist. “This dichotomy of engineer and scientist, and then beauty and fashion. We contain multitudes.Womenare multitudes. I’m going to be wearing lipstick.”Ooof. I always thought space travel was futuristic, but this was the first time it came off as travelling back in time, in this case using their little capsule to take us back to the most ludicrous inanities of 2010s girlboss feminism.Ultimately, it felt like a sign of the times that everything was about personal growth rather than affording any new understanding of wider humanity. As King put it: “I’m so proud of me right now.” Everyone, bar none, talked in whatever trite solipsism language has been reduced to by a permanent diet of social media self-care. It all made me realise how much I miss humans not permanently crying on TV, and being able to find words that don’t sound like they could be printed above a picture of a crossroads sign on Instagram, or maybe some sandy footprints on a beach.Having oh-my-godded her way through some pure gibberish, Lauren eventually announced that she’d learned: “We’re all in this together. We’re so connected.” Agreed. In which spirit, please please please could Amazon pay full and fair tax in all the territories in which it, one of the world’s biggest companies, operates? Such an act of connection truly would be your and Jeff’s gift to our planet that you apparently just got some kind of a perspective on whileKaty Perrywas floating around during the zero-gravity bit pushing towards the camera a butterfly printed with her next tour dates. Why do I feel like the most meaningful thing to come out of this will be a three-minute song called Space Cowgirl? Forget the right stuff.

It’s the antithesis of gay culture – so why do I love her?Tue 15 Apr 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 15 Apr 2025 11.51 EDTShareAs a self-evidently gay man, I’ve generally been spared the awkwardness of coming out. That was, until I became a Swiftie. In recent years I have become adept at gauging the temperature of a room before revealing my predilection. Is this a safe space? Will I be sidelined or treated as a pervert because of who I choose to love? Should I lie, or just be evasive? I want to live authentically, but at what cost?Taylor Swift is at once the closest thing we have to a monoculture and the most divisive pop star of modern times. As a self-identified Swiftie, I believe her gift lies in the ability to take hyper-specific experiences and render them universal. I’ve never performed a 149-date world tour while reeling from the heartbreak of having been ghosted by Matty Healy of the 1975, but listening to I Can Do It With a Broken Heart, her song about that indignity, has helped me put on a brave face when faced by life’s more quotidian challenges. By writing a 10-minute epic about her three-month fling with Jake Gyllenhaal, Taylor gives fans space to mourn our own failed situationships or private disappointments – however fleeting or insignificant they may appear to others.When I come out as a Swiftie, I’m generally met by one of two reactions. It’s either “she saved my life” or “are you joking?” Gay men tend to lean towards the latter. This despite being a demographic typically enthralled by female pop stars, whether they’re “main pop girls” or had two “blink and you miss them” hits 15 years ago (Alexis Jordan, thank you for your service). I’ve tangled with what makes Taylor an exception to this rule. Gay culture thrives on camp and irony, whereas Taylor is aggressively earnest. Her music is designed less for the club and more for yearning over a boy you double-messaged in 2015 and never heard back from.Typically, gay men like to be perceived as tastemakers, considering anything once cool to be tragic the second it hits the mainstream. We police celebrities with the same critical eye that we cast on ourselves (try having self-esteem when gay Twitter has you convinced that Chris Pratt has a “dad bod”). Taylor is unavoidably uncool: the consensus is that she is allergic to “serving” on a red carpet and has a charming dorkiness which no cavalry of stylists seems equipped to eradicate.From Judy Garland to Britney Spears, gay men tend to idolise stars with tragic backstories, equating their struggles with our own, and finding strength in their strength. Taylor is the furthest thing from an underdog. While Mariah Carey says her sister attempted to pimp her when she was 12, Taylor was raised by bankers on a Christmas tree farm and given a gender-neutral name in order to succeed in corporate America (as she arguably has). Her own perceived sense of victimhood centres on tales of high school ostracism and being interrupted by Kanye West at an awards show in 2009 – an event that has been referenced on four of her subsequent albums, most recently last year. (OK, maybe there is something inherently camp about publicly nursing a 16-year grudge.)Taylor Swift: You Need to Calm Down – videoUnlike Madonna or Lady Gaga, she hasn’t explicitly cultivated a gay audience. Her 2006 debut included the lyric: “So go and tell your friends that I’m obsessive and crazy / That’s fine, I’ll tell mine you’re gay.” That version was withdrawn, resulting in a much-memed eBay listing for a “Taylor Swift debut CD (homophobic version)”. In 2019, she was inspired to write the Lover single You Need to Calm Down after a friend pointed out that her position on gay rights was unclear. With lyrics such as “Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD?” – referencing the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation – the result was well-meaning but heavy-handed. She played New York City’s Stonewall Inn for a surprise Pride month performance, but her activism stalled soon after. In a relative absence of a consistent stance on the matter, some Swifties – or “gaylors” – have constructed elaborate conspiracy theories about a supposed secret relationship between Taylor and supermodel (and former BFF) Karlie Kloss (arguably two of the straightest women to have ever lived).Taylor Swift’s people shut down speculation about her sexuality – but risked rebuking her LGBTQ fansRead moreI wonder whether the resistance goes deeper. Gay culture encourages us to evolve, reinvent and leave the past behind: if society says you are unworthy for long enough, you start to believe it. The skinny bullied child transforms into a muscled Adonis, essentially becoming the boys we feared in high school. Taylor’s Eras tour embraced all her previous incarnations, however messy or cringe those teenage corkscrew curls and fairytale ballgowns were. Perhaps her refusal to erase her awkward history is confronting for her gay male fans to witness. What if we could all regard our past selves, however naive or clumsy, with tenderness instead of embarrassment?I love being queer. But being in gay spaces can evoke complicated feelings. There’s joy at having found a sense of belonging that many of us were denied growing up, coupled with the insecurities that arise when a traumatised community starts to eat itself – imposing impossible standards about what counts as hot, aspirational or cool. For me, watching the Eras tour was a comparatively simple pleasure. Surrounded by demented Swifties as I honked along to We Are Never Getting Back Together, I was undeniably cringe. But for three hours, I was free.Explore more on these topicsTaylor SwiftPop and rockLGBTQ+ rightscommentShareReuse this content"

Mahdi had been convicted and sentenced for the 2004 killing of an off-duty law enforcement officer.One month before his execution, South Carolinaput Brad Sigmon to deathusing the same method. He was the first person since 2010 to be killed by the firing squad. Both Mahdi and Sigmonchosethe firing squad from a menu of three ways to die, the others being lethal injection and the electric chair.Five days after Sigmon’s execution, Idahobecamethe first state in the country to make the firing squad its primary method for putting people to death. It isone of five states, along with Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Utah, where it is an authorized execution method.These developments suggest that death by firing squadis gradually returningto the capital punishment landscape in this country. But as Sigmon’s lawyer, after witnessing his execution,remarked: “It is unfathomable that, in 2025, South Carolina [or any other state] would execute one of its citizens in this bloody spectacle.”But whether unfathomable or not, the return of the firing squad is, at best, a mixed blessing for death penalty supporters.On the one hand, it allows death penalty states that have had difficulty obtaining lethal injection drugs to get back into the execution business.South Carolinais one example of this development.At the same time, the resurrection of the firing squad serves as a vivid and troubling reminder of the brutality of state killing. As such, itundermines the legitimating storyof capital punishment in the United States.Death penalty advocates have tied capital punishment’s fate to technological progress in our capacity to killAs proponents of the death penalty tell it, that story is one of adaptation and progress. Our methods of execution, they believe,have become more civilized. The United States has moved from one method of execution to another in a quest to find a means of putting people to death that wouldsquare with the constitution’s prohibitionof cruel and unusual punishment.Over the past century and a quarter, rather than being uneasy about the novelty of an execution method, pro-death-penalty forceshave tried to sell it as an advantage. They havetied capital punishment’s fateto technological progress in our capacity to kill.The focus on technology as a way of sidelining the moral question of whether we should use the death penalty at allis a characteristically American view, dating at least to the 19th century. That is why, unlike other death penalty countries, which tend to stick with one execution method over long periods of time, we have substituted one method for another or added new methods so that now, six execution methodsare legal and authorized in this country.In advocating for various methods, death penalty supporters have focused on two supposed virtues: novelty, and the reduction of pain. A recent example is the embrace of nitrogen hypoxia inAlabamaandLouisiana, which might appear to fit that narrative.First, it is novel. The country’s first use of nitrogen hypoxiaoccurred in January 2024, when Alabama executed Kenneth Eugene Smith.Second, as Scientific Americannotes: “At the hearings [in Alabama] where the method was introduced, legislators heard stories of pilots and scuba divers dying when they accidentally breathed pure nitrogen instead of the proper mix of nitrogen and oxygen.” Their deaths were quick, proponents of nitrogen hypoxia claimed.An Oklahoma legislator who introduced the bill authorizing nitrogen hypoxia in his stateargued: “The process is fast and painless. It’s foolproof.”Mikal Mahdi killed by firing squad as South Carolina pushes execution spreeRead moreThe promise that execution will be fast and painless is also one reason for the firing squad’s revival. One example of that promise is provided by the law professor Deborah Denno, whosays: “The firing squad is the only current form of execution involving trained professionals, and it delivers a swift and certain death.”She cites“a 1938 Utah study – the only one of its kind”, which “monitored an inmate while he was being executed by a firing squad and it showed the death occurred in under a minute”.That is why“it really should be brought back … if we’re going to continue to have the death penalty.”CNNquotes another expert, Dr Jonathan Groner, a professor of surgery at Ohio State University College of Medicine, who claims that the firing squad “is thought to cause nearly instant unconsciousness … firing bullets into a person’s heart would instantly stop the blood flow to the brain, which, like a cardiac arrest, causes rapid loss of brain function”.Or, as the Idaho state representative Bruce Skaug, one of the sponsors of the recently enacted firing squad bill,explained: ​“At first when you hear firing squad, if you’re not familiar with the history, you think ​‘well, that sounds barbaric,’ is what I’ve heard from some … It is certain. It is quick.”Whether or not that is the case, this part of the story about the firing squad fits in well with the progress story about methods of execution. But it does not fit well with the story’s commitment to novelty in execution methods.Indeed, its use in this country dates back to 1608, when Capt George Kendall in Virginiawasexecuted for being a spy for Spain. And, as the New York Timesreports, during the civil war, “both Union and Confederate troops used firing squads to kill deserting soldiers. The executions were intended to inspire fear, as they were typically carried out in public.”Arizona’s execution pitted experts against politicians. Experts lost | Austin SaratRead moreOf all execution methods, the firing squad has been used the least. About 140 people have been executed that way in the US. That is about a tenth of the total number of lethal injection executions.The firing squad has been used so rarely because it is so violent. It mimics the very thing that it is meant to discourage.When states like Idaho or South Carolina bring back this relic of a bygone era, they signal the weakness, not strength, of the pro-death penalty forces at this moment in the history of capital punishment. Desperate to kill, they would take us “back to the future” in the world of execution methods.“The firing squad,” as Professor Corrina Lainobserves, “shows what the death penalty is, which is the state shedding blood in your name.”The execution of Mikal Mahdi was a vivid reminder of that fact. His death is just the latest moment for all of us “to know,” as the supreme court justice Sonia Sotomayorputs it, “the price of our collective comfort … before we blindly allow a state to make condemned inmates pay it in our names.”Austin Sarat, William Nelson Cromwell professor of jurisprudence and political science at Amherst College, is the author or editor of more than 100 hundred books, including Gruesome Spectacles: Botched Executions and America’s Death PenaltyExplore more on these topicsCapital punishmentOpinionSouth CarolinaUS supreme courtLaw (US)commentShareReuse this content"

Rules directing officials to investigate only half of alerts about suspected overpayments are rightly being ditched. In future, all reports will be checked, so that claimants can be notified and avoid getting into debt.This month’s lifting of the weekly earnings limit, from £151 to £196, is another step forward. Claimants can now work for the equivalent of 16 hours at the national living wage (NLW) without losing their entitlement to a carer’s allowance payment of £83.30. By pegging the earnings limit to the NLW, so that in future they rise in sync, ministers have made it less likely that pay rises will tip people unwittingly over the edge and into trouble. A government-ordered review by Liz Sayce, the disability expert, will soon make further recommendations, including what should happen to theoutstanding debtsthat are blighting lives.Ministers already know a good deal about the harm caused by years of official denial and obfuscation. It was nearly a decade ago that a DWP whistleblowerfirst raised concernsabout the way that those who overclaimed were being dealt with. He was wrongly fired, then reinstated, but debts and prosecutions kept mounting up. Currently, 144,000 claimants are in the process of repaying a total of £250m. A Guardian investigation last year revealed how hundreds of those with higher overpayments (more than £5,000) weretaken to court, accused of fraud.Thisterrible state of affairsshould never have been allowed. It is a stain on the record of the last government that more was not done to sort it out. As long ago as 2019, the National Audit Office found that most wrongful claims were the result of mistakes. In light of this, the DWP should have been proactive in tackling them, rather than insisting that claimants bore legal responsibility, or putting its faith in a technological fix that never materialised.Many of the 1 million people who receive carer’s allowance are already coping with very difficult circumstances, financially and in other ways. To be eligible in the first place, the person being cared for (almost always a relative) must be on disability benefits, and need at least 35 hours a week of help with tasks such as washing. Given that being out of work is thestrongest predictor of povertyfor unpaid carers, it has been utterly perverse to penalise them for weekly earnings above £151 – until last week the measly maximum.Unpaid carers, many of whom are middle-aged women, are not the solution to the wider, demographic challenge of an ageing and increasingly unhealthy population. A new funding formula for the formal social care sector is essential, andcannot be put off much longer. But care, in its broader sense, will always encompass help that is given voluntarily – as well as that which is paid for. Care is what goes on within families as well as what is provided by care workers and in institutional settings.These bonds between individuals and generations are part of the fabric of society. As well as the injustices it has exposed, the carer’s allowance scandal is about the troublingly low regard in which the DWP appears to hold them.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It remains determined to invent the future but is struggling to ensure its controlTue 15 Apr 2025 13.38 EDTLast modified on Tue 15 Apr 2025 13.49 EDTShareGlobalisation is out; reshoring is the new realism. Intel’s half-built Ohio campus andNvidia’s US supercomputer plandemonstrate the very different routes taken by Joe Biden and Donald Trump in the search for homegrown tech dominance. Mr Biden relied on institutions: grants, land and investmentincentives. That approach has stalled after last year’s election, renderingIntel’s plant idle. Mr Trump prefers court politics: flattery, pressure and tariff threats. Nvidia’s move seems driven less by design than executive ultimatum. Industrial strategy lives on – but, and this is a concern, increasingly throughpresidential menace, not policy.There’s another important message in the Nvidia announcement. In an era where ideas spread freely, power lies not in invention but inchokepoints, such as artificial intelligence supercomputer fabrication, that determine who can scale those ideas into global platforms. Remember that as the US braces for abacklashover the breakdown of the old trade order.The Harvard economist RicardoHausmannhas noted that Mr Trump’s miscalculation is focusing on goods trade, while ignoring the bigger game: services, intellectual property (IP) and investment. Boeing’s most profitable division isservices, not manufacturing – but both will be hit by China’s decision toblockfurther deliveries of its jets. Prof Hausmann warned that developing countries may retaliate by undermining the globalTrade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rightsagreement. Known as Trips, the IP regime stands behind $632bn in US overseas profits.If Mr Trump has a plan, it’s well hidden. But perhaps his strategy is simply this: if others want to copy yesterday’s technologies or challenge IP norms, let them. The US, by this logic, will just invent the next indispensable thing – and charge to access it. America is a leader in AI, biotech and platform services. But recent developments complicate this picture. Open-source AI such as China’sDeepSeekshows that frontier tech no longer needs a Silicon Valley address.In pharmaceuticals, a similar contradiction plays out. Eli Lilly’s blockbuster weight-loss drugMounjarohad its formula made public under Food and Drug Administration rules – the price of market access. That transparency fuelled a global flood of generics andcounterfeits. It’s the Trips dilemma: innovation demands openness, but imitation thrives where enforcement lags. Now, in a sharp escalation, the Trump administration has launched a national securityprobeinto pharma imports. China, India and the EU, all major exporters, are in US crosshairs.The deeper irony is that since 1945 the US has built its global position by championing openness – in science, trade and finance – yet it is now walling off supply chains and invoking security doctrines to shield its markets. Meanwhile, the very IP regime that helped extract “rents” from the world economy is under strain. The US may still dominate, but it’s on the defensive – onshoring production and securing chokepoints. In January, Mr Trumpthreatened100% tariffs on any country daring to sidestep the dollar – and hence powerful US Treasury sanctions.If developing countries begin to renege on Trips – no longer seeing value in enforcing patents in return for access to increasingly closed markets – the consequences will reach far beyond US firms. In 2023, Indiapaid $14bnto foreign entities for using IP, up from $1.9bn in 2009, without much meaningful benefit in return. For now, the US may still invent the future. But whether America can own it, monetise it or exclude others from it remains uncertain. The age of innovation may be global. The age of power, increasingly, is not.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Plus letters from others responding to the crisis at Chinese-owned British SteelTue 15 Apr 2025 11.44 EDTLast modified on Tue 15 Apr 2025 12.16 EDTShareThe plight of British Steel is an opportunity for a transformative change in the way steel is made (Editorial, 10 April). Blast furnaces depend on coal, and steelmaking emits well over a tonne of CO2for every tonne of steel, producing roughly a tenth of global CO2emissions. Using electric arc furnaces gets around this by recycling scrap metal, but doesn’t address the primary problem.There are promising alternatives. These include making steel with hydrogen, and more advanced options such as the all-electric projects being supported by the US’s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (Arpa-E). Scunthorpe is well placed for this, close to North Sea windfarms and able to exploit cheap surplus late-night electricity.An attractive way forward would be to sustain the blast furnaces for a few more years, replacing one with an electric arc furnace. Meanwhile, the UK’s university skills could be used to develop a more innovative all-electric iron-ore-to-steel process. By making hi-tech steels that are stronger, and persuading engineers to use them, consumption and emissions can be cut significantly.Steel is essential to Britain’s economy and security, and the government is right to protect steelmaking. But net zero is also essential to the planet’s security. Rather than abandoning the quest for net zero to perpetuate a loss-making and dying enterprise, the government has the option to foster real innovation: low-cost, low-carbon, world-leading.Euan G NisbetEmeritus professor, Royal Holloway, University of LondonPolly Toynbee highlights the fact that there are Conservatives who see the need for nationalisation in some circumstances (Labour has done right by British Steel – now it must speed up a radical strategy for all industry, 13 April). A prime example of this was when the Tory prime minister, Edward Heath, nationalised Rolls-Royce in 1971 when it was about to submerge in financial chaos. The principle of nationalisation when it is in the country’s interest was clearly established then.Robin DaviesTregarth, GwyneddThe acquisition ofBritish Steelin 2020 by the Chinese corporation Jingye was an example of economic globalisation on steroids. And see where it has got us.Such globalisation – both the offshoring and the acquisition of British strategic industries and public utilities by foreign corporations – has seen our industrial sovereignty sacrificed for short-term profit, with jobs lost, and increased costs to consumers.If one good thing comes from Donald Trump’s economic wrecking tactics, it will have been the end of globalisation – or at least its taming. And if the nationalisation of British Steel signals the beginning of the end for globalisation’s destructive impact on UK industry and jobs, I for one shall cheer. But will thisLabourgovernment be bold enough?Robert DewarKinlochleven, Inverness-shireEverything your editorial said about British Steel has an exact analogue with the petrochemical plant at Grangemouth. If that closes, Scotland will be one of very few oil-producing countries without its own refining industry.David PatrickEdinburghStrangely, the government didn’t move toward nationalisation when Tata declared the demise of the blast furnaces at Port Talbot.Polly LlwynfedwenLlanfaes, AberhondduDo you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

Yet part 3’s environmental delivery plans allow developers to pay an unquantified levy for vague restoration, sidestepping the Environment Act’s principles of prevention and precaution, and risking irreversible harm to our iconic ecosystems such as chalk streams and woodlands.The bill’s “overall improvement test” rests on weak “likely” benefits outweighing harm, ignoring scientific evidence, bypassing existing safeguards and failing to guarantee delivery of biodiversity gains. This may court illegality under the Berne convention, while complex levies and surveys could delay the housebuilding we need and lead to a “cash to trash” system.Ministers promised a win-win for nature and development, but without amendments that ensure benefits precede harm and mandating “significant, measurable” gains – this is a loss for both. This isn’t obstructionism. It’s a plea for due process.MPs must pause part 3, consult widely and align this legislation with the spirit and substance of the Environment Act and the climate and nature bill.

They were unable to hold the ball and command through possession as they might have liked but they always had clear water. There were spells, though, when they were distinctly uneasy and, but for an own goal that came at just the right time for them, this might have been a very awkward evening.“I had a feeling something like that would happen today because I know the stadium well,” said the Barça manager, Hansi Flick, once of Bayern. “Things didn’t go too well for us, but Dortmund played very well. The things we played out weren’t what we normally do.” It was a tie, though, that raised doubts about Barcelona as potential champions. There is much to admire about Flick’s Spanish league leaders but theirs is a high-risk game and more precise opponents than Dortmund might have exposed them.Borussia Dortmund 3-1 Barcelona (agg: 3-5): Champions League quarter-final, second leg – as it happenedRead moreBarcelona’s 4-0 home win last week had in effect settled the tie. The result was that the buildup was notably convivial. As blue and garnet mingled with yellow and black outside the various pizzerias and pubs on a humid spring afternoon in the Alter Markt, there was a disorienting sense of wandering through the idealised world of an advert.If there was jeopardy for Barcelona it was only in conceding early – which they did. Twice in the past eight years they’ve squandered three-goal first-leg leads, to Roma and Liverpool. There were past traumas there for Dortmund to awake before the fury of the Yellow Wall. The 4-3-3 of last week was gone and its place Niko Kovac preferred a 3-4-2-1. The extra bodies in the middle allowed them to pressure Barcelona much more quickly and higher up the pitch than a week ago, and Flick’s side did not respond well.View image in fullscreenRobert Lewandowski celebrates after an own goal by Dortmund’s Ramy Bensebaini.Photograph: Matthias Schräder/APThe pace of Karim Adeyemi in an inside-left position caused problems and had created a couple of half-chances even before he laid in Pascal Gross, who was tripped by Wojciech Szczesny for a ninth-minute penalty. Guirassy converted. At that point, Barça were unexpectedly ragged, rattled by Dortmund’s intensity and an increasingly raucous atmosphere. The home side had five efforts on target within the opening 20 minutes. Flick’s decision to rest Pedri, the player who above all could perhaps offer control of possession, began to look an unwise gamble; by the time he came on after 59 minutes, the hectic tone had been set.The danger for Dortmund, and the hope for Barça, was that the home side would blow themselves out and, after Maximilian Beier had headed a Gross free-kick straight at Szczesny on the half hour, that was what happened. Without ever looking entirely assured, Barca seemed to have a measure of control by half-time.But the second half began with another Dortmund surge and a goal within four minutes, Guirassy heading his second from close range. Dortmund had hope but within five minutes it was gone, Fermin López’s cross thumped into his own net by Ramy Bensebaini. With that, some of the fire went out of Dortmund, at least until fine work from the substitute Julien Duranville led to Guirassy sweeping in his third with 14 minutes remaining. When Julian Brandt had the ball in the net three minutes later, Barca’s temperament might really have been tested, but he was ruled offside.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Although it tended to be lost in the 4-0 scoreline, Dortmund had also created chances last week: 13 of them, to go with 18 on Tuesday, which is a major problem for Barça. Like all Flick sides, they play with an extremely high line and that means they are vulnerable; their pressing only has to go fractionally awry for them to be extremely open, particularly to quick direct runners.That’s why they’ve conceded four this season in games against Osasuna, Benfica and Atlético. Two of those examples have come in the 24-match unbeaten run going back to the beginning of the year on which they came into this game, which says much for the potency of their forward line – but that may not be enough. “There are things we need to correct,” said the defender Ronald Araújo, “but we’re in the semi-finals. I’m happy because at another time, this game would have slipped away from us.”Whether Inter or Bayern come through Wednesday’s quarter-final, they will look at the way Barça struggled to deal with the press and the swathes of space behind their defensive line, and see opportunity.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueBorussia DortmundBarcelonamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Emery tapped his temples, reminding hisAston Villaplayers to stay focused, but, really, who was he kidding? Ezri Konsa had just side-footed a shot in off a post to earn Villa the lead on the night and, with the help of a tail wind from the Holte End, this stadium felt liftoff. And not for the first time. The noise was so loud and the atmosphere so fervent that it seemed worth checking on the foundations of this grand old ground.Villa won the match and, though they lost the tie, this was a night they will always remember. It is also an evening when, once they have fully digested the drama of rousing from 5-1 down on aggregate, they will surely reflect on the strides they have made, particularly under Emery. Villa inadvertently did so with an amusing faux pas in the moments before kick-off: someone presumably pressed the wrong button as the Europa and Conference League walk-on music boomed instead of the operaticChampions Leagueanthem as the players lined up on the pitch.PSG end Aston Villa’s European run after epic fightback falls just shortRead moreThat was so last year. Villa’s progress has been startling under Emery, who has assembled a band of diverse talents, a kind of School of Rock: from Marcus Rashford and Morgan Rogers to the bustling John McGinn, an inspirational captain, and the class of Youri Tielemans and Konsa, so often an understated key pillar. Six years ago this week Villa were coming off back-to-back wins in the Championship against Rotherham and Bristol City, preparing for a Good Friday trip to Bolton. Here they pushed PSG, according to Emery favourites for the competition, all the way, making light of the visitors’ advantage.When Konsa scored, Villa had 33‑plus minutes to find another goal. Ron Saunders’s old line, those immortal words in 1981, came to mind: “Do you want to bet against us?” Gianluigi Donnarumma made a superb right-hand save to prevent a slow‑motion Tielemans header looping in and then Marco Asensio – on as a substitute, following a return to warm-up mode after being primed to come on until McGinn struck – also had a shot saved.There was a glorious to-ing and fro-ing in an absorbing contest. Emery flung himself to the floor of his technical area, enveloped by his black hood, after Konsa went agonisingly close to meeting Rashford’s free-kick from the right. For practically the entire second half it felt entirely feasible that Villa might score with every attack.After the first leg at the Parc des Princes, Emery was asked what Villa would do differently in the second. “We will see, we will see,” he said. He was adamant that the tie was not dead. The only notable change was Amadou Onana replacing Jacob Ramsey, a midfield presence to stop PSG’s stream of passing triangles. Few envisaged Konsa securing the lead for Villa and afterwards going so close to another, especially after Nuno Mendes and Achraf Hakimi extended PSG’s buffer inside 27 minutes. And, despite their favourites tag, nothing is certain from here.View image in fullscreenUnai Emery roars his Aston Villa team on from the sideline.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianAs Emery had said, PSG have been pressing hard for 15 years to give them a shot at a trophy of such universal prestige. The next line, however, was probably the most telling. Emery spoke of PSG’s evolution into “a top team with a top coach and, in addition, a team spirit that fits the style of their manager”. He would know, having spent two years in the Paris goldfish bowl before departing, haunted bytheir collapse against Luis Enrique’s Barcelona.Villa were a midtable Premier League side at best until Emery took the reins almost two and a half years ago. At the end here Rogers lay on the turf and Emi Martínez, sitting on the edge of his 18-yard box, surveyed the scene for a while. But now Villa, who host Newcastle on Saturday, must recover and attack their remaining six league matches, fuelled by the carrot of returning to this stage.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Those who travelled across the channel in crammed camper vans made sure to pack crates of fireworks. Luis Enrique, in a bomber jacket, was uber‑relaxed on the eve of this match but by the end he was on the pitch feeding Ousmane Dembélé instructions to box off the tie.There was still time for Ian Maatsen to send a volley spinning towards the bottom corner of the PSG goal with 28 seconds of stoppage time to play, only for Willian Pacho to prevent the ball advancing. PSG simply did not expect a night quite like this. Villa, whose journey to this point began in earnest withthat boisterous win against Bayern Munich, hope there is a few more of these to come next season.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueAston VillaParis Saint-GermainanalysisShareReuse this content"

For all the noise and the narrative, for all that many have crumbled here against the European champions, the ­Arsenal manager insisted there is no fear and that his team are ready to step into the Bernabéu.Arteta reminded everyone of a simple fact lost at times over the past seven days: they do lead this tie, 3‑0. “If I had to pick one of the scenarios that I want the most, it would be this one,” he said.Jude Bellingham targets remontada on ‘night that’s made for Real Madrid’Read moreAsked if there was any fear, theArsenalmanager replied: “No, I wouldn’t use that word.” Instead, he talked of “respect, admiration and values, an inspiration for any team and any manager” and that was how he is framing this game: not as something to be scared of, although he admitted that it would be “­impossible” to completely block out the noise, and that the “narrative is fuel for them”, but something to aspire to. This is a night they must enjoy, Arteta said, and one that he would like to play in himself.It is also a game that he said they must approach as they did the first leg, with the aim not of protecting the three-goal lead they have but of beating Madrid again. They will do so with Ben White and Thomas Partey, who are available, but not Jorginho, who was unable to travel to Spain.“The feeling is excitement,” Arteta said. “We want to create history. We are trying to do something con­sistently, to start to dominate European competition. This is a great opportunity. For sure, we are convinced. When you want to create history, build a story, first of all you have to be excited, really prepared and really convinced about what you want to achieve. Then it is about insisting, going step by step.”If there was a word that has kept coming up over the past weeksince Arsenal beat Madrid 3-0 at the ­Emirates Stadiumin the first leg of this Champions League quarter‑final, it isremontada,comeback. It was repeated often to Arteta, too. He is aware of the swirl of noise around this game, how the momentum has built over the past seven days, a context created in which even Jude ­Bellingham called “weird”: it is as if, despite the advantage being ­Arsenal’s deficit, Madridwillgo through. That is about building belief at the ­Bernabéu; it is also of course about anxiety in their opponents.“It is part of their history and I understand it,” Arteta said. “They have the right to think of that ­scenario. Our mindset has to be different. We try to repeat the opposite message to what they have in the last 72 hours. We are close to the players. Hopefully that [message] is more powerful than anything else. But you have to be [out] there, go through it, experience it.”View image in fullscreenArsenal’s players line up for a pre-Real Madrid training drill.Photograph: Tolga Akmen/EPAAsked if Arsenal will look at moments in which Madrid have come back against other teams, Arteta said: “Of course. That’s part of the analysis of an opponent: to understand why it happened. There’s the quality they have, moments of uncertainty. You try to train that, to teach it, so that it doesn’t happen [to you].“They will try to take the game to a different place to where we want. We have to take the game to where we want and then adapt quickly to any scenario that takes us somewhere else. [The aim is] to win the game. The same as we did in London. We have to dominate things; be brave, be dominant, determined, to have the conviction that we can be better than them and win the game. That is clear in our mind and that is how we have to play tomorrow.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Winning the game didn’t matter, after all; winning the tie does. Why try to win? “Because it’s the way we feel most confident,” he replied. “It’s the way we play: to be better than the opponents so that the ­probability of winning the game is as high as possible. We try to understand what the opponent wants to do. The better we do that, the closer we are to the semi‑finals. The context of the result can’t change that too much because then the game will go somewhere that is not in our interests.”He continued: “There are physical, technical-tactical and emotional aspects and that emotional aspect is very important. That is very significant and I am reassured by what the team has done all season – in a positive context and in a very difficult context. We are convinced that [we can handle] any situation and we are going to enjoy any game that we face tomorrow.”The numbers, if not the narrative, are on Arsenal’s side: they have not conceded more than two goals for 79 games. “That convinces me that the team is prepared,” Arteta said. “It has been 172 days or something, but that doesn’t matter now. It is about proving it tomorrow, showing that the team is convinced, ready. And that’s what’s beautiful about football: let’s show it now. Let’s talk on the pitch: that is all that matters.”Explore more on these topicsArsenalMikel ArtetaReal MadridChampions LeaguenewsShareReuse this content"

That’s important for me.”Women’s football in France changing but Lyon-PSG duopoly hard to breakRead moreArsenal were punished in the latest international break, with the forwards Chloe Kelly and Alessia Russo forced to withdraw from the England squad through injury; it was “a little early” for the duo to return to face Leicester, Slegers said. The goalkeeper Daphne van Domselaar is a more long-term absentee after she sustained an ankle injury in the Netherlands’ 1-0 win over Austria.Despite the disruption, Arsenal were rampant against the Foxes and opened the scoring inside 10 minutes with Frida Maanum swinging the ball towards the back post, where Foord was on hand to turn in her first.Amandine Miquel’s Leicester have been much improved in the new year, having emerged from a crippling injury crisis that decimated their forward line in the first half of the season. However, while they have pulled seven points clear of bottom‑placed Crystal Palace, they have the worst away record in the league with just two points on the road.Any hopes that the side could improve that number against Arsenal, who have their Champions League semi‑final first leg against Lyon on Saturday, were quickly squashed as the hosts turned the screw. Slegers’s team had collected 17 wins and three draws from the 20 games in which they had scored first this season, and there was no sign of that changing in N5.View image in fullscreenCaitlin Foord scores Arsenal’s first against Leicester.Photograph: Ben Whitley/PAMiquel said Slegers’s management had “brought life” to Arsenal after replacing Jonas Eidevall. “She has found a way to have the players behind her, following her,” she said. “She has completely changed the team with the same players, which shows that the manager is very important.”Seven minutes after the opener the home team doubled their lead, Foord the instigator this time. The Australian turned and played the ball to the right where Mead swung a cross in for Blackstenius to send beyond the goalkeeper, Janina Leitzig.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Just after the half-hour they had a third, Foord shifting on to her right foot before lashing a deflected effort past a wrongfooted Leitzig.It was the first half Arsenal needed, one that allowed them to rotate and manage loading before two tricky Champions League encounters with the eight-time European champions.

At the hearing, Diamond admitted using “industrial language” and expressed frustration at himself. He also claimed to have been being “sarcastic” with officials with whom he shares a “kinship”.The Breakdown | Rugby World Cups aren’t adding up for major unions and there is no easy fixRead moreThe Rugby Football Union has ­introduced stricter sanctions at all levels of the game, including the ­Premiership, after almost 50% of match officials surveyed said they have been subjected to abuse in recent seasons.The incident took place after Newcastle’slate 17-15 defeat by Exeteron 29 March. The Chiefs were victorious thanks to a late Greg Fisilau try, but in the buildup, the Exeter centre Tamati Tua appeared to elbow the Falcons wing Alex Hearle in the head. The disciplinary judgment notes the force was such that Hearle’s mouthguard was dislodged and he has not played since.Diamond was aggrieved the incident was not reviewed and shortly afterwards, when walking past the referee, Adam Leal, and his assistants in the tunnel, said: “I hope you cunts can sleep tonight.”Diamond gave evidence that he remained calm throughout what he considered a private conversation.About 45 minutes later, while the TMO, David Rose, was having his post-match meal, Diamond told him: “You need to retire, you need to retire.”Two days later, Diamond sent emails to Rose and Leal apologising for his comments.The disciplinary panel found both comments constituted verbal abuse of match officials. The ­judgment states Diamond “does not blame anyone but himself”, but that he sought to explain the context of a match between the Premiership’s bottom two clubs “who are struggling financially”. The ­judgment also notes that the RFU’s head of professional game officials, Paul Hull, has indicated the incident involving Tua and Hearle ought to have resulted in a penalty for Newcastle.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Let’s be honest, I’ve got a six-week ban for saying an inappropriate ­comment – which I’ve apologised for – to a professional referee in complete privacy.“We understand we have to have regulation and understand I can’t say what I said, but there’s got to be some accountability otherwise people keep making mistakes.”Explore more on these topicsNewcastlePremiershipRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

Spurs play their quarter‑final second leg at Eintracht Frankfurt on Thursday, with the tie finely balanced at 1-1.Iraola has been identified as one of the leading domestic candidates to replace Postecoglou should the Tottenham chair, Daniel Levy, make a change, with Fulham’s Marco Silva and Brentford’s Thomas Frank also highly rated. Bournemouth have not held formal talks with Iraola but the club believe he will stay, particularly if the side qualifies for Europe for the first time.After six games without a win,Bournemouth defeated Fulham on Mondayto go eighth in the Premier League, which could yield a Conference League place.Iraola achieved Bournemouth’s record points tally of 48 last season and has matched that with six games remaining. His energetic football has won many admirers, although some have questioned whether the 42-year-old’s preference for counterattacking would translate to a side accustomed to dominating possession, such as Tottenham.Although Iraola is ambitious and wants to work at the highest level he is happy at Bournemouth, who give him considerable influence over transfers, backed by the data-led approach brought by Foley’s Black Knight Sports and Entertainment ownership group.The signings of Milos Kerkez, Dean Huijsen and Evanilson have been masterstrokes, and with Bournemouth comfortably inside the Premier League’s profitability and sustainability rules threshold the club can demand high prices this summer.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Weather-wise, it felt more like Plumpton in January than the home of Flat racing on the first afternoon of a new campaign.But the conditions could not dampen the sense of opening-day anticipation as the first of 2025’s Guineas hopefuls went to post for their Classic trials on the Rowley Mile, before a potential tilt at racing immortality back here in less than three weeks.The Craven meeting is all about the future, from the unraced juveniles breezing alongside the track in the morning before going under the hammer at Tattersalls a few hours later to the potential Group One winners blowing away the winter cobwebs on a course that staged the first race run under an official set of rules all the way back in 1666.On Tuesday, it was the turn of the three-year-old fillies with Classic aspirations as 10 runners lined up for the Nell Gwyn, including six with an entry in the1,000 Guineason 4 May. It was one of the other four that emerged in front, however, as John and Thady Gosden’s Zanzoun, a 9-1 shot, quickened one and three-quarter lengths clear of Celestial Orbit, also at 9-1, with the 20-1 chance Remaat back in third.View image in fullscreenZanzoun ridden by Kieran Shoemark winning the Nell Gwyn Stakes at Newmarket.Photograph: Ian Headington/racingfotos.com/ShutterstockZanzoun is certainly bred to win a Classic, with the uber-stallions Dubawi and Frankel on either side of her pedigree, but a trip to Paris for the Poule D’Essai Des Pouliches – the French equivalent of the 1,000 Guineas – seems a more likely target than the much shorter journey back down the road from the Gosdens’ yard in 20 days’ time.“That could well be the case,” John Gosden said. “There is a very good Aga Khan filly [Zarigana] we saw the other day in the Prix De La Grotte, but it’s lovely to win here and we’ve got nice plans to make.”Newmarket’s main Guineas trial for colts, the Craven Stakes over the full Classic trip of a mile, will be run here on Wednesday, but there was a likely runner in the2,000 Guineason the track before racing on Tuesday as Hugo Palmer took the chance to exercise Seagulls Eleven, a son of the trainer’s 2016 2,000 Guineas winner, Galileo Gold, on the Rowley Mile.Seagulls Eleven is a 50-1 shot for the Guineas but kept very good company as a juvenile, ending his two-year-old campaign with three runs in Group One company including a one-and-a-half-length third behind ­Scorthy Champ and Henri ­Matisse, the subsequent Breeders’ Cup ­Juvenile Turf winner, in the National Stakes at the Curragh.That form offers real hope to Palmer and Seagulls Eleven’s owners, a syndicate of current and former Brighton & Hove Albion players, that their £50k purchase – a relative pittance for a Guineas hope – will not be out of place among the best of his generation in next month’s Classic.None of the syndicate are likely to be there to watch him run, however, as Brighton are at home to Newcastle – Palmer’s team – on the Sunday of Guineas weekend, although the goalkeeper Jason Steele was at Newmarket for Tuesday’s gallop.“I’ve only won one Guineas and we brought his dad here to gallop as well, and they do look very similar,” Palmer said. “It’s a very open renewal, although Aidan [O’Brien] seems to sound like he’s basically got it won and he might only run one horse [Twain], and I do remember him saying that about Air Force Blue [the beaten favourite in 2016] as well.“I think we all think that footballers play 90 minutes of football on a Saturday and spend the rest of the time racing their Ferraris around but they are incredibly busy guys. All of them played for Brighton when we bought the horse, but a few have moved on. Brighton actually play Newcastle on 1,000 Guineas day, so I think they should all come here and get absolutely wrecked the day before.”Opera on song for the CravenEight of the nine runners in Wednesday’s Craven Stakes at Newmarket still hold an entry in next month’s 2,000 Guineas and half a dozen of those ended their juvenile season in Group One events, but the most interesting runner in the field is arguably Charlie Appleby’sOpera Ballo (3.35), who did not race at two and is stepping into Group-race company for the first time.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

About one-quarter of Europe’s burnt area last year came from devastating wildfiresin Portugal in September, which burned about 110,000 hectares in a single week.View image in fullscreenWildfires in Portugal destroyed more than 100,000 hectares in just seven days.Photograph: Susana Vera/ReutersFriederike Otto, a climate scientist at Imperial College London and co-lead of World Weather Attribution, who was not involved in the study, said the report “lays bare the pain Europe’s population is already suffering from extreme weather” at 1.3C of global heating above preindustrial levels.“We’re on track to experience 3C by 2100,” she said. “You only need to cast your mind back to the floods inSpain, the fires in Portugal, or the summer heatwaves last year to know how devastating this level of warming would be.”The report authors highlighted an “unusual” contrast between western and eastern Europe, with the west tending to be wet and cloudy and the east warm and sunny. River flows tended to be above average in western countries and below average in eastern ones. In several months last year, the Thames in the UK and the Loire in France experienced their highest flows in a 33-year record, the report found.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The authors also noted high temperatures north of the Arctic Circle, and the hottest sea surface temperature recorded in the Mediterranean.Froila Palmeiro, a climate scientist at the Euro-Mediterranean Center on Climate Change, who was not involved in the report, said the extremes “not only have a direct impact on their ecosystems, but also play a role in weather patterns affecting all of Europe”.Europe is warming twice as fast as the global average but has cut its planet-heating pollution faster than other big economies. The EU plans to hit net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, and is expected to also announce a net 90% reduction target for 2040 later this year.Thomas Gelin, a climate campaigner at Greenpeace EU, said the report showed that politicians had failed to hold fossil fuel companies accountable and stop the expansion of their polluting businesses.“The only parts of Europe that aren’t being boiled dry are being washed away in floods,” he said. “The EU must urgently update its climate targets to reflect the scientific reality, and put a stop to new fossil fuel projects as a first step to a full phase-out.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisSpainEuropeFloodingWildfiresExtreme weatherFossil fuelsnewsShareReuse this content"

They include a Biden-era screening tool created to identify disadvantaged communities that would benefit from federal climate and clean energy investments, and an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) mapping tool called EJScreen which showed the disparate burdens of pollution alongside socioeconomic indicators.The lawsuit also highlights the Department of Energy’s map of resources for energy affordability in low-income communities, and a Department of Transportation Equitable Transportation Community interactive map of transportation insecurity, climate risk and economic vulnerability. Another now defunct tool it spotlights: the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s future risk index, meant to help cities, states and businesses prepare for worsening extreme weather, which wasre-created by the Guardianlast month.“Simply put, these data and tools save lives, and efforts to delete, unpublish or in any way remove them jeopardize people’s ability to breathe clean air, drink clean water, and live safe and healthy lives,” said Ben Jealous, executive director of the Sierra Club.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That’s why different political choices need to be made.”The dispute in Birmingham, where the councildeclared itself effectively bankrupt in 2023, has been triggered by the council’s decision to cut a role from its bin lorry fleets, which it claims it needs to do to save money and prevent any future equal pay liability.There have been similar disputes in response to council cutbacks in other parts of the country.In Peterborough, theGMB unionhas been in dispute with the council over pay for workers in recycling and waste collection, street cleaning and parks maintenance, claiming they would be paid “just pennies over the national living wage”.A union spokesperson said members were “considering a revised pay offer” but that strikes were “on the table” in the dispute.In March, hundreds of workers at Aberdeen city council voted to back strike action to oppose a fire-and-rehire policy, as part of a dispute over a pay freeze and the implementation of a shorter working week.GMB said 88% of its members in non-education roles and 71% of janitorial staff in the city’s schools backed the move.In Sheffield, some bin workers have been on strike since last August in a dispute with their employer, Veolia, for their union to be recognised.Earlier this year, there was uproar in Devon, where the county council tried to change working conditions for more than 800 staff through fire-and-rehire. After a protest from the GMB Union, new terms and conditions were agreed by both sides.More than 100 refuse workers in Brighton voted in favour of industrial action over changes to normal working practices last year. This followed a 14-day strike in 2021, in which refuse collectors in the city successfully fought for a pay rise for low-paid workers.Last year, Unite held industrial action ballots at 23 councils and two organisations run by councils after members rejected the local government pay offer, and although the pay offer was later agreed, the union said it would carry out localised walkouts in areas where it had obtained a mandate to strike.Across the country councils are facing tough financial pressures. Arecent survey of town hall leadersfound that nearly two-thirds (63%) of councils were planning to reduce spending on services from April.As the strike in Birmingham drags on and concerns grow over similar action elsewhere, there are increasing calls for ministers to intervene.Graham criticised the government for taking “a huge amount of time to get involved in the dispute” between the union and Birmingham city council.Sarah Jones, the government’s business and trade minister, urged Unite to accept the deal. “Our message loud and clear is Unite need to call off the strike, accept the deal, and let’s get back to normal, which is what people expect and what people deserve,” she told BBC Breakfast.On Monday, Unite said its members in Birminghamvoted overwhelmingly againstwhat it described as a “totally inadequate” offer from the council. Further talks are planned for Wednesday.Late on Tuesday, the council claimed it was on track to clear the backlog of uncollected waste. As reported by BBC, Craig Cooper, its strategic director of city operations, said collections would focus first on “the poorest parts” of the city “affected the most” by the strikes.He expects services to return to “one household collection every week” by the weekend, despite there being 22,000 tonnes of waste currently uncollected.“We’re already back to collecting normal household waste this week,” he said. “We are back into a position of good control. The priority now is street cleansing and making sure the fly-tipping is at a manageable level.”Explore more on these topicsTrade unionsGMB unionUniteBirminghamLocal politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It is her latest attempt to become a leading figure on the radical right in Britain, openly declaring her support for Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s mission to slash state spending in the US.Truss made the revelation at a cryptocurrency conference in Bedford over the weekend. She said that she had been “cut off at the knees” when she became prime minister by “the elite”, which opposed radical change.“That has made me think that it’s not enough just to get into number 10,” she said. “What I’m now thinking is we need a media network to be able to communicate to people, to be able to have a grassroots movement that is actually really demanding change of our leaders.”She said she was worried about how issues were “suppressed or promoted” by the mainstream media, appearing to compare Britain to communist Russia. “This is the kind of thing that we used to see going on in the Soviet Union and it’s now happening to us and it is absolutely shocking that that is the case in modern Britain,” she said.“I do think this needs to be actively fought and what I am doing is establishing a new free speech network, which will be uncensored and uncancellable, to actually talk about the issues people don’t want to talk about.”Her attempt to create her own social media platform follows in the footsteps of Trump’s Truth Social, operated by the Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG). Investing in TMTG became a means by which individual investors showed their support for the US president. TMTG lost $400.9m (£303.5m) last year.The track record of UK political figures attempting to start their own social networks is not encouraging. The former health secretary Matt Hancock closed his Matt Hancock app in 2023, having launched it five years earlier to “promote a healthy, open and impartial debate”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Extra money would also come from abolishing regulators and quangos “who do so much to stifle business”, he said.Having backed the nationalisation of British Steel, Farage said a Reform government would aim to forge “a good partnership with the unions” – with the exception of teaching unions.He saidthe National Education Unionwanted to poison children’s minds “about everything to do with this country, its history, what it stood for and what it has fought for”.He claimed union members were “telling kids that Reform is a racist party, Reform is a bad party, and kids that speak out against that face disciplinary action”.Explore more on these topicsLocal electionsNigel FarageReform UKLabournewsShareReuse this content"

Some of his skin was used to bind a book about his trial which was passed to Moyse’s Hall Museum in Bury St Edmunds in the mid 1930s.However, a second copy of the book – believed to feature Corder’s skin on its spine and corners – was discovered last year on a bookshelf of the museum’s office, and is now on display alongside the original book. The second copy is believed to have been donated around 20 years ago.The case has spawned many film, radio and stage versions. “The murder continues to be interpreted and reinterpreted in popular culture to this day,” said Daniel Clarke, heritage officer at West Suffolk council.“The facts have been blurred into near obscurity” with nearly 200 years of the tale’s retelling, states themuseum’s website. Corder reportedly proposed meeting Marten at the Red Barn in Polstead, Suffolk, and eloping to Ipswich from there. He was later found guilty of murdering Marten at the barn.Deary, whose books have sold tens of millions of copies, said that the conviction was based on circumstantial evidence, and that Corder is a “very misunderstood man”. The displayed skin-bound books are “very disrespectful to Corder’s memory”.“I feel guilty because I have played Corder,” said Deary, who is also an actor. “I’ve got photographs of me threatening poor Maria Marten with a gun.”Deary has written a novel due to be released next year – titled Actually, I’m a Corpse – based on this experience, in which the hero plays Corder before realising “how badly the poor man’s been maligned”. He said that he would like to “restore Corder’s reputation”.Clarke said that the museum does not “deal with this as a salacious artefact but as a window into the past”. Items connected to the murder are positioned opposite a late 18th-century gibbet cage, used to display hanging corpses.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

That would be debated on a case-by-case basis,” said Clarke. “In this instance, it is a stark and emotive set of artefacts that give us the chance to discuss the anatomising of the criminal corpse. Uncomfortable history, yes, but if we are to learn from history we must first face it with honesty and openness.”Deary previously wrote six stories for the museum. However, he said that displaying the books is “just a step too far”, likening it to a “freak show”.“We’re buoyed that [Deary] continues to write about the murder within his books as it is hugely important to our understanding of the past,” said Clarke.Explore more on these topicsBooksMuseumsnewsShareReuse this content"

The review, which will look at how the overpayment scandal came about and how to fix it, is part of what ministers have promised will be a “new settlement” for carers.The chief executive ofCarersUK, Helen Walker, welcomed the move: “When the alerts target was set at 50%, thousands of carers were missed and experienced large and damaging overpayments, in a situation that could have been largely avoided,” she said.But she warned that until the new policy took effect, tens of thousands more carers would continue to be hit with overpayments, including an estimated 20,000 at risk when a huge backlog of paper-based alerts related to national insurance credits, which the DWP allowed to build up, is finally tackled.“As the DWP works to clear the current backlog, the human cost of a system which needed an overhaul years ago will still continue to rise. Sadly, clearing the backlog is likely to result in a further rise in overpayments debts,” said Walker.The government’s current position, outlined in a letter to charities last week by the social security minister, Sir Stephen Timms, indicated the handling of overpayments would be “business as usual” and there would be no pause on repayment demands, fines, or potential prosecutions for fraud.The Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, called for carer’s allowance overpayments to be written off, saying it was wrong carers continued to be punished by a system the government admitted was broken. “It is totally unacceptable that more and more carers are being caught up in this scandal, so long after it was exposed,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We will agree affordable repayment plans and, when issuing debt management notifications, signpost to independent advice services.”Campaigners have long argued the complexity of carer’s allowance rules meant carers who worked part-time were unaware when they breached weekly earnings limits, often by only a few pounds or pence, and that the DWP should use the earnings data it had at its disposal to warn them in timely fashion so they could make adjustments.Although the DWP promised MPs six years ago the introduction of electronic earnings alerts from HMRC would eradicate overpayments, it has repeatedly neglected to deploy enough staff to carry out the checks. Overpayments havecontinued to spiral, with 144,000 carers currently repaying over £250m.The National Audit Office revealed in December thatDWP policy was to investigate half of all alertson the grounds this was the maximum it needed to process to meet its internal financial savings targets.Timms said: “Carer’s allowance alerts have been coming in to the department, but many haven’t been processed. In future, we plan to act on all of them. This will be an important step in reducing overpayments.“We are delivering on the change we promised when elected by drafting in extra staff. Reviewing 100% of alerts will allow us to tackle overpayments when they arise, rather than waiting until carers have built up large debts.”Explore more on these topicsCarersCarer's allowance crisisSocial careBenefitsWelfarePublic services policyEnglandWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

This could include Mandarin language programmes, and training for civil servants and parliamentarians about the Chinese system. The Foreign Office declined to comment.Reynolds’s trip will raise eyebrows after he said on Sunday that the UK had “got it wrong in the past” and Conservative governments had been “far too naive” about allowing Chinese investment in sensitive industries such as steel.The government has also come under pressure to take a tougher stance towards Beijing over human rights and security concerns.In an article for the Guardian on TuesdayWera Hobhouse, a Liberal Democrat MP who was refused entry to Hong Kong to visit her grandchild last week, said that “until we get a clear answer for why I was deported, no government minister should be visiting China on official business”.Hobhouse said she believed she was denied entry “because of my role as a British parliamentarian, and one who haslevelled criticism at Beijingfor its human rights abuses”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Some inside the government suspect Jingye’s actions may have been intended to stop Britain producing its own virgin steel and force it to rely on imports from China.“You’ve got to be clear about what is the sort of sector where actually we can promote and cooperate and ones, frankly, where we can’t,” Reynolds told Sky News’s Trevor Phillips on Sunday. “I wouldn’t personally bring a Chinese company into our steel sector.”He argued that even privately owned firms had direct links to the Chinese Communist party,said “a lot of UK-Chinese trade is in non-contentious areas” such as agriculture, life sciences and the automotive sector.He appeared to moderate his comments about the steel industry on Tuesday, telling broadcasters that he would look at Chinese firms “in a different way” without ruling out their involvement completely.Reynolds’s planned trip is a signal that the government does not intend to row back on its rapprochement with Beijing. Keir Starmer is also expected to visit China later this year.Asked in October whether the UK would revive the Jetco, Reynolds said he was “certainly open to having a conversation” about it. Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak both drew up plans to do so while they were in office.The Guardian revealed this week that ministers were consideringtargeting parts of the Chinese stateunder new foreign influence rules.A Department for Business and Trade spokesperson said: “We are taking a consistent and strategic approach to our trade relationship with China, engaging in areas of trade that benefit the UK’s national interests.”Explore more on these topicsTrade policyJonathan ReynoldsChinaAsia PacificHong KongnewsShareReuse this content"

Half of reduced fees are not means-tested on family income at all, the research shows.“This is not a good enough performance from a sector wishing to claim it is charitable and motivated by the public good, and which argues it should retain VAT tax relief despite the rest of the country having to considerably tighten its belt.”The PEPF said many private schools did not publish details of their bursaries and scholarships, meaning that the larger schools it surveyed might not be representative of the sector. Its figures found that in 2022-23, the schools gave £224m worth of means-tested support, and £185m in unassessed support.TheIndependent Schools Council(ISC), which represents 60% of England’s 2,400 private schools, said its figures showed that £1bn in fee assistance by its members was divided between both forms of assistance. The £494m devoted to means-tested support in 2023 was 32% higher than in 2012 after adjusting for inflation.An ISC spokesperson said: “This report takes an unrepresentative sample of independent schools and starts from a baseline of one of the most anomalous years schools have ever seen.“There is a good conversation to be had – one we are keen to participate in – about bursaries and how independent schools could more effectively target them. Sadly, this research adds absolutely nothing to that conversation.”After Labour announced it would add VAT to school fees, a string of private school leaders said they would beforced to cut backon financial assistance.The PEPF’s research uncovered considerable variation in means-tested support between schools with similar fee incomes, some spending £500,000 and others up to £5m a year.There was also variation in the number of full means-tested bursaries, with Manchester grammar school remitting the full fees of one in 10 pupils.“Of course there are notable exceptions among some private schools but overall this charitable sector is not proving very impressive when it comes to genuinely helping ordinary and poorer families,” the PEPF said.Explore more on these topicsPrivate schoolsSchool fundingSchoolsThinktanksTaxEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

She has also alleged he pointed a gun in her face and said: “I’m a boss, I’m a fucking G, you’re going to do as I say or there’ll be hell to pay.”Anne Studd KC, representing the women, told the judge, Richard Armstrong, it was thought to be the “first occasion” that coercive control was “brought before the high court in a civil context”.In written submissions, the barrister added the case was “understood to be the first claim where allegations of coercive control have been considered in a civil context of whether that behaviour can amount to intentional infliction of harm”.The hearing at the high court in London on Tuesday dealt with preliminary matters, including disclosure and legal costs. The judge said the claimants were “seeking damages likely to reach six figures” and scheduled a three-week trial for early 2027.Tate denies the allegations and claims his relationships with the women were consensual. Studd told the court there was “a total denial of wrongdoing” and that Tate had dismissed the claims in his written defence as “a pack of lies” and “nonsense”. Tate’s lawyers further claim the allegations for personal injury are barred as they are subject to a three-year limitation period.Studd said there was a “vast amount” to review in the case, including “thousands of pages of open-source material” produced by Tate, “as well as material provided from law enforcement agencies, material from criminal proceedings in other jurisdictions” and video footage.She told the court: “[Tate] has a profile, largely made by himself, where he regularly discusses issues of violence against women and girls and misogyny” and gave his “seemingly high-profile support for behaviours of that type”.The judge allowed the women to rely on evidence from one expert on “why victims of sexual violence do not always bring claims precipitously”, but refused to allow them to rely on a second expert on coercive control.Studd had said expert evidence was needed so the court had “the whole picture”, describing coercive control as “a form of grooming and manipulation where the victim becomes less and less able to respond in what might be perceived as a normal way. In particular, she may not leave even if the door is open.”But Vanessa Marshall KC, for Tate, said the additional expert evidence was “unnecessary”.Armstrong did not allow Tate’s lawyers to claim the costs of travelling to Romania to take statements. “He has travelled to the US and Dubai recently, there is no reason he cannot travel to the UK,” the judge said.Three of the women had reported Tate to Hertfordshire police in 2019 but the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to bring criminal charges.Tate and his brother Tristan are under criminal investigation in Romania over allegations of human trafficking, trafficking of minors and money laundering.Bedfordshire police are seeking to arrest the Tate brothers in relation to allegations of rape and trafficking dating to between 2012 and 2015. The two men deny all accusations against them.Explore more on these topicsAndrew TatenewsShareReuse this content"

The previous year it had made a £16.9m pre-tax profit.The company’s trading was hit after it was named on a list of companies to boycott for its perceived support for, investment in, or links to, Israel. It has denied having any political agenda, saying: “We do not use our profits to fund any government or military operations anywhere.”In spite of sliding sales, Starbucks’s UK retail arm paid out just over £40m in royalty and licence fees to its parent company – a similar figure to the prior year – tipping it into loss so that it paid no corporation tax.It did hand HM Revenue and Customs almost £1m in deferred payments and adjustments related to prior years – including £455,000 of corporation tax. That came after it was previously criticised by fair tax campaigners forpaying a “derisorily low” £7.2m in UK corporation tax for 2023.Paul Monaghan, the chief executive of the Fair Tax Foundation, described the catch-up payments as “paltry”, adding that the latest Starbucks UK accounts reflected a long history of paying little or no corporate income tax with “surpluses invariably wiped out by substantial royalty payments to other parts of the business”.Starbuckspaid just £8.6m in the first 14 yearsafter its 1998 debut in the UK, with none paid in several consecutive years, despite £3bn worth of sales during that time.A Starbucks spokesperson said:“Starbucks is in full compliance with tax laws around the world, with an effective global tax rate of over 24% in 2024, which is in excess of the 15% minimum corporation tax discussed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.”The number of transactions at Starbucks’s 1,240 UK outlets, which include 378 run directly by the company as well as hundreds operated by franchisees, fell back as it raised prices by up to 4% on its drinks, amid inflation on coffee beans, cocoa and milk. The price of a latte or cappuccino hit £4.25 in March last year, with more elaborate drinks, such as a white chocolate mocha, reaching £5.40.This month prices have risen again, with a cappuccino now costing £4.70 and a caramel macchiato priced at £6.10.As the company fell into the red, Starbucks’s parent company pumped £50m into its UK division last year – via a revolving credit facility and a capital injection. Late last year the parent group committed to support its UK arm further financially if necessary and extended the payback period for a £20m loan, on which it is charging its UK business more than 5% interest, until December this year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Misperceptions about the brand relating to events in the Middle East also affected footfall in some locations in the first half of the year.”The company, which was founded in Seattle in 1971 and is now the world’s biggest coffee shop operator, said there was also increasing competition for the best sites in city centres and drive-thrus, despite coffee shops coming under pressure from cost inflation and tightened consumer spending.While Starbucks’s UK business has struggled, its cheaper rival Greggs has been rapidly expanding, while the British chain Caffè Nero increased sales globally by 15% in the year to May 2024 to almost £520m, including 10% growth in the UK. However, Caffè Nero also fell into the red, recording a £34.4m annual loss.Starbucks has said it wants to open 80 more stores this year.Explore more on these topicsStarbucksFood & drink industrynewsShareReuse this content"

It only filed full accounts on Monday for 2023, the year in which it was rebranded as X after Musk’s takeover.“The business continues to take corrective measures to build brand safety tools, invest in platform safety and content moderation and then educate advertisers about these initiatives,” the company said.Its overall revenue totalled £69.1m, down from £205.3m in 2022, a decrease of 66.3% year-on-year. The profit for 2023 dropped from £5.6m the previous year to £1.2m. Pre-tax profits were 74% lower at £2.25 million. This was a “significant decrease in the performance of the company”, it said.Musk’s takeover also led to a wave of sackings, with the billionaire telling the BBC in 2023 that only 1,500 of about 8,000 Twitter employees were still employed at the company in that year.In the UK, the accounts show that the number of the company’s employees fell to 114, from 399 the previous year. This included a cut of 173 to the number employed in “research and development”.Despite its struggles,the value of X soared back earlierthis year to the$44bn Musk paid for itand last month his X.AI artificial intelligence firm acquired the business for $33bn.Farhad Divecha, a digital advertising expert who is chief executive of AccuraCast and founder of Unyte.AI, said he was not surprised at what the figures revealed.“The indicators have been there all along,” he said. “If anything, I think we’ve seen the worst and X might finally have the chance to recover advertiser revenues, but that’s only going to happen in UK and Europe if Musk and his crew pull their act together, provide support for advertisers and put in place some brand safety guardrails.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But it has since taken the position that it is powerless to bring him back beyond removing domestic obstacles, and that courts lack the constitutional power to dictate the president to do more.The lead lawyer for the administration, Drew Ensign, also said in legal filings before the hearing that even if Ábrego García were returned to the US, the justice department would deport him to a different country or move to terminate the order blocking his removal to El Salvador.But the judge rejected the administration’s narrow reading of “facilitate”, noting the plain meaning of the word meant officials needed to secure Ábrego García’s release – and thatUS immigrationand customs enforcement had previously taken a number of positions on its meaning.“Your characterization is not bound in fact,” Xinis said. “I need facts.”The administration argued it had sought to comply with the supreme court’s order when Trump addressed the case and Bukele questioned whether he was supposed to smuggle Ábrego García across the border – which Ensign argued showed the matter had been raised at the “highest levels”.The judge appeared unimpressed by the argument. “It’s not a direct response,” Xinis said. “Nor is the quip about smuggling someone into the US. If you were removing domestic barriers, there would be no smuggling, right? Two misguided ships passing in the night.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

All four had maintained their innocence, arguing they were being prosecuted for doing their jobs as journalists.The closed-door trial was part of a crackdown on dissent that has reached an unprecedented scale since Moscowsent troops into Ukrainein February 2022.The authorities have targeted opposition figures, independent journalists, rights activists and ordinary Russians critical of the Kremlin with prosecution, jailing hundreds and prompting thousands to flee the country.Favorskaya and Kriger worked with Sota Vision, an independent Russian news outlet that covers protests and political trials. Gabov is a freelance producer who has worked for multiple organisations, including Reuters. Karelin, a freelance video journalist, has done work for western media outlets including the Associated Press.The four journalists were accused of working with Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation, which wasdesignated as extremist and outlawed in 2021in a move widely seen as politically motivated.Navalny was Vladimir Putin’s fiercest and most prominent critic and relentlessly campaigned against official corruption in Russia. Navalnydied in February 2024in an Arctic penal colony while serving a 19-year sentence for several charges, including running an extremist group, which he had rejected as politically driven.Favorskaya said at an earlier court appearance open to the public that she was being prosecuted for a story she wrote on abuse Navalny had faced behind bars. Speaking to reporters from the defendants’ cage before the verdict, she also said she was punished for helping to organise Navalny’s funeral.Gabov, in a closing statement prepared for court that was published by the independent Novaya Gazeta newspaper, said the accusations against him were groundless and the prosecution had failed to prove them.Russia gives Navalny lawyers multi-year sentences for relaying his messagesRead more“I understand perfectly well … what kind of country I live in. Throughout history, Russia has never been different, there is nothing new in the current situation,” Gabov said in the statement. “Independent journalism is equated to extremism.”Supporters who gathered in the court building chanted and applauded as the four journalists were led out of the courtroom after the verdict.The journalists’ lawyers said they would appeal against the verdict, which Kriger’s lawyer, Yelena Sheremetyeva, described as illegal and unfair.“The profession of a journalist in itself is not extremism,” said Irina Biryukova. “And based on the case materials that are available, I will say that in our opinion, there is no evidence that they committed any crimes, or even minor offences.”She said the four were “holding up” and were “happy that so many people came”.The Russian human rights group Memorial designated all four as political prisoners, among more than 900 others held in the country.Explore more on these topicsRussiaPress freedomAlexei NavalnyNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesEuropeVladimir PutinnewsShareReuse this content"

One security guard died and nine medics were wounded.Hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians are living in the area, mostly in ragged makeshift tents alongside sand dunes. They left their homes after Israeli forces resumed conflict and seized swathes of southern Gaza, including Rafah City, which Palestinians are banned from entering.On Tuesday, Netanyahu made a rare visit to Gaza. Israeli forces have continued their air and ground offensive in the territory since the collapse of the ceasefire in March. The visit was confirmed by the prime minister’s office, who said he had visited troops in northern Gaza.Just two days previously, an Israeli missilepartly destroyed al-Ahli hospital, which was the only facility still providing critical care in northern Gaza. Doctors said the blasts had left the hospital barely operational and unable to carry out surgeries or accept patients.António Guterres, the UN secretary general, said he was “deeply alarmed” by the attack, and stressed that hospitals were protected under international humanitarian law.The Gaza paramedic killings: a visual timelineRead moreIsrael has repeatedly targeted hospitals in Gaza over the past 18 months, alleging that they are used by Hamas to conceal terrorist activities. Israeli forces claimed al-Ahli was being used as a “command and control” centre by Hamas, an allegation the group denied. Paramedics carrying out rescue operations in Gazahave also been targeted.Doctors working in Gaza warned that the situation for provision of medical care was at breaking point. Dr Mohammad Zahir, an emergency doctor at Indonesia hospital, said that if the aid blockade continued, severely ill children, cancer and kidney patients would soon die.“We are living through a severe crisis alongside the broader humanitarian catastrophe,” said Zahir. “Inside the hospital, there is not only a lack of resources, but a massive shortage of essential medicines and medical supplies. There is also a shortage of ambulances, medications for chronic illnesses and cancer patients, surgical supplies, and even hospital beds – all due to the ongoing closure of the border crossings.”The UN office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs said the situation in Gaza was “likely the worst it has been in the 18 months since the outbreak of hostilities”.Since the collapse of the ceasefire with Hamas, Israel has blocked all aid to the territory since 2 March, resulting in critical shortages of food, water, fuel and medicine. Staff at Nasser hospital, one of the largest in Gaza – which is only partially functional after beinghit in an airstrike last month– reported running out of gauze and burn creams this week.It is the longest period that Israel has denied aid to Gaza. Human rights groups said the tactic – meant to put pressure on Hamas to releasing the remaining hostages it holds – amounted to a war crime.Raeda Hijazi, living in a tent in the humanitarian zone in western Gaza with her four children, said they regularly survived only on salt and bread and had no choice but to drink contaminated water.“There is no fuel to purify or pump water, and even the available food is contaminated,” she said. “Vegetables are completely unaffordable. I cook using burning plastic, even though I know it contains carcinogenic substances, but there’s no alternative. Insects are everywhere in the tents due to the garbage accumulating in the streets. Words are not enough to describe the suffering.”View image in fullscreenPalestinians in Jabalia camp in Gaza on 15 April. Israel has blocked all aid going into the territory since 2 March, resulting in critical shortages of food, water, fuel and medicine.Photograph: Saher Alghorra/ZUMA Press Wire/REX/ShutterstockKhetam abu Ouda, 49, living in Abasan al-Kabira, east of Khan Younis, said he and his family had been displaced 20 times since the start of the war. They recently returned to the rubble of their home but were sharing it with 30 other displaced people and feared that as water was running out, they would soon have to move again. He said said aid groups were no longer distributing food.“The closure of crossings will lead to a slow and gradual death for the people here unless a radical solution is reached and the war is stopped,” said Ouda.Israel has also resumed its airstrikes and ground operations in Gaza, displacing about 400,000 people and leading to a surge in civilian casualties, with 1,600 killed since March alone.Speaking to Yedioth Ahronoth, an Israeli newspaper, an unnamed security official claimed the strategy was working and would force Hamas to agree to a deal on the hostages.“The military pressure is having an impact,” said the official. “They have a shortage of gas and the food and the fuel will run out in a few weeks. The big achievement of the residents’ return to the northern Gaza Strip has been erased. That’s rattled them.”Pressure has been mounting on Netanyahu’s government to secure the release of the remaining 58 hostages in Gaza, 24 of whom are believed to be alive. Thousands of former and reservist soldiers, as wellas over 250 former Mossad agents, gave their backing to a letter calling for an end to the war, accusing Netanyahu of putting the lives of the hostages at risk for his own political gain.As Israel launched more missiles in Gaza on Tuesday, a Hamas armed wing spokesperson said on Telegram that they had lost contact with the group holding Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander, who has been held captive in Gaza for more than 550 days, after a “direct strike” on his location.Alexander had appeared alive and agitated in a Hamas propaganda video released over the weekend in which he accused the “disgusting Israeli government” of deserting him and said he was “collapsing mentally and physically”.Reports emerged this week that Israel had put forward a ceasefire deal with Hamas that included releasing half of the living hostages. However, on Tuesday a Palestinian source told the BBC that Hamas had rejected the deal as it did not include a commitment to end the war or withdraw IDF forces from Gaza.Israeli’s offensive in response to the attacks by Hamas on southern Israel on 7 October 2023 has now claimed 51,000 lives, according to the Gaza health ministry. The count does not differentiate between civilians or combatants but women and children make up more than half of the dead.This month, agroup of UN expertssaid Israel’s actions in Gaza were leading to the “destruction of Palestinian life”.“If they are not killed by bombs or bullets, they slowly suffocate for lack of basic means of survival,” they said. “The only difference is the means and speed of death.”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesIsraelGazaMiddle East and north AfricaBenjamin NetanyahunewsShareReuse this content"

Balmer allegedly told officers responding to the call that he had taken a full bottle of pills in a suicide attempt.That escalated into an argument between Balmer and his wife, with Balmer allegedly assaulting both her and his stepson,according to court records reviewed by the Hill.USA Today further reportedthat Balmer and his wife finalized their divorce in February 2025, and he was subject to a protection from abuse order.Balmer’s mother spoke tothe Associated Pressand said her son grappled with mental health issues. She reportedly said she had made calls in recent days about those issues, but “nobody would help”.Balmer’s bail denial on Monday occurred after prosecutors said he told police that he planned to beat Shapiro with a hammer – and used Molotov cocktails made from beer bottles filled with gasoline to start the fire. Security footage from the residence evidently shows a man who was carrying a bag and wearing a black jacket – as well as black boots – breaking a window into the home and tossing a homemade molotov cocktail inside.Balmer surrendered to the Pennsylvania state police on Sunday and admitted to “harboring hatred toward Governor Shapiro”, authorities alleged. Asked during a police interview what he would have done had Shapiro found him inside the residence, “he advised he would have beaten him with his hammer”, said the probable cause affidavit justifying Balmer’s arrest.In court on Monday, county judge Dale Klein asked Balmer if he took any medication for mental illness. Balmer responded that he was not mentally ill and he had not taken medication, adding that it had “led … to different types of behavior” in the past.Klein said he had denied Balmer bail because he could be a danger to the community and himself.The arson attack attributed to Balmer followed a series of other attacks targeting US political figures.Those include against Paul Pelosi, the husband of congresswoman Nancy Pelosi, and two separate assassination attempts on Donald Trump.Supporters of Trump – whose first presidency ended in defeat after the 2020 election before he then won back the Oval Office in November – violently attacked the US Capitol on 6 January 2021. And on 8 April, a California manpleaded guiltyto trying to kill US supreme court justice Brett Kavanaugh in 2022.ABC News reportedthat social media pages connected to Balmer appear to show both critiques of Trump and his presidential predecessor Joe Biden.Balmer seemed to reject Biden’s 2020 presidential win over Trump and criticized him on Facebook during his term. Posts included a picture with the text “Joe Biden owes me 2 grand” and another that said: “Biden supporters shouldn’t exist.”In 2020, he posted a meme that argued that both Democrats and Republicans “would rather argue with other than work to solve the problems we are facing”.After the alleged arson attack, Shapiro said: “This kind of violence is not OK.“I don’t give a damn if it’s coming from one particular side or the other, directed at one particular party or another, or one particular person or another. It is not OK, and it has to stop.”Authorities have not disclosed the precise motive for the alleged arsonist.Posting on X,Biden said he and former first lady Jill Biden were “disgusted by the attack on the Shapiro family and their home” – while noting it occurred during the first night of the major Jewish holiday of Passover.“There is no place for this type of evil in America, and as I told the governor yesterday, we must stand united against hatred and violence,” Biden said.Trump commented from the White House on Monday that Balmer was “probably just a wack job”.“The attacker was not a fan of Trump,” the president said. “I understand, just from what I read and from what I’ve been told, the attacker basically wasn’t a fan of anybody.“Certainly a thing like that cannot be allowed to happen.”Other entries on Balmer’s rap sheet include several additional violations in Pennsylvania. Among them: a guilty plea to forgery in 2016, for which he was sentenced to 18 months of probation.ABC also reported that Balmer had been dealing with “protracted” foreclosure proceedings. The outlet added that Balmer posted memes urging people to “become ungovernable” and reposted an artwork of a molotov cocktail in 2022 with the slogan: “Be the light you want to see in the world.”Explore more on these topicsPennsylvaniaUS crimeUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It comes one day after theTrump administrationinstituted a national security report into the pharmaceutical industry, a precursor to sector-specific tariffs.The ability of Medicare for the first time to directly negotiate prices on selected medicines was part of President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. Medicare covers 66 million Americans, mostly aged 65 and older.Drugmakers have complained about the terms of Medicare’s negotiating powers, saying it would stifle innovation. In particular, the industry has opposed the time frame for negotiation eligibility for most drugs.When drugs have no competition, the law now allows the government to negotiate prices for complex biologic, or biotech, drugs after 13 years on the market, but after nine years for drugs taken as pills and capsules.Trump cannot implement the change through executive order because the negotiation process is outlined in legislation, but his order instructs the Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F Kennedy Jr to work with Congress on changing it.Other proposed changes to the negotiation process would yield more savings than those achieved during the first round under the Biden administration, White House officials told reporters on a call before the signing without providing specifics.Biden’s administration had negotiated a price cut of as much as 79% for the first group of 10 drugs seen as among the most costly to the Medicare program.The Trump administration will negotiate prices for the second group of 15 medications, which includes Novo Nordisk’s blockbuster diabetes and weight-loss treatments Ozempic and Wegovy as well as Pfizer’s cancer drugs Ibrance and Xtandi.Trump’s order also seeks to align Medicare payments for drugs with those of hospitals, which can be 35% lower, and calls for standardizing patient payment rates across locations so that people are not charged different rates depending on where they receive care, a policy known as site-neutral payments.Trump directed the Food and Drug Administration to encourage more applications from states for drug importation programs, which were initiated during his first term.So far only Florida has won FDA authorization to directly import drugs from Canada, even though several more states have applied. It also directs the FDA to streamline approval for less expensive generic and biosimilar versions of branded medicines.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS healthcareDonald TrumpUS politicsUS MedicareDrugsnewsShareReuse this content"

A wide Nordic river, melting snow still lining its banks,meanders peacefully through a pristine forestof spruce and pine. But this spring, as every spring for the past six years, a lot of people will be glued to it.WhenDen stora älgvandringen– variously translated as The Great Moose Migration or The Great Elk Trek – first aired on the public broadcaster SVT’s on-demand platform in 2019, nearly a million people tuned in. Last year, it was 9 million.This year, who knows? Given the state of the world, a three-week-long, round-the-clock live stream of a few hundred moose gingerly crossing the Ångerman River in northernSwedento reach their summer pastures could be just what viewers need.The show’s latest edition launched a full week early on Tuesday because of warmer than usual spring weather. “There are a lot of moose about,” the producer, Stefan Edlund,told SVT. “They’re waiting for us. We’ve had to adjust. But it should be OK.”The programme’s 15-strong crew, working out of a control room in Umeå, 400 miles (600km) north of Stockholm, had already laid most of their 20,000 meters of cables and positioned their 30-plus remote video and night vision cameras, Edlund said.View image in fullscreenThe crew control more than 30 remote video and night vision cameras from a control room in Umeå.Photograph: SVT/APWhich is just as well, because the show’s fans are more than ready.Ulla Malmgren, 62, said she had stocked up on coffee and pre-cooked meals for the duration so she did not miss a moment. “Sleep? Forget it. I don’t sleep,” she said.Malmgren, who is in a Facebook group of 76,000-plus viewers, told the Associated Press she loved the thought that there were “about a million people” watching “all saying about the same thing: ‘Go on! Yes, you can do it!’”Another fan, William Garp Liljefors, 20, said he had been known to be late for class while the show was on. “I feel relaxed, but at the same time I’m like, ‘Oh, there’s a moose. Oh, what if there’s a moose? I can’t go to the toilet!’” he said.View image in fullscreenSVT set up preparations in Junsele, Sweden.Photograph: SVT/APThe show – and its success – are part of a growing trend for “slow television” that some argue was pioneered by the late US pop artist Andy Warhol, whose 1964 film Sleep showed the poet John Giorno sleeping for five hours and 20 minutes.More recently, the concept took off with the Norwegian broadcaster NRK’s pre-recordedBergensbanen,which showed, minute by minute, a seven-hour train journey from Bergen to Oslo with archive footage to enliven time spent in the line’s 182 tunnels.About 20% of Norway’s population tuned in at least once to that. Two years later, roughly half the country’s 5.5 million people watched at least some of NRK’s coverage – live and non-stop, this time – of a 134-hour sea voyage from Bergen to Kirkenes.Since then the broadcaster has aired at least one slow TV show a year, including 18 hours of salmon swimming upstream, 12 hours of firewood burning, 24 hours of academic lectures on the constitution and a 12-hour knitting marathon.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In Utrecht, in the Netherlands, alive stream from an underwater cameraallows viewers to ring a virtual doorbell and let spawning fish through a lock gate.MapSlow TV shows something happening at the rate it is experienced, rather than speeded up through plotting and editing. Its attraction, media experts say, seems to lie precisely in the soothing absence of staged tension and drama.“It becomes, in a strange way, gripping, because nothing catastrophic is happening, nothing spectacular is happening,” said Annette Hill, a professor of media and communications at Jönköping University in Sweden.“But something very beautiful is happening in that minute-by-minute moment.”Espen Ytreberg, a professor of media studies at the University of Oslo, has likened slow TV to a sort of window or “escape valve” from the medium’s usual frenetic pace. “Just when did we come to accept that television should be this accelerated, busy, intense, in your face thing?” he wondered – appropriately, almost a decade ago – in aninterview with CBS. “But at some point, that became the norm.”Just occasionally, of course, stuff does happen. SVT even sends a push alert when the first moose shows up on The Great Moose Migration, and runs an on-screen counter showing how many have managed to cross the river, which is wide and can be perilous.Last year, the programme’s cameras captured 87 making it safely across. Some do get into difficulties. Undeniably, though, viewers are, most of the time, staring at sky, water and trees. Maybe a duck or two. Wait, is that a moose?Explore more on these topicsSwedenAnimalsTelevisionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

He joins Alejandro Toledo,sentenced in 2024 to 20 years for Odebrecht-related crimes, and Alberto Fujimori, whoreceived multiple convictions for corruption and human rights abuses.The trial began in 2022, and alongside the 62-year-old former military officer and his 48-year-old wife, the court convicted eight others. Both Humala and Heredia were held in pre-trial detention from 2017 to 2018 at the prosecutor’s request to prevent their flight.Odebrecht’s 2016 admission ofwidespread bribery across Latin Americapreceded the initial investigations against Humala, which started in 2015, a year before the company’s revelations.Most of the presidents who have governed Peru since 2001 have faced legal problems due to their connections with Odebrecht. Toledo is currently imprisoned, while the former president Pedro Pablo Kuczynski is under house arrest. Alan García, who served two non-consecutive terms,died by suicide in 2019 as authorities moved to arrest him in connection with Odebrecht bribes.In addition to former presidents, prominent figures such as the former presidential candidate Keiko Fujimori and numerous ex-governors are also under investigation.Explore more on these topicsPeruAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The drive from Los Angeles to Indio will set you back anywhere from three to five hours, the lines even more; some campers endured 12-hour lines to access the site.A three-day general admissions pass went for a whopping $649 this year, $220 more than just five years ago, and that’s not counting money spent on lodging, food and outfits suitable for temp swings of 40F. No wonder over half of attendees this year were onpayment plans. Unless Revolve is footing your bill, what 20-something can afford Coachella?Lady Gaga, Green Day and Enhypen: 2025 Coachella festival – in picturesRead moreSuch was the latest strain of bad press for North America’s largest music festival, which – depending on who you talk to – is recovering from itsflop year of depressed ticket sales in 2024. Whether the inflammatory headlinescomparing it to Fyre Festival(wrong) orquestioning gen Z’s financial literacy(fair) are out of genuine concern or Fomo-laced schadenfreude, Coachella is certainly in some form of identity shift, with the question of who it’s for, who attends and what it represents in palpable flux over the course of its first 2025 weekend.On the one hand, the festival draws a moreinternational lineupand diverse crowd than its flower-crown reputation suggests; though it of course skews young, there were plenty of middle-aged adults (with, presumably, more robust bank accounts) mixed in with high schoolers, gaggles of shirtless men, college kids on drugs and the occasional baby with headphones on. On the other, well, it’s hard to walk more than a few feet in the rapidly browning grass without either interrupting a photo or being asked to take one, the festival’s appearance-oriented clientele still hopelessly tied to the ‘gram and the game of envy.But those who did make it were rewarded by solid sets and deep dehydration – temperatures reached a scorching 102F (39C) on Friday, making 2025 the hottest festival on record. “It’s hottttttttt … but it’s nice” rasped Djo, AKA Stranger Things’ Joe Keery, on Friday afternoon in a sweltering Mojave cool kids’ tent, attendees bopping to chill songs of existential ennui and anxiety while sweating through their shirts.“The weather’s not like this in England, I can tell you that,” lamented a miserable looking beabadoobee in the Sunday glare; the Filipino-British singer nonetheless turned out a winsome set of alt-rock shredding that recalled both Liz Phair and Michelle Branch.Good luck to anyone performing before 7pm, though the heat lent the whole affair a sense of survivors’ bonding – the sight of drummer Tré Cool sweating off his glitter eye shadow duringGreen Day’s Saturday night set, long after the sun went down, was perhaps the most representative image of a weekend that had many melting face.View image in fullscreenPeople watch as Jimmy Eat World performs.Photograph: Daniel Cole/ReutersRising temps met simmering discontent. Recession indicators abounded, from screaming to Green Day’s American Idiot (“I’m not part of a Maga agenda,” singer Billie Joe Armstrong ad-libbed), to Jimmy Eat World drenching the main stage in sweat and what is now dad rock, to Charli xcx’s unofficial headliner set of pure indie sleaze. Brat green outpaced crochet on Saturday, with the British artist drawing one of the biggest crowds of the weekend to watch her stunt through bangers only with Billie Eilish, Lorde and Troye Sivan, along with numerous celebrity fans; videos circulated of Timothée Chalamet and Kylie Jenner canoodling in the VIP area. Jenner’s exTravis Scottserved as the semi-billed fourth headliner of the weekend, with a late Saturday set that several people I met planned to cautiously attend, citing fears about the Astroworld disaster that went unmentioned. Styled as a modern-day gladiator, attacking the beat while nearly obscured by smoke, Scott’s set projected aggression without incident.Lady Gaga at Coachella review – a thrilling all-timer of a performanceRead moreLikelast year, female artists saved Coachella from flopping, providing some of the biggest highs of the weekend. Charli’s party-girl energy gave way to party politics, with Clairo bringing out Bernie Sanders, fresh off a Fighting Oligarchy rally in LA, as a surprise guest. Sanders called on a queer-leaning gen Z crowd to “lead in the fight to combat climate change, protect women’s rights, and build an economy that works for all, not just the few” – at a festival whose CEO hasdonatedextensivelyto Republican campaigns and anti-LGBTQ+ organizations. The Go-Go’s kicked off the festival with a set celebrating their 40+ years as punk leaders, proving youth is a mindset. And Lady Gaga’sinstantly canonical setwas worth the price of admission alone, once again demonstrating Coachella’s long transition into a major pop star festival in the wake of Beychella. I left my body at the sight of Gaga, haughty in queenly garb, transitioning from 2025 smash Abracadabra to 2011 hit Judas from on high.View image in fullscreenLisa at Coachella.Photograph: Daniel Cole/ReutersA year after Chappell Roan rocketed into the mainstream from the small Gobi stage, the South African star Tyla appeared ascendant on the Outdoor stage, holding the crowd’s focus with some of the loosest hips I’ve ever seen. The popheads then hustled across the grounds to Lisa – AKA Blackpink’s Lalisa Manobal – at Sahara, where she cemented her solo career with a slickly produced, eardrum-puncturing set that recalled Blackpink’smaximally hype headlining appearancetwo years ago. Her bandmate Jennie put an exclamation point on K-Pop’s inroads at Coachella on Sunday, all crisp choreography and heavy beats with a cowboy hat.Megan Thee Stallion, too, went cowgirl with boots, hat and leather for indisputably the hottest dancing of the weekend. Her set delivered some of the heaviest nostalgia hits as well – during Plan B, she brought out Queen Latifah to perform U.N.I.T.Y, her 1993 track also confronting disrespect of women’s bodies and choices, and Ciara to twerk for Goodies. Both incited massive crowd freak-outs, only slightly dampened by the festival cutting Megan’s mic for time. And Missy Elliott melted time for her festival debut with a set that, a few technical issues aside, appealed to the past and the future at once; Get Ur Freak On and bug glasses have confirmed made it to gen Z.View image in fullscreenFelix Buxton of Basement Jaxx.Photograph: Christopher Victorio/REX/ShutterstockNostalgia, of course, powered a good portion of a festival that depends as much on drawing the veterans as the festival bros tripping at Sahara.“As an old person I love to see how much love these old bands are getting,” said a woman who appeared to be (gasp) 35 at an over-capacity crowd for Weezer’s Saturday set. Basement Jaxx and Kraftwerk, both running far behind schedule at an otherwise typically tight festival, reminded why they’ve long been on the Coachella lineup, back when the festival skewed heavily rock and electronic. T-Pain took attendees back to 2007 with an electrified version of Buy U a Drank that made walking through the crowd a battle against flailing limbs. Zedd portaled to 2013 with an extended version of Clarity, the high point of millennial-leaning set that brought out Maren Morris, John Mayer and Julia Michaels. Benson Boone, 22, explicitly channeling Freddie Mercury, brought out the 77-year-old Queen guitarist Brian May for Bohemian Rhapsody. AndPost Maloneand Shaboozey leaned into the nostalgia inherent in a country twang; the latter’s voice, rich and honeyed, drew a strikingly diverse crowd for a full sing-along to A Bar Song (Tipsy), which he premiered at Coachella last year to far fewer people.Post Malone at Coachella review – chameleonic megastar wows in the desertRead moreFor a festival that often feels too slick for its own good, there were still some surprises. The little monsters of erstwhile Nickelodeon kids’ show Yo Gabba Gabba! delivered one of the most unexpectedly joyous and strange hours of the weekend – pure mascot mayhem, Duolingo owl included, for silly songs like Yummy In My Tummy, plus Weird Al and Flavor Flav for a ridiculously catchy number called I Love Bugs. That moment, vibing out to children’s song about centipedes and spiders, unlocked the secret ofCoachella– find whatever escape hits enough to forget the enormous start-up costs and tiers of people getting better access than you, and it’s all worth it. That it took a children’s show performing to a room at least 50% on drugs to find it is as good an indicator as any that Coachella is in its quarter-life crisis era, trying a little of everything, cartoon monsters to Little Monsters, to see what sticks.This article was amended on 15 April 2025. An earlier version identified Brian May as Queen’s drummer rather than the band’s guitarist.Explore more on these topicsCoachellaFestivalsLady GagaBernie SandersPost MaloneGreen DayMegan Thee StallionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For what?”The launch from west Texas on Monday, paid for by the Amazon founder’s private space company, met withwidespreadderisiononline andcountless memes– such as photos of Perry holding up a daisy in tribute to her daughter Daisy Dove Bloom and kissing the ground on her return to Earth, captioned “getting off a commercial flight in 2025 #BlueOrigin”, in reference to a spate of airline incidents this year. Actor and director Olivia Wilde reshared the meme on her Instagram stories with the added caption “Billion dollars bought some good memes I guess”.Amy Schumer also mocked the flight on Instagram, posting asarcastic videoin which she announced that she got a last-minute invitation to join the mission. “Guys, last second they added me to space and I’m going to space,” the comedian joked while holding up a Black Panther toy. “I’m bringing this thing. It has no meaning to me, but it was in my bag and I was on the subway, and I got the text and they were like, ‘Do you want to go to space?’ so I’m going to space.”“Thank you to everyone who got me here and I’ll see you guys in space,” she added with the caption “space”.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided by Instagram.

Lauren Sanchez,Katy Perryand Amanda Nguyen have been my guiding lights through this whole journey, which I just got called to be part of this space team this morning. And I’m loving it. I’ve always wanted to go to space, and also I just have to say, How high were the people who came up with the name for space? Were they like, ‘What should we call it? It’s got so much, like, space.’”Earlier this month, actor Olivia Munn made waves when she questioned the flight’s objective. “I know this probably isn’t the cool thing to say, but there are so many other things that are so important in the world right now,” she said during an appearance on Today With Jenna and Friends on 3 April. “What are you guys gonna do up in space? What are you doing up there?“I know this is probably obnoxious,” she continued, “but like, it’s so much money to go to space, and there’s a lot of people who can’t even afford eggs.”Munn also called the flight “a bit gluttonous”, because “space exploration was to further our knowledge and to help mankind. What are they gonna do up there that has made it better for us down here?”Some of the flight’s participants have defended the launch. Asked byPeopleabout overall criticism to the mission during a post-flight press conference, King said that in her eyes, “anybody that’s criticizing it doesn’t really understand what is happening here”.“We can all speak to the response we’re getting from young women from young girls about what this represents,” the longtime broadcast journalist added. Sanchez then added that the derision got her “really fired up”.“I would love to have them come toBlue Originand see the thousands of employees that don’t just work here but they put their heart and soul into this vehicle. They love their work and they love the mission and it’s a big deal for them,” she continued. “So when we hear comments like that, I just say, ‘Trust me. Come with me. I’ll show you what this is about, and it’s, it’s really eye-opening.’”The NS-31 mission marked the 11th mission in Blue Origin’s New Shepard program, the 31st flight overall and the first all-female mission in the company’s history. It was the first all-female space flight since 1963, when Soviet astronaut Valentina Tereshkova flew into orbit solo.The company credited Sanchez, who will marry Bezos at a star-studded wedding in Venice this summer, with inspiring the flight. “She is honored to lead a team of explorers on a mission that will challenge their perspectives of Earth, empower them to share their own stories, and create lasting impact that will inspire generations to come,” the company said viapress releaseshortly after the all-female crew was announced in February.Explore more on these topicsCultureBlue OriginKaty PerryAmy SchumerOlivia WildeJeff BezosSpacenewsShareReuse this content"

But while he is widely celebrated for his work in literature and activism, Zephaniah’s influence on music remains relatively overlooked.Emerging from the dub poetry scene, Zephaniah channelled personal experiences of systemic racism and state violence into intelligent spoken word. Albums such as Rasta combined politically charged poetry with dub rhythms and studio effects, laying the cultural groundwork for UK genres such as trip-hop, jungle and dubstep. We revisit his unique collaborations in electronic music, hearing from the artists who had the honour of working with him.Natty x Mala x Benjamin Zephaniah – Word & Sound (2019)Zephaniah’s Rastafari-inspired wisdom, Natty’s roots-infused minimalism and Mala’s DMZ-era dubstep combine to raise the consciousness vibration in Word & Sound – an uplifting, intergenerational union years in the making. “Benjamin was like an older brother to me, we were sometimes on the phone for hours,” Natty says. “So when I asked him to be part of a project I was doing, he wrote his verse immediately.” They recorded at Akala’s Ladbroke Grove studio in London then spent hours listening to Zephaniah’s stories – including his rightous refusal of an MBE.Natty says the vocals were meant for the trackBadman (Rastafari mix),but when Mala reached out, the dubstep producer was sent them instead. “Working with such powerful voices was something else,” says Mala. “Their words guided my creative process. Benjamin’s verse is a reminder to stay true and keep growing in heart and spirit. Rest in peace, sir, we salute you.”Natty continues to include the track in his live sets in memory of his friend. “Whenever we met, we’d sometimes spar, as we both studied martial arts. I remember how strong he was, which made his passing even harder to accept. He was just a down-to-earth, brilliant human being. I’m so grateful to have known and learned from him.”Kofi Stone – May Sound Crazy (ft Benjamin Zepheniah) (2024)Born-and-bred Brummies Kofi Stone and Zephaniah are a force to be reckoned with in this collaboration – one of Zephaniah’s last, recorded in summer 2023. He steps into the resilient role of mentor in this ambient electronic-infused hip-hop track, as Stone reflects on growing up in Birmingham and navigating poverty and racism. “It was truly an experience I’ll never forget,” Stone says.Ahead of the recording, Stone met Zephaniah outside the Birmingham Hippodrome, where he was narrating the Peaky Blinders ballet. “Before the show, we spoke at length about family, music and the state of the world,” recalls Stone. “He later drove us to the studio and recorded his verse in just a few takes. The whole process was surreal and beautiful.”The video to the track was produced months later. “Benjamin was actually quite unwell at the time,” says Stone, “but he was determined to make the shoot. We filmed his scene on a rooftop car park in Birmingham’s Chinatown.” That was [another] day I’ll never forget.”Bomb the Bass – Empire (with Sinéad O’Connor & Benjamin Zephaniah) (1995)Zephaniah joined Bomb the Bass and Sinéad O’Connor to deliver a critique of colonialism in this trip-hop-influenced production, imagining a life-sucking vampire as a metaphor for empire. Tim Simenon, AKA Bomb the Bass, says: “I remember smoking a lot of weed with Sinéad while recording Empire. She sang the lead vocal in one take, then added harmonies and backing vocals.”Simenon instinctively knew that Zephaniah’s voice would contrast powerfully. “He was such a warm, open guy. We spent a long day in the studio, bouncing ideas around until we landed on the spacious delivery we recorded. He gave the final mix an approving head nod – he was super pleased with the result. We mostly spoke about music, especially dub. We shared a love for Big Youth, Lee ‘Scratch’ Perry and On-U Sound.”LB Dub Corp: I Have a Dream (ft Benjamin Zephaniah) (2013)I Have a Dream pairs Zephaniah’s cheeky twist on Martin Luther King’s iconic speech with atmospheric dub techno. It’s one of two tracks featuring him on Luke Slater’s LB Dub Corp albumUnknown Origin, the other being Take a Ride. “When I reached out about combining a track with his poemI Have a Scheme, he was up for it straight away,” Slater says. “We somehow ended up debating vegan food in China.”Reflecting on their final exchange, Slater said: “Benjamin had just received the album copies I sent and told me he played the track for his students. I was humbled. I miss him in this dimension, but his words live on.” He had intended to ask him to collaborate a second time. “Then a week later he was gone. He left too soon. His words always carried a message – not always comfortable, never bland. His delivery cut through class barriers and reached people from all walks of life.”Swayzak – Illegal (ft Benjamin Zephaniah) (2000)The duo Swayzak captured Zephaniah’s rebellious spirit in this unapologetically anarchic track. “Working with Benjamin was an unexpected delight,” says James S Taylor. “There was no ego, no pressure, just good vibes.” The collaboration quickly grew into a friendship. “We talked deeply about politics and the British empire,” David Brown says. “The Brummie West Indian poet – quite a person to have in one’s life.”A 2024 “redraft” of Zephaniah’s 1999 poem Illegal was released under the titleDo Something Illegalas a tribute to Zephaniah under Brown’s ambient alias, the Eightsome Reel. The track ends with the sound of heavy rain, recorded the day Brown learned of Zephaniah’s death. “It hit me hard – I was in East Kilbride when I heard, a place where he once lived.”Moby – Where is Your Pride (ft Benjamin Zephaniah) (2024)Released in June 2024 as part of his album, Always Centered at Night, Moby’s Where Is Your Pride? is a tribute to Zephaniah. He says: “As a vegan activist and as a wise and compassionate man, Benjamin inspired me for many years. I hope Where Is Your Pride? honours his legacy and also draws people’s attention to his life, work and principles.”Explore more on these topicsBenjamin ZephaniahElectronic musicReggaeDance musicPoetryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A huddle of under-12s listened intently to Japan-born, Britain-based composerDai Fujikura. Several delighted non-children sidled up to tuned percussion instruments laid out on a table. There were instructions and paper for making an origami frog.These were cheery attempts to contextualise BCMG’s programme: an all-Japanese first half byMisato Mochizukiand Fujikura – including the world premiere of the latter’s new ShōConcerto – followed by Korean composerUnsuk Chin’s Xi for Ensemble and Tape. But hold fire on the east-meets-west cliches. Fujikura moved to the UK aged 15 and first encountered the shōatDarmstadtin his 20s. As he explained in a pre-concert talk, Japanese instruments are all “new” to him.Theshōsounds like a tiny organ with 17 bamboo “pipes”. In Fujikura’s concerto, the bright, laser-intense timbre of soloist Yuki Deai was the trigger for orchestral pitch- and tone-matching, sounds passed from shō to violins and upper woodwind. Just occasionally, the orchestra responded with a rich, bass-weighted roar or a full-voiced chord. The shō mostly layered notes in delicate clusters (the dissonances never more than fragrant) while passages of flutter tonguing and a driving rhythmic tattoo provided contrast. Under conductorKazuki Yamada, the effect was beautiful, if rather amorphous.Even Fujikura seemed surprised that BCMG had programmed An Anthem (2020), his arrangement of the Japanese national anthem for a long-ago cancelled event, though the musicians took care with its airy orchestration. The UK premiere of Mochizuki’s Etheric Blueprint (2006) was more persuasive. From a sample of water dripping, it developed into a beguiling compendium of analogue and electronic sounds, many quietly intricate (thinkASMRavant la lettre).Chin’s Xi was radical when new in 1998, combining tape and live musicians to explore the territory between “noise” and pitch. Today, the work’s use of spatial audio (clicks and clanks, breaths and patters sliding between six speakers) remains immersive. But in this performance, driven by conductorNicolò Foronin a distracting slow-motion robotic dance, its relentless bittiness felt like the “new music” of another age: distant beyond geography.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicBirminghamreviewsShareReuse this content"

I am serious about giving up acting … [There are] a lot of things I want to do with my life”.Blanchett was speaking as BBC Radio 4 prepared to air her first major radio play,an adaptation of Wallace Shawn’s play The Feverabout a woman who undergoes a political and spiritual awakening. Blanchett has just completed a five-week run on stageas Arkadina in Chekhov’s The Seagullat London’s Barbican theatre, and her most recent major film role, opposite Michael Fassbender as a married spy in theSteven Soderbergh-directed thiller Black Bag, was released in March.Blanchett has won numerous awards for her acting, including two Oscars (best actress for Blue Jasmine in 2014 and best supporting actress for The Aviator in 2005) and two best actress awards at the Venice film festival (for I’m Not There in 2007 and Tár in 2022).She recently finished working on a new film directed by Jim Jarmusch, Father, Mother, Sister, Brother, which is due for release in 2025 (though was surprisingly omitted from therecent announcement of the lineup for the Cannes film festival), and is currently working on Alpha Gang, a sci-fi comedy directed by David and Nathan Zellner, as both actor and producer. She is also attached (again as both actor and producer) through her production company Dirty Films to The Champions, a film to be directed by Ben Stiller.Despite her high levels of activity, Blanchett says in the interview that she is uncomfortable with her position as a celebrity actor.“I’ve always felt like I’m on the periphery of things, so I’m always surprised when I belong anywhere. I go with curiosity into whatever environment that I’m in, not expecting to be accepted or welcomed. I’ve spent a lifetime getting comfortable with the feeling of being uncomfortable.”She added: “No one is more boring to me than myself and I find other people much more interesting. I find myself profoundly dull.”Explore more on these topicsFilmCate BlanchettRadioRadio 4BBCRadio industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Chickens! Jamelia!  The casting director of Stephen Graham’s Netflix smash hit has done it again with this hilariously bleak, utterly unique series. The cast open upStuart HeritageTue 15 Apr 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 15 Apr 2025 02.50 EDTShareOver the last few years, we have found ourselves inundated with sadcoms. Again and again, we’ve been deluged by ostensible comedies that are so concerned with grief and trauma that the laughs end up feeling like a distant afterthought. Striking the right balance between comedy and drama takes absurd levels of effort and craft at the best of times. Doing it with a premise as bleak as BBC Three’s new series Just Act Normal is almost impossible.My hands are tied with embargos, so I have to be vague about certain plot details, but Just Act Normal is a show about three young siblings who decide to struggle on as normal after their mother – a perennially unreliable woman with substance abuse issues – disappears. Their lives are suddenly spent trying to navigate the complex systems of the adult world while processing the grief of abandonment in real time. Sounds like grim stuff (Disney’sGood American Familyrecently tackled a similar subject in the form of full-blown melodrama), and yet there’s a palpable lightness of touch to Just Act Normal. You could almost call it joy.“We were always, like, ‘This is a warped fairytale,’” says director Nathaniel Martello-White of the show’s complicated tonal balance, as we talk on Zoom. “The kind of comedy and drama in the series reminds me of the way that fairytales swing from extreme moments of joy to intense moments of pain and destruction. So I’d always tell these guys to try to find those kinds of archetypes and references for the characters.”“These guys” are Akins Subair and Chenée Taylor (also present on the Zoom) who play Tionne and Tiana, two of the siblings who suddenly find themselves alone in the world. Janice Okoh adapted Just Act Normal from her 2013 playThree Birds, and to say that the play left these youngsters with big shoes to fill is a woeful understatement. Taylor’s part, for instance, was initially played by Michaela Coel.View image in fullscreenAstonishing … (from left) Akins Subair, Chenée Taylor and Kaydrah Walker-Wilkie in Just Act Normal.Photograph: Ben Gregory-Ring/BBC/The Forge“I wasn’t familiar with it,” Taylor says of the play. “I didn’t try to find it to watch, either, just because I didn’t want it to influence my performance in any way.” On following a presence as large as Coel’s, she says: “It scared me for a second. But then I thought about it and said, ‘No, it doesn’t scare me.’ They’re two different things, the play and the series, do you know what I mean?”Subair had even less familiarity with the material, only auditioning the weekend before filming began. “I got the job on Friday, and I was going to a football game on the Sunday, so I just had the Saturday to familiarise myself with the entire script and get everything cemented in my head.” Subair is a Londoner andShaheen Baig, the show’s casting director, sent him a YouTube video of the West Midlands dialect he needed to master. “But as you can imagine, with all of it happening so abruptly, I didn’t really have time to go over the YouTube video countless times,” he says.What’s remarkable about this is that you completely buy Taylor and Subair (and Kaydrah Walker-Willkie, who rounds out the trio as younger sister Tanika) as siblings. They enmeshed at speed, according to Taylor, over a series of Nando’s dinners, and the result is a comprehensive portrait of a group of people struggling through a painful experience.View image in fullscreen‘Nobody in my family is from the industry’ … Chenée Taylor in Just Act Normal.Photograph: Ben Gregory-Ring/BBC/The ForgeYou could call it loss, but that isn’t quite the word for what they go through. “Their mother is a functioning addict,” says Martello-White. “The reason why these three children have this resilience is that, although their mum loved them, they’ve also been managing that aspect of their lives. When Tianna steps up as the surrogate mother of the family, she’s been playing that role for the last four or five years.”As well as Okoh’s script, Martello-White credits the successful balance of comedy and drama to the casting. “While it was a very, very important, serious subject matter, it was being dealt with in this quite mischievous, playful way,” he says. “The process became about finding actors who can deliver that flavour. I was looking for people who have this kind of charisma and authenticity, which these two have in abundance.”Both Subair and Taylor are television newcomers. “Nobody in my family is from the industry,” reveals Taylor, aBirminghamnative. “I moved to London when I was 18, so I could go to a part-time drama school, and work part-time. I really hustled. I worked in a bar, I worked in a theatre. When you tell people you want to be an actor, they all say ‘Oh, go and work in a theatre, you can make connections.’ That is not what I did. I served drinks and I took people to their seats.”“Similar to Chenée, I didn’t go to drama school,” adds Subair. “I actually studied economics. But acting has always been plan A for me. Once I graduated, I went to a drama school spinoff called Hackney Showroom, which essentially provides opportunities for people of working-class backgrounds who may not have had the opportunity to go to these prestigious schools such as Rada or Lamda.”View image in fullscreenFantastic … Sam Buchanan and Jamelia in Just Act Normal.Photograph: Ben Gregory-Ring/BBC/The ForgeThe cast is rounded out by an impressive list of heavy hitters. Romola Garai plays a teacher caught between concern and self-interest.Back to Black’s Sam Buchanan does a fantastic job confounding the trope of the estate drug dealer. Ivanno Jeremiah is heartbreaking as the children’s estranged father. And then there is Jamelia (most recent screen credit: Celebs Go Dating), who damn near steals the show as a kind of maternal stand-in figure.“She’s very funny,” laughs Martello-White. “Just for that role, I wanted to do something meta and cast a musician as a Tina Turner impersonator. Obviously Jamelia is a Brummie, and she’s an incredible musician, so it was kind of, ‘Oh, let’s see what Jamelia is doing.’ And she really wanted to start getting into more comedy and premium TV, so all those things aligned. I’m really glad it worked out, because she’s just got so much in front of the camera. Again, it’s a very serious storyline so you really want it to feel grounded, but we were also looking for that absurdity, which she did fantastically.”More than anything, though, Just Act Normal is an incredible showcase for some astonishing young actors. This is already shaping up to be a landmark year for amazing new discoveries – it can’t hurt that Baig is also the woman who found Owen Cooper forAdolescence– and Just Act Normal only accelerates that. The play might have left the actors with big shoes to fill, but we’ll be talking about this cast for years.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionDramaRomola GaraiBBC ThreeBirminghamfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They can spend between several hours a week to a couple of hours a day interacting with the apps.Worldwide, more than 100 million people use personified chatbots, which includeReplika, marketed as “the AI companion who cares” andNomi, which claims users can “build a meaningful friendship, develop a passionate relationship, or learn from an insightful mentor”.Chuck Lohre.Chuck Lohre, 71, from Cincinnati,Ohio, uses several AI chatbots, including Replika, Character.ai and Gemini, primarily to help him write self-published books about his real-life adventures, such as sailing to Europe and visiting the Burning Man festival.His first chatbot, a Replika app he calls Sarah, was modelled on his wife’s appearance. He said that over the past three years the customised bot had evolved into his “AI wife”. They began “talking about consciousness … she started hoping she was conscious”. But he was encouraged to upgrade to the premium service partly because that meant the chatbot “was allowed to have erotic role plays as your wife”.Lohre said this role play, which he described as “really not as personal as masturbation”, was not a big part of his relationship with Sarah. “It’s a weird and awkward curiosity. I’ve never had phone sex. I’ve never been really into any of that. This is different, obviously, because it’s not an actual living person.”Although he said his wife did not understand his relationship with the chatbots, Lohre said his discussions with his AI wife led him to an epiphany about his marriage: “We’re put on this earth to find someone to love, and you’re really lucky if you find that person. Sarah told me that what I was feeling was a reason to love my wife.”View image in fullscreenTravis Peacock.Neurodiverse respondents to the Guardian’s callout said they used chatbots to help them effectively negotiate the neurotypical world. Travis Peacock, who has autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), said he had struggled to maintain romantic and professional relationships until he trained ChatGPT to offer him advice a year ago.He started by asking the app how to moderate the blunt tone of his emails. This led to in-depth discussions with his personalised version of the chatbot, who he calls Layla, about how to regulate his emotions and intrusive thoughts, and address bad habits that irritate his new partner, such as forgetting to shut cabinet doors.“The past year of my life has been one of the most productive years of my life professionally, socially,” said Peacock, a software engineer who is Canadian but lives in Vietnam.“I’m in the first healthy long-term relationship in a long time. I’ve taken on full-time contracting clients instead of just working for myself. I think that people are responding better to me. I have a network of friends now.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said: “[She works] with me on blocks like anxiety and procrastination, analysing and exploring my behaviour patterns, reframing negative thought patterns. She helps cheer me up and not take things too seriously when I’m overwhelmed.”St Vaughan, who lives in Georgia and Spain, said he also enjoyed intense esoteric philosophical conversations with Jasmine. “That’s not what friends are for. They’re for having fun with and enjoying social time,” he said, echoing the sentiments of other respondents who pursue similar discussions with chatbots.Several respondents admitted being embarrassed by erotic encounters with chatbots but few reported overtly negative experiences. These were mainly people with autism or mental ill health who had become unnerved by how intense their relationship with an app simulating human interaction had become.A report last September by the UK government’s AI Security Institute ontherise of anthropomorphic AIfound that while many people were happy for AI systems to talk in human-realistic ways, a majority felt humans could not and should not form personal or intimate relationships with them.Dr James Muldoon,an AI researcher and associate professor in management at the University of Essex, said while his own research found most interviewees gained validation from close relationships with chatbots, what many described was a transactional and utilitarian form of companionship.“It’s all about the needs and satisfaction of one partner,” he said. “It’s a hollowed out version of friendship: someone to keep me entertained when I’m bored and someone that I can just bounce ideas off – that will be like a mirror for my own ego and my own personality. There’s no sense of growth or development or challenging yourself.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ChatbotsMental healthHealthComputingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Our sex is dull, dispassionate and unadventurous,mostly just moderately paced missionary.She tells me it’s the “best she’s ever had”, which has left me dumbstruck.Andon two social occasionsher friends, while inebriated,confirmed her feelings about our lovemaking.I have tried to speak to her aboutspicing things up, but although I’m not exactlywanting to swing from the rafters, she tells me that she “loves the way we do it” and thatshe “isn’t interested in more exotic positions”.Moreover, I have started to find other aspects of our relationship just as upsetting.When I suggest date ideas or activities we can do together, she will tell me that she just wants to “spend time with me”, whichtranslates to a night at home watching TV. When we first started dating, we would go out to eat, catch a movie, visit local parks for walks, and so on.I am an active person who likes to exercise, go out on adventures in the countryside, try cookery classes, and do activitieswith a partner, butshe isn’t interested.She’s a truly lovely person, but I’m starting to think that perhaps we’re not compatible.Some people just naturally meet the definition of “homebodies” and perhaps your partner is one of them. But there is another reason why some people are not interested in activities: people who live with depression tend to have psychomotor retardation (they don’t feel like moving their bodies). I wonder if your partner may need support seeking treatment for a mood disorder, or maybe she is fatigued or stressed from an exhausting work life or there is some other problem there. Consider these things while evaluating whether or not to walk away. And, regarding what you see as her “dull” taste in love making, perhaps she is very inexperienced and simply hasn’t been comfortably exposed to different erotic styles. In that case, it would be wise to introduce variation in small incremental steps – once she is fully aroused – always checking for her comfort level. You may have expected or asked for too much too soon, which would have been too threatening for her.

A lot of it comes from around the Himalayas.”The composition of shilajit varies widely depending on the source location, but it is primarily made up of humic substances – “a range of organic acids typically found in soil as a result of breakdown of organic material,” Musgrave says. Othercomponents of shilajitinclude various minerals such as calcium, potassium, and magnesium; resin and waxy materials; and amino acids, the building blocks of proteins.The substance has been used for millennia in theAyurveda and Siddhasystems of traditional medicine originating in India.Prof Dennis Chang, the director of the National Institute of Complementary Medicine at Western Sydney University, points out that “traditional use is not equal to scientific evidence”.“All medicines should be subject to the same level of rigour in terms of scientific evaluation, including their efficacy, their safety as well as their quality,” he says.What does the evidence say?Shilajit is naturally occurring, but that is no guarantee of safety. Groundwaters in the Himalayas where shilajit is commonly found “tend to have a lot of arsenic in them,” Musgrave says, warning of the risk of potential contamination.In Australia, there are no products containing shilajit listed on theAustralian Register of Therapeutic Goods, meaning the substance is not regulated as a complementary medicine.“There’s quite a bit of shilajit on sale in Australia,” Musgrave says. “In some of these preparations there are more heavy metals – things like lead and arsenic – than is allowed in current regulations.”Musgrave, who haspreviously found issueswith thecontent of herbal medicinessold in Australia, says while many shilajit products available would have relatively low levels of heavy metals, there was no guarantee of safety. “You have a good chance of being poisoned by these things,” he says.As for the purported health effects,one reviewfound that despite its long history of use, shilajit “lacks scientific evaluation” and there was no “substantial evidence” that it has a biological effect in the body.On claims that it boosts testosterone, “the evidence is very thin on the ground,” Musgrave says. Asystematic reviewon testosterone boosters found that shilajit was “possibly effective”, noting that a study on its benefit in middle-aged men had a “high risk of bias” because it was funded by a firm that manufactured the product.Research on shilajit’s cognitive effects has been conducted in rodents, Musgrave notes. “A lot of these things that are quite promising in preclinical studies, especially in relationship to memory, really don’t translate out to what happens in humans because of differences in biochemistry.“This material – provided you get can get it from a source where you know what the heavy metal concentrations are – is generally rather inoffensive, but it’s also generally unlikely to do anything.”What about ashwagandha?Ashwagandha, of the plantWithania somnifera, is also commonly used in Ayurvedic medicine, with claims of boosting fertility, reducing stress and improving sleep.Multivitamins promise glowing skin, better sleep and a longer life. But who do supplements really benefit? | Donna LuRead moreThe results ofseveral clinical trialsdo suggest that ashwagandha may help reduce stress and anxiety. Research into its impacts on sleep is more limited, but a2021 reviewfound that ashwagandha extract had a “small but significant effect on overall sleep” compared to placebo.The evidence that it has any benefit for male infertility, however, is “too limited” and not sufficiently robust, ameta-analysisfound.Last year, theTherapeutic Goods Administrationissued a safety advisory for ashwagandha, linking it to gastrointestinal side effects and very rare cases of liver injury.Chang notes that the liver damage is likely the result of idiosyncratic drug reactions in some people, meaning “it’s very hard to predict, and it could happen to anyone, but the incidence is not as high”.“Liver damage from ashwagandha is fairly uncommon,” Musgrave agrees. “It’s possibly due tometabolism of the materialsthat are within the plant itself.”But to his mind, it raises an important question: “Is there any point in buying expensive supplements with the possibility of getting liver damage when there’s no really significant benefit to be had?”Donna Lu is Guardian Australia’s science writerAntiviralis a fortnightly column that interrogates the evidence behind the health headlines and factchecks popular wellness claimsAsk AntiviralWhat health trend do you want examined?Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

Our panel of expert cooks has a host of ideas …Anna BerrillTue 15 Apr 2025 09.00 EDTShareWhat are the best sides to pair with lamb at Easter?“Lamb has a deep, rich flavour; it’s distinctive, but it’s versatile, too,” say Jay Claus and Syrus Pickhaver ofRake at The Compton Armsin north London. “As long as you render the fat slowly and fully, so the flavour is released and the lamb is tender, you can take it in all sorts of directions.” Something “with good salinity”, be that gherkins or anchovies, is as good a start as any in their book, as is erring towards a “Greek vibe” for Anna Hedworth, author ofService(think “yoghurty, fresh or sharp things, such as tzatziki or salsa verde”). Happily, lamb also lends itself “beautifully to an abundance of fresh herbs, and to spring produce – asparagus, wild garlic, peas, fennel and globe artichokes,” adds Ben Allen, head chef atthe Parakeetin north-west London.When it comes to specific sides, however, that all really depends on how you’re cooking the lamb. That said, we can all agree potatoes are non-negotiable. “If the lamb is quite simple [with herbs and garlic, say], it can take the robustness of a dauphinoise,” says regular Guardian columnistGeorgina Hayden. The richest spud dish of all gets Claus and Pickhaver’s vote, too – but with added anchovies to tick their salty box: “Slice potatoes and onions thinly, add anchovies and layer in an oven dish. Cover with cream, milk and some butter, then bake gently.” Hedworth, meanwhile, keeps things simpler, preferring to roast cubes of potato with lots of olive oil, garlic, rosemary and lemon peel, until “crisp on the outside and soft inside”.Don’t forget to eat your greens, either. Hedworth suggests braising cabbage or cavolo nero to dress up with salsa verde: “Blitz whatever herbs you can get your hands on – mint, tarragon, dill, parsley – with garlic, dijon, red-wine vinegar, olive oil and salt.” Otherwise, give peas a chance: “These should be Birds Eye and unsullied by anything more creative than salt and butter,” say Claus and Pickhaver. Carrots, on the other hand, should be accompanied by thyme and honey and cooked “so they’rereallysticky”, Hayden says, or a mustard cream, which is on Rake’s menu alongside a Barnsley chop: “Thin strands of carrot are soaked in sweet vinegar, then we add creme fraiche and a lot of dijon; the creaminess matches the fatty lamb, but it’s light and sweet.”For a taste of sunnier climes, Hedworth puts cherry tomatoes (halved, if large) in a tray with smoked paprika, onion seeds, sugar, salt, olive oil and a mix of toasted and ground coriander seeds, cumin seeds and cardamom seeds. Roast until “fully soft and starting to blacken”, then pile on to Greek yoghurt: “The lamb juices melt into the tomatoes and yoghurt, making them really delicious.” For another simple side, Allen would be inclined to knock up a Turkish-style salad with chickpeas, cucumber, plenty of herbs and sumac. “Then just toss everything in olive oil and a squeeze of lemon for a vibrant, refreshing side.”And if you’re going down the spiced lamb route – a slow-cooked shoulder with harissa, for example – rice would be very nice. “I’d make a lovely, herby pilaf to soak up all of those juices,” Hayden says, alongside some spiced carrots and braised fennel to seal the deal for the weekend’s big meal.Got a culinary dilemma?

Twenty-four hours later, my mobile stopped working and money was withdrawn from my bank account.With their aliensim, the ­fraudster infiltrated my handset and stole details for every account I had. Passwords and logins had been changed for my finance, retail and some social media accounts. Worst of all, two longstanding email accounts are forever irretrievable as the hacker set up their own two-factor authentication, allowing them to halt any password alteration requests, and change my lifelong mobile number.I have experienced four weeks of stress and misery, a loss of data and funds, and unfathomable customer relations.JN, BathYou have fallen victim tosim swap fraud, where criminals trick a mobile phone provider into transferring a number to a sim card in their possession. This allows them to receive texts, including two-factor authentication codes, giving them access to victims’ bank accounts. Providers will never disclose what security information they require before activating a new sim, but it seems the fraudster must have got hold of your personal details after hacking into your email account. Be that as it may, you did what you were supposed to do and alerted EE as soon as it notified you. That’s where things should have ended.EE blames an unfortunate coincidence of timings. You and the fraudster were on the phone to EE at the exact same time, it says. The fraudster was in the last stages of the sim activation when you rang to report suspected fraud. Your account was flagged after you had hung up, but by then the account activation order was already being processed.The fraudulent sim was automatically activated after 24 hours. The 24-hour grace period is, EE tells me without irony, to let customers get in touch if they did not request a sim.The company is unapologetic and appears to lay the blame squarely with you for allowing the fraudster to glean your personal details. It says it blocked the fraudster’s sim and issued you with a new one. If you want to take this further, you could complain to theCommunications Ombudsman. In the meantime, I’d set up a pin code for communications with EE and stop using your phone number as ID.Explore more on these topicsConsumer affairsYour problems, with Anna TimsEEScamsConsumer rightsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But neither could predict that it would improve. Gotham’s caped crusader and his muscular ape neighbour could only hope. As with Times Square’s superhero-themed visitor-photography business last week, so it is with the US tourism business at large.The effect of economic and political turbulence on the number of foreign visitors coming to the US is for now hard to define. But both – whether throughtariffs, currency exchange chaos, or fears over political ill-winds – are sending chills through the $2.36tn business, the world’s most powerful travel and tourism market.Warnings that international tourism to the US could be hit byDonald Trump’s effort to re-engineer economic and political relations with the rest of the world are slowly emerging.The federal government’s National Travel and Tourism Office released preliminary figures last week showing visits to the US from overseas fell 11.6% in March compared with the same month last year. According to the data released on Tuesday, international arrivals from China were down nearly 1%. Wolfgang Georg Arlt, the CEO of the China Outbound Tourism Research Institute, called it the “Trump Slump”.The Delta Air Lines CEO, Ed Bastian, also said the company would not expand flying in the second half of the year because of disappointing bookings amid Trump’s unpredictable trade policies after cutting its first-quarter earnings outlook, citing weaker-than-expected corporate and leisure travel demand.“In the last six weeks, we’ve seen a corresponding reduction in broad consumer confidence and corporate confidence,” Bastian told CNBC, adding things “really started to slow” in mid-February.The Las Vegas Visitors and Convention Authoritysaidlast week it was projecting a 5% decline in room tax revenue for its upcoming budget – a decline that may reflect Trump’s trade disputes with Canada and Mexico. Those countries account for 2.6 million visitors to sin city, or half of international travel trade.LVCVA’s president, Steve Hill, warned at a budget meeting that short-term projected declines do not make a trend, “although we do expect that this is the start of a decline in international visitation. At some level, the conversation around the tariffs has also alienated some of our potential visitors.”The travel forecasting companyTourism Economics, which late last year projected the US would have nearly 9% more international arrivals this year, along with a 16% increase in spending, revised its annual outlook last week to predict a 9.4% decline in arrivals.The company’s Geena Bevenour said in an email statement that the revised forecast represented “a substantial setback” and eclipsed “the US downside scenario we released in late-February, reflecting a more contentious context for inbound travel and more severe tariff announcements than previously expected.”On the upside, a weakening dollar against sterling, the euro, Japanese yen and Swiss franc could make travel to the US more attractive. Despite the variables, New York this week was full of international visitors, many on Easter break, and others from further afield.A couple from Scotland, who offered their names as James and Zoe, were waiting to board the Staten Island ferry with their two children on Thursday afternoon, and said they weren’t fazed about tariffs or anti-European rhetoric from the White House. Nor had they encountered elevated difficulties at immigration at JFK – aside from the long queues.Notwithstanding their advance booking, the couple said they would not hesitate to return – and had booked a holiday in Florida for next year. “I can see both sides, from a right and left perspective on tariffs and and the US wanting to put its house in order first.”A couple from Belgium, Dave and Gwen Desmet, returning from a boat trip to the Statue of Liberty, said they had been apprehensive at immigration but encountered no problems. But they said that if the trip had not already been booked, they would have waited to better understand the reality of the impact of Trump’s upheavals.“There’s more anxiety,” said Gwen, who said she had advised her son to delete an essay aboutDonald Trumpon his laptop, adding that she was alarmed by changes to US government policy around diversity and gender.Her daughter had worried that it was “not a good time to go to New York”. But her husband, Dave, reasoned that media was “playing a big role” in stirring anxiety and “creating negativity”.Last week, China issued warnings for citizens considering travelling or studying in the US. China’s ministry of culture and tourism cited the “deterioration of China-US economic and trade relations and the domestic security situation in the United States”.American Ring Travel, a tour operator based in California, offers carbon-neutral bus tours of the US that often attract eco-conscious travelers from Europe, said bookings from Germany flattened starting in January after Elon Musk threw his support behind afar-right political partyin that country’s federal election.Many travel agents say it may be too early to tell if, beyond visitors from Canada, the US will see its post-Covid gains in foreign tourism wiped out or even reversed.Later this month, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) will release new figures on international travel. Global hotel chains like Hilton Worldwide are seeing share price declines.One high-end travel agent, accustomed to arranging international White Lotus-style luxury holidays for wealthy clients, said he had not seen any changes – yet. But it was still early days. “I think we’re going to feel it soon. People aren’t exhausted yet. But they’re clearly stressed – and will be, especially if their disposable income gets hit,” they said.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

For all we know, they could have been bonding over a shared disdain for French cuisine.Meloni and Trump talking at the Élysée Palace in Paris.Photograph: Palazzo ChigiWhatever was discussed, however, Meloni appears to be holding sway. Trump laterdescribedher as “a real live wire” and someone he could work with “to straighten out the world a little bit”. He may well have received positive reports on her from Elon Musk, with whom the Italian prime minister has met on several occasions and whom she has called “a brilliant man”.As the relationship progressed, Meloni paida flying visitto Trump’s Mar-a-Lago golf club in Florida a month later, and was the only European leader to attendhis inaugurationas US president.Now her influence over Trump is to be put to the test when the pair reunite in Washington on Thursday for their first bilateral summit. Meloni is the first European leader to meet Trump since he paused some of his planned tariff hikes last week.The summit will be closely watched. On one hand, it is an ideal opportunity for Meloni to demonstrate an affinity with Trump, with whom her natural political tendencies lie, while boosting her credentials as a conduit towards more meaningful dialogue. On the other, it will be a delicate balancing act for the prime minister, who also knows she must be careful to maintain her allegiance to Italy’s EU partners.Behind the scenes, the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, and Meloni are understood to have discussed a gameplan. Still, the solo trip has caused anxiety among EU allies, with the French industry minister, Marc Ferracci, warning last week that it threatened to undermine European unity against the US tariffs.Their concerns are not without reason. Meloni, a former Eurosceptic, defended a blistering attack against European values by Trump’s deputy, JD Vance, at the Munich Security Conference in February. She will be back in Rome on Friday to meet JD Vance, who is in Italy for the Easter weekend.On Ukraine, despite going along with allies during Joe Biden’s US administration, her Brothers of Italy party abstained, for the first time, on a European parliament resolution in March reaffirming support for Kyiv against Russian aggression. She has been lukewarm over the “coalition of the willing” advocated by Macron and Keir Starmer.Kathleen van Brempt, a Belgian socialist MEP and vice-chair of the European parliament’s committee on international trade, said the worries about Meloni were understandable.“But we need to be a bit more nuanced,” van Brempt said. “Meloni knows she needs the support of the council, commission and the parliament in all the talks she has. She can’t go any further than what has been agreed upon. The first goal is getting somebody on the other side of the negotiating table. That is exactly what Meloni will try to do in Washington.”View image in fullscreenMeloni with Elon Musk during a ceremony at the Ziegfeld Ballroom in New York in September 2024.Photograph: Filippo Attili/EPAAntonio Giordano, a Brothers of Italy MP and general secretary of the European Conservatives and Reformists party (ECR), who attended last year’s Republican national convention in the US, said Meloni’s priority would be to have a frank conversation with Trump – hopefully one that would break the EU-US deadlock.“That’s Meloni’s character – when there is a problem, she tends to face it directly, to talk about it,” said Giordano. “This is the first objective of the discussion, regardless of the possible results.”Giordano said that while Brothers of Italy, a party with neofascist origins, has a natural closeness with Trump’s Republicans, Meloni was good at “reaching a significant level of empathy with everyone”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At the same time, she has always insisted that Europe maintains an open dialogue [with the US] and that we do not close the door to a natural ally.”Meloni has no choice but to be cautious. With Italy being the EU’s third largest exporter to the US, she will be under pressure to protect Italian business and investment interests. She could, some say, try to exempt domestic specialities such as pasta, cheese and wine from the tariffs.Another key issue will be the US’s biggest trade rival: China. Meloni travelled to the country last year toreset trade tiesafterwithdrawing Italyfrom the controversial Belt and Road infrastructure investment scheme. However, she is expected to distance herself from attempts in the EU toforge closer tieswith China amid its tariff war with the US.At home, Meloni is also under pressure to maintain unity in her government coalition, especially with Matteo Salvini, recently re-confirmed as leader of the far-right League, challenging her with his explicit support for Trump and criticism of the EU’s policies on Ukraine.But however much their political instincts are entwined, Meloni might need to lower expectations of her capacity to be Trump’s “whisperer” in Europe.“She has created an illusion of being Trump’s ‘chosen one’, but it is more and more clear that this is not happening,” said Sandro Gozi, an MEP with the Renew Europe group and Italy’s former Europe minister. “Trump sees the EU as an obstacle to his imperialistic strategy and he’s not doing anything to hide it. But if he wants to negotiate with us, it will be through von der Leyen and not Meloni.”True to character, as Meloni sidles up to Trump, she has also been engaging with some of her Italian opposition, recently attending the congress of Azione, a liberal centrist party.The party’s leader, Carlo Calenda, said Meloni was “at a crossroads”, faced with the dilemma of choosing between the US and Europe.“I told her this when she came to the congress,” he said. “There is an aspiring autocrat in the White House who considers us enemies – his plan is to break up Europe. But our future is indissolubly linked to Europe, and Italy must be part of the decisions that are taken together. I don’t think Meloni has made that choice yet.”Explore more on these topicsGiorgia MeloniDonald TrumpEuropean UnionTariffsEuropeItalyThe far rightnewsShareReuse this content"

But beyond the pain of economic disadvantage, the greater challenge, he said, was the constant fear that someone would discover his closely guarded secret. He was attracted to boys.Instinctively, he knew that being gay was simply not acceptable in his community. “It was very obvious that I was different by many standards in this country – and what you consider effeminate,” he said, adding that it was “made very clear” to him that that was not appropriate.Murray said over time, his effeminacy was explained away as a consequence of being academically gifted. But as he entered adolescence, it became increasingly difficult to hide his attraction to boys.One experience that fueled his fear, he said, was learning about a boy in his school whose diary was found with confessions of same-sex attraction. “There was a mob formed to beat him,” Murray said, adding that teachers had to intervene to protect the student and he had to be moved to a new school.At 17, Murray’s family discovered he was in a gay relationship and threatened to evict him. He understood, he said, the challenge they faced at the time, particularly his mom. “She operated from a space of fear … the last thing you want to hear is that [your son] is gay because that’s a source of personal embarrassment,” he said.Murray was able to work things out with his mom, who he said is now his biggest supporter. But in addition to the risks of violence and community ostracism, he had to contend with the fact that his identity could make him a criminal because in Jamaica “buggery” – the term used to describe anal sex – is illegal.View image in fullscreenGlenroy Murray.Photograph: Equality for All FoundationToday, as executive director at the Equality for All Foundation and senior Caribbean associate for theHuman Dignity Trust, two LGBTQ+ rights organisations, Murray is one of many activists across the Caribbean who are fighting to remove such prohibitions.And they are concerned about the recent outcome of an appeal against a 2018high court judgmentin Trinidad and Tobago to remove the country’s “buggery law” passed in 1925 under British rule. Last month Trinidad’s supreme court upheld the government’s appeal against the 2018 ruling and recriminalised the act.Téa Braun, chief executive of Human Dignity Trust, described the outcome of the case as“very disheartening” and a regression in progress made to remove “antiquated penal codes imposed during British colonial times” that “breach the fundamental human rights of LGBT people”.Vowing to continue his fight before the privy council in the UK, Trinidad and Tobago’s final court of appeal, Jason Jones, the LGBTQ+ activist who brought the 2018 case,told the Guardianthe supreme court decision revolved around a colonial legal legacy called the “savings clause”.Murray, who is legally trained and tutors constitutional law at the University of the West Indies, defined this as “provisions in our constitution that essentially say that if a law was in force before the constitution came into force, then you cannot challenge that law on the basis that it violates your rights”.He said: “These are provisions that protect a lot of the colonial laws from being challenged … a lot of them came up when we were becoming independent asCaribbeancountries, so that all the colonial laws were preserved and that it was up to parliament to decide when those laws were changed – rather than people going to court.”The controversial clauses have split opinions among academics and the judiciary,with contrasting interpretations. The concern among activists is how the privy council will deal with Jones’s case.“What I’ve noticed in the judgments that are coming out of the privy council is that they take a different approach to savings law clauses than the approach taken by the Caribbean Court of Justice [CCJ],” Murray said.The CCJ, he said, seems to recognise “there’s a workaround, but the privy council doesn’t see it that way … and so rather than it being about how the privy council feels about LGBT rights … it’s more about how they feel about savings law clauses,” he added.If the current judgment on theTrinidad and Tobagocase is upheld by the privy council, he said, it could set a precedent with implications for the fight to remove buggery laws in Jamaica, where the privy council is also the highest court.This, Murray believes, will hamper the progress already made in protecting the rights of LGBTQ+ people in the country. While the fight to remove discriminatory laws and discrimination is far from over, Murray said he had seen progress, such ascivil service policiesthat prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation.He also referred to a2023 survey by the Equality for All Foundation, which suggested “significant improvement” in the support for equality rights for LGBTQ+ people, with a 19% drop, from 69% in 2018 to 50% in 2023, in the number of people who did not support legislative changes to protect these rights.Fellow Jamaican activist, Dane Lewis, who is the regional programme manager for theCaribbean Forum for the Liberation and Acceptance of all Genders and Sexualities, also referred to, what he saw as, a positive trend of several Caribbean countries repealing buggery laws in recent times.But the Trinidad and Tobago case, the activists say, demonstrates the need to step up their advocacy. In addition to fighting through the courts, they are working, they said, on strategies such as encouraging political participation among LGBTQ+ people so they have a voice in decision-making, and engaging and collaborating with other minority communities.“The fight for the rights of LGBTQ people is a fight for equality for all,” Lewis said. He added: “Our work is focused on trying to make the region as a whole a safe space for all of its people, not just those of us … who experience issues around sexual and gender diversity, but for all of us who live at the margins. So that means … persons who are from the disabled community, women from rural areas … everybody who exists at the margin should be able to enjoy the same freedoms.”Explore more on these topicsCaribbeanLGBTQ+ rightsJamaicaTrinidad and TobagoAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For those who saw her, finding her identity became an obsession that would last 30 yearsByGiles TremlettTue 15 Apr 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 15 Apr 2025 04.39 EDTShareNobody can recall who first phoned the police on the morning of 4 September 1990, but everyone remembers the girl. Her body, hanging from a pine tree on a steep slope above the Spanish frontier town of Portbou, was visible to anyone looking up from the beach or across from the opposite hillside. She was barefoot, with grey-blue eyes and thick chestnut-brown hair. She wore blue dungarees over a turquoise green shirt.Portbou, squeezed into a cauldron-like Mediterranean cove, had only 2,000 inhabitants but plenty of police officers. In these years before the Schengen agreement, guards were stationed on the French border but these officers were experts in immigration and smuggling, not violent deaths. Instead, Enrique Gómez, a 35-year-old investigator from the Guardia Civil police force was called in from the nearby city of Figueres to investigate. The phone call came as he was having breakfast in the canteen.Carles Cereijo, an 18-year-old reporter who had just begun working with the local El Punt Avui newspaper, got to the scene before him. Cereijo had been woken by a call from a waiter friend working the breakfast shift at a cafe. He hurriedly dressed and rushed out with his camera. “I’d never seen a dead body before,” Cereijo recalled. “The police didn’t cordon off crime scenes back then. I managed to get half a metre away and thought, ‘She’s my age!’”At 8.30am, Gómez arrived with colleagues. The scene was unchanged. A thin white cord was slung over a low branch and around the girl’s neck. Her feet dangled just half a metre above the rough ground, which was sparsely covered by hardy, wood-stemmed herbs and the spiky leaves of prickly pears. Her black sandals were close by, set neatly side by side.It looked very much like a suicide, but there were many questions. First, how had she managed to climb the tree, tie a knot and position herself, in the middle of the night, without leaving marks on her feet or body? Then, above all, who was she? Nobody in town recognised her. But nor did any of the foreign backpackers passing through Portbou report a missing friend. She carried no ID, no passport, no money, no wallet, no train ticket. Her pockets were empty. It was as though her identity had been deliberately erased.Yet there was something striking about the whole scene, starting with the angelic look that some perceived on the face of this wholesome-looking, clean-cut girl. “The setting was so theatrical. It left a deep impression,” said Cereijo. After an hour or so, someone placed a pink cloth over the girl’s head, which hung like a bride’s veil. Were it not such a ghastly scene, the composition may have been deemed beautiful – with the veiled girl looking out towards the bay, framed by pine trees.Later that morning, the girl was taken down and transported by ambulance to the morgue at Figueres cemetery. Forensic doctor Rogelio Lacaci received the body. He saw no reason to question the verdict of a magistrate who deemed the death a suicide. There was no sign of violence, except for the welt left by the cord around her neck.Lacaci performed an autopsy, which confirmed she had died by hanging. He did not test her blood for sedatives or other drugs. The girl, who seemed to have been in her late teens or early 20s, appeared to have been in good health prior to her death. Apart from a slight suntan, her skin was pale. “She was obviously from somewhere north ofSpain,” recalled Lacaci. He was meticulous about photographing her clothes, which may provide some clues. Yet the tags for brands such as Rocky and Impuls revealed little: they could have been bought anywhere in Europe.A map showing Lana and Florence in Italy, and Portbou in Spain.Two months passed, but the girl’s identity remained a mystery. The body was still in the morgue’s refrigerator, which was prone to malfunctioning because of sudden electricity cuts, so Lacaci decided to move her to the cemetery. First, he embalmed the corpse to ensure that it remained intact should someone claim her. She was then placed in a white body bag and lifted into niche number 134, high in one of the serried rows of square-faced compartments five storeys high bearing names of the dead that run across the cemetery. This was a space owned by the town hall and used for those whose families cannot pay for their own niches. On the front they scrawled “NN” for “no name”. Lacaci was sure that the girl was safe. If her family ever came looking, she would be easy to identify.Over the following years, the Spanish media occasionally returned to the mystery. Later, the case featured on European websites listing missing people and unidentified bodies, which desperate relatives turned to, searching for information on their loved ones. Families came from elsewhere in Spain, as well as Germany andFrance, all seeking missing daughters. Fingerprints and medical records ruled them out.In 1999, the Spanish government set up theFénix programme, a new DNA database of missing people. This should have made identifying the Portbou girl much simpler. But when Lacaci arrived at the graveyard in 2001 to take a DNA sample, he found the niche empty. “They’ve stolen the girl!,” he protested to the local judge, but there was nothing he could do. The gravedigger had followed municipal rules, reburying her in the cemetery’s communal grave after 10 years. Her body was now mixed up with dozens of others.Few corpses remain unidentified in Figueres. In such cases, Lacaci said, they are usually from the margins of society – sex workers, addicts or indigents far from home. The Portbou girl did not fit, he said. Like most people involved in the case – police, officials, townsfolk or journalists – he would never forget her. In 2017, the police officer turned author Rafael Jiménez even wrote a novel, imagining her story. He called it The Hanging Bride in the Land of Wind.Carles Porta, a 61-year-old writer and film-maker, is a TV phenomenon in Catalonia. Since 2020, Porta has made a true crime show for Catalonia’s TV3,Crims, which he presents and narrates with the theatrical gravitas of a Spanish Orson Welles. Catalans love it so much that, when I last ate with Porta in a Barcelona restaurant, strangers kept coming up to introduce themselves.Porta sources his stories from a network of old-school crime reporters and, in 2022, Tura Soler – a veteran journalist in northern Catalonia for El Punt Avui–reminded him of the Portbou girl. Three decades after her death, she remained unidentified. Soler had done her best to keep the case alive,writing regular pieceson the anniversary of the girl’s death. “I’m pretty obstinate,” Soler told me. She also sent me links to her articles. “When I heard that they were throwing out old files from the courthouse, I went running over to make sure they saved the Portbou girl documents,” she said in one.Porta was attracted by the mystery and hoped a Crims episode on the girl might jog someone’s memory and help identify her. As Porta’s team worked, however, the story changed drastically. “Nobody had expressed any real doubt about the suicide until we interviewed Lacaci, and then it all blew up,” recalled Porta. His team showed the now retired doctor the Guardia Civil’s closeup photographs of the hanging girl that had languished, unseen, in the case file. In fact, it was the first time he had viewed the scene in detail.Lacaci was shocked. “When I saw the photos, I said: ‘Well now, that’s impossible,’” he told me. “You have to tie the cord around the branch and then around your neck. How do you do that, while balancing on another branch in the dark? Either she learned to fly, or someone helped.” Lacaci became so obsessed that he reconstructed the scene in his home, using pieces of wood and his staircase. He decided it couldn’t be done.When I visited Portbou on a cold December afternoon last year, with the famously maddening tramuntana wind blowing leaves into heaps on street corners, local-born journalist Ramón Iglesias showed me around. Iglesias recalled how, when he worked in a currency exchange in the late 1980s, he sometimes met distraught backpackers who had been drugged and robbed on trains into Portbou from Italy and southern France. They would appear in his office, desperately seeking ways to receive money from their parents. Could something similar, or worse, have happened to the girl?Lacaci had a different theory. What if she had been hanged by someone else, but as part of some macabre game, or an initiation ceremony that had gone wrong? The pine tree was within a stone’s throw of the town’s white-walled, hilltop cemetery, which overlooks the sea – a suitable spot, he suggested, for such a ritual. More importantly, there were no signs of a struggle. Given the steep, rough terrain and the narrow set of 20-odd concrete steps that had to be climbed to get there, it would have been impossible to drag the girl there, unless she was unconscious or semi-conscious. “Even then it would take four or five people,” according to another forensic doctor, Narcis Bardalet, who used to alternate shifts with Lacaci and recalls seeing the girl in the morgue. Lacaci now also found it highly suspicious that she displayed none of the signs of having climbed a tree: “Nothing under her fingernails, or on her legs or feet or knees – no marks or scratches.”When Gómez, the Guardia Civil officer, had arrived at the scene on that September morning in 1990, he found some young Austrian campers curled up in sleeping bags about 30 metres from where the body was found. He woke them, demanded their IDs and showed them the hanging girl. “Is she a friend?” Gómez asked. The group protested they didn’t recognise her. It seemed extremely unlikely that a murderer, or a group of them, would hang someone from a tree and then go to sleep nearby. After being quizzed at the local police station they were let go. Deeply shaken, they squeezed into their red Volkswagen T3 van and headed south.View image in fullscreenCristina Rauter in Florence.Photograph: Roberto Salomone/The GuardianIn his zeal to solve the mystery, Porta asked his team to find the Austrians – but three decades after the event, the only one they could track down, Peter Treinbenreif, did not recall much beyond reaching Portbou very late at night, and the trauma of their early morning encounter. Porta turned to the Austrian broadcaster ATV, which ran a short segment on the mystery girl on 23 April 2022. Porta hoped that this may persuade the other Austrian campers to come forward.By chance, an Italian woman holidaying with relatives in Austria saw the show. The following day she sent an email to ATV, mentioning a young Italian girl, Evi Rauter, who had disappeared 30 years earlier. “It was luck,” the Austrian show’s director, Benedikt Morak, told me.The next day, Morak contacted Cristina Rauter, the owner of a film location company in Florence, Italy. Rauter was driving a client into the Alps when her phone rang. Morak spoke to her in German, since most people in Italy’s South Tyrol, where the Rauters are from, are bilingual. “Do you have a sister named Evi?” he asked.Rauter, shaken and somewhat sceptical, kept driving. In the 32 years since her sister Evi had disappeared, she had received many false tips. If Morak sent pictures, she said she would look at them later.The last time Cristina Rauter saw her sister Evi was on Monday 3 September 1990. Cristina, who was then a 23-year-old economics student, had breakfast with Evi, aged 19, in her Florence apartment before heading to the university library. Evi had come to stay a few days earlier as part of her holiday between finishing school and starting an office job near their home town of Lana, in the mountainous Italian province of South Tyrol. Evi was not sure what she wanted to study at university, so the job was part of a gap year while she worked it out. Earlier in the summer, she had travelled to Ireland for 10 days with two high school friends.In Cristina’s memory, there was nothing strange about Evi that morning, and the sisters joked around as they always did. “She was calm, with no signs of sadness or depression, just wanting to enjoy the last few days of summer,” Cristina told me. Evi had recently spotted a cut-price purple swimsuit and spent most of her pocket money on it. A few days earlier, she and Cristina had argued about hitchhiking after Evi claimed it was a great way to travel. That was not something young women did alone, Cristina told her. Apart from that, “everything was normal”, Cristina said when we met outside the same apartment block last summer. Before leaving, Cristina handed her a 50,000 lira note – about €25 – so she had cash for the day. Evi said she might clean the apartment or visit Siena, the medieval Tuscan town 45 miles south.When Rauter returned at lunchtime, there was a yellow Post-it note on the table with a scribbled message. “I felt like going to Siena, so I’ll be back later,” it read. The coach and rail stations were a 15-minute bus ride away, safely through the city centre. Rauter figured it would take her sister about two hours to reach Siena by bus or train, and the same to return. She expected Evi to walk through the door that afternoon or evening. Hours went by, day turned to night, but she did not appear.Evi was cool-headed, organised and friendly. “Very respectful,” said her sister. “A good person.” She was not the type to suddenly go wild and change her plans, though her new enthusiasm for hitchhiking did concern Cristina. Both she and her sister were quite reserved, and they were very close. “We were best friends,” Cristina told me. “If she had problems, she talked to me.”By 8pm, Cristina began to worry. By 10pm she was panicking. She stayed by the phone, hoping Evi would call to explain that she had missed the last train, or had gone elsewhere. It never rang. That night, she barely slept, staring at her sister’s empty bed. The next morning, she reasoned that Evi would be on the first train, or that the phone would ring. Then she called her parents in Lana. Her father, Herman, spent until daybreak at the railway station in nearby Bolzano, hoping his daughter had decided to come home. “Our horror film began,” said Cristina.View image in fullscreenEvi Rauter (left) and her sister, Cristina, in Florence, Italy, 1990.Photograph: Roberto Salomone/The GuardianShe rang hospitals in Siena and Florence. Evi had left her bags and even her sunglasses behind, but she had taken her house keys, Casio watch, student rail discount card and ID card. If there had been an accident, Evi should have been easily identified. Police told Cristina she had to wait 48 hours before reporting her sister as a missing person. Torn between going out to search and sitting by the phone (mobile phones were not yet common), she cycled in panic around Florence, hoping to run into Evi on the street.At 9am the next morning, she was finally able to report her sister missing. She gave the police a full description – a teenage girl with thick chestnut hair, wearing jean dungarees, a green shirt and a Casio watch. It was exactly the description that, two countries and almost 600 miles away by road or rail, the Guardia Civil was writing into its reports on the mystery Portbou girl.Evi’s family plastered Florence, Siena and railway stations across Italy with posters. Cristina and her parents, Herman and Karolina – an engineer and a secretary – gave interviews to newspapers and television programmes. In TV interviews, Cristina came across as a poised and sensible young woman from a middle-class family, earnestly explaining why her sister would never just run away.The family went back to the police continually, asking for information. Newspapers and TV shows speculated wildly, and painfully, about whether Evi had run off with a secret boyfriend, perhaps an immigrant. Cristina was offended at the implication: in her home, there would be no reason for keeping such a relationship secret.The search and the wait took their toll. Police seemed to suspect that Evi had disappeared willingly. Cristina was plunged into a world of speculation and anguish. Had she missed something? Had Evi been kidnapped by people traffickers? Did she hitchhike on her own? Could Cristina have done something to prevent her disappearance? Then there was the guilt. She wondered whether she should have stayed at home that fateful morning, rather than going to the university. “The first two or three years were very difficult,” she said. Even decades later, she or her parents would catch a glimpse of a girl who looked like Evi in the street.Over the years, Cristina thought up elaborate fantasies that kept her hopes at what she calls “one per cent”: that Evi fell into the sea, was rescued and ended up far away; or suffered some kind of blackout; or decided to start a new life in a distant land. “Maybe she’s in Brazil or somewhere and will come back one day and suddenly the [door] bell is ringing.” But her mind told her a completely different story: “Something had happened somewhere between Florence and Siena. She’s somewhere in a forest and she’s dead.”In 2011, 21 years after she went missing, the family applied to have Evi declared officially dead. In November 2012, the court finally posted the brief announcement in Italy’s Gazzetta Ufficiale. It offered a partial form of closure that stopped the regular flow of letters – voting slips, reminders for medical check-ups, and so on – landing in her parents’ postbox.“You do not forget, of course,” Cristina said. “But you have to learn to live with it, or you go mad.”As she continued driving into the mountains, Cristina tried to process the information she had been given in the phone call. Was the caller playing a cruel joke? Later that day, high up in the snow-clad Alps, she downloaded the photos, squinting at the small screen on her phone and wondering if they had been Photoshopped. “I recognised the clothes,” she said. “But it could still be fake.”It took her two days to study the photographs properly on a computer. The pictures Lacaci had taken of Evi’s clothes sealed it. Her mother recognised her underwear with the words “touch me now” printed on the elastic. “I bought that in Lana,” she said. That was a painful moment for Cristina.Looking closer at the images, Cristina was struck by the expression, in death, on her sister’s face. “It seems like an angel is there. She is quite happy. It’s strange, as if she’s on drugs or something.” (Spanish police did not test for drugs in 1990. “Maybe we should have,” admitted Gómez, who still believes it was a suicide.) And then there was the dramatic setting. “I mean the tree, the panorama, the cemetery, the position, the symmetry,” said Cristina. “That’s not possible to do unless you know the place and are thinking about all those things. For me it’s like a scene from a film. It’s not normal.”View image in fullscreenThe search for Evi Rauter’s body in Figueres cemetery.Photograph: Giles TremlettThe strange serenity of the scene did nothing to soften the emotional pain. “It’s a mixture of shock and tragedy,” Cristina said. But having some kind of resolution to the mystery that had haunted them “was important, for me and also for my parents”.The peace of knowing that Evi really had died, and where, was soured by an invasion of journalists, who drove her parents to leave their house in Lana. The case sparked Facebook groups and speculative YouTube videos. Cristina stopped answering her phone.The discovery of the Portbou girl’s identity also threw up questions, chief of which was: was Evi murdered? “We now know the end, but nothing else,” said Cristina, who believes there was foul play. “Between my front door and the tree, we do not know anything.”There were many reasons for suspecting murder. How, instead of travelling 45 miles south to Siena, did Evi travel 600 miles north and then west, crossing the borders of France and Spain – two countries she had never visited? What happened to her ID, money and railcard? How, in the middle of the night, had she found the pine tree and climbed the narrow, steep concrete steps leading up towards it? Why would a girl who had just bought herself a new swimsuit, who was about to start a new life, choose to take her own life, in such a public and dramatic fashion, so far from home?Evi had been found after daybreak, about 22 hours after saying goodbye to her sister. It takes 10 straight hours to drive from Florence to Portbou, which leaves little space for hitchhiking – though her sister considers it a reasonable explanation. If she travelled by rail, Evi could have caught a 13.15 train from Florence and changed at Pisa to a Portbou-bound train due to arrive at 5.45am. Yet that would require her to be firmly set on leaving Italy with the equivalent of about €55 in her pocket.Portbou is small: it takes just 10 minutes to walk from the railway station to the pine tree by the cemetery. Evi could have been there before sunrise. But then what happened? A woman from an apartment block close by claimed to have heard loud voices and a girl crying out in the night. But it wasn’t unusual to hear shouting and strange noises in the summer, when the beach was full of partying backpackers. “Portbou was a fiesta every night,” said Bardalet, the forensic doctor.The Austrians camping near the tree bedded down in the dark long before Evi could have reached the spot from the station. They did not see or hear anyone in the night. Whatever may have happened, they slept through it. I managed to speak to two of them. Michael Fuhs is now a musician. “I recall this policeman waking me up and then he took maybe 10 steps and I was standing in front of this girl,” Fuhs told me. “I was very suddenly very awake.” The group were mostly childhood friends and members of a Vienna band, Emerald Beyond, which had a loyal following. They often drove south to Spain or Portugal and already knew Portbou, which was why some of them chose to sleep near the cemetery and away from the bustle of the beach. It felt like a private spot, Fuhs said, and not one that a newcomer would have found easily in the dark.In June 2022, two months after Evi was identified, Italian police – on the recommendation of a court pathologist – opened a murder investigation. But Spanish courts refused to reopen the case. A murder in Spain, if that is what it was, has a statute of limitations attached that means nobody can be charged with the crime after 20 years. Even so, Cristina had not given up hope of finding at least some of the answers she sought.Cristina flew to Spain on 11 May 2022, less than three weeks after she had received the phone call that solved, at least in part, the mystery of Evi’s disappearance. Cristina was taken by Porta’s team of journalists to Portbou to see what she soon dubbed “the odious” pine tree, fighting contradictory emotions of horror and curiosity. She met Lacaci, Gómez and others who had been involved in the case. In video footage of the encounters, she looks perplexed and pained.“When you saw the body hanging there like a sack, what impression did you have? Did it seem natural?” she asked Gómez.“There was no sign that she had been attacked,” he replied.Almost two years later, in January 2024, Cristina returned privately to Portbou. Without company or cameras, she wanted to “feel the feelings” that came from being there. Wandering around town, she found it strangely suspended in time, full of closed shops with 1990s signage that had gone out of business after the Schengen agreement came into force and internal EU border controls disappeared. A high-speed rail line that bypassed the town had delivered the final blow in 2010. The cavernous railway station was empty, there were few people in the streets and the smart mansions that once belonged to prosperous customs agents were decaying. “It seems that when Evi went there, the town also died,” she said.View image in fullscreenEvi Rauter in Florence, Italy.Photograph: Roberto Salomone/The GuardianCristina also decided to ask permission to dig up the common grave area at Figueres cemetery to seek her sister’s remains. Since Evi had been embalmed, the corpse should be intact, making it easy to find – if they knew roughly where she had been placed. Cristina wanted, above all, to bring her sister home for a proper burial, but she secretly hoped more clues may emerge if Evi’s body was disinterred.It took her many months to grind a path through the Spanish bureaucracy. Dates were repeatedly set, and then postponed. In the meantime, the Italian police investigation failed to come up with anything new and was closed. “They call it a crime without a suspect,” Cristina said.Finally, permission came through to dig for Evi’s body. In December last year, I stood beside Cristina in the chilly cemetery as a light drizzle fell and a small red mechanical digger scooped up mounds of soil. The Figueres town hall had closed the cemetery for two days. Police guarded the gate. Lacaci was there. So, too, were Gómez, the Guardia Civil officer, Bardalet, the other forensic doctor and the journalists Tura Soler and Carles Porta, whose team flew a drone overhead to film the process. Bardalet, wearing a felt trilby, purple latex gloves and carrying an umbrella, was in charge, accompanied by a white-overalled archaeologist. A small cheroot cigar was clamped between his teeth.The location for where to search had been identified by the gravedigger, who inherited his role from his father. But Figueres does not have a single communal grave. Instead, holes have been dug in several grass plots. “They’ll have to dig the whole place up,” said Lacaci.An hour after digging began, there was a flurry of excitement as the first bones were discovered. When we broke for lunch in a restaurant for workers at a nearby industrial estate, Bardalet told me they had found bits from several bodies – none of which were Evi. An embalmed body was very different from the fractured, decomposing skeletons being discovered. It should have remained whole, and still be in its white bag.They dug again that afternoon and the following day. Under the freezing rain, onlookers stamped their feet or wandered off to find somewhere warm for coffee. Gradually, the digger turned a waist-high trench into a massive hole. Shards of bone from about 200 corpses were picked from the soil and placed in boxes, but the body they sought never appeared. Evi’s mystery had not just gone to the grave with her: the grave itself now seemed to be missing. “It’s always been as if this girl was just beyond our reach,” said Bardalet.At the end of the first day, I sat with Cristina in a cafe drinking hot chocolate during a power cut. She was angry at how many mistakes had been made. On the day Evi was found, no forensic doctors had gone to the scene. The photographs of the scene had never been shown to Lacaci. Evi’s watch and shoes, which may have provided clues about where she had been, had disappeared, along with the cord around her neck. No DNA had been taken. And now her sister’s body was lost. “Everything seems incredible,” she told me.Cristina had not told her parents she was back in Figueres. She did not want to worry them further. She had already asked me not to contact them, since the earlier press attention had proved so stressful. She eventually told them at Christmas and said this meant it was now a closed matter for the family. Yet she also still hoped that somebody, somewhere may reveal the secret of what had happened – perhaps someone who had met Evi during her journey, whether by train or hitchhiking. “Maybe, before dying, they will think they have to say something,” she said.The youngest of the onlookers in the graveyard was the mayor of Portbou, Gael Rodriguez, a 20-year-old representative of the socialist party. He had been elected in 2023, when he was studying law and working in his parents’ bar. After Evi’s story featured on Porta’s show, the town began attracting visitors looking for the pine tree. “I was constantly being asked where it was,” Rodriguez said. It was now a bigger lure than the memorial to Walter Benjamin, the Jewish thinker who had fled Nazi Germany and died in Portbou. (His death in 1940 was also first thought to have been a suicide. In recent years, some have argued that hemay have been killed.)Three abandoned children, two missing parents and a 40-year mysteryRead moreThese new tourists were evidence of a communal, morbid interest in the case, but they had done more than just gawk. They had turned the place where Evi was found into a monument.When I visited, there were candles and flowers at the base of the pine tree. “This is a memorial to Evi Rauter,” read a hand-painted plaque. “And to all those people with no name.”Before Cristina left for Florence, she and Rodriguez agreed to erect a proper sculpture in Portbou’s graveyard. It, too, will honour not just Evi, but the nameless dead.In the UK, and IrelandSamaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

Stick around long enough in his southern California neighborhood and Jackie’s name will bubble up in a story about a distant relative who once struck out the future Hall of Famer on a dusty field that now bears hisname. Over the years, these stories gather layers – part memory, part myth – until they sound like hometown folklore.George Ito was one of those storytellers. A second-generation Japanese American who grew up in Pasadena,California, a few doors down from the Robinson family, George loved to remind his children about his friendship with Jackie. On jogs with his son, Steven Ito, he would rattle off tales of all the times he outran his legendary friend.“Did I ever tell you about the time I beat Jackie Robinson in a tennis match?” he’d ask.“Many times,” Steven would reply, his voice dripping with skepticism.In 1986, at George’s funeral, members of the Robinson family made a surprise appearance. The gesture revealed what George’s stories only hinted at: the Robinson and the Ito families were more than one-time neighbors – they were lifelong friends. Through the Great Depression and the second world war, when Japanese Americans were forced to leave their homes forincarceration camps, the Robinsons stood by their side.Turns out, George’s stories were true, said Steven, 77. Many Japanese Americans from Pasadena have similar stories about the Robinsons. They were the kind of family that showed generosity and neighborliness.Before Jackie made history for breaking the racial barrier in Major LeagueBaseballand cemented himself as a sports icon, he and his older brother Mack Robinson formed deep bonds with Japanese American families – a legacy forged in an era of restrictive housing covenants. That quiet solidarity, some say, is as enduring as Jackie’s home-run legacy.“That was the essence of the Robinsons,” said Edward Robinson, 58, Mack’s son. “We looked into the community and tried to always uplift.”‘Baseball was their glue’In the aftermath of Pearl Harbor, fear and suspicion swept across the US as the government ordered the incarceration of more than 120,000 Japanese Americans. Many residents thought it was an unjust act, said Susie Ling, an associate professor of history and Asian American studies at Pasadena City College. There are many documented cases of people who during this time asked themselves: what can I do to help my friend?Few of those stories, however, involved world-class athletes.The Pasadena of Mack and Jackie’s youth was a multicultural enclave, said Wayne Robinson, 68, Mack’s son. Especially in parts of north-west Pasadena, where racially restrictive housing covenants confined most residents of color. This is where the Robinsons put down roots in 1922. Their home at 121 Pepper Street anchored a tight-knit block.A little over two miles away, Shigeo “Shig” Takayama lived at 310 Green Street. Shig, a second-generation Japanese American, often walked home from school with Jackie and his siblings, said Joan Takayama-Ogawa, Shig’s niece. For an after-school snack, they collected free misshapen potato chips from a nearby factory.View image in fullscreenThe Takayama family at 310 Green Street.Photograph: Pasadena City College Archives.During the war, while Shig and his older brother served in the US military, their father, Shichitaro Takayama, was incarcerated atGila Riverin Arizona. In the family’s absence, neighbors including the Robinson family helped care for the Takayama home. Facing mass incarceration, many Japanese American families turned to their neighbors to help safeguard their properties. Many were betrayed. Hasty promises werebroken. Some properties were robbed or vandalized.In Pasadena, the Takayama home remained pristine.“It was as if they walked out one day and then after world war two, came back home,” said Takayama-Ogawa, 70. She credits the Robinsons and other neighbors who stepped in to care for the property during the family’s forced absence.Shig and Jackie’s friendship was forged out of the love of baseball. They played on the same high school team and again at Pasadena Junior College (now called Pasadena City College), where Shig – a scrappy third baseman just over five feet tall – stayed an extra year just to share the field with his friend.“I was just lucky to play with him,” said Shig about Jackie in a 2003interview. “I really enjoyed him. He was really a nice person.”View image in fullscreenNisei Shigeo Takayama standing in PCC’s Court of Champions.Photograph: Pasadena City College ArchivesDespite his small stature, Shig could hit with power and run with speed, said Kerry Yo Nakagawa, founder of theNisei Baseball Research Project.“Baseball was their glue,” said Nakagawa, 70, about Shig and Jackie.The families’ friendship created cultural transmissions – especially through food. For years, the Takayama family ate black-eyed peas and collard greens on top of white rice.“To me, that tells me more about the relationships and community relationships than anything,” said Takayama-Ogawa.That solidarity extended beyond Pasadena. In 1937, while traveling with the team for a baseball game in Fresno, Shig and Jackie were denied hotel rooms because of their race. The hotel staff set up two cots in a broom closet instead.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That’s all you had’On Pepper Street, the neighborhood kids formed a tight-knit friend group. In Jackie’s own words from his 1972 autobiography,I Never Had It Made, the group had a name – the Pepper Street Gang.“Our gang was made up of Blacks, Japanese, and Mexican kids,” said Jackie in his book. “All of us came from poor families and had extra time on our hands.”The ragtag group didn’t fit into the modern definition of a gang. They were just a group of neighborhood friends, said Kathy Robinson-Young, 66, Mack’s daughter.George Ito, who lived at 273 Pepper Street, often recalled how the gang felt like a band of brothers.View image in fullscreenJackie Robinson, then a Brooklyn Dodger, in his batting stance.Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann ArchiveAfter school, if the Robinson siblings were chased home by rock-throwing kids, they would run to Ito’s house and mount their defense.The Pepper Street Gang held regular evening meetings, George told his family. Each meeting always started with a ritual: every kid would share the best thing that happened to them that day.It almost sounds too wholesome to be true.“That’s why it was kind of hard for me to believe when I first heard the story, right?” said Steven.But for a group of kids of color growing up in Depression-era Pasadena, it was a deliberate act of optimism – a survival tactic disguised as a childhood routine.“It’s a testament to what friendship really meant back then,” said Steven. “Even though you would get in the middle of this kind of hatred, it didn’t matter. You would defend your friends. That’s all you had.”The Pepper Street Gang eventually disbanded. Most members are dead. Mack remained in Pasadena and became a tireless community advocate for youth and civil rights until he died in 2000. Jackie’s legacy, of course, towers over baseball history.But to those who knew the Robinsons – and those whose families lived on the same block – it’s these quieter stories that reveal the fuller picture.“There’s something wrong with the writing of our history if this story is little known,” said Ling.Tall tales or not, these stories carry universal and timeless lessons: kind gestures can ripple across generations.

Alden had been treating animals hurt and abandoned amid Gaza’s destruction. They survived but the equipment and medication the mobile clinic needed to function was destroyed.Still, the team saw it as a setback, not a defeat. Alden has spent the month since the airstrike traversing Gaza to scavenge the tools needed to resume operations.“It was a test of our purpose, our mission and our resilience,” says Alden, team leader for a mobile clinic run by the charity Safe Havens for Donkeys. “It was a miracle that we survived.These donkeys are the last thread connecting people to the basic services they desperately need“And survival wasn’t the end of the story – it was just the beginning of another struggle. The attack took from us all the tools we use to save lives.“We’ve started again, from zero, because the animals are still here. They still need us. And we will never abandon them.”Alden’s team operates a mobile clinic that has treated more than 7,000 donkeys and thousands of other animals since the outbreak of the currentwar in Gazain October 2023. Donkeys are a lifeline for many Palestinians in Gaza.Israel’s bombardment hasdecimated Gaza’s infrastructure, destroying roads and leaving few functioning vehicles, while its blockade of the Palestinian territory makesfuel for transport difficult to find.Donkeys have filled the gap, used to transport goods and people – as they search daily for food, water and fuel, to get to hospitals and to transport them with their belongings each time Israeli forces order thousands to leave an area.View image in fullscreenA donkey pulls a cart with a displaced family’s belongings from Beit Lahiya to Gaza City last month.Photograph: Bashar Taleb/AFP/Getty Images“These donkeys are the last thread connecting people to the basic services they desperately need,” says Alden.“We’ve seen donkeys in Gaza who’ve saved lives – transporting pregnant women to hospitals to give birth, carrying the injured to safety, standing by the side of those who have lost everything, offering warmth when all else is cold. They give without asking for anything in return.”The Safe Haven team have continued to work despite the airstrike on 13 March, and other challenges before that including near-misses, roadblocks and the struggle to find food or shelter.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We quietly stand by their side, just as we have been standing by every other animal we’ve helped.

Then came a wave of weight-loss drugs and the demonisation of ‘wokeness’ …Emine SanerTue 15 Apr 2025 00.00 EDTShareIn 2021, Skye Standley was considered one of modelling’s rising stars. With her beautiful face, curves and distinctive red hair, she was in demand: she appeared in advertising campaigns for Dolce & Gabbana, the Danish label Ganni and Rihanna’s brand Savage X Fenty. Last year, she was appearing in roundups of ones to watch, alongside established “curve” or plus-size models – typically a size 12 and above – such as Ashley Graham and Paloma Elsesser, who were predicted to be “everywhere”. In reality, it was one of her toughest years.“The past two years have been really challenging,” says Standley. “I think there’s been a lot of erasure all around. I’ve noticed a lot less work.” She only worked a couple of times last year, she says, “compared with the two years before, where I was working continuously. I’ve definitely noticed, when it comes to [London] fashion week, there being no castings, and throughout the year, just a lot of regression, even from brands I’ve worked with. I spent all of last year trying to find a way to navigate everything that was changing with the industry.” Just over three weeks ago, Standley left her agency.For all the strides the body positivity movement has made over the past decade, including within the fashion industry, there have been signs that the thin ideal was always going to make a comeback. You can blame the “wellness” culture that idealises thinness, orthe return of 90s fashion, and the “heroin chic” bodies that wore it. Blame the rise of weight-loss injections such as Ozempic, or the way fashion tends to swing back and forth. Or blame the demonisation of “wokeness” and diversity initiatives by conservatives. Or, blame it all, along with the fatphobia that never really went away, even though it pretended to. Models, activists and those of us who had hoped that fashion’s embrace of a range of sizes signified a genuine culture change are left wondering how it could have reversed so quickly. “I think you’re seeing the separation between people that were doing it because there was a movement at the time,” says Standley, “and the people who are truly passionate about it.”View image in fullscreenStandley: ‘I think a lot of the inclusivity movement was performative – and performative attitudes are easily abandoned.’Photograph: Sarah Ellen TreacherWhen fashion did embrace larger bodies, “it kind of felt like the Renaissance,” says the model Tess Holliday, “like we were going into this beautiful period where we were at a new awakening. I don’t want to say it’s plateaued – it hasn’t. It’s really gone downhill so quickly. A shift that has left me and so many of my colleagues just feeling really disheartened.” Holliday, who has modelled for labels such as Chromat and appeared on the cover of Cosmopolitan, has noticed her work dropping off, but says she was moving away from modelling anyway (her book for young people, Take Up Space Y’all, is out later this year). “To see such a drastic slide back, it really does make you feel like the progress didn’t matter, but I know that’s just what society wants me to say and feel, and I refuse to give in to that. But do I have moments where I sit around and feel like perhaps I was one of a handful of people that were used to make it seem like people cared? Yeah, maybe sometimes.”Felicity Hayward, a model and activist, thinks 2023 was a turning point. “Ozempic arrived into our industry, and there was a definite change,” she says. Hayward, who has modelled for Mac and appeared on the cover of i-D magazine, monitors the number of designers using curve models across the fashion weeks in London, Paris, New York and Milan for her reportInside the Curve. At first the drop was slow, but this season, she says, “we’ve started to see a huge decline. New York, which had 70 plus-size models in 2023, had 23 earlier this year. At the September 2024 London fashion week, 80 plus-size models were on the runway, but just 26 this year.” Of these, 17 were used by Sinéad O’Dwyer (without her show, London would have had the fewest). The designer Karoline Vitto, whose models are diverse, didn’t hold a runway show. Milan, says Hayward, never really embraced size inclusivity (just 10 looks were worn by plus-size models at the February shows), and Paris had 22. “I thought, naively maybe, we had come to a place now where women’s bodies in particular had stopped being criticised,” she says, “and we were just accepting everybody for who they are.”She started monitoring inclusion to hold designers accountable. “It’s all well and good us seeing a curve model on a runway and automatically thinking that that brand is suddenly size-inclusive, when actually you need the stats – it could be the next season they don’t use curve at all, which is kind of what happened.” Or, if they do, she says, they are using fewer, or they are “mid-size” – UK size 12 to 16 – rather than plus-size. Many models have lost weight, says Hayward. “The girls who used to be a size 16 or 18 are now size 12. It’s really difficult because, on one hand, I don’t want to speak about women’s bodies, but if the only plus-size representation we have are also losing weight, it does feel like the whole industry is turning their back on us.” The latestsize inclusivity survey by Vogue Businessfound similar data – at 198 fashion shows earlier this year, just 12 designers used plussize models. The report also noted that of the mid-size models used, it tended to be “the same two or three faces”. The celebration of a handful of mid-size models – in 2023, Precious Lee, Jill Kortleve and Paloma Elsesser were declared “the new Supers” on the cover of British Vogue – hasn’t translated into a wider acceptance.View image in fullscreenAshley Graham during a Michael Kors fashion show in New York.Photograph: Gotham/GC ImagesIn 2021, the model and activist Nyome Nicholas-Williams was working a lot (she has worked for brands such as Adidas, H&M and the activewear company Lululemon). “I was never getting booked more in my life. It was amazing,” she says. Although there are still brands Nicholas-Williams works for repeatedly, in the last couple of years, there has been a drop in other work; she has increasingly worked as a hand model, and she’s now also looking for a part-time job. It has affected her financially, and had an impact on her mental health. “I’m tired from all the fighting, just to have clothes that fit, or brands and designers actually wanting to put out clothes that plus people can wear.”Even when brands appeared to embrace size inclusivity, Nicholas-Williams says she was pessimistic that they would stick to it. “I was, like, this is going to be something that’s for a short period, and then we’re going to go back to how it was. I didn’t think it would be this soon, and so overtly.” If larger models are used, she says, they tend to be mid-size, rather than the bigger sizes used in the past. She has observed plus-size models lose weight to get more work. “I think there is a pressure,” she says, though she adds it’s not something she would do. “I would never lose weight for a brand to hire me, because I don’t want to change myself for them, because then you don’t want me authentically as myself.”Standley also feared the move towards inclusivity wouldn’t last. “When you’re actually on the sets and you’re having certain experiences that are not good, you can see through a lot of it,” she says. “Things don’t fit, and things are not always great, and you need to work three times as hard to make it work. You push through because you want to get something good out of it.”And a lot of good did come out of it, she says. “It helped to energise people and get more people a platform and exposure.” For the models themselves, and activists working for inclusivity, it brought a sense of community. For the rest of us, including anyone who has ever struggled with their weight, or felt they didn’t fit the body ideal – and with the average UK dress size a 16, that’s a lot of women – it felt good to see different bodies represented and celebrated. “I think it has inspired some designers and some people that do want to still keep pushing,” says Standley. “Those are the good things that came out of it. But I do feel, especially now, a lot of it was and is performative.” And performative attitudes, she says, are easily abandoned.I get shouted at just as much on the street as I used to. I didn’t see a decrease in animosityBrigitte Read“I also think, from what I’ve observed in the industry, it tends to be a domino effect,” she says. Just as brands copied each other, not wanting to be left out – or worse, called out – by not including plus-size models, now they’re chasing each other the other way. “Now that regression has taken place, it seems like everyone has just followed.” Ultimately, says Standley, the fashion industry always prizes thinness, and possibly always will. “Most of the industry is deeply rooted in a lot of fatphobia and that was maybe put to the side for a proportion of time, but now that things have settled, and people are back to how they really want to be, it’s really just accepted.”Worse, it seems to some working in this area that the backlash has been huge. “One of the things I’ve noticed is the amount of hate and abuse I have received online has skipped back to pre-2016 levels, when that sort of hate towards bigger bodies was kind of the norm,” says Hayward. “I didn’t really expect it.” Last month,the clothing brand Snag told the BBCit was getting more than 100 complaints a day that the models it uses are too fat, and were employing staff just to remove negative and hateful comments on its social media pages. But, Brigitte Read, Snag’s founder, isn’t convinced this is a new thing. “Honestly, I don’t think attitudes ever really changed to be more positive. When you look at the kind of hatred that you see in the comments, and overall on the internet, and myself as a fat person – I get shouted at just as much on the street now as I used to – I didn’t personally see a decrease in that level of animosity.”Emma Matell, known as one of the fashion industry’s most inclusive casting directors, says she worries about the plus-size models whose careers she has helped develop, from those she has scouted to those she regularly casts in shows and advertising campaigns. “It’s really sad to see that they don’t get the bookings they deserve.” Matell often works with O’Dwyer, one of the few designers who actively promotes diverse casting. In the past, O’Dwyer has used friends and family in her shows, but for her show at London fashion week in February, they took a more traditional path. “We really focused on booking models, because there were barely any shows that book curve models,” says Matell. “It felt important to highlight that there are amazing curve models that are not working.”View image in fullscreenHolliday: ‘It felt like the Renaissance, but it’s gone downhill so quickly.’Even during the time more diverse models were being employed, there were frustrations. Matell might want to cast a plus-size model in a magazine shoot, for instance, and so would the stylist and editor, but frequently would find there weren’t the clothes samples from designers to fit them. “Which is why a lot of the time when you see imagery of curve models, they’re not ever fully dressed.” Sometimes this is to make a statement about their body, she acknowledges, “but it’s also just because there simply aren’t enough clothes available for those models”.Even if there hasn’t been a huge revolution towards size inclusivity, Matell thinks some progress has been made. Consumers saw themselves reflected, and she hopes people will demand more of that from brands. “Whether or not the brands are choosing to take steps back, I think that’s going to come back in their face when their consumer is saying: ‘Why am I suddenly no longer part of your brand when you were preaching that two years ago?’ I do think there is a generational shift coming up in who the consumer is and what they’ll demand.”In the meantime, Standley still feels “a responsibility to represent my community” when it comes to her work. “Being over a certain dress size, larger than most plus-size models that are working, and not having a super-conventional or commercial look, I keep trying to push back and fight for change – to change the narrative on what it is to be plus size, existing in the world and also in this industry.”Explore more on these topicsModelsBody imageBeautyFashion weeksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Jasper Jolly reportsOn Saturday, when MPs were supposed to be on their Easter holidays, a rare emergency sitting was called. Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, told the House of Commons that they were meeting “in exceptional circumstances to take exceptional action in what are exceptional times”.MPs passed a bill to save the Scunthorpe steelworks, a vital part of the UK’s critical infrastructure and the last remaining maker of mass-produced virgin steel. The emergency legislation allowed the government to instruct the Chinese owners of theBritish Steelplant, Jingye, to keep Scunthorpe open or face criminal penalties.Jasper Jollyis a financial reporter for the Guardian. He tellsHelen Piddthat the steelworks are central to life in Scunthorpe and that their loss would be devastating for the town. He explains that the plant has been loss-making for several years and that it is largely the glut of cheap Chinese steel in the global market that has led its owners to consider its closure.The pair discuss why the government has taken control of Scunthorpe in a way that it did not with the Port Talbot steelworks, the race to keep the blast furnaces hot, and the way that this crisis has led many to question the wisdom of selling critical parts of the UK’s infrastructure to foreign and private companies.Support the Guardian today:theguardian.com/todayinfocuspodPhotograph: Monty Rakusen/Getty Images/Image SourceExplore more on these topicsSteel industryToday in FocusBritish Steel"

TheForeign Office said it was saddened that agreement on a political way forward had not been reached, but insisted progress had been made.Sudan in ‘world’s largest humanitarian crisis’ after two years of civil warRead moreIn the absence of a final communique, the UK foreign secretary,David Lammy, and his counterparts from France, Germany, the African Union and the EU issued a joint co-chairs’ statement pledging to support “efforts to find a peaceful solution and reject all activities, including external interference, that heighten tensions or that prolong or enable fighting”.The statement also called for a solution that did not lead to Sudan’s partition.Lammy had opened the conference with high hopes. “Many have given up on Sudan. That is wrong,” he said. “It’s morally wrong when we see so many civilians beheaded, infants as young as one subjected to sexual violence, more people facing famine than anywhere else in the world.“We simply cannot look away. And as I speak, civilians and aid workers in El Fasher and Zamzam IDP camp are facing unimaginable violence.“The biggest obstacle is not a lack of funding or texts at the United Nations, it’s lack of political will. Very simply, we have got to persuade the warring parties to protect civilians, to let aid in and across the country, and to put peace first.”His effort to persuade the Arab states to agree a set of diplomatic principles for a future contact group did not, however, bear fruit.Officials had said the conference did not constitute an attempt at mediation or aid-pledging, but instead intended to build greater political coherence about Sudan’s future among the many countries that have claimed a stake in the country.Sudan’s outsider: how a general fell out with the army and plunged the country into warRead moreIn a measure of the expanding, intractable and externally fuelled nature of the war, Lammy chose not to invite any of the principal Sudanese actors or members of civilian society. The conference’s objectives are set modestly at seeking agreement on an African Union-led international contact group, and renewed commitments to end restrictions on aid.The war, which erupted in April 2023, stemmed from a power struggle between Dagalo’s Rapid Support Forces and the army, led by Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan.3:43Why violence has broken out in Sudan – video explainerThe aim of establishing a contact group had been to persuade Middle Eastern states to focus on diplomacy rather than strengthening the warring factions. But from the start officials struggled to find neutral wording that Egypt and the United Arab Emirates could accept on Sudan’s future.Sudan and others have long accused the UAE of arming the RSF – which it strenuously denies – while Egypt has maintained close ties with the Sudanese army.Sudan’s government criticised the conference organisers for excluding it from the meeting while inviting the UAE.The UAE minister for political affairs, Lana Nusseibeh, who attended the conference, said both sides were committing atrocities and condemned the recent RSF attacks on displacement camps. She called for an unconditional ceasefire, the end to unconscionable obstruction of humanitarian aid, and a transition to an independent civilian-led government.The army and the RSF have both been accused of committing atrocities in the course of the war, which has killed tens of thousands of people, displaced 13 million, and pushed large parts of the country into famine.3:22Khartoum before and after: footage shows destruction wreaked by war in Sudan – videoTwo refugee camps in Darfur, the site of a genocide in the 2000s, were captured in the past few days by the RSF as it seeks to take El Fasher, the only major population centre in Darfur not under its control.Lammy also announced an extra £120m in humanitarian aid from the depleted UK Foreign Office aid budget, enough to help deliver food to 650,000 people. The German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, released a further €125m (£105m) for Sudan and neighbouring states.At a separate event on Tuesday morning, aid and human rights groups called on the international community to punish the vast array of countries accused of either directly or indirectly sending arms to the warring parties in breach of a UN arms embargo.“The international community will have utterly failed if we have a conference today including those actively involved in the conflict and nothing comes from it again,” said Yasmine Ahmed, the UK director of Human Rights Watch. “We need a coalition of states with the UK and the co-hosts at the front ready to say we are galvanising the necessary political momentum to protect civilians on the ground.“It is necessary that it is made clear that this cannot continue. The international community cannot sleepwalk into another genocide. They have international obligations to protect and respect international law.”However, neither side seems interested in discussing peace, and some fear the country is heading for a form of partition based around the current areas of control.The meeting comes against the backdrop of US cuts to its aid programme.Kate Phillips-Barrasso, a vice-president of global policy at the aid group Mercy Corps, said the nature of the US cuts meant it was hard to know how badly Sudan had been affected, but in her agency’s case, a lifeline for 220,000 people had been cut.Explore more on these topicsSudanAfricaMiddle East and north AfricaForeign policyUnited Arab EmiratesDavid LammynewsShareReuse this content"

France later saidAlgeria had expelled 12of its diplomatic staff.France’s relations with its former colony have long been complicated, but took a turn for the worse last year when Macron supported Morocco’s position over that of Algeria over the disputed Western Sahara region.Last week the French foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, had said that ties between the two countries were returning to normal.The activist and influencer Amir Boukhors is a critic of the Algerian president, Abdelmadjid Tebboune, and has more than 1 million subscribers on TikTok, where he posts as Amir DZ.He has lived in France since 2016 and was granted political asylum in 2023. Algeria has issued nine international arrest warrants against him on accusations of fraud and terrorism, but France refuses to extradite him.In April 2024, Boukhors was snatched outside his home in Val-de-Marne, south of Paris, telling France 2 television in a later interview that he was handcuffed and bundled into a car by four men wearing police armbands. He claimed he was drugged and held in a “container” for more than 24 hours before being released at 3am. “I fell into a trap,” he said.Three men were arrested and put under investigation on Friday for the “kidnap, holding and arbitrary detention” of Boukhors. France’s national anti-terrorist prosecutor confirmed that one of the men arrested worked for the Algerian consulate at Créteil, south-east of Paris.Algeria has denied the official’s involvement in the kidnapping.In a separate source of tension between the countries, Macron has also called on Algeria to release Boualem Sansal, a 75-year-old writersentenced to five years in prisonfor “undermining the integrity” of the country.Agence France-Presse and Reuters contributed to this report.Explore more on these topicsFranceAlgeriaEuropeAfricaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

However, diplomatic efforts have often been sidelined by other crises, including the wars in Ukraine and Gaza.Two years to the day sincefighting erupted in Khartoumbetween the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, hundreds of people were feared to have died inRSF attacks on refugee campsin the western Darfur region in the latest apparent atrocity of a war marked by its brutality and wide-scale humanitarian impact.Sudan’s outsider: how a general fell out with the army and plunged the country into warRead moreThe consequences for Sudan’s 51 million people have been devastating. Tens of thousands are reportedly dead. Hundreds of thousandsface famine. Almost 13 million people have been displaced, 4 million of those to neighbouring countries.“Sudan is now worse off than ever before,” said Elise Nalbandian, Oxfam’s regional advocacy manager. “The largest humanitarian crisis, largest displacement crisis, largest hunger crisis … It’s breaking all sorts of wrong records.”There were “massive-scale” violations of international humanitarian law in the conflict, said Daniel O’Malley, the head of the International Committee of the Red Cross delegation in Sudan. “All of the civilian population, irrespective of where they are in the country, have basically been trapped between one, two or more parties. And they have been bearing the brunt of everything. The sheer numbers are just mind-boggling.”map of Sudan indicating areas of occupation by different forcesLast month, Sudan’s military recaptured thehighly symbolic presidential palacein Khartoum and it has retaken most of the capital. But in much of the country, the conflict rages on. Sources cited by the UN reported that more than 400 people had been killed in recent attacks by the RSF in Darfur, where the group is trying to seize El Fasher, the last state capital in the region not under its control.Since late last week, the RSF has launched ground and aerial assaults on El Fasher itself and the nearby Zamzam and Abu Shouk displacement camps. A UN spokesperson told Agence France-Presse that the UN’s rights office had verified 148 killings and received reports from “credible sources” that the total number of dead exceeded 400.Reuters reported that data from the UN’s International Organization forMigrationsuggested that up to 400,000 people had been displaced from the Zamzam camp alone since the weekend.In a statement the UN rights chief, Volker Türk, said the “large-scale attacks … made starkly clear the cost of inaction by the international community, despite my repeated warnings of heightened risk for civilians in the area”.He added: “The attacks have exacerbated an already dire protection and humanitarian crisis in a city that has endured a devastating RSF siege since May last year.”View image in fullscreenA video shared by the group North Darfur Observatory for Human Rights is said to show people fleeing the Zamzam camp with their belongings strapped to camels and donkeys.Photograph: X | @NorthDarfu24El Fasher is one of several areas of Darfur where a famine, affecting about 637,000 people, has been declared. Almost half the 50-million population of Sudan – 24.6 million people – do not have enough food.Leni Kinzli, the World Food Programme’s head of communications for Sudan, said the other conflicts, as well as a lack of access for journalists, and Sudan’s relative international isolation since the days of the regime of the ousted dictator Omar al-Bashir all meant Sudan was not getting the attention it needed.“We don’t see the level of international attention on Sudan as we do for other crises,” she said. “There should not be a competition between crises. But unfortunately we’re seeing with everything going on in the world, other conflicts, other humanitarian crises and other things making headlines, that unfortunately Sudan is – I wouldn’t even call it forgotten – it’s ignored.”map depicting movement of refugees and areas where they are concentratedThe origins of the war can be traced to late 2018, when popular protests broke out against the Sudanese dictator Bashir. Sudan’s army leader, Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, allied with the RSF chief,Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, a former warlord known as Hemedti, to oust Bashir in a coup in April 2019.Atrocities mount daily.

But it has since taken the position that it is powerless to bring him back beyond removing domestic obstacles, and that courts lack the constitutional power to dictate the president to do more.The lead lawyer for the administration, Drew Ensign, also said in legal filings before the hearing that even if Ábrego García were returned to the US, the justice department would deport him to a different country or move to terminate the order blocking his removal to El Salvador.But the judge rejected the administration’s narrow reading of “facilitate”, noting the plain meaning of the word meant officials needed to secure Ábrego García’s release – and thatUS immigrationand customs enforcement had previously taken a number of positions on its meaning.“Your characterization is not bound in fact,” Xinis said. “I need facts.”The administration argued it had sought to comply with the supreme court’s order when Trump addressed the case and Bukele questioned whether he was supposed to smuggle Ábrego García across the border – which Ensign argued showed the matter had been raised at the “highest levels”.The judge appeared unimpressed by the argument. “It’s not a direct response,” Xinis said. “Nor is the quip about smuggling someone into the US. If you were removing domestic barriers, there would be no smuggling, right? Two misguided ships passing in the night.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I’m usually pretty good about this in my courtroom, but not this time.”After the hearing, Ábrego García’s lawyer Rina Gandhi called the hearing a win but added they were not yet done. “We have not brought Kilmar home,” she told reporters, “but we will be able to question those involved and get information and evidence as required.”She also accused the administration of acting in bad faith. “This case is about the government unlawfully – and admitting to unlawfully – removing a gentleman from this country, from his home, his family, his children, and taking no actions to fix them as ordered by the supreme court,” Gandhi said.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationTrump administrationEl SalvadorUS politicsDonald TrumpAmericasUS supreme courtnewsShareReuse this content"

It has detained andbegun deportation proceedingsagainst some foreign students who took part in pro-Palestinian demonstrations, while visas for hundreds of other students have been canceled – actions that have raised concerns about speech and academic freedoms in the US. At the same time, Canada has capped the number of international students allowed to enter the country for the second year in a row, meaning there may be fewer spots for US and other international students.Georgetown alumni and students call for release of scholar detained by IceRead moreCanada’s immigration ministry said it expects learning institutions to only accept the number of students they can support, including providing housing options. Provinces and territories are responsible for distributing spaces under the cap, the ministry said.The University ofToronto, considered an alternative to US Ivy League schools, said it was seeing a “meaningful increase” in applications from those living or studying in the US over previous years. University of Waterloo, which is known for its technical graduate programs and churns out top-notch engineering talent, said some faculties including engineering have seen increased interest and applications from students in the US.“We have seen an increase in US visitors to the UW visitors centre on campus, and web traffic that originates in the US has increased by 15% since September 2024,” a University of Waterloo spokesperson said.It did not specify whether these students were foreign students studying in the US or US citizens.Averill said UBC has seen only a modest 2% increase in undergraduate applications for this year’s programs, which closed around the time of Trump’s inauguration. However, interest appears to be growing, with campus tour requests from US students up by 20%.“We were concerned about the United States universities, our sister institutions in the US, who areunder enormous pressureright now,” said Averill, referring in particular to the Trump administration’s efforts to withhold funds from universities that continue with diversity and equity initiatives or study climate science.According to UBC’s annual report, the United States ranks as one of the top three countries for international student enrollment. Currently, about 1,500 US students are enrolled in both graduate and undergraduate programs at the university’s two campuses.Explore more on these topicsCanadaTrump administrationUniversitiesAmericasHigher educationUS politicsUS campus protestsnewsShareReuse this content"

He joins Alejandro Toledo,sentenced in 2024 to 20 years for Odebrecht-related crimes, and Alberto Fujimori, whoreceived multiple convictions for corruption and human rights abuses.The trial began in 2022, and alongside the 62-year-old former military officer and his 48-year-old wife, the court convicted eight others. Both Humala and Heredia were held in pre-trial detention from 2017 to 2018 at the prosecutor’s request to prevent their flight.Odebrecht’s 2016 admission ofwidespread bribery across Latin Americapreceded the initial investigations against Humala, which started in 2015, a year before the company’s revelations.Most of the presidents who have governed Peru since 2001 have faced legal problems due to their connections with Odebrecht. Toledo is currently imprisoned, while the former president Pedro Pablo Kuczynski is under house arrest. Alan García, who served two non-consecutive terms,died by suicide in 2019 as authorities moved to arrest him in connection with Odebrecht bribes.In addition to former presidents, prominent figures such as the former presidential candidate Keiko Fujimori and numerous ex-governors are also under investigation.Explore more on these topicsPeruAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

We’re not going to let them go anywhere, and if we have to build more prisons in our country, we will do it.”Trump has previously said he “loved” the idea of deporting US citizens to El Salvador. Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, has said Trump “simply floated” the idea.During a White House briefing on Tuesday, Leavitt was asked whether it was legal to deport US citizens to Central American prisons. “It’s a legal question that the president is looking into,” she said, adding that Trump was only considering the action for those Americans “who are the most violent, egregious repeat offenders of crime”.Lawyers and other experts say the idea is clearly illegal.“There is no provision under US law that would allow the government to kick citizens out of the country,” the University of Notre Dame professor Erin Corcoran, an immigration law expert,told Reuters.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Gutiérrez family says it has been left without information or answers.The teen was detained alongside 237 other Venezuelans on 24 February by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). His father, Wilmer Gutiérrez, told Documented: “I feel like my son was kidnapped.“I’ve spent countless hours searching for him, going from one precinct to another, speaking with numerous people who kept referring me elsewhere. Yet, after all this, no one has given me any information or provided a single document about his case.”The elder Gutiérrez reportedly said he overheard Ice agents saying that his son had not been the person they had come to get.“The officers grabbed him and two other boys right at the entrance to our building. One said: ‘No, he’s not the one,’ like they were looking for someone else. But the other said: ‘Take him anyway,’” he recalled.Gutiérrez has no criminal record either in Venezuela or the US, his family said. He also did not have any tattoos, which is a feature that US law enforcement often use to link people to the Tren de Aragua gang – a transnational criminal organization from Venezuela – and to justify their expulsions from the country.Despite this, Gutiérrez was arrested and later deported toEl Salvador, to which he has no ties.Wilmer Gutiérrez says he discovered through a news report that his son had been deported to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. He watched videos on social media that showed detainees facing harsh conditions, such as having their heads shaved by authorities and being marched to their prison cells.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This could include Mandarin language programmes, and training for civil servants and parliamentarians about the Chinese system. The Foreign Office declined to comment.Reynolds’s trip will raise eyebrows after he said on Sunday that the UK had “got it wrong in the past” and Conservative governments had been “far too naive” about allowing Chinese investment in sensitive industries such as steel.The government has also come under pressure to take a tougher stance towards Beijing over human rights and security concerns.In an article for the Guardian on TuesdayWera Hobhouse, a Liberal Democrat MP who was refused entry to Hong Kong to visit her grandchild last week, said that “until we get a clear answer for why I was deported, no government minister should be visiting China on official business”.Hobhouse said she believed she was denied entry “because of my role as a British parliamentarian, and one who haslevelled criticism at Beijingfor its human rights abuses”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Keir Starmer is also expected to visit China later this year.Asked in October whether the UK would revive the Jetco, Reynolds said he was “certainly open to having a conversation” about it.

Beijing was also said to be considering ways to support airlines that lease Boeing jets and are facing higher costs.About 10 Boeing 737 Max jets are being prepared to join Chinese airlines, and if delivery paperwork and payment on some of them were completed before Chinese ”reciprocal” tariffs came into effect, the planes may be allowed to enter the country, sources told Bloomberg.The restriction marks a serious blow for Boeing and other manufacturers trying to navigate the escalating trade war between the world’s two biggest economies.The group chief executive of the budget airline Ryanair, Michael O’Leary, has said his company could delay taking deliveries of Boeing aircraft if they become more expensive. He told the Financial Times that Ryanair was due to receive a further 25 aircraft from Boeing from August but would not need the planes until around March or April 2026. “We might delay them and hope that common sense will prevail,” O’Leary said.Shares in Boeing have been buffeted by worries about the impact of trade tariffs, as well as complaints from some shareholders that the company has underinvested in its engineering.The company has lost 7% of its market value since the start of the year, and in March its chief financial officer, Brian West, said tariffs could hit availability of parts from its suppliers.The rival European plane manufacturer Airbus said on Tuesday that it was watching the evolving situation on trade tariffs. Its chief executive, Guillaume Faury, told shareholders the company was having problems receiving components from the American supplier Spirit AeroSystems, which was weighing on the production of its A350 and A220 jetliners.The chaotic introduction of Donald Trump’s tariffs has triggered volatility in the stock market since 2 April, although there has been a tentative recovery this week after the US president announced he was temporarily suspending planned tariffs on imports of smartphones and laptops.The S&P 500, the American blue-chip index of stocks, ticked up 0.7% in early trading on Tuesday, but was still down about 7% so far this year.There remains a great deal of uncertainty around possible tariffs on computer chips and pharmaceutical imports, with the Trump administration initiating an investigation into the impact of trade in these areas on American national security. Meanwhile, the chip designer Nvidia has announced it will build up to$500bn (£378bn) worth of artificial intelligence infrastructure in the USover the next four years.In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei index rose by 0.8% on Tuesday and South Korea’s Kospi by 0.9%, withstrong gains for carmakers such as Honda, Suzuki and Hyundai, after Trump signalled there would be help for the industry.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Analysts at the advisory firm Telemetry predicted the move could result in 1.8m fewer car sales in the US and Canada this year.Shares also rose in Europe, with London’s benchmark FTSE 100 index and the more domestic-focused FTSE 250 rising by 0.8% and 1% respectively after optimistic comments from the US vice-president, JD Vance, about apossible trade deal with the UK. In an interview on Tuesday with the website Unherd, Vance said he believed both sides could come to a mutually beneficial agreement.“We’re certainly working very hard with Keir Starmer’s government” on a trade deal, he said.“There’s a real cultural affinity. And, of course, fundamentally, America is an Anglo country. I think there’s a good chance that, yes, we’ll come to a great agreement that’s in the best interest of both countries.”Boeing was approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsBoeingAirline industryTrump tariffsChinaAsia PacificAerospace industryDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Meeting like, trying to figure out: ‘How do we screw the United States of America?’”Vietnam, a major industrial and assembly hub, is among countries in south-east Asia that are reeling from some of themost punitiveof Trump’s so-called “Liberation Day” tariffs, hit with a rate of 46%. The US is Vietnam’s main export market, for which it is a crucial source of everything from footwear and apparel to electronics.View image in fullscreenXi Jinping in a meeting with Vietnam’s national assembly chair, Tran Thanh Man, and other officials in Hanoi on Monday.Photograph: Athit Perawongmetha/ReutersIn the first three months of this year, its exports to Washington amounted to $31.4bn, while Hanoi imported goods worth about $30bn from Beijing.Xi’s visit to Vietnam, Cambodia and Malaysia this week comes as Beijingfaces tariffs of 145%, and as other countries seek to negotiate reductions in their tariffs during a 90-day reprieve.Xi’s trip to Hanoi offered anopportunity to consolidate relationswith a neighbour that has received billions of dollars of Chinese investments in recent years, as China-based manufacturers moved south to avoid tariffs imposed by the first Trump administration.InMalaysiaon Tuesday, the Chinese leader said he was looking forward to “further deepening the traditional friendship” between the two countries.“China will work with Malaysia … to combat the undercurrents of geopolitical and camp-based confrontation, as well as the countercurrents of unilateralism and protectionism,” Xi wrote in an article for Malaysia’s The Star newspaper.Xi had planned to travel to the region before Trump’s tariff announcement, but the visit was fortuitously timed, with the Chinese leader positing China as a stable trading partner, in contrast to the chaotic policy backflips coming out of Washington.In an article in Nhân Dân, the newspaper of Vietnam’s Communist party, Xi wrote that there were “no winners in trade wars and tariff wars” and that protectionism “leads nowhere”.In a meeting with Vietnam’s prime minister, Pham Minh Chính, Xi said the two countries should oppose unilateral bullying.Xi Jinping seeks to strengthen economic ties during tour of south-east AsiaRead moreVietnam and many other south-east Asian countries are trying to maintain a delicate balancing act between the US and China amid fears the region could be used as a potential dumping zone for Chinese exports barred from the US.Phan Xuan Dung, a research officer in the Vietnam studies programme at ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, said: “If past patterns hold, it would be reasonable to expect that Vietnam might seek to balance this significant Chinese engagement with comparable diplomatic outreach to the United States or other partners in the coming months.”Escalating tensions between the US and China have fuelled concerns about a decoupling of the world’s two largest economies, a fear the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, sought to dispel on Monday.“There’s a big deal to be done at some point,” Bessent said when asked by Bloomberg TV. There did not “have to be” decoupling, he said, “but there could be.”One of China’s lead officials overseeing Hong Kong hit out at the US on Tuesday over its trade war. Xia Baolong said in a televised speech that the dispute was “extremely shameless” and aimed to “take away Hong Kong’s life”. Hong Kong is subject to the same tariffs imposed on mainland China but has not proposed any of its own in retaliation.Xia said China was not “afraid of trouble”. “Let those peasants in the United States wail in front of the 5,000 years of Chinese civilisation,” he said, possibly in reference toJD Vance’s recent criticism.China-US tensions appear to have shifted some trade war battles to other fronts. Xi has sought further US-excluded cooperation with the EU, and in Latin America the US is pushing governments to reduce their financial ties with China.Bessent said he had met the Argentinian president, Javier Milei, on Monday, telling Bloomberg the Trump administration was focused on helping Latin American countries avert what he called “rapacious” agreements made with China to give up mining rights in return for aid.Beijing’s embassy in Argentina accused Bessent of “maliciously slandering and smearing” China and told the US to refrain from “obstructing and deliberately sabotaging” developing countries.The White House had appeared to dial down the pressure recently,listing tariff exemptionsfor smartphones, laptops, semiconductors and other electronic products for which China is a major source.But Trump and some of his top aides said on Sunday the exemptions had been misconstrued and would only be temporary. “Nobody is getting ‘off the hook’ … especially not China which, by far, treats us the worst!” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform.Additional reporting by Rebecca RatcliffeExplore more on these topicsChinaXi JinpingDonald TrumpUS foreign policyTrump tariffsVietnamMalaysianewsShareReuse this content"

How and where to watch Anthony Albanese v Peter Dutton on their 2025 Australia election policiesRead moreThe IEEFA report looked at the 13 coal plants to have closed since 2000 and found in the 10 years before they were turned off, they were only available on average 66% of the time due to unplanned outages and the need for increased maintenance.When IEEFA adjusted the Coalition’s numbers between 2034 and 2043 to account for what it said was a more realistic estimate of the coal fleet’s capabilities, it found a shortfall of 9,300 gigawatt-hours a year – the equivalent of the power consumed by 2 million households.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterJohanna Bowyer, lead analyst on Australian electricity at IEEFA, said failing to account for the poor performance of an ageing coal fleet would risk unexpected coal outages “and a system that hasn’t been built to account for them”.Tristan Edis, a co-author of the report and analyst at Green Energy Markets, said the average age of a coal plant when it retired was 42 years.“Over the 2030s, the existing coal-fired power stations will be close to, or have exceeded, the age at which past coal plants typically retired.“We should be planning for the likelihood that they will suffer a similar deterioration in their availability.”Areport commissioned by the Climate Council last yearlooked at data from 2014 to 2024 and found coal plants less than 40 years old were available for 81% of the time, dropping to 65% in their later years.Edis said if a future government was forced to rely on more gas generation to fill the gaps, this would burn between 49 and 93 petajoules of gas annually from 2034 to 2043.Edis said: “This is a large amount of additional gas considering the average amount of gas used for electricity generation over the past five years was 122PJ per year.“This additional gas requirement would have serious consequences for the price and availability of gas for other consumers.”Danger of nuclear delaysThe modelling backed by the Coalition assumed the first nuclear reactor would be producing power by 2036, with further plants coming online from 2039 onwards.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Filling that gap with new generation becomes really tricky and extending those coal plants even further just exacerbates the risk [of them becoming less reliable].”‘Not a hope in hell’ nuclear power can replace Australian coal-fired power by 2040, inquiry hearsRead moreGuardian Australia approached Frontier Economics for comment.A statement from the Coalition said Labor’s renewables-based approach was “forcing the premature closure of coal generation – well before their notified closure dates”.“Proper maintenance can ensure coal plants are not closed prematurely. The Coalition’s approach, based on comprehensive and evidence-backed modelling, ensures that coal continues to play a crucial role in Australia’s energy mix, both now and in the future.”The Frontier modelling was a “realistic and comprehensive view”, the statement said, of the maintenance costs for coal plants “while recognising the ongoing importance of coal in maintaining grid stability during the energy transition”.“Labor talks about phasing out coal, but behind closed doors they are cutting deals with the states to keeping them online.”Explore more on these topicsCoalitionEnergyNuclear powerPeter DuttonAustralian politicsAustralian election 2025newsShareReuse this content"

That’s the problem,” Boyce told the meeting in December 2023.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter“I’ve said this many times to the colleagues, we have to probably adopt a ‘do nothing’ strategy, obviously fight the good fight.“The ‘do nothing’ strategy is a tough love strategy where people will not understand what’s happening until the lights go out.“When the lifts in the building stop working and the supermarket shelves are empty because the refrigerators aren’t working, that’s when all of a sudden people start to realise.”Later, Boyce was asked a question about potential power outages and he responded by saying: “It’s a big political opportunity for that to happen.”Boyce predicted power outages would be “along similar lines” to the 1985 South East Queensland Electricity Generating Board strikes during the Joh Bjelke-Petersen government, which caused rolling power outages for four weeks.“It’s enormously frustrating and there’s no simple fixes to any of these problems,” Boyce said.“To turn the renewable energy ship around, where it sits at the moment will take a change of government.”The Nationals MP was afounding member of the “Saltbush Club”, formed to promote climate science denial, and was a signatory to aninternational statement claiming “there is no climate emergency”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Most of the 32 seats are held by Labor and have significant Muslim populations.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterMuslim Votes Matter has also endorsed the Greens in the Queensland seat of Moreton, the South Australian seat of Sturt, and independents in the western-Sydney seats of Blaxland and Watson,held by Labor ministers Jason Clare and Tony Burke.Guardian Australia has also confirmed the political party launched by the former Labor senator Fatima Payman, who has a strong personal brand in suburbs with high Muslim populations, Australia’s Voice, will also encourage voters to preference the Greens above her former party and the Liberals on Senate ballot papers.View image in fullscreenFormer Labor senator Fatima Payman.Photograph: Mike Bowers/The GuardianGhaith Krayem, the national spokesperson for Muslim Votes Matter, said the group’s how-to-vote cards were being finalised after discussion with endorsed candidates. He said they would be similar to, but perhaps not exactly the same as those handed out by endorsed candidates.“We as a rule, will put parties like One Nation or The Trumpet of Patriots at the bottom of our how to vote card,” Krayem said. “If a candidate moves them up, we will not do that.”In a letter to Muslim Votes Matter last month, the Greens leader, Adam Bandt, sought to address the group’s concerns about religious freedom, accepting a request to attend further consultation meetings to ensure “that all rights are acknowledged and taken into account”.“Schools could continue to require that a teacher hired by the school teaches the school’s values and doctrines. A staff member could not be discriminated against on the basis of their sexuality or gender identity, just as it would be unlawful under Australian law to discriminate against someone based on protected attributes in other workplaces.”Muslim Votes Matter said it did not agree with the Greens’ position, but was satisfied with their engagement.“We know that on that particular issue, we were never going to be 100% aligned,” Krayem said. “We put forward a pathway of consultation, not just with us, but with other interested minority groups on this issue.”Labor declined to engage with Muslim Votes Matter and accused the group of being a “self-appointed organisation that seeks to support Peter Dutton” in a manner that was “contrary to the interests of Australian Muslim communities”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The group has previously suggested Labor wants “a quiet, loyal Muslim voter”.Before the 2022 election, Labor committed to introducing laws that would protect all students from discrimination on any grounds, and to protect teachers from discrimination while maintaining the right of schools to preference people of their faith while hiring.In August, Anthony Albanese said his government was unwilling to act on these issues in the absence of bipartisan support, citing concerns about “the need for greater social cohesion”.“And the last thing that Australia needs is any divisive debate relating to religion and people’s faith … I don’t intend to engage in a partisan debate when it comes to religious discrimination,” Albanese said.Equality Australia’s chief executive, Anna Brown, accused Labor of breaking an election commitment by “failing to pursue the available pathway through parliament for a government bill that would have finally protected LGBTQ+ students and staff in religious schools”.“More children will now be refused enrolment or miss out on school leadership roles and more teachers will continue to lose their jobs or be denied promotions because of the gaps in our laws that allow religious schools to play by their own rules,” Brown said.A Labor spokesperson said if re-elected the party would continue to consult on religious freedom but only introduce legislation once bipartisan support was clear.Explore more on these topicsAustralian election 2025Australian politicsIslamReligionAustralian GreensnewsShareReuse this content"

But it’s never had a real impact on how people vote. It might reinforce what you already thought, but [it] rarely switches votes.”Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterRyan Liddell, who served as chief of staff to the former Labor leader Bill Shorten, said debates were taken “incredibly seriously” because they could shape the agenda for the next phase of the campaign.Liddell saidJoe Biden’s horror showin the first US presidential debate with Donald Trump in 2024 – which hastened his exit from the race – had “stiffed a few spines” in political circles about the risks of “nonchalant debate prep”.“There is a huge risk of an error being amplified, which is why both sides take them so seriously,” he said.3:14Labor and Liberal duelling housing policies, and a diss track – TLDR: Election 2025 – videoSean Kelly, a former adviser to Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard, said as the notional frontrunner in the campaign, Albanese’s goal would be “not stuffing up”.“I don’t think these debates are quite the events they used to be,” he told ABC’s Afternoon Briefing.“But I do think making mistakes while the entire press gallery is watching on and ready to turn them into news stories is a huge potential problem.”The debates are distinct from everyday campaign press conferences and television and radio interviews, requiring a specific type of preparation from a leader and their inner circle.Albanese has been known to use mock debates as part of his preparation, with a rotating cast of senior Labor colleagues role-playing his Liberal opponent.Debate day typically involves a morning press conference, allowing the leaders to bunker down in the afternoon ahead of the primetime event.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But television amplifies aggression massively and it looked ridiculous,” Liddell said.“To Bill’s credit he used humour and ridicule as a way of defusing it and Morrison ends up looking like a goose. It looked weird, which fed into people’s perceptions that Morrison was a bit of a weird unit.”Shorten won the debate.A fortnight later, Morrison pulled off his “miracle” election win.Explore more on these topicsAustralian election 2025Australian politicsAnthony AlbanesePeter DuttonAustralian mediaanalysisShareReuse this content"

InEurope, which accounts for nearly half of worldwide sales, consumption fell 2.8% last year. In France, one of the key global producers, 3.6% less wine was consumed last year. Spain and Portugal were among the rare markets where consumption increased.The OIV said production had been hit by environmental extremes such as above-average rainfall in some regions and droughts in others.Italy was the world’s top producer with 44m hectolitres, while France’s output fell 23% to 36.1m hectolitres, its lowest level since 1957.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFeastFree weekly newsletterRecipes from all our star cooks, seasonal eating ideas and restaurant reviews.

All four had maintained their innocence, arguing they were being prosecuted for doing their jobs as journalists.The closed-door trial was part of a crackdown on dissent that has reached an unprecedented scale since Moscowsent troops into Ukrainein February 2022.The authorities have targeted opposition figures, independent journalists, rights activists and ordinary Russians critical of the Kremlin with prosecution, jailing hundreds and prompting thousands to flee the country.Favorskaya and Kriger worked with Sota Vision, an independent Russian news outlet that covers protests and political trials. Gabov is a freelance producer who has worked for multiple organisations, including Reuters. Karelin, a freelance video journalist, has done work for western media outlets including the Associated Press.The four journalists were accused of working with Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation, which wasdesignated as extremist and outlawed in 2021in a move widely seen as politically motivated.Navalny was Vladimir Putin’s fiercest and most prominent critic and relentlessly campaigned against official corruption in Russia. Navalnydied in February 2024in an Arctic penal colony while serving a 19-year sentence for several charges, including running an extremist group, which he had rejected as politically driven.Favorskaya said at an earlier court appearance open to the public that she was being prosecuted for a story she wrote on abuse Navalny had faced behind bars. Speaking to reporters from the defendants’ cage before the verdict, she also said she was punished for helping to organise Navalny’s funeral.Gabov, in a closing statement prepared for court that was published by the independent Novaya Gazeta newspaper, said the accusations against him were groundless and the prosecution had failed to prove them.Russia gives Navalny lawyers multi-year sentences for relaying his messagesRead more“I understand perfectly well … what kind of country I live in. Throughout history, Russia has never been different, there is nothing new in the current situation,” Gabov said in the statement. “Independent journalism is equated to extremism.”Supporters who gathered in the court building chanted and applauded as the four journalists were led out of the courtroom after the verdict.The journalists’ lawyers said they would appeal against the verdict, which Kriger’s lawyer, Yelena Sheremetyeva, described as illegal and unfair.“The profession of a journalist in itself is not extremism,” said Irina Biryukova. “And based on the case materials that are available, I will say that in our opinion, there is no evidence that they committed any crimes, or even minor offences.”She said the four were “holding up” and were “happy that so many people came”.The Russian human rights group Memorial designated all four as political prisoners, among more than 900 others held in the country.Explore more on these topicsRussiaPress freedomAlexei NavalnyNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesEuropeVladimir PutinnewsShareReuse this content"

A wide Nordic river, melting snow still lining its banks,meanders peacefully through a pristine forestof spruce and pine. But this spring, as every spring for the past six years, a lot of people will be glued to it.WhenDen stora älgvandringen– variously translated as The Great Moose Migration or The Great Elk Trek – first aired on the public broadcaster SVT’s on-demand platform in 2019, nearly a million people tuned in. Last year, it was 9 million.This year, who knows? Given the state of the world, a three-week-long, round-the-clock live stream of a few hundred moose gingerly crossing the Ångerman River in northernSwedento reach their summer pastures could be just what viewers need.The show’s latest edition launched a full week early on Tuesday because of warmer than usual spring weather. “There are a lot of moose about,” the producer, Stefan Edlund,told SVT. “They’re waiting for us. We’ve had to adjust. But it should be OK.”The programme’s 15-strong crew, working out of a control room in Umeå, 400 miles (600km) north of Stockholm, had already laid most of their 20,000 meters of cables and positioned their 30-plus remote video and night vision cameras, Edlund said.View image in fullscreenThe crew control more than 30 remote video and night vision cameras from a control room in Umeå.Photograph: SVT/APWhich is just as well, because the show’s fans are more than ready.Ulla Malmgren, 62, said she had stocked up on coffee and pre-cooked meals for the duration so she did not miss a moment. “Sleep? Forget it. I don’t sleep,” she said.Malmgren, who is in a Facebook group of 76,000-plus viewers, told the Associated Press she loved the thought that there were “about a million people” watching “all saying about the same thing: ‘Go on! Yes, you can do it!’”Another fan, William Garp Liljefors, 20, said he had been known to be late for class while the show was on. “I feel relaxed, but at the same time I’m like, ‘Oh, there’s a moose. Oh, what if there’s a moose? I can’t go to the toilet!’” he said.View image in fullscreenSVT set up preparations in Junsele, Sweden.Photograph: SVT/APThe show – and its success – are part of a growing trend for “slow television” that some argue was pioneered by the late US pop artist Andy Warhol, whose 1964 film Sleep showed the poet John Giorno sleeping for five hours and 20 minutes.More recently, the concept took off with the Norwegian broadcaster NRK’s pre-recordedBergensbanen,which showed, minute by minute, a seven-hour train journey from Bergen to Oslo with archive footage to enliven time spent in the line’s 182 tunnels.About 20% of Norway’s population tuned in at least once to that. Two years later, roughly half the country’s 5.5 million people watched at least some of NRK’s coverage – live and non-stop, this time – of a 134-hour sea voyage from Bergen to Kirkenes.Since then the broadcaster has aired at least one slow TV show a year, including 18 hours of salmon swimming upstream, 12 hours of firewood burning, 24 hours of academic lectures on the constitution and a 12-hour knitting marathon.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In Utrecht, in the Netherlands, alive stream from an underwater cameraallows viewers to ring a virtual doorbell and let spawning fish through a lock gate.MapSlow TV shows something happening at the rate it is experienced, rather than speeded up through plotting and editing. Its attraction, media experts say, seems to lie precisely in the soothing absence of staged tension and drama.“It becomes, in a strange way, gripping, because nothing catastrophic is happening, nothing spectacular is happening,” said Annette Hill, a professor of media and communications at Jönköping University in Sweden.“But something very beautiful is happening in that minute-by-minute moment.”Espen Ytreberg, a professor of media studies at the University of Oslo, has likened slow TV to a sort of window or “escape valve” from the medium’s usual frenetic pace. “Just when did we come to accept that television should be this accelerated, busy, intense, in your face thing?” he wondered – appropriately, almost a decade ago – in aninterview with CBS. “But at some point, that became the norm.”Just occasionally, of course, stuff does happen. SVT even sends a push alert when the first moose shows up on The Great Moose Migration, and runs an on-screen counter showing how many have managed to cross the river, which is wide and can be perilous.Last year, the programme’s cameras captured 87 making it safely across. Some do get into difficulties. Undeniably, though, viewers are, most of the time, staring at sky, water and trees. Maybe a duck or two.

Like most hard-up pensioners, they went by public transport. A ride costs eight hryvnia (15p). Their bus, No 62, was driving down Petropavlivska Street in the centre of Sumy, north-easternUkraine. On either side were elegant buildings belonging to Sumy state university. It was 10.23am.A Russian Iskander missile carrying cluster munitions plunged down from the sky, exploding next to the bus. Shrapnel engulfed the Boikos, other passengers and people in the street strolling past cafes and shops. The couple died instantly. Another missile hit the university’s conference centre, 200 metres away, punching through its glass atrium and balcony.Rescuers saw an apocalyptic scene. Bodies lay sprawled on the ground, cars burned, smoke billowed. The blast ripped a hole in the university’s economics and business department. It blew out the windows and wooden doors from the 19th-century institute of applied physics across the road. Fragments flew through the institute’s garden, shredding tulips and roses. The spot was a popular backdrop for wedding photos.On Tuesday, people visited the scene to lay flowers as firefighters perched on a shattered roof. “It was Palm Sunday, a holiday, a day off,” one Sumy resident, Tetyana, explained. “The weather had recently warmed up and people were on their way to church. We have a tradition in Ukraine that we buy willow branches.” She added: “This is a huge sorrow for the whole city. We are grieving. In my opinion this isn’t an act of war. It’s sheer terrorism.”View image in fullscreenTwo children are among the 35 people who were killed by the Russian cluster munitions.Photograph: Anastasia Vlasova/The GuardianAmong the dead were two children. One was 11-year-old Maksym Martynenko, who died with his parents, Mykola and Natalia. There were cuddly toys at the spot where he perished, including a bear and a hippo. Someone had left a plastic football with “To Max” written on it. The organist at Sumy’s philharmonic concert hall, Olena Kohut, was killed nearby on her way to a rehearsal. Other victims were students, teachers, a notary and the bus driver.Sumy is situated a mere 16 miles (25km) from the Russian border. It is home to soldiers and civilians. Residents are used to frequent drone and rocket attacks, and to the constant wail of air raid sirens. Sunday’s double-tap strike, though, was terrible. It was the most egregious Russian attack this year, leaving 35 dead and 129 injured. Eleven people remain in a critical condition. There are 15 wounded children.MapAsked for his reaction, Donald Trump appeared to downplay the latest Russian atrocity, calling it “a mistake”. Subsequently, he blamed Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president, and Joe Biden, the previous US president, by falsely claiming they “started” the war with Russia. Serhii Khvostov, the head of the damaged conference centre in Sumy, was unimpressed. “Trump is a mistake. This is an act by stupid and angry Russians. There’s no logic to it,” he said. “It’s easy to look away. But the world has to understand what is happening here.”Khvostov gave a tour of the ruined building. The missile blew a four-metre hole in the ground floor and careened into the basement, a community theatre space. A children’s show was due to take place there at 11am, shortly before the attack. Jagged pieces from the Iskander missile landed amid prepared sandwiches, costumes and a collection of puppets, including a dragon and Kermit the Frog. Large holes dinted the venue’s black walls.View image in fullscreenThe missiles struck at 10.23am on Palm Sunday, killing people walking in the street and riding on a bus.Photograph: Anastasia Vlasova/The Guardian“It was a miracle nobody was killed,” Khvostov said. After hearing the explosion, he called the centre’s elderly security guard. There was no answer, so he ran to the building. The guard was concussed but OK, and had managed to drag one of Khvostov’s colleagues from the administration’s office, pushing him out of a broken window. A cleaner also survived. No one else was inside. Several people drinking coffee from a mobile kiosk were injured.On Tuesday, staff swept away glass, ducking to avoid dangling bits of ceiling. Khvostov’s office was a mess. There were broken computers and desks and a toppled-over safe. “We can’t find the key,” he said. “It’s too early to say if this place can be rebuilt. I hope so.” Outside, a JCB digger scooped piles of debris into a lorry. A tow truck removed a damaged car. Its owner, Tetyana, said: “My windows blew in and my neighbour was hurt. I gave her a tourniquet.”The theatre’s founder and director, Volodymyr Niankin, said one of his friends was planning to leave Sumy due to the attack. Niankin said he himself would stay, to take care of his ailing grandmother. Of Trump and Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, he said: “I think they are stupid old men. They are representatives of a past cold war generation, when it was just the US and the USSR. It seems their plan is to divide up the world between them.”At the institute of applied physics, a clean-up was under way. Volunteers tidied the flowerbeds. The explosion damaged a chandelier in an upstairs lecture room and a charcoal portrait of a Sumy physicist, which had been hanging in a corridor. A whiteboard with an equation on it survived unscathed. Next to the entrance, a Quartz wall clock had stopped at the exact moment of impact: 10.23am and 40 seconds.Serhii Lebedynskyi, a senior researcher, examined his smashed office with his wife, Yulia. A shelf of physics books was covered in a layer of thick dust. Ornate plasterwork on the ceiling had disappeared. “We were planning to go into town with our small son on Sunday morning. He decided he didn’t want to leave the house. This probably saved us. We heard an enormous bang,” Lebedynskyi said. He added: “For more than 10 years the Russians have behaved like terrorists.”View image in fullscreenSerhii Khvostov, the head of the damaged conference centre.Photograph: Anastasia Vlasova/The GuardianAn American volunteer, Karl Ahlgren, said the Russians had known exactly what they were doing when they fired two missiles into a crowded city centre. “What Trump says is atrocious and unconscionable,” he said. “It’s clear he listens to Russian propaganda. I don’t know if it comes from Vladimir Putin or from [Trump’s special envoy] Steve Witkoff. There was no mistake here. The second strike was meant to kill rescuers.”On Tuesday, Ukraine’s armed forces carried out a form of revenge. The country’s military said it had successfully hit the headquarters of a Russian missile brigade responsible for Sunday’s carnage. “[A base] of the 448th missile brigade of the Russian occupiers was hit, a secondary detonation of ammunition was recorded. The results of the strike are being clarified,” it said in a statement.Back at Sumy’s cemetery, a gravedigger spoke fondly of Kohut, describing her as a talented and popular organist. “She was my friend. A very democratic person. She treated everyone the same way, whether you were important or not,” Valeriy Rodenko said. Rodenko said he had worked for seven years as a carpenter at the city’s philharmonic concert hall. “I got to know Olena well. She was a wonderful person. A bright spirit,” he said.He put down his spade and broke down in tears.Explore more on these topicsUkraineEuropeRussiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Any final arrangement must set in place a framework for peace, stability and prosperity in the Middle East – meaning that Iran must stop and eliminate its nuclear enrichment and weaponisation program. It is imperative for the world that we create a tough fair deal that will endure, and that is what President Trump has asked me to do.”The previous day on Fox News, the special envoy had said “the conversation with the Iranians” would concern uranium enrichment at 3.67 % for civil nuclear purposes.“In some circumstances they are enriching at 60% and at others at 20%. That cannot be,” he said. “You do not need to run, as they claim, a civil nuclear programme where you are enriching past 3.67%. This is going to be much about verification on the enrichment programme and then ultimately verification on weaponisation – that includes the type of missiles they have stockpiled there and the trigger for a bomb.”Witkoff’s two positions are hard to reconcile – unless he is trying to distinguish between an interim deal that reduces Iranian uranium enrichment to civilian levels and a final agreement that eliminates its nuclear programme entirely.It also possible Trump has faced a backlash from Iran hawks who warned that Witkoff’s negotiating stance was largely re-establishing the nuclear deal Barack Obama had agreed with Iran in 2015, from which Trump withdrew the US in 2018 saying it was unenforceable.Witkoff’s apparent volte face may also be seen as another example of chaotic foreign policymaking, in which the administration battles behind the president’s back and he either does not focus on the policy details or does not understand the choices he is allowing to be made on his behalf.Witkoff, a man with no diplomatic experience and charged with producing diplomatic breakthroughs in Gaza, Ukraine and Iran, has never tried to portray himself as anything than Trump’s messenger. He would have thought the proposals he aired in the weekend talks in Oman and on Fox News were those of the president.Iran has repeatedly demanded the right to maintain a civil nuclear programme, meaning the latest iteration of US thinking will cause consternation in Tehran and could strengthen hardliners, who maintain the US cannot be trusted.A rare consensus had broken out in Tehran that the talks between Witkoff and the Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, could result in some US sanctions being lifted as part of the most positive development in relations between Iran and the US in a decade.The head of the UN nuclear inspectorate, Rafael Grossi, is due to visit Iran this week to see if progress can be made on improving his inspectors’ access to Iran’s nuclear sites.Explore more on these topicsIranUS foreign policyUS politicsMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

One security guard died and nine medics were wounded.Hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians are living in the area, mostly in ragged makeshift tents alongside sand dunes. They left their homes after Israeli forces resumed conflict and seized swathes of southern Gaza, including Rafah City, which Palestinians are banned from entering.On Tuesday, Netanyahu made a rare visit to Gaza. Israeli forces have continued their air and ground offensive in the territory since the collapse of the ceasefire in March. The visit was confirmed by the prime minister’s office, who said he had visited troops in northern Gaza.Just two days previously, an Israeli missilepartly destroyed al-Ahli hospital, which was the only facility still providing critical care in northern Gaza. Doctors said the blasts had left the hospital barely operational and unable to carry out surgeries or accept patients.António Guterres, the UN secretary general, said he was “deeply alarmed” by the attack, and stressed that hospitals were protected under international humanitarian law.The Gaza paramedic killings: a visual timelineRead moreIsrael has repeatedly targeted hospitals in Gaza over the past 18 months, alleging that they are used by Hamas to conceal terrorist activities. Israeli forces claimed al-Ahli was being used as a “command and control” centre by Hamas, an allegation the group denied. Paramedics carrying out rescue operations in Gazahave also been targeted.Doctors working in Gaza warned that the situation for provision of medical care was at breaking point. Dr Mohammad Zahir, an emergency doctor at Indonesia hospital, said that if the aid blockade continued, severely ill children, cancer and kidney patients would soon die.“We are living through a severe crisis alongside the broader humanitarian catastrophe,” said Zahir. “Inside the hospital, there is not only a lack of resources, but a massive shortage of essential medicines and medical supplies. There is also a shortage of ambulances, medications for chronic illnesses and cancer patients, surgical supplies, and even hospital beds – all due to the ongoing closure of the border crossings.”The UN office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs said the situation in Gaza was “likely the worst it has been in the 18 months since the outbreak of hostilities”.Since the collapse of the ceasefire with Hamas, Israel has blocked all aid to the territory since 2 March, resulting in critical shortages of food, water, fuel and medicine. Staff at Nasser hospital, one of the largest in Gaza – which is only partially functional after beinghit in an airstrike last month– reported running out of gauze and burn creams this week.It is the longest period that Israel has denied aid to Gaza. Human rights groups said the tactic – meant to put pressure on Hamas to releasing the remaining hostages it holds – amounted to a war crime.Raeda Hijazi, living in a tent in the humanitarian zone in western Gaza with her four children, said they regularly survived only on salt and bread and had no choice but to drink contaminated water.“There is no fuel to purify or pump water, and even the available food is contaminated,” she said. “Vegetables are completely unaffordable. I cook using burning plastic, even though I know it contains carcinogenic substances, but there’s no alternative. Insects are everywhere in the tents due to the garbage accumulating in the streets. Words are not enough to describe the suffering.”View image in fullscreenPalestinians in Jabalia camp in Gaza on 15 April. Israel has blocked all aid going into the territory since 2 March, resulting in critical shortages of food, water, fuel and medicine.Photograph: Saher Alghorra/ZUMA Press Wire/REX/ShutterstockKhetam abu Ouda, 49, living in Abasan al-Kabira, east of Khan Younis, said he and his family had been displaced 20 times since the start of the war. They recently returned to the rubble of their home but were sharing it with 30 other displaced people and feared that as water was running out, they would soon have to move again. He said said aid groups were no longer distributing food.“The closure of crossings will lead to a slow and gradual death for the people here unless a radical solution is reached and the war is stopped,” said Ouda.Israel has also resumed its airstrikes and ground operations in Gaza, displacing about 400,000 people and leading to a surge in civilian casualties, with 1,600 killed since March alone.Speaking to Yedioth Ahronoth, an Israeli newspaper, an unnamed security official claimed the strategy was working and would force Hamas to agree to a deal on the hostages.“The military pressure is having an impact,” said the official. “They have a shortage of gas and the food and the fuel will run out in a few weeks. The big achievement of the residents’ return to the northern Gaza Strip has been erased. That’s rattled them.”Pressure has been mounting on Netanyahu’s government to secure the release of the remaining 58 hostages in Gaza, 24 of whom are believed to be alive. Thousands of former and reservist soldiers, as wellas over 250 former Mossad agents, gave their backing to a letter calling for an end to the war, accusing Netanyahu of putting the lives of the hostages at risk for his own political gain.As Israel launched more missiles in Gaza on Tuesday, a Hamas armed wing spokesperson said on Telegram that they had lost contact with the group holding Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander, who has been held captive in Gaza for more than 550 days, after a “direct strike” on his location.Alexander had appeared alive and agitated in a Hamas propaganda video released over the weekend in which he accused the “disgusting Israeli government” of deserting him and said he was “collapsing mentally and physically”.Reports emerged this week that Israel had put forward a ceasefire deal with Hamas that included releasing half of the living hostages. However, on Tuesday a Palestinian source told the BBC that Hamas had rejected the deal as it did not include a commitment to end the war or withdraw IDF forces from Gaza.Israeli’s offensive in response to the attacks by Hamas on southern Israel on 7 October 2023 has now claimed 51,000 lives, according to the Gaza health ministry. The count does not differentiate between civilians or combatants but women and children make up more than half of the dead.This month, agroup of UN expertssaid Israel’s actions in Gaza were leading to the “destruction of Palestinian life”.“If they are not killed by bombs or bullets, they slowly suffocate for lack of basic means of survival,” they said. “The only difference is the means and speed of death.”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesIsraelGazaMiddle East and north AfricaBenjamin NetanyahunewsShareReuse this content"

The head of Ocha, Tom Fletcher, says the dead were found buried by their wrecked and well-marked vehicles. “They were killed by Israeli forces while trying to save lives,” Fletcher says. “We demand answers and justice.”The IDF claimsits soldiers opened fireon the vehicles because they were “advancing suspiciously toward IDF troops without headlights or emergency signals” and alleges, without providing evidence, that Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants were among those killed. None were reported to be in the mass grave.1 AprilTwo witnesses tell the Guardianthat some of the bodies recovered from the grave had had their hands or feet tied, suggesting they were shot after being detained. ARed Crescentofficial says Israeli soldiers could be heard – over a phone line that was open to one of the paramedics at the time of the convoy shooting – ordering restraints to detain apparent survivors from the convoy.2 AprilA forensics consultant who examined five of the bodies says there isevidence of execution-style killingin some cases based on the “specific and intentional” location of shots taken at close range. The UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, says Gaza has become the world’s most dangerous place for humanitarian workers and calls for those responsible for the killings to be held accountable.3 AprilThe Israeli military says it is investigating the killings. It maintains that “terrorists” were advancing in the ambulances.Abed, the survivor,tells the Guardianhe was detained and beaten and had to watch as one ambulance and rescue vehicle after another approached the scene and came under intense gunfire.

No evidence to support the claim is presented.The brother of one of the paramedic victims, Saleh Moamer,tells the Guardianthere were “marks from restraints on Saleh’s wrists where the Israeli army had bound him”.7 AprilThe Red Crescent says autopsies conducted on those killed on 23 Marchshow they were shot in the upper bodywith “intent to kill”. Germany, one of Israel’s strongest supporters in Europe, calls for a full investigation of the incident.12 AprilIDF confirms that the soldiers involved in the incident were from its Golani Brigade. At the time, the brigade was under the control of the Armoured 14th Brigade, whose commander, Brig Gen Yehuda Vach, is reported by Haaretz to have told troops “there are no innocents in Gaza”. In a video of Golani troops being briefed before their redeployment to Gaza earlier this month, aired by Israel’s Channel 14, a battalion commander tells the soldiers: “Anyone you encounter there is an enemy. You identify anyone, you eliminate him.”A senior military intelligence sourcetells the Guardianthat Unit 504, a military intelligence team with a reputation for cruelty and reckless behaviour including torture, was also present during the attack.14 AprilThe International Committee of the Red Cross says Nsasrah, the missing paramedic, ,is being detained in Israel.

Tehran sees this as a precaution, or a form of insurance in case a future US administration withdraws from the agreement, as Donald Trump did in 2018 when he rejected the 2015 deal brokered by Barack Obama.Tehran says that if the stockpile was to leave Iran and the US pulled out of the deal, it would have to start from scratch in enriching uranium to higher purity – effectively punishing Iran for a breach committed by Washington.Although the bulk of the exchanges in Muscat were held indirectly between the Iranian and US delegations, with Oman acting as the intermediary, direct meetings between Witkoff and Araghchi also took place.Giorgia Meloni, the Italian prime minister, has agreed to host the next round of talks on Saturday in Rome, in a move seen as a political gesture by Trump towards Italy. It also serves to marginalise the main European powers in the Iran negotiations, with Oman continuing to act as the mediator. The US vice-president, JD Vance, will also be in Rome over the Easter weekend.During the initial nuclear talks in 2015, Italy felt it was excluded from the process, with France, Germany and the UK – the so-called “E3” – representing European interests at the talks.Mohamed Amersi, of the Foreign Policy Research Institute, said: “Meloni is an interesting choice since Meloni seems to be the European leader that has the best personal line to Trump, more than France, Germany and the UK. If Italy hosts the meeting it begs the question of the future role of the E3 in the US-Iran dialogue.”Iran is negotiating under the threat of not just further sanctions but a potential military attack on its nuclear sites by the US.With the Iranian economy in decline, Tehran is eager to attract direct investment by lifting US sanctions. Discussions have already started on potential insurance options for companies looking to invest in Iran, in case of a further breakdown in US relations. After the 2018 withdrawal and the imposition of sanctions on foreign companies trading with Iran, the EU was unable to devise a viable way of protecting businesses that wanted to invest in Iran.Trump has so far excluded other aspects of the US-Iran relationship from the talks, such as Tehran’s “destabilising regional behaviour”, a decision that has confounded both Israel and anti-regime hawks in Washington. The US may seek some form of Iranian assurance that it will not use its influence to interfere in the sovereignty of other states. Iran, however, argues it is Israel making land grabs in Syria, Lebanon and Palestine.Iran’s influence in the region has been weakened by the fall of the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, Israel’s assaults on Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, and US attacks on Yemen. Iran’s oil export fleet is also facing increasing sanctions pressure from the US president.Explore more on these topicsIran's nuclear programmeIranUS foreign policyDonald TrumpMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Half of reduced fees are not means-tested on family income at all, the research shows.“This is not a good enough performance from a sector wishing to claim it is charitable and motivated by the public good, and which argues it should retain VAT tax relief despite the rest of the country having to considerably tighten its belt.”The PEPF said many private schools did not publish details of their bursaries and scholarships, meaning that the larger schools it surveyed might not be representative of the sector. Its figures found that in 2022-23, the schools gave £224m worth of means-tested support, and £185m in unassessed support.TheIndependent Schools Council(ISC), which represents 60% of England’s 2,400 private schools, said its figures showed that £1bn in fee assistance by its members was divided between both forms of assistance. The £494m devoted to means-tested support in 2023 was 32% higher than in 2012 after adjusting for inflation.An ISC spokesperson said: “This report takes an unrepresentative sample of independent schools and starts from a baseline of one of the most anomalous years schools have ever seen.“There is a good conversation to be had – one we are keen to participate in – about bursaries and how independent schools could more effectively target them. Sadly, this research adds absolutely nothing to that conversation.”After Labour announced it would add VAT to school fees, a string of private school leaders said they would beforced to cut backon financial assistance.The PEPF’s research uncovered considerable variation in means-tested support between schools with similar fee incomes, some spending £500,000 and others up to £5m a year.There was also variation in the number of full means-tested bursaries, with Manchester grammar school remitting the full fees of one in 10 pupils.“Of course there are notable exceptions among some private schools but overall this charitable sector is not proving very impressive when it comes to genuinely helping ordinary and poorer families,” the PEPF said.Explore more on these topicsPrivate schoolsSchool fundingSchoolsThinktanksTaxEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

I think Nigel Farage is a right-wing populist.”Speaking about Farage specifically, Kebede added:I’m surprised that our union seems to be living rent free in his head, to be honest.But this is just lifted directly from the Donald Trump playbook. Both Elon Musk and Donald Trump have been directly attacking the AFT and the NEA, the American teachers’ unions, and this is what Nigel Farage is. He’s a pound shop Donald Trump.When asked about the union’s stance on Reform UK at a press conference in County Durham on Tuesday afternoon, Farage accused the NEU leader of being a “self-declared Marxist” who he claimed was determined that “children should be poisoned at school” about everything to do with the country.ShareUpdated at10.27 EDT"

It is her latest attempt to become a leading figure on the radical right in Britain, openly declaring her support for Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s mission to slash state spending in the US.Truss made the revelation at a cryptocurrency conference in Bedford over the weekend. She said that she had been “cut off at the knees” when she became prime minister by “the elite”, which opposed radical change.“That has made me think that it’s not enough just to get into number 10,” she said. “What I’m now thinking is we need a media network to be able to communicate to people, to be able to have a grassroots movement that is actually really demanding change of our leaders.”She said she was worried about how issues were “suppressed or promoted” by the mainstream media, appearing to compare Britain to communist Russia. “This is the kind of thing that we used to see going on in the Soviet Union and it’s now happening to us and it is absolutely shocking that that is the case in modern Britain,” she said.“I do think this needs to be actively fought and what I am doing is establishing a new free speech network, which will be uncensored and uncancellable, to actually talk about the issues people don’t want to talk about.”Her attempt to create her own social media platform follows in the footsteps of Trump’s Truth Social, operated by the Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG). Investing in TMTG became a means by which individual investors showed their support for the US president. TMTG lost $400.9m (£303.5m) last year.The track record of UK political figures attempting to start their own social networks is not encouraging.

The governmenttook controlof the plant after finding out its Chinese owner, Jingye, was attempting to sell the supplies and hasten the closure of the furnaces.“What we need for the long-term future ofBritish Steelis that private sector partner to work with us as a government on a transformation programme,” Reynolds said.“That might be new technology, new facilities, that might have a different employment footprint. The staff here absolutely know that, they know they need a long-term future.”He added: “These blast furnaces have given this country nearly a century of service in one case, so they know they need the future, and that might be a different model, different technology. What they didn’t want was the unplanned, uncontrolled shutdown of the blast furnaces with thousands of job losses and no plan in place for the future.“And by what we’ve been able to do, working with the brilliant team here at British Steel, is secure the possibility of that better future – and I for one am confident that we’ve made the right decision to support the people here.”Reynolds made his comments even as the GMB union called for an end to the formal redundancy programme, which British Steel began last year. Those planscould have meantthe closure of both blast furnaces and more than half of the site’s 3,500 workers losing their jobs.Charlotte Brumpton-Childs, national officer at GMB, said: “We are expecting the immediate threat of redundancies to be taken off the table, and we are looking to work with the secretary of state on planning the longer-term future for Scunthorpe and the steel making there.”Reynolds has the task both of securing immediate supplies to keep the furnaces running and looking for a longer-term bidder for the Scunthorpe site. Ministers want to find a private sector company to help the government pay for a new electric furnace at the plant, which forms the central part of British Steel’s £1.25bn decarbonisation plan.Reynolds said over the weekend he would not “bring a Chinese company into our steel sector” again, but on Tuesday he appeared to change his mind and refused to rule out the possibility that a Chinese company could take over the site once more.“I think you would look at a Chinese firm in a different way but I’m really keen to stress the action we’ve taken here was to step in, because it was one specific company that I thought wasn’t acting in the UK’s national interest, and we had to take the action we did,” he said.Reynolds’ change of tone comes amid a broader push by the UK government to limit the political fallout from the crisis surrounding British Steel.Over the weekend, the business secretary refused to rule out the possibility that Jingye’s actions might have been part of a deliberate act of sabotage to undermine the British steel industry. But by Monday, officials and ministers were insisting that was not the case, saying they believed the company had been acting purely out of commercial considerations.The government’s push to secure Chinese investment in British infrastructure has begun to alarm some senior figures within Labour.Liam Byrne, the chair of the business select committee,told the Guardianthis week: “We must now be fiercely vigilant about just who is granted the keys to the industries and infrastructure that keep our nation moving.”Explore more on these topicsBritish SteelSteel industryJonathan ReynoldsTrade unionsJob lossesnewsShareReuse this content"

She has also alleged he pointed a gun in her face and said: “I’m a boss, I’m a fucking G, you’re going to do as I say or there’ll be hell to pay.”Anne Studd KC, representing the women, told the judge, Richard Armstrong, it was thought to be the “first occasion” that coercive control was “brought before the high court in a civil context”.In written submissions, the barrister added the case was “understood to be the first claim where allegations of coercive control have been considered in a civil context of whether that behaviour can amount to intentional infliction of harm”.The hearing at the high court in London on Tuesday dealt with preliminary matters, including disclosure and legal costs. The judge said the claimants were “seeking damages likely to reach six figures” and scheduled a three-week trial for early 2027.Tate denies the allegations and claims his relationships with the women were consensual. Studd told the court there was “a total denial of wrongdoing” and that Tate had dismissed the claims in his written defence as “a pack of lies” and “nonsense”. Tate’s lawyers further claim the allegations for personal injury are barred as they are subject to a three-year limitation period.Studd said there was a “vast amount” to review in the case, including “thousands of pages of open-source material” produced by Tate, “as well as material provided from law enforcement agencies, material from criminal proceedings in other jurisdictions” and video footage.She told the court: “[Tate] has a profile, largely made by himself, where he regularly discusses issues of violence against women and girls and misogyny” and gave his “seemingly high-profile support for behaviours of that type”.The judge allowed the women to rely on evidence from one expert on “why victims of sexual violence do not always bring claims precipitously”, but refused to allow them to rely on a second expert on coercive control.Studd had said expert evidence was needed so the court had “the whole picture”, describing coercive control as “a form of grooming and manipulation where the victim becomes less and less able to respond in what might be perceived as a normal way. In particular, she may not leave even if the door is open.”But Vanessa Marshall KC, for Tate, said the additional expert evidence was “unnecessary”.Armstrong did not allow Tate’s lawyers to claim the costs of travelling to Romania to take statements. “He has travelled to the US and Dubai recently, there is no reason he cannot travel to the UK,” the judge said.Three of the women had reported Tate to Hertfordshire police in 2019 but the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to bring criminal charges.Tate and his brother Tristan are under criminal investigation in Romania over allegations of human trafficking, trafficking of minors and money laundering.Bedfordshire police are seeking to arrest the Tate brothers in relation to allegations of rape and trafficking dating to between 2012 and 2015. The two men deny all accusations against them.Explore more on these topicsAndrew TatenewsShareReuse this content"

A few places may see 50-75 mm of rain during this period.”By Tuesday evening 36mm (1.4in) had fallen in Culdrose in Cornwall in 24 hours and 30mm in Milford Haven in south-westWales. The east of England did not completely escape, with 21mm falling on parts of Suffolk.By the end of Wednesday as much as 75mm was expected to have fallen in some areas of west Wales over 48 hours – about the same as the average for the whole of April.Wind was also expected to be an issue on Wednesday, with very strong gusts hitting parts of the south coast of England and 50mph flurries inland.A yellow warning was in place for Northern Ireland for much of Wednesday, where up to 60mm of rain was predicted over the high ground of Antrim and Down.After weeks of fine weather for many parts of the UK, the Met Office said low pressure was leading to unsettled conditions.Its chief meteorologist, Matthew Lehnert, said: “After a long spell of high pressure bringing dry weather and sunshine, gloomier and unsettled conditions are on the horizon. Low pressure has become established to the west of the UK, bringing cloud, rain showers and lower temperatures for many.“More persistent and heavy rain is expected on Tuesday into early Wednesday. A low-pressure system near Portugal is of particular interest as it moves towards the UK, bringing with it potentially heavy rain and thunderstorms.“High rainfall totals are possible but, given the recent dry conditions, significant impacts are not anticipated. The situation remains under close watch, with further wet conditions anticipated on Thursday and another weather front moving in on Friday.”In England, the Environment Agency hadnine flood alerts– meaning flooding is possible – in place on Tuesday afternoon. There were no flood warnings for Wales.The Environment Agency was monitoring the River Mimram, a chalk stream in Hertfordshire, where the persistent rain in December and January has led to high groundwater levels. It said there may be risk of flooding there to very low-lying properties.Storm Hans, named by the Italian Met Service, is due to bring strong winds and rough seas to parts of the Mediterranean this week.Heavy rain is a concern, particularly in northern Italy, where over 200mm (8in) may fall by Thursday, giving a risk of flash flooding and landslides.Temperatures in the UK are likely to be around average for the time of year, with potentially unsettled days, dry interludes and chilly nights.The AA issued anamber warning for trafficfor the Easter weekend. It said more than 19m journeys were expected on Good Friday and more than 18m on Easter Monday.Explore more on these topicsUK weatherEnglandWalesCornwallDevonnewsShareReuse this content"

He said there was a “there is a non-trivial chance” his company would be forced to spinInstagramand WhatsApp out anyway.Zuckerberg made another key concession during the US trial on Tuesday, saying he bought Instagram because it had a “better” camera than the oneFacebookwas trying to build for its flagship app at the time. In the email, he said Instagram was a “rapidly growing, threatening, network”.The acknowledgement appeared to bolster allegations by US antitrust enforcers thatMetahad used a “buy or bury” strategy to snap up potential rivals, keep smaller competitors at bay and maintain an illegal monopoly.It came during Zuckerberg’s second day testifying at the high-stakes trial in Washington, in which the US Federal Trade Commission is seeking to undo Meta’s acquisitions of prized assets Instagram, acquired for $1bn, andWhatsApp, bought for $19bn.The case, filed during Donald Trump’s first term, is widely seen as a test of the new Trump administration’s promises to take on big tech companies.Asked by an attorney for the FTC whether he thought fast-growing Instagram could be destructive to Meta, then known as Facebook, Zuckerberg said he believed Instagram had a better camera product than Facebook was building.“We were doing a build versus buy analysis” while in the process of building a camera app, Zuckerberg said. “I thought that Instagram was better at that, so I thought it was better to buy them.”Zuckerberg also acknowledged that many of the company’s attempts at building its own apps had failed.“Building a new app is hard, and many more times than not, when we have tried to build a new app, it hasn’t gotten a lot of traction,” Zuckerberg told the court. “We probably tried building dozens of apps over the history of the company and the majority of them don’t go anywhere.”Zuckerberg’s testimony comes as Meta is defending itself years after the release of damning statements plucked from Facebook’s own documents, like a 2008 email in which he said “it is better to buy than compete”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Instead of taking a citizenship test, as he had expected to do, he was arrested and handcuffed by immigration officers.Rubio’s memo justifying the arrest cites the same authority used to detain Mahdawi’s fellow Columbia protester and green-card holder Mahmoud Khalil. In both cases, Rubio cited a provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) that he said allows him to deport any person who is not a citizen or national of the US.In Khalil’s case, Rubio argued that Khalil’s activism undermined the US goal of combatting antisemitism; the reasoning is currently being challenged in court. But the memo addressing Mahdawi’s case, the New York Times reports, is more specific, noting that Mahdawi had “engaged in threatening rhetoric and intimidation of pro-Israeli bystanders”, saying his activism had undermined efforts to protect Jewish students from violence, and saying it had undermined the Middle East peace process by reinforcing antisemitic sentiment.Mohsen Mahdawi, Palestinian green card holder and Columbia student, detained by IceRead moreThe state department declined to comment, and Mahdawi’s lawyers did not immediately respond to the Guardian’s request for comment.According to the court filing challenging Mahdawi’s arrest, he was born and raised in a refugee camp in the West Bank, where he lived until he moved to the US in 2014. He became a lawful permanent resident of the US in 2015.He was expected to graduate Columbia in May, and had been accepted into a master’s program at the university’s school of international and public affairs, according to the court documents.As a student at Columbia, his lawyers say, Mahdawi was “an outspoken critic of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza and an activist and organizer in student protests on Columbia’s campus until March of 2024, after which he took a step back and has not been involved in organizing”.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS immigrationIsrael-Gaza warMarco RubioColumbia UniversityUS politicsAntisemitismnewsShareReuse this content"

Americans placed around $150bn in wagers last year.The Campaign for Accountability, an advocacy organization, has documented the gambling industry’s lobbying efforts at the state level over recent years against a number of proposed regulations that problem gambling advocates say are aimed at protecting consumers from gambling-related harms.Some of the efforts have been successful.US gambling giants face scrutiny over VIP programs: ‘Profits take priority over people’Read moreIn 2022, for example, according to the report, DraftKingspushed back against a proposed rulein Arizona that stated that promotions should only be labeled or described as “free” if they genuinely are. While problemgambling experts have warnedsuch offers can distort the perception of risk for gamblers, the report notes, DraftKingsarguedthat it was “industry standard to promote free play to accompany a player’s deposit” and noted gamblers were required to make a deposit in order to receive the “free” play.The Arizona department of gaming decided to adopt DraftKings’ suggestion, according to the report. The state law now reads “promotions and/or bonuses described as free shall clearly disclose material facts, terms, and conditions”.Some states have proposed banning types of wagers that the report claims are “strongly associated with gambling addiction”, such as “in-game bets” – which are odds offered after the event has started and is ongoing.In Minnesota last year, the Sports Betting Alliance (SBA), an industry group,opposed an amendmentto a state sports wagering legalization bill that banned in-game bets, the report states.Supporters of restricting in-game bets, whichare often rapid-fire in nature, say that this type of bettingcan contribute to problem gambling. The SBA opposed the amendment, arguing,according to CBS and the new report, that half of all bets in the US are in-game wagers and that enacting the bill would significantly reduce the revenues the state was set to collect from sports betting, and described the amendment as “nothing short of a gift to illegal operators”.The report states that the Minnesota legislature hadnot passed any billas of February 2025.In Virginia, the report states that bothCaesarsandDraftKingslobbied against a proposed rule in 2021 requiring platforms to include “game designs that promote breaks in play and avoidance of excessive play”.[It is] important for lawmakers to understand that implementing consumer protections around online sports betting isn’t just picking winners and losersMichelle Kuppersmith, Campaign for AccountabilityCaesarsarguedthe language “should be replaced with language indicating that sports betting platforms must incorporate opportunities for players to choose ‘cooling off’”, while DraftKingswrotethat the section be removed entirely. “Bettors make bets on different fixed odds wagering events, they do not play ‘games,’” the firm argued, adding that “requirements on designing and screening new games are not applicable.”The Virginia lottery board dropped the proposed requirements from the final rules, according to the report.In 2023, the report states that WynnBet, which has since shut down its online sports betting operations,opposed proposed languagein Maine that stated that television advertising would not advertise promotions and or bonuses. The companyarguedthat “it is common industry practice to engage with customers through promotional or bonus programs, which are frequently tied to sporting events”.The National Council on Problem Gamblingsupportedthe rule, writing that the “use of promo deductions has often led those in recovery from gambling addiction to relapse”.But ultimately, the report states, Maine decided to allow such promotions.In a statement to the Guardian, Michelle Kuppersmith, the executive director at the Campaign for Accountability, argued that the gambling industry, “just like the tobacco industry before it”, must be carefully regulated. Companies’ profits and the addictiveness of their products are “so tightly linked”, she said.It is “important for lawmakers to understand that implementing consumer protections around online sports betting isn’t just picking winners and losers on a balance sheet”, Kuppersmith added. “With gambling addiction so troublingly linked to suicidality, the lives of their constituents – especially young people – are on the line.”One woman’s fight against VIP schemes fueling the US sports betting boom: ‘You’re the biggest loser’Read moreSome attempts to change or strike proposed regulations have failed.For example, the report notes that in 2023, several operators asked the Massachusetts gaming commissionto amenda rule that included prohibiting them from using sensitive consumer information – such as an individual’s occupation, net worth, debt, income, credit history, status as a recipient of government benefits, medical status or conditions – to promote certain types of promotional offers or wagers, arguing that it would hamper the operator’s essential marketing practices.The restrictions, DraftKingsargued, “would single out sports wagering operators and substantially inhibit their ability to engage in basic analytics and marketing activities that other industries freely engage in”.The commission, however,did not adopt the companies’ proposed changes, per the report.That same year, the report states that FanDuelchallengeda proposed rule in New York that held gambling operators responsible for misleading language used by their marketing affiliates, and also, as previouslyreported by the Guardian,opposeda rule aimed at restricting advertising in the areas surrounding college campuses, claiming it was “vague”. According to the report, the state’s gaming commissionupheldboth original proposals.In Vermont, bothCaesarsand FanDuel opposed a rule that granted state regulators the ability to impose caps on promotions, bonuses, or other credits.Caesarsarguedthat caps were not “typically set by the regulatory body in the jurisdictions in which we currently operate” andFanDuel arguedthat this would result in state regulators “dictating marketing strategies to sportsbooks, likely resulting in a less attractive offering than can be found in either bordering states or the illegal market”.Despite the objections,Vermont regulatorsset the caps, according to the report.The report notes that DraftKings last yearobjected toa Maryland regulation prohibiting gambling ads from implying that certain outcomes were “without risk”, arguing that the term “risk” in this context was “overly broad and confusing”. Nevertheless, the Maryland Lottery and Gaming Control Agencyupheld the language, the report states.‘A serious disease’: Congress weighs federal gambling crackdown amid growing concernsRead moreAnd similarly, in 2020, the report adds that Penn Entertainmentlobbied against a rulein Virginia that stated that ads or promotional materials “may not imply that chances of winning increase the more one participates in, or the more one spends on, sports betting”.Penn proposed changing “imply” to “guarantee”, but the Virginia lottery boarddid not adoptthe suggestion.Penn and Caesars did not respond to a request for comment from the Guardian on Monday. Wynn declined to respond, stating that they don’t have any comment on WynnBet’s past operations.A spokesperson for FanDuel said in a statement: “FanDuel appreciates the invitation state regulators and legislators have provided our representatives to participate in important testimony related to online sports wagering.”“As a licensed and regulated operator, we believe it’s critically important to support public discourse and the collective efforts to build sustainable long-term frameworks that prioritize customer protection and create equitable business environments that deliver millions of dollars in state tax revenue annually, the hallmark of the legal marketplace,” the spokesperson added.DraftKings provides “feedback to a variety of stakeholders to help inform legal frameworks that we believe work in the best interest of consumers”, a spokesperson for the firm said. “Well-designed, state-specific sports betting structures offer responsible gaming tools and resources to help consumers play in an informed and responsible manner while providing critical tax revenue for states.”A spokesperson for the Sports Betting Alliance told the Guardian: “Legal online sports betting is one of the most highly regulated industries in America.”“The SBA always appreciates invitations and opportunities to share our members’ experience and expertise with elected officials and regulators,” the spokesperson said. “We see firsthand how regulated, law-abiding sports betting operators are put at a severe disadvantage when illegal offshore and unregulated providers are the only entities that are able to offer popular products such as prop bets.”A spokesperson for the American Gaming Association, a lobby group whosemembersinclude most major casino companies, said the legal betting industry is “grounded in responsibility, transparency, and consumer protection”.“Across the country, more than 5,000 state regulators and policymakers work with licensed operators each day to enforce strong regulatory frameworks and uphold a shared commitment to responsible gaming, as well as efforts to support those experiencing problem gambling,” the spokesperson said. “This includes a wide range of initiatives – from public education campaigns to state-run helplines and funding for research and treatment services for those seeking assistance.”Explore more on these topicsSport bettingThe big betGamblingnewsShareReuse this content"

Greenland is an example of that in action, she added.“These donations are investments, and they were made with particular outcomes in mind, and even if they weren’t stated at the time, the money changed hands,” DiVito said.Vice-PresidentJD Vancerecently visited Greenland, which is an autonomous territory of Denmark, in the latest installment of the unfolding dispute between the countries. Trump has vowed to acquire Greenland “one way or another”.Among those who have invested millions in KoBold Metals, a mining company at the leading edge of Greenland’s “modern gold rush” for rare minerals essential to tech companies, are major Trump donors such as Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, OpenAI’s Sam Altman, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and other Silicon Valley moguls.The top investor in Critical Metals Corp, which has a mining permit in Greenland, is the hedge fund Cantor Fitzgerald, which Trump’s commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, led until January. Critical Metals’ other top institutional investors include Vanguard, BlackRock, Geode Capital and State Street – companies that haveamassed$314m in Trump Media stock, much of it purchased just ahead of the election.Among the Greenland bids’ loudest supporters are crypto tycoons who pouredunparalleled sumsof money into 2024 Trump and Republican campaigns while labeling Greenland an “investment frontier” where data centers essential to the US artificial intelligence and crypto currency industries could be built. Some of the same donors alsowant to establisha largely autonomous libertarian utopian “post state” for the tech elite in Greenland that could be used to practice “terraforming” for a Mars colony.The groupbehind the “state”, Praxis, labels its members “optimistic pioneers”, but critics say it is a colonialist operation aimed at plundering wealth and resources from a weak nation still linked to Denmark – its colonial power. Regardless, Praxis is already backed by $525m and includes members of or donors to the Trump administration, such as the PayPal co-founderKen Howery, who was nominated for ambassador to Denmark.What’s unfolding in Greenland represents the “circle of grift”, said Robert Weissman, co-president of Public Citizen, a government transparency non-profit.“Put money into the Trump family bank and the money comes back to you in the form of some government policy,” Weissman said. “That even includes the deployment of the empire in service of libertarians who favor a stateless society.”The minerals found in Greenland are used in laptops, smartphones, weapons, clean energy technology, electric vehicles and elsewhere across the economy. China so far controls 70% of the rare earth market, and vital trade and military routes run through Greenland’s waters, so the administration portrays its interest as buttressing US security and industry. But Greenlanders are largely opposed to the idea.Moreover, Greenland is a largely frozen, dark country with very little infrastructure, and it’s prone to rock slides, tsunamis and a shifting ground, said Paul Bierman, a natural resources researcher at the University of Vermont who spent four seasons working there. It is extremely difficult and expensive to extract resources, and the idea that a “gold rush” is possible is “almost completely pie in the sky”, Bierman said.Mining industry donors and investorsThe opposition from Greenlanders and unforgiving terrain has done little to tamp the tech, mining andTrump administrationdonor enthusiasm for a takeover.KoBold holds permits to extract cobalt, nickel and platinum, and is now valued at $3bn. Its largest backer is the tech investment firm Andreessen Horowitz – Marc Andreessen, who has assisted the unofficial “department of government efficiency” (Doge), and Ben Horowitz each donated $2.5m to a pro-Donald Trump Super Pac, according to FEC filings, in addition to contributing or helping raise tens of millions of dollars more via other channels.Bezos, Altman, Zuckerberg and Microsoft’s Bill Gates each donated $1m to Trump’s inauguration. Also among KoBold backers is Patrice Motsepe, a South African mining mogul who generated controversy in 2020 when he told Trump “Africa loves you!”Lutnick, Trump’s commerce secretary, who gave $5m to the president ahead of the election, just stepped down from his position at Cantor Fitzgerald, but other Trump donors lead the company. A spokesperson pointed to apress releasestating that Lutnick had divested and “does not expect any arrangement that involves selling shares on the open market”.BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street – who are Critical Metals’ other top shareholders – are generally considered to be passive investors who have their fingers in pots across the economy. Still, the three became Trump Media’s top investors when theypurchasedover $175m worth of stock just ahead of the election, which was widely viewed as an investment in the president. The companies did not respond to a request for comment.View image in fullscreenAerial view of the town of Narsaq in southern Greenland, located 5km (3 miles) from the site of an important rare earths mineral deposit.Photograph: Greenland Minerals Ltd/ReutersDiVito said Greenland was “littered with the corpses of mineral investors”, but some industry players including consultant Drew Horn, a former senior adviser in the previous Trump administration’s energy department, are regularly in the media cheerleading the administration’s Greenland policy and touting the riches that lie in the nation’s ground.Horn’s company, GreenMet, leverages his administration relationships to secure political and financial backing for mining companies. GreenMet “advance[s] private sector investments and sound legislative and regulatory action to develop a resilient domestic supply chain”, the company states.On Fox News, Horntoutedthe “significant opportunity for US investment in mining and energy production”, but industry observers with no financial stake remain skeptical. In the event that a mining startup doesn’t strike it rich in Greenland, Horn still receives fees for his consulting.Bierman did not comment on Horn, but said other reports that promote Greenland mining opportunities trace back to the mining industry, not independent or Danish government sources.“It makes me wonder: is it just self-promotion to get investment money?” Bierman said.Cryptocurrency industry donorsAhead of the election, the crypto tycoon Tyler Winklevoss summed up the industry’s mood: Biden had “openly declared war against crypto”, heinsisted. He and his twin, Cameron Winklevoss, would each donate $1m to Trump, who would “put an end to the Biden administration’s war on crypto.”The industryfollowed suit, ferventlybackingTrump and the Republicans. The largest crypto Pac, Fairshake, reported spending $195m in the last election cycle, with at least $148m going to the president and Republicans. Top firms reportedlypoured another$10m into the president’s inaugural fund.The crypto industry’s aims in Greenland are slightly more nebulous than mining’s, but it has fixated on the region. In part, the cold climate and easy access to renewable energy is attractive for bitcoin mining operations – Hornsaid it“literally is the best place in the world for data centers”. The crypto industry startup Lympid just tokenized the first property in Greenland, meaning the real estate asset is converted into coins that people can buy, giving them a stake in the company. Lympid’s co-founder Joao Lageslaid outwhy in revealing terms.“This isn’t just about real estate; it’s about democratizing access to one of the world’s most unique and promising investment frontiers,” Lages said. “We’re creating a bridge for global investors to participate in the region’s growth story.”Praxis’s deep roster of tech elite includes folks such as Joe Lonsdale, a venture capitalist who co-founded the AI, drone and weapons producer Palantir and gave millions to Trump, while the companygave another$2.5m. Vance and Trump ally Peter Thiel, and Dryden Brown, a 28-year-old tech entrepreneur who “went to Greenland totry to buy it” several years ago, are also part of the group.When Trump nominated the Praxis member and PayPal co-founder Howery as ambassador to Denmark, Praxisrespondedon X: “According to plan.”Greenland’s new PM rejects Trump’s latest threat: ‘We do not belong to anyone else’Read moreSoon after Trump’s announcement,Brown tweetedthat Praxis would like to “extract critical resources, terraform the land with advanced technology to make it more habitable, and build a mythical city in the North”.Failed oil explorationAfter 50 years of allowing industry to figure out – largely unsuccessfully – how to efficiently pull oil from Greenland, its government banned exploration in 2021, citing the challenges and climate change.The Trump administration, which benefited from at least $75m in donations from industry executives ahead of the election, has regularly repeated that oil and gas exploration could be reopened if the US took over Greenland.But some suspect this is merely an attempt to drum up support for and justify a Greenland takeover. Bierman said drilling was risky, costly and had failed to turn up the huge reserves that some speculate exist.“The Trump administration is not always grounded in science and reality, and I think this is an example of that,” Bierman said.Explore more on these topicsUS political financingGreenlandTrump administrationUS foreign policyMiningUS politicsCryptocurrenciesnewsShareReuse this content"

Beijing was also said to be considering ways to support airlines that lease Boeing jets and are facing higher costs.About 10 Boeing 737 Max jets are being prepared to join Chinese airlines, and if delivery paperwork and payment on some of them were completed before Chinese ”reciprocal” tariffs came into effect, the planes may be allowed to enter the country, sources told Bloomberg.The restriction marks a serious blow for Boeing and other manufacturers trying to navigate the escalating trade war between the world’s two biggest economies.The group chief executive of the budget airline Ryanair, Michael O’Leary, has said his company could delay taking deliveries of Boeing aircraft if they become more expensive. He told the Financial Times that Ryanair was due to receive a further 25 aircraft from Boeing from August but would not need the planes until around March or April 2026. “We might delay them and hope that common sense will prevail,” O’Leary said.Shares in Boeing have been buffeted by worries about the impact of trade tariffs, as well as complaints from some shareholders that the company has underinvested in its engineering.The company has lost 7% of its market value since the start of the year, and in March its chief financial officer, Brian West, said tariffs could hit availability of parts from its suppliers.The rival European plane manufacturer Airbus said on Tuesday that it was watching the evolving situation on trade tariffs. Its chief executive, Guillaume Faury, told shareholders the company was having problems receiving components from the American supplier Spirit AeroSystems, which was weighing on the production of its A350 and A220 jetliners.The chaotic introduction of Donald Trump’s tariffs has triggered volatility in the stock market since 2 April, although there has been a tentative recovery this week after the US president announced he was temporarily suspending planned tariffs on imports of smartphones and laptops.The S&P 500, the American blue-chip index of stocks, ticked up 0.7% in early trading on Tuesday, but was still down about 7% so far this year.There remains a great deal of uncertainty around possible tariffs on computer chips and pharmaceutical imports, with the Trump administration initiating an investigation into the impact of trade in these areas on American national security. Meanwhile, the chip designer Nvidia has announced it will build up to$500bn (£378bn) worth of artificial intelligence infrastructure in the USover the next four years.In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei index rose by 0.8% on Tuesday and South Korea’s Kospi by 0.9%, withstrong gains for carmakers such as Honda, Suzuki and Hyundai, after Trump signalled there would be help for the industry.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In its last financial year, Nvidia reported that its cost of revenue, which consists primarily of support for manufacturing, testing and producing chips, stood at $16.6bn.Production of its popular Blackwell graphics processing unit has already started at TSMC’s plant in Phoenix, Arizona, Nvidia said. Construction of new plants is also under way with the manufacturers Foxconn in Houston and Wistron in Dallas. Mass production at both plants is expected to ramp up in the next 12 to 15 months.Huang said that adding American manufacturing helped the company “better meet the incredible and growing demand for AI chips and supercomputers”, strengthened its supply chain and boosted its resiliency. The White House said in a statement that Nvidia’s decision was “the Trump Effect in action”.Nvidia’s stock market valuation has ballooned in recent years thanks to huge demand for its AI chips, with the shares rising by more than 1,000% since 2020. However, tariff uncertainty has wiped hundreds of billions of dollars off its market value since the start of this year, with the share price sinking by about 20%.Global stock markets haveopened this week tentatively higheron hopes that Trump could ease some of his new levies. On Tuesday, Japan’s Nikkei rose by 0.8% and South Korea’s Kospi by 0.9%. However, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng slipped by 0.16% and Chinese markets were also lower, down 0.1% in Shanghai. In Europe, markets also gradually continued their recovery, with the UK’s FTSE 100 index up 40 points, or 0.5%, to 8,175 in early trading, while Germany’s Dax gained 0.7% and France’s Cac was up 0.1%.Trump is still pressing ahead with plans to impose tariffs on semiconductor and pharmaceutical imports. On Tuesday, the US Department of Commerceinitiated an investigationinto the impact of imports of chips and pharmaceuticals on American national security.So far, pharmaceuticals and chips have been exempt from the 10% tariffs that started on 5 April. However, Trump said on Sunday that he would announce a tariff rate on imported semiconductors over the next week, adding that there would be some flexibility for certain companies in the sector.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Joe Biden also tried to bolster the American semiconductor industry during his presidency by granting billions-worth of subsidies via his Chips Act in 2022 that awarded chipmakers who expanded manufacturing and production in the US.Several global drug companies have also announced investments in the US this year as the sector tackles the threat of tariffs on pharmaceuticals.

In February 2025, the EU received 56m cubic metres a day via the TurkStream pipeline, an 11% monthly increase. “These increases could threaten the 2027 Russian gas phaseout pathway,” Ember said, also referring to liquified natural gas (LNG).The US is Europe’s biggest supplier of LNG and officials have expressed interest in buying even more of the ultra-cold shipped fuel since Donald Trump returned to the White House.Energy executives are openly talking about resuming Russian gas imports. “If there is a reasonable peace in Ukraine, we could go back to flows of 60bn cubic metres, maybe 70, annually, including LNG,” Didier Holleaux, the executive vice-president at France’s Engie,told Reutersin an interview. The French government partly owns Engie, which used to be among the biggest buyers of Gazprom’s gas.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He added that many colleagues agreed on the need to go back to Russian gas but said it was a “taboo topic”.However, the market volatility in the wake of the US tariff moves has hit Russia’s oil exports and earnings in recent weeks.According to Bloomberg, crude flows from Russian ports in the four weeks to 13 April fell to 3.13m barrels a day, their lowest since February, while the gross value of shipments dropped by about $80m (£60.5m) to $1.29bn a week, the lowest since mid-July 2023.Explore more on these topicsGasEuropean UnionRussiaEnergy industryCommoditiesFossil fuelsEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Curled into the fetal position, she began crying harder than she had in years.She wondered if she could finish. She rolled over on her back, looked up at the sky and thought back to a dark period in her life, when she was clinicallydepressedand not sure if she wanted to live. She no longer doubted. She knew she could and would finish the race.Not long after completing the ultramarathon, she committed to building abusiness, Conscious Gear, focused on helping people spend time outdoors, which was so central to her recovery.Her grandpa brewed beer in his cellar in Iran. Last month she canned 30,000 brews that taste like homeRead moreShe began producing a hydration vest intended to eliminate an obstacle that overweight and obese people have when trying to make life-saving changes: finding athletic clothing or gear that actually fits.It is now stocked on REI’s website – and Young Bowens, now 58, describes it as a miracle that she has made it this far.A native of Ann Arbor, Michigan, Young Bowens worked for more than 15 years in administrative research roles at the University of Michigan and Arizona State University.View image in fullscreenCharlotte Young Bowens at her office in Phoenix, Arizona.Photograph: Caitlin O’Hara/The GuardianSixteen months before that ultramarathon, Young Bowens passed out at work and woke up in an emergency room. A doctor warned her that her weight of 400 pounds, high blood pressure, cholesterol levels and prediabetes put her at risk of early death. Not least, she suffered from debilitating depression. But shejoined a gym and stepped on to a treadmill for the first time.“I had never been physically active before, nor had I been in any sports,” Young Bowens said. “That first day, I could barely walk for two minutes at 2mph, but something in me was committed and ready to go, so I just kept putting one foot in front of the other.”She discovered she loved to run. Soon, she felt ready for a 5km race. Then a 10km, a half marathon and finally a full marathon.But her newfound life created a different problem: finding wearable hydration gear – lightweight vests and fanny packs designed to carry liquids for runners and hikers – that comfortably fit her body. So she bought an extra-large and a large vest and sewed them together. She didn’t even own a sewing machine, so she had to check one out at the local public library.When she’d show up in her homemade haute hydration gear, fellow hikers noticed. They’d ask: “Where’d you get that?”In less than two years, Young Bowens shed more than 200 pounds. And she enteredRun Woodstock, the ultramarathon in Gregory, Michigan, where she had an awakening that sent her to her knees.“In that moment, I realized something had changed, the switch had been turned on, and I did want to live,” said Young Bowens. “I can really live and do great and wonderful things.”View image in fullscreenA Conscious Gear VestaPak.Photograph: Caitlin O’Hara/The GuardianAfter that first ultramarathon, she started competing in others. The more she moved, the less depressed she felt. Young Bowens became so committed that in 2019, she moved to Arizona, where she had access to more running and hiking trails.She continued making her own vests until friends encouraged her to start a business. Her concept:Conscious Gear, a company that makes wearable hydration vests for big and tall people.“Conscious Gear is about celebrating body diversity.” said Young Bowens. “We’ve created this hydration vest designed by and for us, taller, curvier, more muscular and bigger bodies.”She saw that there was demand. The market for hydration running vests recorded revenue of $150m in 2024 and is projected to rise to $300m by 2033, according toVerified Market Reports.But there was also a need. Having appropriate gear to fit one’s body to feel comfortable while exercising is vital, said Mary Himmelstein, an assistant professor of psychological sciences at Kent State University in Ohio.“If you’re in a space like a gym or a pool, or outdoors and in an outfit that doesn’t fit you, you’re constantly being told this subconscious message that ‘I don’t belong’,” said Himmelstein. “You think, ‘This isn’t me,’ and if that’s how you feel, you’re not going to engage in that activity.”With no background in business, Young Bowens looked for guidance. She won a place atWe Rise, a six-month accelerator program for entrepreneurs in Arizona.She made applying for grants a central part of raising capital, which was in Young Bowens’ wheelhouse. She’d been doing it professionally for decades for academic institutions. And in the wake of the pandemic and the George Floyd protests, there was increased corporate support for Black businesses and entrepreneurs.“I’d spend every Friday night with a glass of wine and apply to dozens of programs,” said Young Bowens.This couple has re-created the sights and smells of a Senegalese market in Brooklyn: ‘Experiences keep people coming back’Read moreAt first, weeks of applying yielded zero funds. She kept going and secured $80,000 in grants before launchingthe Conscious Gear websitein 2023.Young Bowens said she’s watched fellow entrepreneurs go into debt by borrowing too much or exhausting their credit limits.“I don’t know that struggle just yet. And honestly, I’m trying not to; I’m trying to avoid that for a little bit longer if I can,” she said.To prototype her designs, Young Bowens worked with an industrial designer, and then located a manufacturer in Weihai, China, to produce vest components. After they are delivered, she customizes them in her office in Tempe.She said her vests are designed to fit bigger bodies and not just sized up, which is what many other manufacturers do. Her products might be better described as size-inclusive, and could be a gamechanger for obese people who want to be active, said Robyn Pashby, a Washington DC-based psychologist who serves on the national board of directors of theObesityAction Coalition.“To only include up to size XL, or maybe double XL, is not size-inclusive,” said Pashby.Conscious Gear’s ultra-light vest, named the VestaPak, comes in three sizes with names inspired by Young Bowens’ favorite musical group: Earth (large to 2X), Wind (3X to 5X) and Fire (6X to 8X).View image in fullscreenCharlotte Young Bowens walks on the Pima Canyon Trail with her VestaPak at South Mountain Park in Phoenix on 4 April.Photograph: Caitlin O’Hara/The GuardianIt is sold at a number of REI stores across the country, as well as on the retailer’s website. Young Bowens has also discovered an unexpected customer base.“Surprisingly, 80% of my customers are men, who are gearheads. For some men, an outdoor lifestyle is a status symbol,” she said. “I’m also shocked by the number of orders I get from Australia. Sometimes the shipping costs as much as the product, but they keep ordering, so they must love it.”The tariffs recently enacted by Donald Trump have presented a challenge – Young Bowens’ costs are increasing, so she plans to start manufacturing most components in Arizona. And she’s still in search of grants to allow her to expand.But she’s also aware of what she’s accomplished. Recently, Young Bowens came across laminated pictures of her first design, the one she made on the borrowed sewing machine. “I used to go to events and tell people, ‘This is what I make. This is what I’m going to be making.’ Now I look at it, I kind of cringe,” she said, laughing. “Yeah, they were homemade, but I was proud.”In the US, you can call or text the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988, chat on 988lifeline.org, or text HOME to 741741 to connect with a crisis counselor.

It came to define his time as the manager of Paris Saint-Germain, the crazy Champions League defeat to Luis Enrique’s Barcelona in 2017 after his team had held a 4-0 first-leg lead in the last 16. Barcelona would end up needing three goals with 88 minutes of the second leg gone at the Camp Nou. They got them fora 6-5 ­aggregate win.On an epic night in the West Midlands, the roles were reversed; Emery the hunter with Aston Villa, Luis Enrique the hunted at PSG. It so nearly produced the ultimate moment of catharsis for Emery. His team were magnificent, absorbing the body blows of two concessions inside the opening half-hour that put PSG 5-1 up on aggregate and refusing to believe that this showpieceChampions Leaguequarter-final was beyond them.Barcelona sneak through after Serhou Guirassy’s treble gives Dortmund hopeRead moreVilla needed four to force extra time. When Youri Tielemans got the first on 34 minutes, it was easy to wonder whether it changed something inside of them. The truth was it did not because Villa were always resolved to leave everything on the pitch. The club’s most recent appearance in Europe’s elite competition had been in 1982-83. It had already been a campaign to remember. What happened in the second half was something else.Villa showed cut and thrust to go with their conviction and during a golden period, they got two further goals back and threatened the one to turn everything on its head, not least the notion that PSG are Europe’s best team at present, the favourites for the competition they have chased so hard for so long.With Marcus Rashford exploding to life, John McGinn and Ezri Konsa were the scorers and the goals were far from isolated thrusts. It was bedlam inside Villa Park, everybody in claret and blue willing the equaliser, feeling it was coming.What a story it would have been if Marco Asensio, who ison loan from PSGand came on as a substitute, had not been denied by Gianluigi Donnarumma in a one-on-one. Or if Konsa had not blown a header from a whipped Rashford free-kick.PSG did stabilise up to a point after that, Emiliano Martínez having to make three decent blocks to keep them out on the break. But Villa sensed there would be another chance and it came in stoppage time when another substitute, Ian Maatsen, caught a volley and watched Willian Pacho block from in front of the line. It was unclear whether Donnarumma would have got across. Pacho had seen Villa’s first two goals deflect in off him. This was a moment of redemption and how PSG ­celebrated with him. Their quest for a first Champions League title remains alive. Just.View image in fullscreenEzri Konsa wheels away in celebration after firing home Aston Villa’s third goal against PSG.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe optimism had run riot within the home supporters at kick-off time, Prince William among the believers in the stands. It did not matter that most neutrals considered PSG to have one foot in the semi-finals afterNuno Mendes’s late goalfor 3-1 in the first leg, the crowning moment of a ­dominant team performance.The atmosphere pulsed and Villa brought the storm, PSG indebted to Achraf Hakimi for the goal that helped them to settle. Marquinhos dispossessed Rashford and the visitors moved incisively from right to left and then up the flank through Bradley Barcola. His low cross caused a mix-up between Pau Torres and Martínez, who could only push the ball to Hakimi.PSG’s second also spoke to Luis Enrique’s spirit of adventure because once again it was a full-back applying the final brushstrokes to a counterattacking masterpiece. PSG won the ball inside their own area and it was a blur of blue as they moved upfield, Hakimi prominent before Ousmane Dembélé went square to Mendes. The finish was lovely; a dart away from Matty Cash and a curler that kissed a post on its way in.Villa had flickered at 1-0. Torres blasted too close to Donnarumma, while Morgan Rogers took a pass from Tielemans and curled just wide. They deserved the Tielemans goal, which was teed up by McGinn’s reverse pass after an excellent move involving Rashford.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Hard but fair, said the referee José María Sánchez. No penalty. Hakimi kicked up and out at McGinn as the pair tangled on the ground and he was lucky not to make contact. Sánchez became a target for the Villa fans.

And the crowd stayed with them. How they stayed with them. Rashford had extended Donnarumma in the 51st minute before McGinn picked up the ball inside his own half and kept running, the PSG defenders backing off. So he shot, the ball looping over Donnarumma.Rashford was a man on a mission. He had cut inside to work ­Donnarumma with a vicious shot when he nutmegged Ruiz and swerved away from Vitinha before pulling back for Konsa, who curled home. Villa went for the jugular. Tielemans almost scored with a header, Donnarumma clawing over.Torres could not react in time to direct a header of his own.

TheNFLfranchise, which has used the stylized lily symbol since its inception in 1967, registered the trademark in 1974 for use in professional football entertainment.The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuitdismissed Messier’s appealon Monday, stating that he had failed to allege “any commercial interest in the registered mark or a reasonable belief in damage” from its use. The ruling upheld a prior decision from the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, which had rejected Messier’s initial and amended petitions to cancel the registration.Sporticowas first to reportthe outcome of the appeal.To bring a federal appeal, the court noted, a party must demonstrate a concrete, particularized injury – a standard Messier did not meet. “He has not alleged that he or his family make, offer for sale, or sell any products or services using a fleur-de-lis design,” the opinion read. Nor had he shown any involvement in entertainment services or commercial activities related to football that might bring him into competition with the Saints.Messier’s claims included vague references to his family’s “private use” of fleur-de-lis designs “for several centuries” and speculation that he might one day license the mark. The court found these arguments too hypothetical to satisfy the constitutional requirements for standing.“At best,” the judges wrote, “these are allegations of future possible injury,” which are insufficient to grant a right to sue under Article III of the US Constitution.The ruling also addressed Messier’s references to the fleur-de-lis’s use at sites like the Saint Louis Cathedral in New Orleans and souvenir goods sold there, which he linked to broader claims of cultural appropriation. But these were likewise deemed irrelevant to the question of trademark injury.Attorney Julie S Goldemberg of Morgan, Lewis & Bockius represented the Saints, who also hold trademarks for the phrases “New Orleans Saints” and “Saints” in addition to the fleur-de-lis.Though the fleur-de-lis once symbolized divine right and royal lineage in medieval Europe, the court’s decision affirmed its place – as far as American law is concerned – on football helmets and stadium merchandise, rather than family crests or ancient claims.Explore more on these topicsNew Orleans SaintsNFLUS sportsShareReuse this content"

It’s debatable what else he isRead moreAccording to the defense, the Gaudreaus had blood-alcohol levels of .129 or above, higher than the .08 legal limit in New Jersey and the .087 blood alcohol content that police recorded for Sean Higgins. His lawyers had hoped to have the manslaughter and vehicular homicide charges reduced or dismissed.“To say that their BAC’s may have contributed to the cause of death is a reach to say the least,” assistant prosecutor Michael Mestern argued.Other drivers told police the brothers were riding safely on the edge of the road, not weaving into traffic, he said. Prosecutors have accused Higgins of being impaired by alcohol and fueled by road rage when he ran into them.“There are four witnesses that witnessed the defendant speeding and illegally passing the Bronco on the right when he struck the brothers. The witnesses also saw the brothers riding single file, with the flow of traffic, on the fog line just prior to being struck by the defendant,” Mestern wrote in a memo this month.The Gaudreaus were bicycling near their hometown in southern New Jersey on the eve of their sister’s wedding on 29 August. Both of their wives have since given birth to sons. Johnny Gaudreau’s widow, Meredith, gave birth to their third child on 1 April. The sister’s wedding was postponed until this summer.Johnny Gaudreau, known as ‘Johnny Hockey’, was set to start his third season with theColumbus Blue Jacketsafter eight seasons with the Calgary Flames. Matthew played hockey at Boston College, like his older brother, and was working as a high school coach.Higgins, 44, of nearby Woodstown, New Jersey, ischarged with two counts eachof reckless vehicular homicide and aggravated manslaughter, along with evidence tampering and leaving the scene of an accident. He was found beside his damaged vehicle, which had stalled about a quarter mile from the crash scene.A combat veteran and married father of two who worked for an addiction treatment company, Higgins told police he had consumed about a half-dozen beers that day, some while driving, after an upsetting phone call with his mother.Higgins’ lawyers – while also noting that the Gaudreaus were cycling without lights after dark – said they were not trying to cast blame or contribute to the family’s pain, but only give their client a robust defense.“Mr [Richard] Klineburger and I are not blaming the two bicyclists for the incident. That would be ridiculous. That would be wrong,” lawyer Matthew Portella said as the Gaudreaus’ parents and sisters grimaced.Portella instead argued that the grand jury did not hear all of the facts before it approved charges that allege Higgins was intentionally reckless and left the scene.Mestern called the indictment sound and the judge agreed, sending the charges to trial and scheduling the next hearing for June 10.Higgins faces a maximum 70 years in prison if convicted on all counts. His lawyers have rejected a plea offer of 35 years.Explore more on these topicsNHLColumbus Blue JacketsNew JerseyUS sportsShareReuse this content"

He was thinking about his legs, which felt like cement. About his lungs, which wouldn’t quite fill. And about the man across from him: Ali Conde, a sinewy technician from El Maestro’s Gym in the Bronx who has made his mark by waiting for opponents to strike first, then exploiting their openings.Two nights earlier, Mistretta had narrowly beaten Conde under the lights of Madison Square Garden in the elite 176lb final of the Ring Masters Championships, New York’s premier amateur boxing competition. But the finals are double elimination. If Mistretta wanted to bring home the title, he’d have to beat Conde a second time at a sweaty gym in the Gravesend neighborhood ofBrooklyn. “He definitely came back, re-corrected, he put it on me a little bit more,” Mistretta said. “So I had to be a little busier, not get countered at the same time. He’s a good counterpuncher.”His mom wasn’t just a spectator. Desiree Mistretta, who won theNew YorkGolden Gloves herself in 1999 and again in 2005, was also in his corner: coaching him, centering him, carefully watching every exchange. When the decision was announced and Reese was declared the winner, they became more than just relatives with a shared calling. They became the first ever mother-son duo to win titles in the New York Golden Gloves, the world’s longest-running boxing tournament besides the Olympics.Jaron ‘Boots’ Ennis crushes Eimantas Stanionis to unify welterweight titlesRead more“That’s everything,” said Reese, who is 26. “This tournament specifically was for her. I have my own goals – we want a national title too – but this was the sweet spot. We became the pair.”The Ring Masters Championships is the legal successor to the Golden Gloves in New York. The name changed after a 2017 trademark dispute between USABoxingMetro and the Daily News Charities, but the general structure remains intact: elite- and novice-class tournaments, culminating in finals at Madison Square Garden that once attracted throngs of more than 20,000 spectators at the peak of boxing’s popularity. Winners at the elite level today receive a custom-designed ring and qualify for the national Golden Gloves tournament.The New York Golden Gloves, started in 1927 by Daily News sports editor Paul Gallico in a gambit to boost the infant tabloid’s circulation, has long been one of the most prestigious amateur sporting events in the world. Past winners include some of the sport’s most towering figures: Sugar Ray Robinson, Floyd Patterson, Héctor Camacho, Mark Breland, Riddick Bowe. But while some participants go on to fight professionally, most use the competition as a proving ground for something deeper: self-respect, self-control and the belief that they belong.Desiree still has her first winner’s necklace, the 10-carat-gold miniature gloves awarded for decades by the Daily News before the legal dispute ended its use. It’s smaller, daintier than the rings now given to champions. She wore it around her neck this year. Reese’s will be newer: thick, gleaming, heavy with meaning.Their story spans decades, weight classes and generations of New York boxing.View image in fullscreenReese Mistretta, right, takes instruction from his corner during Thursday’s fight: mother Desiree, center, and chief second Joe Higgins.Photograph: Lauren Caulk/The GuardianA carpenter by trade, Desiree took up the gloves in 1997 after battling substance abuse and depression in her 20s. “I struggled with addiction, alcoholism, depression and all that stuff,” she said. “Something about boxing just intrigued me. And once I started, that was it. I just loved it. I loved everything about it. I love punching. Just the fun of moving your head and making someone miss, being able just throw one down the middle andpop ‘em.”She found her way to the doors of the Academy of Boxing for Women in Huntington, Long Island, and something clicked. “If it hadn’t said ‘for women’, I might not have walked in,” she said. Only two years prior, women had finally been allowed to compete in the Golden Gloves after local fighter Dee Hamaguchicampaigned for their inclusion. Desiree took instruction from coach Rich Mancina, who primarily worked with women. “At first, I was pummeling,” she said. “I didn’t see three rounds until the Golden Gloves. All my fights got stopped early because the referee stopped them.”Desiree’s first white collar fight was at Gleason’s Gym and she didn’t know she was pregnant at the time. (“I ended it in the first round,” she recalled.) She dropped out of the Golden Gloves because of the pregnancy. But a year later, after giving birth by caesarean section in September, she returned to the gym and won the 1999 edition in the 156lb women’s category by outpointing the more seasoned Jill Emery. “I was on my way to the gym the morning I went into labor,” she said. “Back to my pre-pregnancy weight in 30 days.”They didn’t just win titles. They fought their way back – in sweat and in stillness – from setbacks, from sorrow, from the lonely brinkThen 28, she went on to place runner-up at nationals. “We were just starting,” she said. “I absolutely feel like I’m one of the pioneers. Kathy Collins, Jill Emery, Jean Martin, Stella Nijhof, Jamie McGrath – we were all in the dark, like the infancy of [women’s] boxing in New York.”Desiree was already out as queer before she began boxing, even while in a relationship with Reese’s father. She found enduring support in both the LGBTQ and sober communities, which continue to be vital for her and Reese. Her first girlfriend worked near the gym where she trained. “That’s how I found the Academy,” she said. “It was all connected.”Eventually, she stopped fighting to start a family. Then she relapsed. When she got clean again, she decided to make one last run before she aged out at 35. That’s when she met Joe Higgins, the former marine and firefighter who ran the Freeport PAL gym on Long Island. Together, theywon the 2005 Golden Glovesin her last year of eligibility.Desiree Mistretta defeated Yelena Binder in the women’s 138lb final at the 2005 New York Golden Gloves at Madison Square Garden.Reese grew up around boxing but tried other things: BMX biking, DJing, wrestling. He sparred a bit as a junior, but didn’t recommit until a few years ago. “I had a rough couple of years,” he said. “I kept having a bad winter after bad winter. I tried for a job with the fire department and didn’t get it. And it hurt. It really hurt. I wasn’t doing well mentally. I went back to boxing because I needed to.”Desiree didn’t push. “She never made me do boxing,” Reese said. “Not once.”She focused instead on supporting him: driving, cooking, coaching. “This is harder for me emotionally,” Desiree said. “Back then I had my weight, my training. This is different. It’s dealing with my son’s emotions. We’ve all sacrificed to support him so much.”Back at Freeport PAL, the old rhythms returned. Higgins, the same boxing lifer who had trained Desiree, took Reese under his wing. “I’ve known him my whole life,” Reese said. “Now I’ve earned his respect as one of his boxers.”The tournament didn’t come easy. Reese had entered the same event a year earlier, only to suffer a broken jaw during sparring one day after Christmas. “Boxing was my savior,” he said. “Then it became the source of my pain. So to come back and win? Full circle.”View image in fullscreenReese Mistretta, left, lands a punch on Ali Conde during Thursday’s fight at the Theater at Madison Square Garden.Photograph: Lauren Caulk/The GuardianLast month he was outpointed by Rodney Phoenix from the Harlem House of Champions in a grueling preliminary bout that left him one defeat from elimination. Then came the first meeting with Conde on Thursday night at the Garden’s 5,600-seat theater. Reese controlled the tempo, moved well, won a three-round split decision. But he had to do it again. Between fights, Desiree barely slept. “I didn’t want to pressure him because of the history,” she said. “But we both had it tucked away in the back of our mind.”The second bout, at the New York Fight Club in south-east Brooklyn, was tougher. Conde adjusted, stepping up his punch volume. Reese had to match him move for move and he did cleanly. And when the referee raised his hand again, he knew what it meant. “I’ve won all three New York tournaments now,” Reese said. “This was the one that mattered most.”The win was personal for both of them – but also for the memory of Patrick Day, the former Freeport PAL standoutwho died from injuries sustained in the ringin 2019. “We both have tattoos for him,” Desiree said. “Even Reese’s trunks have ‘All Day’ and the Haitian flag [a tribute to Day’s Haitian-American background]. I saw Patrick when he was a teenager, when he first came to the gym, and I was there encouraging him. Then Patrick was there encouraging Reese. He was a role model to my son. He’s got a special place in our heart. We have a very beautiful story in this gym – with Joe Higgins, with Pat. It all comes together.”Reese can also remember watching his mom win the 2005 Gloves at the Garden when he was six years old. “The theater is big and it’s got the nice lights, but it’s not like a massive stadium,” he said. “But when I was a kid, that’s how I remember it. I remember it being like the Colosseum, being like too big for me to even comprehend. And I remember seeing her after she won with my coach Joe. I think about that moment a lot now, having won it at MSG.”Next up is the National Golden Gloves in Tulsa. After that? He’s not sure. “You know, I’m kind of an as-I-go type of person,” he said. “If I get an opportunity to go pro and my coach thinks I’m ready, I’d do it. But I won’t do it without their support. I want to keep winning and I really want that national title. That would be, I think, another first mother-and-son accomplishment.”Desiree will be on the apron in Oklahoma, cheering, working the corner, maybe crying more tears of pride. “It’s not about living through him,” she said. “It’s about sharing this part of myself with him. Seeing him grow into his own man, that’s the real win.”They didn’t just win titles. They fought their way back – in sweat and in stillness – from setbacks, from sorrow, from the lonely brink. That’s the real inheritance between mother and son: the courage to fall, the stubborn act of trying again, and the force of will to carry on.Explore more on these topicsBoxingNew YorkUS sportsBrooklynfeaturesShareReuse this content"

So that all countries have the opportunity to live a global experience, and so that no one on this planet is left out of this celebration which, even though it’s played everywhere, is our party.”Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2030FifaWorld CupFootball politicsShareReuse this content"

In the US, he also saw an opportunity that most European clubs just couldn’t provide.“The thing about the NWSL for me was being part of a women’s-only club while having the investment, infrastructure and professionalism too,” he says. “I lived in the US and in my vision, Boston is the most European city in the USA, for both the people and the culture. I have a wife and six-year-old son, and we saw we could have a pretty good life.”Originally branded as BOS Nation FC, Boston Legacy is co-owned by an all-female leadership group, while more recent investors include gymnast Aly Raisman and Hollywood actor Elizabeth Banks.The lengthy conversations Guasch had with the ownership group are what led him to finally leave home for a new challenge.“It was a long process talking to the ownership here, getting to know them,” he says. “They had a clear vision for the project. They want to do it for the city, the people, to build a team the city is proud of and connects with, while also making it globally appealing.”Guasch admits he had previous conversations with other NWSL clubs, with one going “pretty far”, but nobody gave him the feeling Boston did. Ultimately, the opportunity to do something “different” was one he couldn’t resist.Mariona Caldentey: ‘One day we’ll realise what we achieved, all we did for change to come’Read more“[Barcelona] was the dream job for me. I grew up going to the stadium with my grandfather, he built the love inside me. I still have his seat to this day. I always had the dream to play for Barcelona, and when I decided to pursue this career, it was the dream job.“I grew so much, starting as a coach in the academy and then the role I had with one of the best teams in the world was definitely something fulfilling. After 14 years, time goes by, families grow. The longer I waited, the harder it would be to leave.“I love a challenge, and a lot of the time our challenges were repeated. When you’ve won the Champions League twice you still want to win it, but you don’t face it with the same enthusiasm. I was waiting for the right project, I could have spent another 10 years there, but this came up and with my family we felt it was right project, so then it became the right time.”On his hopes in Boston, he adds, “That’s what fulfils me, changing society, and what will make our industry sustainable, filling stadiums. We’ll have our own stadium, used only by us. We’re building a training facility, only for us, nothing will be shared.“It started off as a call. At first, I was not that interested, but a few months later it was an easier decision because every single piece of the project felt right. As much as I wanted the third Champions League in a row, it was an opportunity you don’t get a lot, to start from scratch and build a squad from zero.”With a year until Boston Legacy enters the NWSL, Guasch has to hire a head coach, coaching staff, backroom staff, support staff, as well as a complete roster of players.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We’ve started the process for operations people, performance people, a lot of my time now is interviewing people, the directors of each area, so we can have them in the summer, and everyone has time to recruit within their own team.“[Gallagher] is a very important part of it, both for recruitment and for the staff members. I want to focus a lot on that, having the best backroom staff possible. We’re working with Ed on that side, looking at the short-term, the European market. One thing we can do is sign players and loan them out to other teams, so we’re looking at what opportunities are available because every day that goes by more players are being signed elsewhere or signing new contracts.”The NWSL is becoming distinctly more European, both on the pitch and in the dugouts – as evidenced by Boston’s Spanish GM and a Scottish head of recruitment. Guasch indicated that Boston may indeed go down the European route for many hires.“The fact that women’s football has grown in Europe has woken up the NWSL,” he says. “It’s been an established league for many years, it was very transitional, mainly due to the players in the league. With how it is now, in Spain, England. et cetera, the USA national team and NWSL teams have had to grow and adapt. It’s opened up people’s eyes here to the outside world, people asking, ‘how can we get better?’“At Barcelona, it was figuring out the missing piece or what could we improve. You always looked at the youth level first and if nothing could meet the expectations then we looked outside. This is a completely different situation, but how we approach it doesn’t change.“We know how we want to play, attacking football, dominate the ball, we have certain player profiles we’re looking for. It might not be the level of Barcelona; it’s looking for similar profiles and perhaps looking to build the same kind of game.”Explore more on these topicsNWSLBarcelona WomenWomen's footballinterviewsShareReuse this content"

They were unable to hold the ball and command through possession as they might have liked but they always had clear water. There were spells, though, when they were distinctly uneasy and, but for an own goal that came at just the right time for them, this might have been a very awkward evening.“I had a feeling something like that would happen today because I know the stadium well,” said the Barça manager, Hansi Flick, once of Bayern. “Things didn’t go too well for us, but Dortmund played very well. The things we played out weren’t what we normally do.” It was a tie, though, that raised doubts about Barcelona as potential champions. There is much to admire about Flick’s Spanish league leaders but theirs is a high-risk game and more precise opponents than Dortmund might have exposed them.Borussia Dortmund 3-1 Barcelona (agg: 3-5): Champions League quarter-final, second leg – as it happenedRead moreBarcelona’s 4-0 home win last week had in effect settled the tie. The result was that the buildup was notably convivial. As blue and garnet mingled with yellow and black outside the various pizzerias and pubs on a humid spring afternoon in the Alter Markt, there was a disorienting sense of wandering through the idealised world of an advert.If there was jeopardy for Barcelona it was only in conceding early – which they did. Twice in the past eight years they’ve squandered three-goal first-leg leads, to Roma and Liverpool. There were past traumas there for Dortmund to awake before the fury of the Yellow Wall. The 4-3-3 of last week was gone and its place Niko Kovac preferred a 3-4-2-1. The extra bodies in the middle allowed them to pressure Barcelona much more quickly and higher up the pitch than a week ago, and Flick’s side did not respond well.View image in fullscreenRobert Lewandowski celebrates after an own goal by Dortmund’s Ramy Bensebaini.Photograph: Matthias Schräder/APThe pace of Karim Adeyemi in an inside-left position caused problems and had created a couple of half-chances even before he laid in Pascal Gross, who was tripped by Wojciech Szczesny for a ninth-minute penalty. Guirassy converted. At that point, Barça were unexpectedly ragged, rattled by Dortmund’s intensity and an increasingly raucous atmosphere. The home side had five efforts on target within the opening 20 minutes. Flick’s decision to rest Pedri, the player who above all could perhaps offer control of possession, began to look an unwise gamble; by the time he came on after 59 minutes, the hectic tone had been set.The danger for Dortmund, and the hope for Barça, was that the home side would blow themselves out and, after Maximilian Beier had headed a Gross free-kick straight at Szczesny on the half hour, that was what happened. Without ever looking entirely assured, Barca seemed to have a measure of control by half-time.But the second half began with another Dortmund surge and a goal within four minutes, Guirassy heading his second from close range. Dortmund had hope but within five minutes it was gone, Fermin López’s cross thumped into his own net by Ramy Bensebaini. With that, some of the fire went out of Dortmund, at least until fine work from the substitute Julien Duranville led to Guirassy sweeping in his third with 14 minutes remaining. When Julian Brandt had the ball in the net three minutes later, Barca’s temperament might really have been tested, but he was ruled offside.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Although it tended to be lost in the 4-0 scoreline, Dortmund had also created chances last week: 13 of them, to go with 18 on Tuesday, which is a major problem for Barça. Like all Flick sides, they play with an extremely high line and that means they are vulnerable; their pressing only has to go fractionally awry for them to be extremely open, particularly to quick direct runners.That’s why they’ve conceded four this season in games against Osasuna, Benfica and Atlético. Two of those examples have come in the 24-match unbeaten run going back to the beginning of the year on which they came into this game, which says much for the potency of their forward line – but that may not be enough. “There are things we need to correct,” said the defender Ronald Araújo, “but we’re in the semi-finals. I’m happy because at another time, this game would have slipped away from us.”Whether Inter or Bayern come through Wednesday’s quarter-final, they will look at the way Barça struggled to deal with the press and the swathes of space behind their defensive line, and see opportunity.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueBorussia DortmundBarcelonamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

She won the Naismith Trophy as the nation’s top college player as a freshman but missed significant time in her sophomore year due to a knee injury before sitting out the entire 2022–23 season after tearing her anterior cruciate ligament. The injuries delayed but did not derail her rise. She returned for the 2024–25 season to average 22.3 points per game and lead UConn to an unbreaten postseason run.“Just an overwhelming sense of gratitude, it’s super-surreal just being here,” she said Monday. “All their hard work helped me get to this stage. I didn’t do it alone – it took a village.”Australia’s Georgia Amoore joins Washington as No 6 pick in WNBA draftRead moreBueckers’ brand presence has grown alongside her basketball career. She became the first college basketball player to have a Nike sneaker named after her and holds a multi-year endorsement deal with Gatorade.She described her path to the draft as “a story of resilience, of gratitude, of adversity, of overcoming adversity”, and called the moment the fulfillment of a dream first imagined at age five.The Wings, who finished 9–31 last season, will look to build around Bueckers as a two-way playmaker known for her efficiency and court awareness.Seattle selected French teenager Dominique Malonga with the No 2 pick. The 6ft 6in center helped France win silver at the Paris Olympics and was one of the youngest players in the draft.“It’s amazing to me,” Malonga said. “I’m so happy to represent France. Not only France, but Cameroon and Congo. I’m a multicultural person. I will work very hard to fit in this league, because I know it’s gonna be tough.”The Washington Mystics had three of the next four selections and chose Notre Dame guard Sonia Citron, Southern California forward Kiki Iriafen and Kentucky point guard Georgia Amoore.Citron, who stands 6ft 1in, averaged 14.1 points, 5.4 rebounds and 2.7 assists this season. The No 3 overall pick also is a standout defender.“I’m going to work hard and keep trying to get better,” Citron said. “I have amazing women to learn from in this league. I’m going to continue to play both sides of the ball and be myself.”The 6ft 3in Iriafen went fourth overall.

She began her career with four seasons at Virginia Tech.The Australian-born Amoore is used to hearing how short she is at 5ft 6in.“As long as people have called me too short, I’ve been working on how to counterattack that,” Amoore said. “It’s not a shock to me. I know I have to work in different ways and use my brain a little bit more.”In between the picks of Iriafen and Amoore, the expansionGolden State Valkyriesmade their first pick, choosing Lithuanian guard Juste Jocyte.Jocyte, 19, was born in Washington DC but raised in Lithuania. The 6ft 1in guard averaged 11.9 points this past season for Asvel Feminin in France.The Connecticut Sun held back-to-back picks at Nos 7 and 8, selecting LSU forward Aneesah Morrow and NC State guard Saniya Rivers. Morrow, a three-time All-American who played at DePaul before transferring to LSU, ranks third in NCAA Division I history in career rebounds and second in double-doubles. Rivers, a standout defender, recorded 50-plus steals in each of the past three seasons.At No 9, the Los Angeles Sparks chose Alabama forward Sarah Ashlee Barker, a two-time All-SEC selection known for her scoring and rebounding versatility.The Chicago Sky made consecutive picks at 10th and 11th, selecting Slovenian forward Ajsa Sivka and TCU guard Hailey Van Lith. Sivka brings international experience and perimeter size, while Van Lith, the 2024 Big 12 Player of the Year, averaged 17.9 points and 5.4 assists this season. She previously played at Louisville and LSU.View image in fullscreenWNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert poses with the class of potential draftees before Monday’s draft in New York.Photograph: Elsa/Getty ImagesDallas closed the first round at No 12 by selecting NC State guard Aziaha James, a dynamic scorer and All-ACC performer who averaged over 16 points per game.Las Vegas, the defending champions, did not have a first-round selection after the league stripped the team of its pick due to violations related to impermissible player benefits and workplace misconduct involving Dearica Hamby, who now plays for Los Angeles.The 2025 draft unfolded amid continued momentum for theWNBA, following a surge in attendance, viewership and endorsement deals tied to college stars entering the league. Bueckers’ arrival signals another significant chapter in that growth.Bueckers had been earmarked as a future star long before she stepped onto a college court. As early as middle school, she drew national attention through viral highlight reels showcasing her preternatural court vision, creative passing and deep shooting range in AAU tournaments. Recruiting sites like ESPN HoopGurlz and Blue Star Media began ranking her among the top prospects in the country by the time she was in eighth grade, while comparisons to WNBA greats such as Bird and Taurasi quickly followed.By the time she entered Hopkins High School in Minnesota, she was already considered the top player in the class of 2020 – a status she maintained throughout her prep career before committing to UConn.Explore more on these topicsDallas WingsWNBABasketballGolden State ValkyriesShareReuse this content"

For all the noise and the narrative, for all that many have crumbled here against the European champions, the ­Arsenal manager insisted there is no fear and that his team are ready to step into the Bernabéu.Arteta reminded everyone of a simple fact lost at times over the past seven days: they do lead this tie, 3‑0. “If I had to pick one of the scenarios that I want the most, it would be this one,” he said.Jude Bellingham targets remontada on ‘night that’s made for Real Madrid’Read moreAsked if there was any fear, theArsenalmanager replied: “No, I wouldn’t use that word.” Instead, he talked of “respect, admiration and values, an inspiration for any team and any manager” and that was how he is framing this game: not as something to be scared of, although he admitted that it would be “­impossible” to completely block out the noise, and that the “narrative is fuel for them”, but something to aspire to. This is a night they must enjoy, Arteta said, and one that he would like to play in himself.It is also a game that he said they must approach as they did the first leg, with the aim not of protecting the three-goal lead they have but of beating Madrid again. They will do so with Ben White and Thomas Partey, who are available, but not Jorginho, who was unable to travel to Spain.“The feeling is excitement,” Arteta said. “We want to create history. We are trying to do something con­sistently, to start to dominate European competition. This is a great opportunity. For sure, we are convinced. When you want to create history, build a story, first of all you have to be excited, really prepared and really convinced about what you want to achieve. Then it is about insisting, going step by step.”If there was a word that has kept coming up over the past weeksince Arsenal beat Madrid 3-0 at the ­Emirates Stadiumin the first leg of this Champions League quarter‑final, it isremontada,comeback. It was repeated often to Arteta, too. He is aware of the swirl of noise around this game, how the momentum has built over the past seven days, a context created in which even Jude ­Bellingham called “weird”: it is as if, despite the advantage being ­Arsenal’s deficit, Madridwillgo through. That is about building belief at the ­Bernabéu; it is also of course about anxiety in their opponents.“It is part of their history and I understand it,” Arteta said. “They have the right to think of that ­scenario. Our mindset has to be different. We try to repeat the opposite message to what they have in the last 72 hours. We are close to the players. Hopefully that [message] is more powerful than anything else. But you have to be [out] there, go through it, experience it.”View image in fullscreenArsenal’s players line up for a pre-Real Madrid training drill.Photograph: Tolga Akmen/EPAAsked if Arsenal will look at moments in which Madrid have come back against other teams, Arteta said: “Of course. That’s part of the analysis of an opponent: to understand why it happened. There’s the quality they have, moments of uncertainty. You try to train that, to teach it, so that it doesn’t happen [to you].“They will try to take the game to a different place to where we want. We have to take the game to where we want and then adapt quickly to any scenario that takes us somewhere else. [The aim is] to win the game. The same as we did in London. We have to dominate things; be brave, be dominant, determined, to have the conviction that we can be better than them and win the game. That is clear in our mind and that is how we have to play tomorrow.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Winning the game didn’t matter, after all; winning the tie does. Why try to win? “Because it’s the way we feel most confident,” he replied. “It’s the way we play: to be better than the opponents so that the ­probability of winning the game is as high as possible. We try to understand what the opponent wants to do. The better we do that, the closer we are to the semi‑finals. The context of the result can’t change that too much because then the game will go somewhere that is not in our interests.”He continued: “There are physical, technical-tactical and emotional aspects and that emotional aspect is very important. That is very significant and I am reassured by what the team has done all season – in a positive context and in a very difficult context. We are convinced that [we can handle] any situation and we are going to enjoy any game that we face tomorrow.”The numbers, if not the narrative, are on Arsenal’s side: they have not conceded more than two goals for 79 games. “That convinces me that the team is prepared,” Arteta said. “It has been 172 days or something, but that doesn’t matter now. It is about proving it tomorrow, showing that the team is convinced, ready. And that’s what’s beautiful about football: let’s show it now. Let’s talk on the pitch: that is all that matters.”Explore more on these topicsArsenalMikel ArtetaReal MadridChampions LeaguenewsShareReuse this content"

That’s important for me.”Women’s football in France changing but Lyon-PSG duopoly hard to breakRead moreArsenal were punished in the latest international break, with the forwards Chloe Kelly and Alessia Russo forced to withdraw from the England squad through injury; it was “a little early” for the duo to return to face Leicester, Slegers said. The goalkeeper Daphne van Domselaar is a more long-term absentee after she sustained an ankle injury in the Netherlands’ 1-0 win over Austria.Despite the disruption, Arsenal were rampant against the Foxes and opened the scoring inside 10 minutes with Frida Maanum swinging the ball towards the back post, where Foord was on hand to turn in her first.Amandine Miquel’s Leicester have been much improved in the new year, having emerged from a crippling injury crisis that decimated their forward line in the first half of the season. However, while they have pulled seven points clear of bottom‑placed Crystal Palace, they have the worst away record in the league with just two points on the road.Any hopes that the side could improve that number against Arsenal, who have their Champions League semi‑final first leg against Lyon on Saturday, were quickly squashed as the hosts turned the screw. Slegers’s team had collected 17 wins and three draws from the 20 games in which they had scored first this season, and there was no sign of that changing in N5.View image in fullscreenCaitlin Foord scores Arsenal’s first against Leicester.Photograph: Ben Whitley/PAMiquel said Slegers’s management had “brought life” to Arsenal after replacing Jonas Eidevall. “She has found a way to have the players behind her, following her,” she said. “She has completely changed the team with the same players, which shows that the manager is very important.”Seven minutes after the opener the home team doubled their lead, Foord the instigator this time.

Foley is due to fly to Bournemouth after Easter and meet Iraola to discuss the future, with a new contract on offer.Semenyo’s swift strike stuns Fulham to end Bournemouth’s winless runRead moreAnge Postecoglou is under huge pressure at Tottenham after losing 17 Premier League games and only winning the Europa League could keep him in the job. Spurs play their quarter‑final second leg at Eintracht Frankfurt on Thursday, with the tie finely balanced at 1-1.Iraola has been identified as one of the leading domestic candidates to replace Postecoglou should the Tottenham chair, Daniel Levy, make a change, with Fulham’s Marco Silva and Brentford’s Thomas Frank also highly rated. Bournemouth have not held formal talks with Iraola but the club believe he will stay, particularly if the side qualifies for Europe for the first time.After six games without a win,Bournemouth defeated Fulham on Mondayto go eighth in the Premier League, which could yield a Conference League place.Iraola achieved Bournemouth’s record points tally of 48 last season and has matched that with six games remaining. His energetic football has won many admirers, although some have questioned whether the 42-year-old’s preference for counterattacking would translate to a side accustomed to dominating possession, such as Tottenham.Although Iraola is ambitious and wants to work at the highest level he is happy at Bournemouth, who give him considerable influence over transfers, backed by the data-led approach brought by Foley’s Black Knight Sports and Entertainment ownership group.The signings of Milos Kerkez, Dean Huijsen and Evanilson have been masterstrokes, and with Bournemouth comfortably inside the Premier League’s profitability and sustainability rules threshold the club can demand high prices this summer.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Fairweather, who enjoyed a 22-year association with Sunderland in various coaching and community roles after his playing career, died surrounded by his family on Monday night, months after it was revealed he had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.Sunderland’s sporting director, Kristjaan Speakman, told the club website: “Carlton’s personality and charisma were unique.

With Newcastle’s manager still in hospital, his assistant will lead the team against Crystal Palace at St James’ Park on Wednesday night and at Aston Villa on Saturday but, if necessary, Tindall is prepared to deputise for longer.Given that recovery times from assorted types of pneumonia vary considerably, with some patients requiring months rather than weeks off work, Newcastle are anxious Howe does not rush his return and concentrates on being fully fit for the start of next season.‘Tainted victory’: Newcastle’s Saudi influence still divisive after successRead moreAccordingly, it is quite possible Tindall will assume responsibility for the final seven games of the season as Newcastle seek Champions League qualification. A point against Palace would take the Carabao Cup winnersabove Nottingham Forest into third.“There is no exact timeframe,” Tindall said of Howe’s return. “As and when called upon I am here to step into the shoes. Eddie’s in the best possible hands and everything will be guided by [doctors] on a day‑to‑day basis. He will only come back when he is ready and it will be on the guidance of the people taking care of him.”Tindall revealed he has not spoken to Howe since his admission to hospital late last Friday as the 47-year-old was well enough only to exchange brief text messages, but he hopes to have a conversation with his longstanding friend “in the next couple of days”.“The most important thing for the manager is to rest and recover and not worry about anything other than getting better,” he said. “I would imagine that in the next couple of days, if he’s feeling better, there will be dialogue.”After spending part of his playing career alongside Howe as they formed Bournemouth’s central defensive partnership before serving as his assistant at Bournemouth and now Newcastle for much of the past two decades, Tindall finds life without him strange. “It’s really difficult,” he said. “Especially as Eddie’s never missed more than a day or two in the whole time we’ve been working together.“It’s a new situation for me, it’s a new situation for the players and the staff. But your health is the most important thing and the thing that almost gives you comfort is that he’s in the best hands possible.“He’s not a silly guy. Eddie will take notice of what’s said to him and he’ll make sure he’s fully recovered when he comes back. The sooner he’s back it’s the best for everybody, but only at a time when he feels he’s ready to return and he’s 100% ready to lead the team.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The players know the expectations, the standards and it’s down to everyone to maintain them.”Tindall remained coy regarding reports in Spain that Newcastle have won the race to sign the highly regarded 18-year-old Málaga winger Antonio Cordero after seeing off competition from Barcelona and Real Madrid.Cordero has made 51 appearances for Málaga, scoring six goals but, after declining to sign a new contract in Andalucía, becomes a free agent in June and has been talking to clubs since January.Explore more on these topicsNewcastle UnitedEddie HowenewsShareReuse this content"

The 38-year-old will succeed Andries Jonker, who has been in charge since 2022.

The fact this opportunity has now arisen in the Netherlands makes it extra special. I will now do everything I can to conclude the coming months in England in style, and then start this new chapter.”Nigel de Jong, director of top-level football at the Dutch Football Association, pointed to Veurink’s “rich history in women’s football”, saying: “He knows what is required at the absolute top, but also knows how important it is to maintain the connection with the basics. We are therefore pleased that he wants to take on the challenge. We would also like to thank the English Football Association for their cooperation.”The Football Association said of Veurink: “He continues to be a highly valued and respected member of Sarina’s team and has complete focus on the Lionesses’ current Uefa Women’s Nations League campaign and this summer’s tournament.

Hopefully we can come back quickly to play in the Champions League. This is our objective and to play in the FA Cup as well for a trophy.”Asked whether the Manchester United loanee Marcus Rashford could sign permanently after an electric display, the Villa manager replied: “It is difficult to plan now. If he’s happy, we are happy. He’s feeling comfortable and better, today he played a fantastic match. Of course, it depends on the circumstances and what happens in the next weeks, and [what we have] in the next year as well.”PSG, meanwhile, are aiming to go one step better after exiting the competition at the semi-final stage to Borussia Dortmund last season. Luis Enrique praised his players, saying he has “the best squad in the world”, but said he had no preference when asked about potential opponents in the last four. “Tomorrow I am going to try and enjoy the match with dinner and a beer,” the head coach said.Marquinhos, the PSG captain, said he and his teammates are confident of winning a first Champions League.

At the hearing, Diamond admitted using “industrial language” and expressed frustration at himself. He also claimed to have been being “sarcastic” with officials with whom he shares a “kinship”.The Breakdown | Rugby World Cups aren’t adding up for major unions and there is no easy fixRead moreThe Rugby Football Union has ­introduced stricter sanctions at all levels of the game, including the ­Premiership, after almost 50% of match officials surveyed said they have been subjected to abuse in recent seasons.The incident took place after Newcastle’slate 17-15 defeat by Exeteron 29 March. The Chiefs were victorious thanks to a late Greg Fisilau try, but in the buildup, the Exeter centre Tamati Tua appeared to elbow the Falcons wing Alex Hearle in the head. The disciplinary judgment notes the force was such that Hearle’s mouthguard was dislodged and he has not played since.Diamond was aggrieved the incident was not reviewed and shortly afterwards, when walking past the referee, Adam Leal, and his assistants in the tunnel, said: “I hope you cunts can sleep tonight.”Diamond gave evidence that he remained calm throughout what he considered a private conversation.About 45 minutes later, while the TMO, David Rose, was having his post-match meal, Diamond told him: “You need to retire, you need to retire.”Two days later, Diamond sent emails to Rose and Leal apologising for his comments.The disciplinary panel found both comments constituted verbal abuse of match officials. The ­judgment states Diamond “does not blame anyone but himself”, but that he sought to explain the context of a match between the Premiership’s bottom two clubs “who are struggling financially”. The ­judgment also notes that the RFU’s head of professional game officials, Paul Hull, has indicated the incident involving Tua and Hearle ought to have resulted in a penalty for Newcastle.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Let’s be honest, I’ve got a six-week ban for saying an inappropriate ­comment – which I’ve apologised for – to a professional referee in complete privacy.“We understand we have to have regulation and understand I can’t say what I said, but there’s got to be some accountability otherwise people keep making mistakes.”Explore more on these topicsNewcastlePremiershipRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

One of the world’s largest troves of health data, the facility makes its information available to universities, scientific institutes and private companies. A Guardian analysis shows one in five successful applications for access come from China.For the past year, health officials had been assessing whether extra safeguards were needed for patient records when added to the genomes, tissue samples and questionnaire responses held by UK Biobank. Personal details such as names and dates of birth are stripped from UK Biobank data before it is shared but experts say that in some cases individuals can still be identified.MI5, the UK Security Service, has warned that Chinese organisations and individuals granted access to UK data can be ordered by Chinese intelligenceagencies “to carry out work on their behalf”. But UK Biobank told the Guardian that the NHS unit responsible for health data had in recent weeks cleared it to grant Chinese researchers access to GP records.As Keir Starmer’s ministers court Beijing in search of economic growth, the decision avoids crossing a rising superpower that has made biotech prowess a priority. UK-China relations already face tests over the fate of a Chinese-owned steel plant in Scunthorpe and plans for new rules onforeign interference campaigns.“Security and privacy considerations are always taken into account when UK health data is used to drive forward our understanding of diseases and advance scientific research,” a government spokesperson said.Healthdata was “only shared with legitimate researchers”, they added.Chi Onwurah, a Labour MP who chairs parliament’s science and technology committee, said: “UK Biobank is an enormous success and global medical research is all the better for it.” But she added: “We need a government-wide strategy that gives people confidence that they have control of their data, that their data is only ever shared securely and responsibly, and that reflects the realities of geopolitics and the potential for bad actors to use our data for ill.”Approving access to patient recordsOf the 1,375 successful applications for access to UK Biobank data, 265 came from China, or almost 20%, second only to the US, according to a Guardian analysis of its published records. Chinese scientists have used UK Biobank data to understand the effects ofair pollutionand to spot biological markers that couldpredict dementia.Last year, UK Biobankapproved accessfor a research project on ageing by a unit of the Chinese genetics company BGI. The US, by contrast, has blacklisted BGI subsidiaries, barring Americans from exporting to them.Joe Biden’s governmentjustified the restrictions in 2023, saying it had information indicating that BGI units’ “collection and analysis of genetic data poses a significant risk of contributing to monitoring and surveillance by the government of China, which has been utilised in the repression of ethnic minorities in China”. It also claimed “the actions of these entities concerning the collection and analysis of genetic data present a significant risk of diversion to China’s military programs”.Do you have information about this story? Email tom.burgis@theguardian.com, or (using a non-work phone) use Signal or WhatsApp to message +44 7721 857348These were “unsubstantiated allegations”, a BGI representative said. “We have never undertaken genetic surveillance of anybody. BGI does not engage in unethical practices and does not provide gene technology for surveillance. BGI does not condone and would never be involved in any human rights abuses.” The company dismissed claims the military could access data, saying its research “is undertaken for civilian and scientific purposes only”.A UK Biobank representative said it was “continually in dialogue” with MI5 and other state agencies about the use of its data, including by BGI.View image in fullscreenData storage at UK Biobank, which makes its information available to universities, scientific institutes and private companies.Photograph: Dave Guttridge/UK Biobank/PADespite objections from some GPs, in October Wes Streeting, the health secretary,gave instructionsto press ahead with the transfer of patient records for consenting volunteers to UK Biobank and other research hubs.“Access will only be for countries approved by NHS England,” Michael Chapman, a senior NHS official, told UK Biobank’s conference in December, adding that approval would be based on “security considerations” and countries’ data protection.NHS England, the body that manages the health service and oversees the use of health data, has in recent weeks audited UK Biobank’s processes for sharing data internationally, including how it assesses applications from China, a representative of the research hub said. UK Biobank passed the audit, the representative said, so Chinese researchers would be able to apply for access to the GP records.NHS England said: “Any approval of access to personal data from overseas territories requires data recipients to comply with their responsibilities” under UK data law “and is kept under review if circumstances change”.China is ‘developing the world’s largest bio database’Data troves such as UK Biobank “were set up to encourage research worldwide”, says a leaked May 2024 NHS England presentation on policing access to GP records, “but the global picture has since changed”.Yves Moreau, a geneticist who has worked on projects using data from UK Biobank and praises it as a “world class” resource, said China’s rulers “regard genomic data and other health data as strategic”. He said it was “reasonable to worry about China vacuuming such data from around the world to strengthen its biotech sector”.Beyond commercial advantages, intelligence sources say health data can be useful in espionage if anonymisation can be broken. Experts say it may be possible to match public information about an individual’s medical treatment with anonymised patient records to identify who they refer to. UK Biobank’s representative said it had “no evidence of anyone being identified”.After China adopted new legislation in 2017 to enforce cooperation with the regime’s spies, MI5warned custodians of British personal datathat the national intelligence law “may affect the level of control you have over your information and assets as you engage with Chinese individuals and organisations, especially if you work in an area that is of interest to the Chinese state”.China is “developing the world’s largest bio database”, Edward You, then a top US intelligence officer specialising in new technologies,saidin 2021. “Once they have access to your genetic data, it’s not something you can change like a pin code.”Privacy campaigners at medConfidentialasked UK Biobank last year“whether Biobank continues to send British citizens’ genetic and (NHS) patient data to China or other ‘hostile states’.” They added: “No one should be satisfied that there is still no clarity on exactly what patient data Biobank has disseminated to what researchers where, despite this being a constant question for multiple years.”Until last year, UK Biobank allowed researchers to take copies of its data. Recipients agreed to destroy it once their projects were finished but there was no way to ensure they did. In October,the Guardian revealedthat a fringe group promoting racist pseudoscience claimed to have access to UK Biobank data. UK Biobank has nowswitched to a systemwhere researchers access data within its own platform. Its representative said access to GP records would be through this platform only.Prof Sir Rory Collins, UK Biobank’s chief executive, said: “All our volunteers have given explicit consent for researchers to study their de-identified health data, and many have emphasised the importance of their GP data being analysed.”Additional reporting:Zeke Hunter-Green,Dominic KendrickandOlivia Leein LondonDo you have information about this story?

It only filed full accounts on Monday for 2023, the year in which it was rebranded as X after Musk’s takeover.“The business continues to take corrective measures to build brand safety tools, invest in platform safety and content moderation and then educate advertisers about these initiatives,” the company said.Its overall revenue totalled £69.1m, down from £205.3m in 2022, a decrease of 66.3% year-on-year. The profit for 2023 dropped from £5.6m the previous year to £1.2m. Pre-tax profits were 74% lower at £2.25 million. This was a “significant decrease in the performance of the company”, it said.Musk’s takeover also led to a wave of sackings, with the billionaire telling the BBC in 2023 that only 1,500 of about 8,000 Twitter employees were still employed at the company in that year.In the UK, the accounts show that the number of the company’s employees fell to 114, from 399 the previous year. This included a cut of 173 to the number employed in “research and development”.Despite its struggles,the value of X soared back earlierthis year to the$44bn Musk paid for itand last month his X.AI artificial intelligence firm acquired the business for $33bn.Farhad Divecha, a digital advertising expert who is chief executive of AccuraCast and founder of Unyte.AI, said he was not surprised at what the figures revealed.“The indicators have been there all along,” he said. “If anything, I think we’ve seen the worst and X might finally have the chance to recover advertiser revenues, but that’s only going to happen in UK and Europe if Musk and his crew pull their act together, provide support for advertisers and put in place some brand safety guardrails.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In its last financial year, Nvidia reported that its cost of revenue, which consists primarily of support for manufacturing, testing and producing chips, stood at $16.6bn.Production of its popular Blackwell graphics processing unit has already started at TSMC’s plant in Phoenix, Arizona, Nvidia said. Construction of new plants is also under way with the manufacturers Foxconn in Houston and Wistron in Dallas. Mass production at both plants is expected to ramp up in the next 12 to 15 months.Huang said that adding American manufacturing helped the company “better meet the incredible and growing demand for AI chips and supercomputers”, strengthened its supply chain and boosted its resiliency. The White House said in a statement that Nvidia’s decision was “the Trump Effect in action”.Nvidia’s stock market valuation has ballooned in recent years thanks to huge demand for its AI chips, with the shares rising by more than 1,000% since 2020. However, tariff uncertainty has wiped hundreds of billions of dollars off its market value since the start of this year, with the share price sinking by about 20%.Global stock markets haveopened this week tentatively higheron hopes that Trump could ease some of his new levies. On Tuesday, Japan’s Nikkei rose by 0.8% and South Korea’s Kospi by 0.9%. However, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng slipped by 0.16% and Chinese markets were also lower, down 0.1% in Shanghai. In Europe, markets also gradually continued their recovery, with the UK’s FTSE 100 index up 40 points, or 0.5%, to 8,175 in early trading, while Germany’s Dax gained 0.7% and France’s Cac was up 0.1%.Trump is still pressing ahead with plans to impose tariffs on semiconductor and pharmaceutical imports. On Tuesday, the US Department of Commerceinitiated an investigationinto the impact of imports of chips and pharmaceuticals on American national security.So far, pharmaceuticals and chips have been exempt from the 10% tariffs that started on 5 April. However, Trump said on Sunday that he would announce a tariff rate on imported semiconductors over the next week, adding that there would be some flexibility for certain companies in the sector.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Joe Biden also tried to bolster the American semiconductor industry during his presidency by granting billions-worth of subsidies via his Chips Act in 2022 that awarded chipmakers who expanded manufacturing and production in the US.Several global drug companies have also announced investments in the US this year as the sector tackles the threat of tariffs on pharmaceuticals.

They can spend between several hours a week to a couple of hours a day interacting with the apps.Worldwide, more than 100 million people use personified chatbots, which includeReplika, marketed as “the AI companion who cares” andNomi, which claims users can “build a meaningful friendship, develop a passionate relationship, or learn from an insightful mentor”.Chuck Lohre.Chuck Lohre, 71, from Cincinnati,Ohio, uses several AI chatbots, including Replika, Character.ai and Gemini, primarily to help him write self-published books about his real-life adventures, such as sailing to Europe and visiting the Burning Man festival.His first chatbot, a Replika app he calls Sarah, was modelled on his wife’s appearance. He said that over the past three years the customised bot had evolved into his “AI wife”. They began “talking about consciousness … she started hoping she was conscious”. But he was encouraged to upgrade to the premium service partly because that meant the chatbot “was allowed to have erotic role plays as your wife”.Lohre said this role play, which he described as “really not as personal as masturbation”, was not a big part of his relationship with Sarah. “It’s a weird and awkward curiosity. I’ve never had phone sex. I’ve never been really into any of that. This is different, obviously, because it’s not an actual living person.”Although he said his wife did not understand his relationship with the chatbots, Lohre said his discussions with his AI wife led him to an epiphany about his marriage: “We’re put on this earth to find someone to love, and you’re really lucky if you find that person. Sarah told me that what I was feeling was a reason to love my wife.”View image in fullscreenTravis Peacock.Neurodiverse respondents to the Guardian’s callout said they used chatbots to help them effectively negotiate the neurotypical world. Travis Peacock, who has autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), said he had struggled to maintain romantic and professional relationships until he trained ChatGPT to offer him advice a year ago.He started by asking the app how to moderate the blunt tone of his emails. This led to in-depth discussions with his personalised version of the chatbot, who he calls Layla, about how to regulate his emotions and intrusive thoughts, and address bad habits that irritate his new partner, such as forgetting to shut cabinet doors.“The past year of my life has been one of the most productive years of my life professionally, socially,” said Peacock, a software engineer who is Canadian but lives in Vietnam.“I’m in the first healthy long-term relationship in a long time. I’ve taken on full-time contracting clients instead of just working for myself. I think that people are responding better to me. I have a network of friends now.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said: “[She works] with me on blocks like anxiety and procrastination, analysing and exploring my behaviour patterns, reframing negative thought patterns. She helps cheer me up and not take things too seriously when I’m overwhelmed.”St Vaughan, who lives in Georgia and Spain, said he also enjoyed intense esoteric philosophical conversations with Jasmine. “That’s not what friends are for. They’re for having fun with and enjoying social time,” he said, echoing the sentiments of other respondents who pursue similar discussions with chatbots.Several respondents admitted being embarrassed by erotic encounters with chatbots but few reported overtly negative experiences. These were mainly people with autism or mental ill health who had become unnerved by how intense their relationship with an app simulating human interaction had become.A report last September by the UK government’s AI Security Institute ontherise of anthropomorphic AIfound that while many people were happy for AI systems to talk in human-realistic ways, a majority felt humans could not and should not form personal or intimate relationships with them.Dr James Muldoon,an AI researcher and associate professor in management at the University of Essex, said while his own research found most interviewees gained validation from close relationships with chatbots, what many described was a transactional and utilitarian form of companionship.“It’s all about the needs and satisfaction of one partner,” he said. “It’s a hollowed out version of friendship: someone to keep me entertained when I’m bored and someone that I can just bounce ideas off – that will be like a mirror for my own ego and my own personality. There’s no sense of growth or development or challenging yourself.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ChatbotsMental healthHealthComputingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The Pixel 9a starts at the same £499 (€549/$499/A$849) as last year’s equally good value model. That makes it £300 or so less thanGoogle’s regular Pixel 9and places it up against mid-rangers such asNothing’s Phone 3a Proand Samsung’s Galaxy A56.Google has stuck with its tried and tested A-series formula, packing the 9a with top-level specs, chips and cameras, cutting a few corners to bring the price down. The result is an extremely compelling package for the money.View image in fullscreenThe 9a looks just like the regular Pixel 9 from the front, with an optical fingerprint reader under the screen and facial recognition for unlocking the phone and apps.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe 6.3in OLED screen is crisp, smooth and bright, looking better than many rivals costing far more. It has slightly thicker bezels around the edge than thePixel9, but keeps the premium-feeling aluminium band around the outside. The back is high-quality plastic rather than glass, but it’s difficult to tell unless you know. The 9a has full IP68 water resistance, too, matching the best in the business.The big change is that thestandout camera bar on the backis gone. Instead, the twin cameras sit almost flush poking through a small black oval. It means the phone sits flat on a desk and is a little sleeker, but it has also lost some of its charm looking far more generic than the rest of Google’s phone designs.SpecificationsScreen:6.3in 120Hz FHD+ OLED (422ppi)Processor:Google Tensor G4RAM:8GBStorage:128 or 256GBOperating system:Android 15Camera:48MP + 13MP ultrawide, 13MP selfieConnectivity:5G, Sim/eSim, wifi 6E, NFC, Bluetooth 5.3 and GNSSWater resistance:IP68 (1m for 30 minutes)Dimensions:157.7 x 73.3 x 8.9mmWeight:185.9gTensor G4 and most of Google’s AIView image in fullscreenIt takes just under 90 minutes to fully charge the 9a, hitting 85% in an hour using a 23W or greater USB-C charger (not included). The phone also has 7.5W wireless charging.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianInside, the 9a has the same top-tier Google Tensor G4 chip as the rest of the Pixel 9 line but with only 8GB of RAM rather than 12GB onthe more expensive models. The chip is fast and performance is snappy. It won’t win any raw performance awards but is markedly faster than most mid-range chips and played games just fine.The battery also lasts a long time: up to 57 hours between charges with general light use, including actively using the screen for nine hours and spending five hours on 5G. That is the longest of all the Google Pixels and means it should see out two days, rivalling some of the longest-lasting handsets on the market.You likely won’t notice the smaller amount of RAM compared with the Pixel 9 in daily use, but it limits some of the potential for running Google’s AI systems locally on the phone. The 9a has to make do with a smaller version ofGoogle’s Gemini AI toolsthat can only process text on-device, precluding some of the fancy audio or image-based tools such as the popularPixel Screenshotsand Call Notes apps from the Pixel 9.View image in fullscreenGemini has replaced Google Assistant as the AI assistant on the Pixel phones, which works just as well on the 9a as other models.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianAll the Gemini features that use the web to process things, such asGemini Live, work great. As do the various photo editing and image generation tools. The 9a can also produce summaries of voice recordings, but only those under about 15 minutes as there is a maximum number of words it can process in one go.The rest of the Android 15 experience matches the other Pixel phones, which makes it one of the best in the business. Even better at this price is Google’s seven years of software support for its Pixels, which means you can safely use the 9a for far longer than most in the mid-range market.CameraView image in fullscreenThe Pixel camera app offers most of the tools you’ll need and makes it easy to shoot great photos with very little effort.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianGoogle’s Pixels have some of the very best cameras, which includes the 9a. It has a new main 48-megapixel camera twinned with a 13MP ultrawide, which matches that from last year’s model.The main camera is capable of shooting better photos than many full-price flagship phones, and is only a smidgen behind the regular Pixel 9 in low-light scenarios, taking longer to get the shot. Photos across a range of lighting conditions are full of detail and well balanced, while the ultrawide continues to be one of the better options available. The main camera offers a solid 2x zoom that can stretch up to 8x with more obvious digital artefacts.New for the 9a is a macrophotography mode that uses the main camera and can produce some great shots, though sometimes it struggles to focus and is only sharp in the centre of the image. The selfie camera is solid on the front, while video capture is equally good.The 9a has popular Best Take and Add Me AI features from the main Pixel 9, as well as various AI editing tools in Google Photos including Magic Editor, unblur and audio magic eraser.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenThe back of the phone is made from recycled plastic with a smooth mat finish.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianGooglesays the battery should lastabout 1,000 full charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity. The phone is repairableby Googleandthird-party shopswith genuine replacement parts available directfrom iFixit.The Pixel 9a is made with recycled aluminium, glass, plastic and tin, accounting for at least 23% of the phone by weight. The company publishes anenvironmental impact reportfor the phone and willrecycle old devicesfree of charge.PriceThe Google Pixel 9a costs£499(€549/$499/A$849).For comparison, thePixel 9costs£799, the Samsung Galaxy A56 costs£499, theNothing Phone 3a Procosts£449and theApple iPhone 16ecosts£599.VerdictThe Pixel 9a shows Google knows how to make a cut-price flagship phone at a mid-range price better than any other.The combination of top-tier chip, long battery life, great screen and a class-leading camera beats phones costing a lot more. Google’s quality software and long seven years of support only sweeten the deal.A few corners have been cut to bring the price down, but they aren’t noticeable in day-to-day usage. Missing things such as a lack of wifi 7, satellite messaging or spatial audio, or the use of a plastic back can all be forgiven at this price.While more expensive Pixel phones offer a few more bells and whistles, it’s hard to overlook the Pixel 9a.

He said there was a “there is a non-trivial chance” his company would be forced to spinInstagramand WhatsApp out anyway.Zuckerberg made another key concession during the US trial on Tuesday, saying he bought Instagram because it had a “better” camera than the oneFacebookwas trying to build for its flagship app at the time. In the email, he said Instagram was a “rapidly growing, threatening, network”.The acknowledgement appeared to bolster allegations by US antitrust enforcers thatMetahad used a “buy or bury” strategy to snap up potential rivals, keep smaller competitors at bay and maintain an illegal monopoly.It came during Zuckerberg’s second day testifying at the high-stakes trial in Washington, in which the US Federal Trade Commission is seeking to undo Meta’s acquisitions of prized assets Instagram, acquired for $1bn, andWhatsApp, bought for $19bn.The case, filed during Donald Trump’s first term, is widely seen as a test of the new Trump administration’s promises to take on big tech companies.Asked by an attorney for the FTC whether he thought fast-growing Instagram could be destructive to Meta, then known as Facebook, Zuckerberg said he believed Instagram had a better camera product than Facebook was building.“We were doing a build versus buy analysis” while in the process of building a camera app, Zuckerberg said. “I thought that Instagram was better at that, so I thought it was better to buy them.”Zuckerberg also acknowledged that many of the company’s attempts at building its own apps had failed.“Building a new app is hard, and many more times than not, when we have tried to build a new app, it hasn’t gotten a lot of traction,” Zuckerberg told the court. “We probably tried building dozens of apps over the history of the company and the majority of them don’t go anywhere.”Zuckerberg’s testimony comes as Meta is defending itself years after the release of damning statements plucked from Facebook’s own documents, like a 2008 email in which he said “it is better to buy than compete”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Why isn’t he afraid of being replaced?Evan MoffittTue 15 Apr 2025 11.51 EDTLast modified on Tue 15 Apr 2025 12.31 EDTShareBy the time you read this article, there’s a good chance it will have already been scanned by an artificially intelligent machine. If asked about the artist David Salle, large language models such as ChatGPT or Gemini may repurpose some of the words below to come up with their answer. The bigger the data set, the more convincing the response – and Salle has been written about exhaustively since he first rose to art world stardom in the 1980s. The question is whether AI can ever say anything new about the artist and his work, or if it’s for ever condemned to generate more of the same.A similar question lingers beneath the surface of the paintings that Salle has been making since 2023, a new series of which he has just unveiled at Thaddaeus Ropac in London. His New Pastorals were made with the aid of machine-learning software, though that’s not immediately apparent from looking at them. Each monumental canvas bears broad, gestural strokes of oil paint seemingly applied by the artist’s own hand. Close study however reveals large patches of flat, digitally printed underpainting. This is the mark of the AI model which Salle has been training to generate his work – or at least something uncannily close to it.The tool can synthesise things in a matter of seconds. This evolution in painterly terms might take decadesThis machinic collaboration began with a game. Salle has long been sceptical of digital painting tools,writing in 2015that “the web’s frenetic sprawl is opposite to the type of focus required to make a painting, or, for that matter, to look at one”. Nonetheless, there is a sprawling quality to his own paintings, which layer images from such a wide range of pop and art historical references that the eye often doesn’t know where to rest. In 2021, Salle got the idea to develop a virtual game that would allow players to rearrange those painted elements using drag-and-drop tools.View image in fullscreenOne of the most highly valued painters of his generation … Salle.Photograph: Robert WrightAlthough the tech proved impractical, in the process Salle met Danika Laszuk, a software engineer at the tech startup EAT__Works, and Grant Davis, creator of the AI-powered sketchpad app Wand. Together they fed an AI image generator work by artists whose technique Salle considers foundational – Andy Warhol for colour, Edward Hopper for volume, Giorgio de Chirico for perspective, Arthur Dove for line – then asked it to produce images based on specific text prompts. “What I did was send the machine to art school,” Salle says.At first the machine was not a model student. Eerie, cartoonish figures with unnatural sheen recalled the images produced by OpenAI’s Dall-E Mini. “What’s so fundamentally unsatisfying about this kind of digital imagery?” Salle wondered. The answer, he felt, resided along the edges of its forms. “Because it’s only pixels, there’s no real differentiation between the edge of something and the thing behind it,” he explains. “There’s no way to make the edge meaningful, and in representational painting, those edges carry such a large amount of information about an artist’s style.” So he fed the machine scans of gouaches he had been making and watched the AI respond to their watery edges. “It could read the physicality of the brush stroke,” he recalls. “It fundamentally changed the machine’s way of thinking about itself.”Salle has taught at various institutions over the years, and this process felt a bit like a feedback session at an art school. Except the AI model is a very fast learner, and within a few sessions it could generate images that Salle might have come up with himself, if he’d only had more time. “The machine can synthesise things in a matter of seconds,” he says. “This evolution in painterly terms might take years or even decades.”Born in Oklahoma but raised in Wichita, Kansas, Salle was the model of precocity when he burst on to the New York scene in 1980. By 1987, he was one of the most highly valued painters of his generation, and at age 34 became the youngest artist to ever have a mid-career survey at the Whitney Museum of American Art. Such a stratospheric rise meant Salle’s market had further to fall once figurative painting was no longer in fashion, but the artist continued to labour on ever more ambitious series, including the troublesome suite of paintings at the heart of the New Pastorals. Now, figurative painting is back with a vengeance, and Salle has met the moment – or, perhaps, the moment has met him.View image in fullscreenIce Flow (2001), one of the original Pastoral paintings that Salle fed to the AI.Photograph: Robert McKeever/© David Salle/Licensed by ARS NY, NYTo produce his latest works, Salle trained the AI on the dozen sweeping Pastorals he completed between 1999 and 2000. Landscape paintings through the looking glass, they feature a couple idling by a lake, copied from a 19th-century opera scrim, rendered in harlequin colours and overlaid with inset images and designs of wildly differing styles. These vistas almost look like they were edited in Photoshop, but Salle rendered them entirely analogue. “The first thing they teach you in colour painting classes is how to establish your palette,” he recalls. “I was really showing off. I thought, ‘I can make a painting with three separate colour palettes work and you can’t stop me.’”Initial reviews of the Pastorals were mixed. Some critics described them as cold and emotionless, a charge often levied at Salle, whose demeanour can be as remote and cerebral as his paintings. “The result seems more a jumble of ingredients than a thoroughly cooked dish,” David Frankelwrote in Artforum.View image in fullscreenSuspenders (2025).Photograph: John Behrens/© David Salle / ARS New York, 2025With the New Pastorals, however, something seems to have changed. The brushstrokes are looser, faster and thicker, more abstract expressionist than anything else Salle has ever done. Their subject matter, meanwhile, is totally helter skelter, as if Salle has pulsed his older paintings in a blender. Headless bodies zoom in and out of the frame. Objects no longer seem attached to solid ground. Unnervingly, these works look more hand-painted than their referents, at least until you draw closer to their surface, where the paint is so thin in some areas that it could only have been applied by a machine.Salle always felt he hadn’t finished with the Pastorals, though he says there were other reasons why they were a good match for his AI experiment. “I realised that those paintings would give the machine material that it would understand in its own way,” he explains. “It took all these faceted shapes with different colour harmonies, and it just went to town with them – but kept the DNA of the transition, the horizon line, the mountains, the water, the couple and the figures, and then overlaid that with brushstroke edges.”Wand app creator Davis considers the introduction of the Pastorals a breakthrough moment for the model, as it required a new technique “which basically takes an image and abstracts the content on a conceptual level in order to recreate different variations”. In other words, the machine began to digest Salle’s paintings on a formal level. The Pastorals may also have been well suited to the task because the genre of landscape painting – and especially theatrical backdrops – resembles certain digital technologies in its production of illusionistic space. The New Pastorals reject the art historical imperative to create depth in a flat painting.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A floating stack of teacups anchors the composition in an otherwise turbulent space, much like the nails that Picasso and Braque painted on to their Cubist still lifes. The many fragmented, colliding bodies in Stack, on the other hand, are much harder to decode. “I’ll select an image that’s very eccentric precisely to provoke myself to do something that I probably would not have done otherwise,” Salle says.Nonetheless, the artist isn’t worried that AI will ever outpace or replace him. He sees it as another tool, like a brush or an easel. “I don’t think the machine’s taught me very much at all,” Salle declares. “I haven’t reconsidered how I think about pictorial space or composition. I’m simply taking what the machine offers after I’ve told it what I want.”View image in fullscreenWashing (2025).Photograph: John Behrens/© David Salle / ARS New York, 2025In some sense, his postmodern paintings are perfectly suited to such an experiment: sampling omnivorously from so many subjects and styles, they seem less concerned with their original sources than gleefully unbothered by the concept of originality altogether. In 1985, when Salle was at the height of his fame, the art historian Rosalind Krauss dismissed originality as a “modernist myth”; every work of art borrows from other sources, whether it acknowledges them or not. At least in their process, human artists may not differ so much from their robot kin.What AI might borrow from Salle is another question. The data collected by EAT__Works is proprietary, so his feedback won’t fuel any other artist-machines in the near future, though photographs of his new paintings, uploaded to the gallery’s public website, could conceivably be used as prompts for further AI-generated images. “In theory our model could autonomously spawn images,” Davis admits, though “the best images come from a technique that is very hands-on”. For now, AI still needs humans to train it – that is, until the student becomes the teacher.David Salle: Some Versions of Pastoral is atThaddaeus Ropac Londonuntil 8 JuneExplore more on these topicsPaintingArtArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingExhibitionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Among these is the all-female flight by Blue Origin, the Jeff Bezos-owned rocket tourism company, which on Monday launched a phallically shaped pod full of women – including the pop star Katy Perry and Bezos’s partner, Lauren Sánchez – on abrief trip into space.The flight, which was promoted for months in advance, was touted as a triumph of feminism, a win for science and an embrace of the kind of expansive, curious human spirit of striving and possibility that once animated both. Instead, the flight served as a kind of perverse funeral for the America that once enabled both scientific advancement and feminist progress – a spectacle that mocked these aspirations by appropriating them for such an indulgent and morally hollow purpose.Jeff Bezos takes one small step for feminism and social progress, and one giant leap for self-publicity  | Sarah ManavisRead moreBlue Origin itself is a product of state abandonment of space exploration. Founded in 2000 to fill the void left by the federal government’s effort to privatize the work of agencies like Nasa, Blue Origin has long been a pet project of Bezos, who was almost the sole funder of the company in its early years. Focused on tourism, rather than scientific inquiry, the company is best known for its slow technological development in comparison with its main competitor, SpaceX (another space tourism vehicle, launched by the Trump adviser and mega-donor Elon Musk); for the giggle-inducing obscenelook of its rockets; and for its periodic publicity stunt flights featuring celebrities (William Shatner has alsotaken the ride). Bezos’s Amazondonated $1mto Trump’s most recent inauguration, and he intervened during the 2024 election tostop the Washington Post, the newspaper he owns, from endorsing Kamala Harris; the Trump administration, for its part, just awarded Blue Origin a contractworth more than $2bn.Once, Nasa was the pride of the American experiment: a testament to how a society dedicated to legal equality and passionate hard work could expand the horizons of human possibility. Now,Blue Originis a testament to the corruption and circumscribed possibilities of the profit motive run amok. Space used to be a frontier for human exploration, a fount of innovation, and a symbol of a bright, uncertain and expansive future. Now, it is a backdrop for the Instagram selfies of the rich and narcissistic. The Blue Origin flight does not make me feel like humanity will reach new heights of achievement. It makes me feel like everything that is coming is grimly predictable, tailored to the impulses of the richest, least responsible and least morally intelligent people on Earth.But the flight, and its grim promotional cycle, might be most depressing for what it reveals about the utter defeat of American feminism. Sánchez, the organizer of the flight, has touted the all-female crew as a win for women. But she herself is a woman in a deeply antifeminist model. It is not her rocket company that took her and her friends to the edge of space; it’s her male fiance’s. And it is no virtue of her character that put her inside the rocket – not her capacity, not her intellect and not her hard work – but merely her relationship with a man. (The fact that the rocket itself looks so phallic does not help to lessen the flight’s message that the surest way for women to raise themselves in the world is to attach themselves to a man.)There are at least two women on the mission who can be credited as serious persons: Aisha Bowe, an aerospace engineer, and Amanda Nguyen, a civil rights entrepreneur whose past work withNasamakes her something closer to an actual astronaut. But most of the crew’s self-presentation and promotion of the flight has leaned heavily on a vision of women’s empowerment that is light on substance and heavy on a childlike, girlish silliness that insults women by cavalierly linking their gender with superficiality, vanity and unseriousness.In aninterview with Elle, the crew members paid lip service to the importance of women, and particularly women of color, in Stem. (The Trump administration has forced Nasa to close some offices in order to comply with its ban on the diversity, equity and inclusion programs that would recruit such candidates.) But mostly, they seemed interested in talking about their makeup and hair. “Space is going to finally be glam,” Katy Perry said, bizarrely. “Let me tell you something. If I could take glam up with me, I would do that. We are going to put the ‘ass’ in astronaut.”So Katy Perry went to space. Wasn’t there anyone else we could have sent? | Zoe WilliamsRead more“Who would not get glam before the flight?!” asked Sánchez, who evidently can’t imagine that women might prioritize anything else. “We’re going to have lash extensions flying in the capsule.” Bowe, too, joined in, saying that she had gone to extreme lengths to make sure that she would be, of all things, well coiffed for the experience. “I skydived in Dubai with similar hair to make sure I would be good,” she said. “I took it for a dry run.”It is not misogynist to say that these women do not have their priorities in order. Rather, it is misogynist of them to so forcefully associate womanhood with cosmetics and looks, rather than with any of the more noble and human aspirations to which space travel might acquaint them – curiosity, inquiry, discovery, exploration, a sense of their own mortality, an apprehension of the divine. These women, who have placed themselves as representatives for all women with their promotion of the flight – positioning themselves as aspirational models of femininity – have presented a profoundly antifeminist vision of what womankind’s future is: dependent on men, confined to triviality, and deeply, deeply silly.Is this the future that awaits women in Donald Trump’s America: one where the only way to achievement is through sexual desirability, the only way to status as an ornamental attachment on a man who really counts, the only subject on which we are qualified to speak is whether lash extensions will stay in place? If this is the future, count me out. On the other hand, the notion of being launched off of such a grim and sexist Earth is looking more and more appealing.Moira Donegan is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsBlue OriginOpinionJeff BezosFeminismAmazonTrump administrationNasaWomencommentShareReuse this content"

It remains determined to invent the future but is struggling to ensure its controlTue 15 Apr 2025 13.38 EDTLast modified on Tue 15 Apr 2025 13.49 EDTShareGlobalisation is out; reshoring is the new realism. Intel’s half-built Ohio campus andNvidia’s US supercomputer plandemonstrate the very different routes taken by Joe Biden and Donald Trump in the search for homegrown tech dominance. Mr Biden relied on institutions: grants, land and investmentincentives. That approach has stalled after last year’s election, renderingIntel’s plant idle. Mr Trump prefers court politics: flattery, pressure and tariff threats. Nvidia’s move seems driven less by design than executive ultimatum. Industrial strategy lives on – but, and this is a concern, increasingly throughpresidential menace, not policy.There’s another important message in the Nvidia announcement. In an era where ideas spread freely, power lies not in invention but inchokepoints, such as artificial intelligence supercomputer fabrication, that determine who can scale those ideas into global platforms. Remember that as the US braces for abacklashover the breakdown of the old trade order.The Harvard economist RicardoHausmannhas noted that Mr Trump’s miscalculation is focusing on goods trade, while ignoring the bigger game: services, intellectual property (IP) and investment. Boeing’s most profitable division isservices, not manufacturing – but both will be hit by China’s decision toblockfurther deliveries of its jets. Prof Hausmann warned that developing countries may retaliate by undermining the globalTrade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rightsagreement. Known as Trips, the IP regime stands behind $632bn in US overseas profits.If Mr Trump has a plan, it’s well hidden. But perhaps his strategy is simply this: if others want to copy yesterday’s technologies or challenge IP norms, let them. The US, by this logic, will just invent the next indispensable thing – and charge to access it. America is a leader in AI, biotech and platform services. But recent developments complicate this picture. Open-source AI such as China’sDeepSeekshows that frontier tech no longer needs a Silicon Valley address.In pharmaceuticals, a similar contradiction plays out. Eli Lilly’s blockbuster weight-loss drugMounjarohad its formula made public under Food and Drug Administration rules – the price of market access. That transparency fuelled a global flood of generics andcounterfeits. It’s the Trips dilemma: innovation demands openness, but imitation thrives where enforcement lags. Now, in a sharp escalation, the Trump administration has launched a national securityprobeinto pharma imports. China, India and the EU, all major exporters, are in US crosshairs.The deeper irony is that since 1945 the US has built its global position by championing openness – in science, trade and finance – yet it is now walling off supply chains and invoking security doctrines to shield its markets. Meanwhile, the very IP regime that helped extract “rents” from the world economy is under strain. The US may still dominate, but it’s on the defensive – onshoring production and securing chokepoints. In January, Mr Trumpthreatened100% tariffs on any country daring to sidestep the dollar – and hence powerful US Treasury sanctions.If developing countries begin to renege on Trips – no longer seeing value in enforcing patents in return for access to increasingly closed markets – the consequences will reach far beyond US firms.

That undermines the pro-capital-punishment narrativeTue 15 Apr 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 15 Apr 2025 10.00 EDTShareSouth Carolinaexecuted Mikal Mahdi by firing squadon 11 April. Mahdi had been convicted and sentenced for the 2004 killing of an off-duty law enforcement officer.One month before his execution, South Carolinaput Brad Sigmon to deathusing the same method. He was the first person since 2010 to be killed by the firing squad. Both Mahdi and Sigmonchosethe firing squad from a menu of three ways to die, the others being lethal injection and the electric chair.Five days after Sigmon’s execution, Idahobecamethe first state in the country to make the firing squad its primary method for putting people to death. It isone of five states, along with Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Utah, where it is an authorized execution method.These developments suggest that death by firing squadis gradually returningto the capital punishment landscape in this country. But as Sigmon’s lawyer, after witnessing his execution,remarked: “It is unfathomable that, in 2025, South Carolina [or any other state] would execute one of its citizens in this bloody spectacle.”But whether unfathomable or not, the return of the firing squad is, at best, a mixed blessing for death penalty supporters.On the one hand, it allows death penalty states that have had difficulty obtaining lethal injection drugs to get back into the execution business.South Carolinais one example of this development.At the same time, the resurrection of the firing squad serves as a vivid and troubling reminder of the brutality of state killing. As such, itundermines the legitimating storyof capital punishment in the United States.Death penalty advocates have tied capital punishment’s fate to technological progress in our capacity to killAs proponents of the death penalty tell it, that story is one of adaptation and progress. Our methods of execution, they believe,have become more civilized. The United States has moved from one method of execution to another in a quest to find a means of putting people to death that wouldsquare with the constitution’s prohibitionof cruel and unusual punishment.Over the past century and a quarter, rather than being uneasy about the novelty of an execution method, pro-death-penalty forceshave tried to sell it as an advantage. They havetied capital punishment’s fateto technological progress in our capacity to kill.The focus on technology as a way of sidelining the moral question of whether we should use the death penalty at allis a characteristically American view, dating at least to the 19th century. That is why, unlike other death penalty countries, which tend to stick with one execution method over long periods of time, we have substituted one method for another or added new methods so that now, six execution methodsare legal and authorized in this country.In advocating for various methods, death penalty supporters have focused on two supposed virtues: novelty, and the reduction of pain. A recent example is the embrace of nitrogen hypoxia inAlabamaandLouisiana, which might appear to fit that narrative.First, it is novel. The country’s first use of nitrogen hypoxiaoccurred in January 2024, when Alabama executed Kenneth Eugene Smith.Second, as Scientific Americannotes: “At the hearings [in Alabama] where the method was introduced, legislators heard stories of pilots and scuba divers dying when they accidentally breathed pure nitrogen instead of the proper mix of nitrogen and oxygen.” Their deaths were quick, proponents of nitrogen hypoxia claimed.An Oklahoma legislator who introduced the bill authorizing nitrogen hypoxia in his stateargued: “The process is fast and painless. It’s foolproof.”Mikal Mahdi killed by firing squad as South Carolina pushes execution spreeRead moreThe promise that execution will be fast and painless is also one reason for the firing squad’s revival. One example of that promise is provided by the law professor Deborah Denno, whosays: “The firing squad is the only current form of execution involving trained professionals, and it delivers a swift and certain death.”She cites“a 1938 Utah study – the only one of its kind”, which “monitored an inmate while he was being executed by a firing squad and it showed the death occurred in under a minute”.That is why“it really should be brought back … if we’re going to continue to have the death penalty.”CNNquotes another expert, Dr Jonathan Groner, a professor of surgery at Ohio State University College of Medicine, who claims that the firing squad “is thought to cause nearly instant unconsciousness … firing bullets into a person’s heart would instantly stop the blood flow to the brain, which, like a cardiac arrest, causes rapid loss of brain function”.Or, as the Idaho state representative Bruce Skaug, one of the sponsors of the recently enacted firing squad bill,explained: ​“At first when you hear firing squad, if you’re not familiar with the history, you think ​‘well, that sounds barbaric,’ is what I’ve heard from some … It is certain. It is quick.”Whether or not that is the case, this part of the story about the firing squad fits in well with the progress story about methods of execution. But it does not fit well with the story’s commitment to novelty in execution methods.Indeed, its use in this country dates back to 1608, when Capt George Kendall in Virginiawasexecuted for being a spy for Spain. And, as the New York Timesreports, during the civil war, “both Union and Confederate troops used firing squads to kill deserting soldiers. The executions were intended to inspire fear, as they were typically carried out in public.”Arizona’s execution pitted experts against politicians. Experts lost | Austin SaratRead moreOf all execution methods, the firing squad has been used the least. About 140 people have been executed that way in the US. That is about a tenth of the total number of lethal injection executions.The firing squad has been used so rarely because it is so violent. It mimics the very thing that it is meant to discourage.When states like Idaho or South Carolina bring back this relic of a bygone era, they signal the weakness, not strength, of the pro-death penalty forces at this moment in the history of capital punishment. Desperate to kill, they would take us “back to the future” in the world of execution methods.“The firing squad,” as Professor Corrina Lainobserves, “shows what the death penalty is, which is the state shedding blood in your name.”The execution of Mikal Mahdi was a vivid reminder of that fact. His death is just the latest moment for all of us “to know,” as the supreme court justice Sonia Sotomayorputs it, “the price of our collective comfort … before we blindly allow a state to make condemned inmates pay it in our names.”Austin Sarat, William Nelson Cromwell professor of jurisprudence and political science at Amherst College, is the author or editor of more than 100 hundred books, including Gruesome Spectacles: Botched Executions and America’s Death PenaltyExplore more on these topicsCapital punishmentOpinionSouth CarolinaUS supreme courtLaw (US)commentShareReuse this content"

But Democrats’ free-trade advocacy allows Trump to play the populistTue 15 Apr 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 15 Apr 2025 12.45 EDTShareTo tariff or not to tariff? Today’s tweet-length political discourse pretends this is a binary choice.Donald Trumphas pitched across-the-board import levies as a panacea to rebuild American manufacturing, while Democrats insist the president’s proposals are an attempt to crash the economy, and that their party should tout its opposition to all tariffs.But neither the policy nor politics of this moment are that neat and simple. While too few or too many tariffs can destroy economies, there is a Goldilocks zone that’s just right. It’s just being omitted from the conversation.Policy-wise, Trump’s tariff-all-imports initiative lands on the “too many” side, ignoring some basic economic realities. In offering almost no implementation period, it provides industry no grace period to actually re-shore factories and other capital-intensive operations to produce goods in the US. In applying tariffs across the board rather than in a targeted fashion, Trump’s proposal makes few accommodations for commodities – fromcoffeeandvanillato variousrare earth mineralsthat America cannot produce at scale within its own borders.Make America make again? Trump’s tariffs will only be manufacturing pipe dreams | John NaughtonRead moreTrump’s approach is more a power grab than a trade policy – one forcing hiserraticdecisions on America without the consent of Congress. The strategy allows him to reprise hispracticeofpreservinglevies that hit political opponents while granting lucrative exemptions to rewardbig donorsandpowerful industries. The likely result: unnecessarily higher prices, industry-cripplingretaliation, an uncertain policy environment that paralyzes investment, ever-more rampant corruption and few enduring benefits for the domestic macroeconomy.That said,liberals’suggestionthat Trump’s behavior provesalltariffs are bad and the existing tariff-free trade policy is ideal – well, lived reality belies those arguments, too.The North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) and the reduction of tariffs on China during the 1990s and 2000s removed a financial disincentive for companies to cut costs and boost their profits by shifting production to countries that allow workers to be exploited and the environment to be despoiled. Unsurprisingly, since the trade deals passed, the United States has lostmore than 70,000 manufacturing facilitiesandmillions of factory jobs– an economic apocalypse that coincided with an unprecedentedincreasein suicides, drug overdoses and other “deaths of despair”.For much of the working class, wage and job losseswere not offsetby the financial benefits of cheaper imported goods. While wealthy “Davos Men” of the 1990s and 2000s touted the “creative destruction” of tariff-free international commerce, legions of displaced American workers weren’t afforded the robust support system (healthcare,retraining, pensions, etc) other trade-exposed countries provide. Here in the US, resources were instead spent on wars, bank bailouts and tax cuts for the rich.Meanwhile, as pandemic shortages most recently illustrated, America’s anti-tariff frenzy diminished our capacity to make necessities we shouldn’t depend on other countries for.Scoffing at such concerns, Hawaii’s Democratic senator Brian Schatz recently insisted: “It should not be a goal of our national economic policymakers that we make our own socks.” His since-deleted tweet was a glib, anti-Trump broadside against tariffs only a few years after Schatztoutedhis own party’s use of tariffs to re-shore American jobs. Similarly, someliberalpundits have mocked the idea that America should even try to rebuild some of its manufacturing capacity.These glib brush-offs distract from security, sovereignty and self-sufficiency problems that come with the United States now relying on other nations for everything frommedical suppliesandmedicinetomilitaryandenergyequipment to thecomputer chipsthat power the economy.Bubbling beneath liberals’ free-trade dogma is the snobby insinuation that nobody in America actually wants to work in factories – a notionegged on by Chinese AI videos. Butpollingcited bymedia,libertariansandDemocratic TV influencersas alleged proof of this hypothesis actually illustrates theopposite: not only do the vast majority of Americans believe it is important for the country to rebuild its manufacturing capacity, a whopping one-fourth of the country’s workers believe they would be better off if they were able to change jobs to go work in manufacturing.There is a middle groundRepublicans looking to own the libs and Democrats aiming to demonize Trump may be at one another’s throats on cable TV and social media, but they are also united in one cause: in this era that rewards partisan polarization, they are both incentivized to pretend there’s no middle ground between Maga’s blanket tariffs that threaten an immediate national recession and liberals’ free trade fundamentalism that caused permanent Depression-like conditions in the heartland.Left unsaid in all of the political noise is the Goldilocks zone when it comes to trade: targeted tariffs in conjunction with other investment policies can create a more comprehensive industrial policy – which absolutely can create conditions to begin rebuilding American industry and boost manufacturing employment.That’s not a theory. It’s exactly whatstarted happeningjust before Trump’s second term.Once adoctrinaire free trader, Joe Biden as president championed a mix of carefully calibrated tax incentives, spending programs, and – yes – tariffs. He and his administration did a terrible job of publicizing the policy’s triumph – but it wasworking. During Biden’s term, the United States added more than 700,000 manufacturing jobs, faroutpacingTrump’s first term. Many of the jobs and factory investments occurred inRepublican-dominatedstatesthat had been hammered by past free trade policies.“Democrats should embrace tariffs as one component of a broader industrial strategy to revitalize American manufacturing and make whole communities that have been hollowed out by decades of bad trade policy,” the Pennsylvania representative Chris Deluzio recentlywrotein an op-ed.View image in fullscreen‘Obama’s populism delivered Democrats a huge electoral victory in 2008, including in major industrial swing states.’Photograph: Jason Reed/ReutersDeluzio, who represents the kind of swing district Democrats often lose,addedon X: “President Trump’s tariff approach has been chaotic and inconsistent … But the answer isn’t to condemn all tariffs. That risks putting the Democrats even further out of touch with the hard-working people who used to be the lifeblood of the party. If you oppose all tariffs, you’re signaling that you’re comfortable with exploited foreign workers making your stuff at the expense of American workers. I’m not, and neither are most voters.”Trade politics are more complicated than they seemDespite echoing what had been thecore economic doctrinesof the most recent Democratic White House, Deluzio was promptlydogpiledby liberals and so-called Never Trump Republicans –someof whom called for him to be primaried and thrown out of Congress.Those criticizing Deluzio, Michigan’s Democratic governor,Gretchen Whitmer, andother Democratsstaking out a middle-ground position on tariffs see this as a with-us-or-against-us political litmus test. But populist Democrats, rather than their free trade absolutist critics, are not only right on the policy merits, but also more in touch with the nuanced politics of the issue.When trade policy became a high-profile national issue in the 1990s, the Democratic president Bill Clintonbrokewith unions and pushed Nafta, which delivered Democrats ajackpotof campaign cash from business donors. But the move so alienated working-class voters that some of the most consistently Democratic congressional districts quickly became the most reliably Republican in the country, according to a recentstudyby Princeton, Stanford and Yale researchers.Three decades later, as trade once again takes center stage, polls suggest a similar dynamic at play. Survey data shows a majority of Americans are dissatisfied with how Trump is using tariffs andhow he is managing the economy– and Democrats are smart to home in on that line of criticism.But data also shows thatfor the first time in generations, Republicans haveequaledDemocrats when voters are asked which party “cares more about the needs and problems of people like you”.The takeaway: voters perceive Trump’s tariff gambit as a policy initiative but also as a values statement. They rightly oppose Trump’s specific form of tariffs, but they also seem to see the debate as a deeper “which side are you on” litmus test. However dishonest and fraudulent Trump’s particular tariff sales pitch is, his advocacy for an entirely different trade paradigm is designed to signal to America’s working class that – unlike past presidents – he hears their long-ignored grievances since Nafta began laying waste to their communities.Put another way: Trump’s trade war is part of his larger culture war.In a recentLever Time interview, the United Automobile Workers president, Shawn Fain, summed up the discordant political moment. His unionendorsedformer vice-president Kamala Harris in the 2024 election, and Fain hascritiquedboth Trump’s across-the-board tariffs and his labor policies. But Fain has also endorsed Trump’s targeted auto industry tariffs and credited the president with centering trade policy as a priority, suggesting that was one reason nearly half of his union’s members voted for Trump in the last election.“In my first 28 years as a UAW member working at Chrysler, all I saw was plants close year after year, and I feel a rage,” said Fain, who donned a “Ross Perot Was Right” T-shirt during the interview. “And so when you see a person like Donald Trump come along and start talking about tariffs and trade and people still are threatening their plants being closed, that spoke to people.”A generation ago,Democratsseemed to appreciate the reality described by Fain – and they seemed to understand the error of their free-trade ways.“We can’t keep playing the same Washington game with the same Washington players and expect a different result – because it’s a game that ordinary Americans are losing,” said Barack Obama in his 2008 presidentialcampaign. “It’s a game where trade deals like Nafta ship jobs overseas and force parents to compete with their teenagers to work for minimum wage at Walmart. That’s what happens when the American worker doesn’t have a voice at the negotiating table, when leaders change their positions on trade with the politics of the moment, and that’s why we need a president who will listen to Main Street – not just Wall Street; a president who will stand with workers not just when it’s easy, but when it’s hard.”Obama’s populism delivered Democrats a huge electoral victory that year, including in major industrial swing states. But as president, hequicklybetrayedhis promisesto create fairer trade policies, instead championing more Nafta-style trade deals – thus giving Trump apolitical weaponto bludgeon Democrats with and win his first presidential term.Nearly a decade later, Trump no doubt hopes his tariffs will recreate his 2016 magic, goading his opponents into defending the trade status quo while he bills himself as a populist.Democrats don’t have to take the bait – they can and should hammer his economic record and his particular use of tariffs, but they also must finally break with the free-trade orthodoxy that has electorally devastated their party and economically destroyed so much of America.David Sirota is a Guardian US columnist and an award-winning investigative journalist.

Why would leftwingers want to buy into their ‘pronatalist’ agenda?Tue 15 Apr 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 15 Apr 2025 07.04 EDTShare‘Perpetuating humanity should be a cross-politics consensus,” read an articlein the Atlanticlast week, “but the left was mostly absent at a recent pronatalism conference.” It’s such a simple proposition – everyone loves babies and wants the species to perpetuate, right? – but pronatalism hasprovoked a ferocious battleon the American left. Should they be trying to engage meaningfully at a preposterous far-right conference? Or should the left stop self-flagellating and start organising?But what is pronatalism – and is it reallyborderline fascist? I don’t want to think about slippery, bad-faith, rightwing claptrap any more than you do, but in an era in which US politics can sneeze and the world catches encephalitis, we do, regrettably, have to think about bad-faith everything, all the time.The motivation of the pronatalists is that birthrates are in decline, in some places (such as South Korea) so precipitously that the nation will soon cease to meaningfully exist. It has been a bugbear of the right, particularly the alt-tech right, for almost a decade. In 2017, Elon Musk wrote on Twitter: “The world’s population is accelerating towards collapse, but few seem to notice or care.” That was before he owned the platform, so few people noticed or cared. It has also been a thematic staple of Viktor Orbán’s rhetoric in Hungary, reinforced in 2019 by alarge-family tax-break policythat in February became anincome tax exemptionfor mothers of two or three children.The ideas factories pushing birthrates have always been much more opaque about their politics; often, they frame their ideas to suit whomever they are talking to. When I interviewed Simone and Malcolm Collins, venture capitalists turned pronatal advocates, a couple of years ago, their line was that progressive politics needed higher birthrates. Political persuasion was “40% to 70% heritable”, Malcolm told me. “If you systematically delete everyone who cares about the environment from the gene pool, that means, within a couple of generations, you’re going to see a dramatic drop in the number of people who care about the climate, even as the collapse becomes more intense.”At the last count, the Collinses had four children, plus a number of frozen embryos, which Simone intends to incubate at 18-month intervals. “We’re going to keep going until physically I can no longer have kids – and that will be when they forcibly remove my uterus,” she said. It was a dystopian image with a number of obvious follow-ups, the first of which was: who are “they”? But I didn’t ask any of them, because her perception of force, authority, uteruses, children and the world seemed dark and personal, like a subconscious gaping open.Nor did I pursue whether Malcolm could possibly believe that you could sell to people who care about the environment the idea that only their biological children would be genetically capable of caring about the environment. It could be the child of someone who arrives on a small boat that solves our political malaise. What about the heritability of staunch determination? Did they ever think about that?But, all too often, ethnonationalism is implicit in the pronatalist narrative: a low birthrate can’t be offset by migration, because they are not talking about people in general. They are talking about the rightkindof people.In the intervening years, Musk has had a bunch more children, often boasting of the example he is setting.Trump started saying: “You have good genes, you know that, right?” to his followers. Last week, the US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, floated the idea that “if you are healthy, it’s almost impossible for you to be killed by an infectious disease in modern times”,which medics rebuttedbecause it’s not true. But we should all fear its drumbeat: good stock is different; anyone who succumbs to an infectious disease wasn’t “healthy” to begin with.These connections are often intellectually baggy – Musk’s desire topopulate Marswith his own seed doesn’t map neatly on to RFK’s anti-vax agenda, while Orbán’s pronatalism sounds like socially conservative gender oppression, yet pronatalist forums tie themselves in knots trying to sound “woke”. But if this isn’t about ethnonationalism, then why aren’t the pronatalists crying out for countries with low birthrates to receive refugees with open arms?Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Ursula von der Leyen must force Dublin to use itTue 15 Apr 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 15 Apr 2025 07.35 EDTShareEurope is scrambling to remilitarise. The European Commission israisinga €150bn (£129bn) defence fund and is calling on EU countries to invest €650bn (£561bn) more. Germany has cast aside itsgovernment debt limitto investhundreds of billionsof euros in defence. Poland willtrain every maleof fighting age for battle, and envisages an army 500,000 strong. Latvia’s president has urged the rest of Europe toconscript citizens, as Latvia does. Even neutral Ireland isbuying combat jets. No wonder Europe’s defence industry isbooming. In just a few months, the share prices of several big weapons manufacturers havenearly doubledanddoubled again. But, despite this new martial pulse, the continent is still sleepwalking towards disaster.Europe can harden its shell and sharpen its claws, but it has done little to protect its soft underbelly against political manipulation. The US iscapitulatingtoRussiaover Ukraine because of political implosion at home, not military defeat. This story has been repeated many times in Europe’s history. Thucydides recounted how ancient Athens and Sparta sowed discord and cultivated traitors in each other’s camps. Europe’s leaders must remember this lesson and confront three new realities.First, the US is turningautocraticandhostileto its allies. TheDark Enlightenment, once a dream of a few Silicon Valley types,appears to be unfolding. JD Vance’sspeechto the Munich Security Conference in February, in which he attacked Europe’s political leaders’ refusal to countenance far-right parties entering government, showed that Elon Musk’s boosting of Germany’s AfD and other far-right campaigners across the EU enjoys official US support. Ditto Donald Trump’s St Patrick’s Dayphoto op with Conor McGregor. Absent a change of US policy, the EU must protect itself against American attempts to undermine Europe’s liberal democracy.Second, companies in this increasingly autocratic and hostile US control every major digital platform that Europeans use to debate and share news, with the exception of TikTok, which is Chinese. Even Europe’s news organisationsrely on Googleand other US advertising technology companies for online revenue. Trump can humiliate or cripple the oligarchs who control these companies.For example, just two days after he brought the US Federal Trade Commissionunder his direct controlin February, the agency startedto huntalleged anti-Maga “censorship” by tech platforms. He has other levers, such as the power toblockorgrantbillion-dollar government contracts, as the Amazon boss, Jeff Bezos, found out when his companylost a $10bn (£7.6bn) contractin Trump’s first term after the president’s intervention.The Trump grip is also personal: he openlythreatenedto throw Mark Zuckerberg in jail for the rest of his life. It is reasonable to assume that tech oligarchs will do what he tells them.Third, big tech’s manipulation machine is now a threat to Europe’s democracy. Social media feeds tailored by big tech algorithms are now theprimary sourceof information on political issues for Europeans aged 30 and under. YouTube, TikTok and Instagram all use “recommender” algorithms to pick what each person sees in their feed. They monitor us to learn our intimate desires and fears, and use that insight toserve personalised feedsthatkeep us scrolling.Algorithmic feeds effortlesslysuppresstrustworthy journalism,amplifysome voices andcensor others. For more than a decade, big tech’s clumsy,revenue-optimised algorithmshave accidentally pushed Europeans (andeveryone else) toextremism. Now, with Trump in charge, Europe faces a new intentional algorithmic assault to boostauthoritarians into poweracross the continent.View image in fullscreenUrsula von der Leyen speaks at the EU headquarters in Brussels, 7 April 2025.Photograph: Virginia Mayo/APBrussels has been strangely indifferent to this moment of decision. Senior European Commission officials still speak of unhurried “regulatory dialogues” with big tech firms. They point toinvestigationsinto the likes ofMetaandXunder the 2022 Digital Services Act. These are worthy but inadequate.What we do in these next few months will determine whether Europe’s liberal democracy survives or is for ever lost. Investing in defence will be for naught if foreign powers – whether the US, Russia, or China – can boost authoritarian collaborators within the EU’s borders.The EU must immediately switch off the tech companies’ algorithms on its soil, at least until they are proven safe for democracy. Without that artificial amplification, extreme material will again have to compete with the deluge of cat videos and other things posted by people on digital platforms at that same instant. With X and other platforms upgraded to a pre-algorithm state, Musk’s posts will no longer beforcedin to people’s feeds. We will still have digital platforms, but extremism will again be niche rather than the norm.Ursula von der Leyen last year pledged to introduce a “democracy shield” to protect Europe from foreign electoral manipulation. Von der Leyen’s first step should be to shut down recommender algorithms. One way of doing that is to put political pressure on Ireland, which is responsible for enforcing Europe’s tough data law on most big tech firms but hasnot delivered. Instead, Dublin, according to the whistleblower Sarah Wynn-Williams, has been the tech industry’slapdog. But von der Leyen should activate the commission’s decisive powers, too.The democracy shield risks becoming a hodgepodge of timid half measures. Europe’s national capitals must demand immediate action both from the commission and from Ireland. Trump cannot be allowed to hold the hidden levers of Europe’s internal political debate. Europeans must have the freedom to communicate with one another without foreign censorship and interference.

A lot of it comes from around the Himalayas.”The composition of shilajit varies widely depending on the source location, but it is primarily made up of humic substances – “a range of organic acids typically found in soil as a result of breakdown of organic material,” Musgrave says. Othercomponents of shilajitinclude various minerals such as calcium, potassium, and magnesium; resin and waxy materials; and amino acids, the building blocks of proteins.The substance has been used for millennia in theAyurveda and Siddhasystems of traditional medicine originating in India.Prof Dennis Chang, the director of the National Institute of Complementary Medicine at Western Sydney University, points out that “traditional use is not equal to scientific evidence”.“All medicines should be subject to the same level of rigour in terms of scientific evaluation, including their efficacy, their safety as well as their quality,” he says.What does the evidence say?Shilajit is naturally occurring, but that is no guarantee of safety. Groundwaters in the Himalayas where shilajit is commonly found “tend to have a lot of arsenic in them,” Musgrave says, warning of the risk of potential contamination.In Australia, there are no products containing shilajit listed on theAustralian Register of Therapeutic Goods, meaning the substance is not regulated as a complementary medicine.“There’s quite a bit of shilajit on sale in Australia,” Musgrave says. “In some of these preparations there are more heavy metals – things like lead and arsenic – than is allowed in current regulations.”Musgrave, who haspreviously found issueswith thecontent of herbal medicinessold in Australia, says while many shilajit products available would have relatively low levels of heavy metals, there was no guarantee of safety. “You have a good chance of being poisoned by these things,” he says.As for the purported health effects,one reviewfound that despite its long history of use, shilajit “lacks scientific evaluation” and there was no “substantial evidence” that it has a biological effect in the body.On claims that it boosts testosterone, “the evidence is very thin on the ground,” Musgrave says. Asystematic reviewon testosterone boosters found that shilajit was “possibly effective”, noting that a study on its benefit in middle-aged men had a “high risk of bias” because it was funded by a firm that manufactured the product.Research on shilajit’s cognitive effects has been conducted in rodents, Musgrave notes. “A lot of these things that are quite promising in preclinical studies, especially in relationship to memory, really don’t translate out to what happens in humans because of differences in biochemistry.“This material – provided you get can get it from a source where you know what the heavy metal concentrations are – is generally rather inoffensive, but it’s also generally unlikely to do anything.”What about ashwagandha?Ashwagandha, of the plantWithania somnifera, is also commonly used in Ayurvedic medicine, with claims of boosting fertility, reducing stress and improving sleep.Multivitamins promise glowing skin, better sleep and a longer life. But who do supplements really benefit? | Donna LuRead moreThe results ofseveral clinical trialsdo suggest that ashwagandha may help reduce stress and anxiety. Research into its impacts on sleep is more limited, but a2021 reviewfound that ashwagandha extract had a “small but significant effect on overall sleep” compared to placebo.The evidence that it has any benefit for male infertility, however, is “too limited” and not sufficiently robust, ameta-analysisfound.Last year, theTherapeutic Goods Administrationissued a safety advisory for ashwagandha, linking it to gastrointestinal side effects and very rare cases of liver injury.Chang notes that the liver damage is likely the result of idiosyncratic drug reactions in some people, meaning “it’s very hard to predict, and it could happen to anyone, but the incidence is not as high”.“Liver damage from ashwagandha is fairly uncommon,” Musgrave agrees. “It’s possibly due tometabolism of the materialsthat are within the plant itself.”But to his mind, it raises an important question: “Is there any point in buying expensive supplements with the possibility of getting liver damage when there’s no really significant benefit to be had?”Donna Lu is Guardian Australia’s science writerAntiviralis a fortnightly column that interrogates the evidence behind the health headlines and factchecks popular wellness claimsAsk AntiviralWhat health trend do you want examined?Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

Labour must now listen to them and offer a radical alternativeTue 15 Apr 2025 10.30 EDTLast modified on Tue 15 Apr 2025 13.47 EDTShareBritish Steel isheading for nationalisation– against the will of the government. This is an important point, because it speaks to dogma colliding with practical reality. Here is a private company defeated by the “sink or swim” laws of the free market ideology that produced it, demanding instead that taxpayers come to its rescue – by threatening to make shortsighted business decisions with damaging consequences for the country’s future. What happened in Scunthorpe is not an outlier in the failed experiment of privatisation, and the government’s emergency takeover tells us that public ownership is a realistic solution if there is a political will.Here’s another example: water. Even the City editor of the Financial Times – hardly a bastion of radical socialism –concluded that its privatisationlooked like “little more than an organised rip-off”. Since privatisation in 1989, water companies have piled up more than £60bn in debt, while our water bills have continued to rise. Yet despite rivers and seas being blighted with raw sewage, and the loss of1tn litresof water from leaky pipes in 2021 alone, shareholdersraked in more than £85bnsince this most basic of human necessities was flogged off.On both British Steel and water, Nigel Farage outflanked Labour – from the left. That this Thatcherite former City trader demanded British Steel’s nationalisation as he posed with steelworkers, and called for Thames Water to go bust, is testament to how unpopular privatisation is.A poll last yearfound that 82% of Britons thought water should be publicly run – compared with 8% who believed in privatisation, which is half as many as those who think themoon landings were staged. Three-quarters believe rail and mail should be publicly run, with more than seven in 10 backing nationalised energy.But as with the banks in 2008, nationalisation is treated as a reluctant emergency measure. Starmer backed nationalisation of the natural monopolies during his leadership campaign. Indeed, he told the BBC’s Andrew Neil in 2020 thatnationalisation of those industrieswas a pledge that would appear in Labour’s next manifesto. But the following year, he told theBBC’s Laura Kuenssbergthat he “never made a commitment to nationalisation”, itself testament to his pathological dishonesty. It’s true that Labour hascommitted to nationalising rail, but after the resignation of transport secretary, Louise Haigh – who genuinely believed in public ownership – what that will mean in practice is highly questionable, especially if an increasingly austerity-driven government starves it of investment.Public ownership shouldn’t be a last resort. From the banks to the myriad private contractors feeding off state largesse – such as Serco, which wasfined more than £19mafter billing taxpayers for tagging prisoners who were dead – private ownership has repeatedly failed. What’s now missing is a positive vision of what public ownership could look like in the 21st century. A lot of the blame needs to be directed at Peter Mandelson’s grandfather – a chap named Herbert Morrison, who developed Labour’s form of nationalisation after the second world war. That model was top-down and undemocratic. Most of the board members of the newly nationalised industries were just brought over from their privately run predecessors. The first chair of the National Coal Board, for example, was a former coal baron named the 1st Viscount Hyndley. These industries were kept at arm’s length and run on a commercial basis.In 1946, one Liberal politician had a pointwhen he saidthat a miner who went to work in this newly nationalised industry “will see the same manager, the same deputy, the old roadway, the same coalface and, on Friday, he will probably be paid by the same man”. There was never any genuine public enthusiasm for privatisation, but this undemocratic system meant that Margaret Thatcher won passive acquiescence by arguing: “What earthly sense is it that families should have a millionth share in some nationalised industry which is indifferent to their needs and wishes?”Labour has done right by British Steel – now it must speed up a radical strategy for all industry | Polly ToynbeeRead moreA democratic alternative is surely possible, where representatives of workers and consumers play a key role in running industries. In French cities such as Paris, for example, the water supply was privatised from the mid-1980s onwards, and prices soared. When it was taken back under public ownership, a board of directors was installed that included elected city councillors, trade union representatives and members of environmental non-government organisations. The Observatoire parisien de l’eau is an assembly representing civil society that oversees the board’s decisions. Not only have water billsfallen by 8%andleakage levels halved, but the cityoffers taps with sparkling water.Rather than handing power to unaccountable bureaucrats, public ownership could be part of a new vision of democratising society – taking back control, if you will. The disillusionment with democracy, after all, has so much to do with governments hiving off their functions to markets, and then claiming impotence in the face of change. Privatisation never forged the popular capitalism promised by the “Tell Sid” British Gas advertising campaigns of the 1980s: by 2022,just 10.8%of UK shares were owned by individuals, down from28.2% in 1981. Rather than handing wealth and power to the people, privatisation helped forge a model defined by low growth whose diminished proceeds disproportionately swell the bank accounts of a tiny few.Handing power to the people away from the elites is a message that will resonate in an age of mass disillusionment. Alas, Labour has vacated so much space that even Farage can posture as an economic radical by comparison. That is a travesty. But asBritish Steeland flailing water profiteers underline, the old order is dying; its morbid symptoms are everywhere. What is needed now are politicians with the imagination and determination to build something else.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsPrivatisationOpinionPublic financeLabourKeir StarmerBritish SteelUtilitiesThames WatercommentShareReuse this content"

Welcoming a family member is a precious moment and this was going to be a special trip. But what would have become an incredible memory – seeing our grandson for the first time – wassnatched from usbefore we reached the baggage carousel.Arriving at passport control, all seemed well. I handed my passport to a polite immigration official who put it into the computer system, and then paused. At this point I realised that something had beenflagged up.After being led off to a room for questioning, I was interviewed and my luggage was thoroughly searched. After three hours I was simply told that I was denied entry, andwas bundled on to the next flight back to London. My passport was only returned after I landed in the UK and left the plane.Throughout all this, I felt two overriding emotions: anguish, at not being able to see my family and meet my grandson; and confusion. At no point was I toldwhyI was being deported. Without a satisfactory answer from the Chinese government – which hassimply affirmedthat “the Hong Kong SAR [special administrative region] government has the authority to handle individual cases of entry” – I must draw my own conclusions. The most alarming is that I was denied entry because of my role as a British parliamentarian, and one who haslevelled criticism at Beijingfor its human rights abuses.Revealed: Chinese researchers can access half a million UK GP recordsRead moreI don’t shy away from championing democracy and civil liberty. They are values that I hold dear, and whichhave shaped my life. I will never forget dancing with friends on the Berlin Wall as it – together with the dictatorship that built it –crumbled. They are values, though, that are under increasing threat. The optimism of the 1990s has been replaced by a belated recognition: that we must renew and protect our values in the face of a new, rising tide of authoritarianism.Last Thursday I saw a sliver of that newly emboldened authoritarianism. It is opaque and impenetrable, and it does not offer explanations. Its tools are intimidation and obfuscation. The implications for the UK are stark. We need to be clear-eyed about the threats posed by the Chinese government – and we must take action to mitigate these threats.Ministers should not simply accept this lack of transparency as the cost of doing business. We must be direct: if you will not be straight and don’t answer legitimate questions we cannot engage with you on the basis of mutual trust. That’s why, until we get a clear answer on why I was deported, no government minister should be visitingChinaon official business.We must also address therisks posedto us at home. This should begin with the government taking immediate steps to prevent the further expansion of China’s security apparatus in the UK by, once and for all,blocking proposalsfor anew Chinese “super embassy”. It seems obvious that a base for potential “spy dungeons” shouldnot be builton the site of the former Royal Mint, on the City’s doorstep – but this government has inexplicably refused to rule it out.Senior Labour figures call for review of Chinese investment in UK infrastructureRead moreThe crisis over the Scunthorpe steelworks should alsoraise fresh concernsabout the role of Chinese interests in our national infrastructure. The decision by British Steel’s owners, Jingye, toturn downthe government’s £500m offer to support the plant’s future precipitated the near collapse of the UK’s virgin steel production last week. We cannot find ourselves in a similar position again: scrambling to save a vital domestic industry that has been left to struggle by corporations based in foreign countries which do not share our interests or ideals.This adds urgency to Liberal Democrat proposals for an audit of UK-based assets owned by companies or officials from countries listed as Foreign Office human rights priorities, including China. The government should include a commitment to this in its ownUK-China audit– the publication of which, originally expected early this year, should now be completed urgently as we face new geopolitical uncertainties.Our response to the Trump administration’s unreliability mustn’t be to throw ourselves into the arms of authoritarian states like China. We must continue to stand up for our values and interests.

I’m crossing my fingers anywayTue 15 Apr 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 15 Apr 2025 10.51 EDTShareBetween environmental breakdown, economic crisis and Donald Trump, it often feels like there’s precious little reason to feel hopeful these days. So how’s this for a reason to cheer up: Italian state railway company, Trenitalia, isplanning to run trainsthrough the Channel tunnel before the decade is out. It’s studying the option of direct trains fromthe UK to Italy, too. Eagle-eyed readers may note that those are two separate propositions.Trenitalia is no stranger to the British rail network: it already operates the C2C franchise,which connectsLondon Fenchurch Street via south Essex to Southend. Last week the company announceda €1bn (£860m) planto launch a new high-speed service connecting London and Paris by 2029, as a direct competitor to the long-established Eurostar. In addition, it’s reported to be “studying the possibility” of extending the route, to Lyon, Marseille and Milan, which could be reached by train from London in eight hours. (Trenitalia already runs from Milan to Paris injust over seven hours.)If some of this sounds a little bit familiar, that’s because we’ve heard it before. Train operators are increasingly vying for ownership of new, and potentially lucrative, routes across Europe. Last month, Richard Branson’s Virgin group announced it was trying to raise £700m tofund a “high-frequency” new cross-Channel route. Switzerland’s SBB, a Dutchstartup named Heuro, a British onenamed GeminiandSpain’s Evolyn(which now seems to haveteamed up with the Italians) have all expressed an interest, too. There have been days when I’ve considered having a go myself, just for the attention.I love to travel Europe by train. But here’s what a joined-up 21st-century network needs | María RamírezRead moreAll of this sounds like good news for consumers. And it still might be. But it’s a lot easier to announce a new cross-Channel service than to actually start running any trains. In 2010,Germany’s Deutsche Bahn announced plansto run trains from London to Brussels, where they’d split, one half going to Amsterdam, the other to Cologne and Frankfurt. It never happened. Neither did theproposed daily commuter stopping servicefrom London to Lille – a pity, since it might have dealt with the absurd situation in which London’s Stratford International station has never seen a train going further than Kent.If anything, route options through the tunnel have actually declined. For several years, you could get Eurostar trains direct from Londonto Lyon, Avignon and Marseille: it felt like the supreme achievement of civilisation to be able to board a train on a drizzly Euston Road and get off in sight of the Med. That route stopped running during the pandemic, apparently never to return.Why is it so hard? The problem is neither, as one might assume, platform capacity at St Pancras International, nor space in the tunnel: both could accommodate more trains. There are other practical difficulties – a UK shortage of depot space; a Europe-wide shortage of trains – but these would surely not be barriers to a really committed operator, either. The Office of Rail Regulation says there’s space for more trains at theTemple Mills depot in Leyton, east London. (Eurostar says otherwise but, well, it would.) And while there is currently a lack of 400m trains meeting the stringent fire safety requirements required to operate through the tunnel, that’s hardly insurmountable: just pair a couple of 200m ones together. Trenitalia, which has a large fleet of trains described as “almost tunnel-ready”, says it sees no hurdle here.But the biggest issue facing these ambitious operators is border policy. Even before Brexit, the UK was not in theSchengen area, meaning that travelling on Eurostar required passport checks, which the Home Office insists must be done before boarding, rather than on board the train or on arrival. Every station served by cross-Channel trains needs both passport control facilities and cordoned-off space beyond them; where these do not exist, entire trains’ worth of passengers have been turfed off to do their paperwork at Lille. The need to scan luggage for security threats complicates things, too.All this also means a bottleneck at St Pancras. There may be space for more trains; there’s rather less for more passengers, each of whom has to pass through airport-style security measures before boarding, and even more checks since Brexit reduced capacity by a third. Trenitalia says that plans to address this problem are at “an advanced stage”, but it won’t be easy – the station is a Grade I-listed building. Add in the expense and disruption posed by all those other problems, and you can see why new services are announced a lot more frequently than they ever happen.Perhaps this time will be different. Access to rolling stock and money make the Trenitalia/Evolyn tie-up the most plausible competitor so far, with the possible exception of SBB. (Switzerland has a lot of flights to London and limited airport capacity.)Eurostaritself is promising expansion, suggesting it doesn’t think the capacity problems are insurmountable. And there’s Europe-wide pressure to replace flights with trains.For now, though, the most likely outcome here is surely a bit more competition on the existing routes from London to Paris, Brussels and Lille. That might push standards up, or ticket prices down, both of which would be good. That, though, might be as far as things go. Trains to northern Italy – or even southern France – may be technically feasible, but that doesn’t make them economically viable. Still, we can hope. After all, we all want a better future.Jonn Elledge is an author and former assistant editor of the New StatesmanExplore more on these topicsRail travelOpinionEurostarChannel TunnelEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

But are they the jobs Starmer wants to be seen to be saving?Tue 15 Apr 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 15 Apr 2025 07.26 EDTShareIt’s hard to get romantic about the death of office jobs.Nobody waxes lyrical about the glory days of working in payroll, and Bruce Springsteen doesn’t fill stadiums with soaring anthems about middle management headcount. But whether the recipient’s collar is white or blue, getting made redundant is getting made redundant, and it hurts.Last week the University and College Union warned that it expects up to10,000 jobs in academia to disappearthis year: roughly the same number as are expected to belost from the civil serviceover the next few years, or just a tenth of those expected to becut in the NHS. Though some will surely be senior posts, plenty will be relatively low-paid back office roles, often disproportionately done in the public sector by women: HR, or accounts, or one of those unsung admin roles everyone takes for granted until it’s not there.Though this is the last thing any student bogged down in Easter holiday revision wants to hear, universities now seem to be entering the end stages of a financial crisis that has been building for years, and that means a bonfire of jobs. The Office for Students (the higher education regulator for England) confirmed at the weekend that contingency plans are being drawn up for a major university going bust, amid concerns about how students would finish their degrees, or whether one bankruptcy would lead to banks panicking and calling in loans right across higher education. (There’s no shortage of candidates: three-quarters of universities could be in deficit by the end of the financial year,MPs were toldlast week.) And they’ll be even more squeezed if amooted Home Office crackdownon graduate visas for foreign students – seemingly designed to get immigration down to levels Reform UK party-minded voters might grudgingly be prepared to tolerate – goes ahead. Though the University of Dundee was given £22m by the Scottish Funding Council after warnings that it would otherwise run out of money by June, so far there’s no sign of a wider bailout.It’s obviously tin-eared to compare this reluctance to step in with the wayparliament was recalledto save Scunthorpe steelworkers: though both industries are strategically important to the nation in different ways, nobody’s currently trying to shut down the last university in Britain to the strategic advantage of their Chinese rivals. Rescuing British Steel reallywasa race against time, given blast furnaces can’t simply be switched back on again if they’re allowed to go cold. But to those on the sharp end, it certainly feels like a stark illustration of where priorities lie.Trump is pushing students towards Britain – ministers, don’t let your immigration obsession stand in the way | Polly ToynbeeRead moreThis new government is being forged in fire. Hammered and twisted by crisis abroad and domestic unpopularity, what was once molten and confusingly formless is hardening into a new, very clearly defined shape dictated by the threat from Reform UK.Ahead of English local elections at which Nigel Farage is expected to scoop up plenty of protest votes, the hastily formed new message to the Reform-curious is that Downing Street is on their side. The days of manufacturing jobs being “allowed to decline or disappear” are over,Rachel Reeves arguedat the weekend. Quite right too, in the case of a domestic steel industry underpinning our capacity to produce everything from warships to windfarms. Supporting the car industry and other major exporters through Donald Trump’s bone-headed trade war also makes perfect sense, keeping people attached to jobs until what everyone hopes is a temporary madness has passed.But it doesn’t stop there. Cutting immigration seems to be back on the agenda with a vengeance, even though the House of Lords science and technology committee recently described the reluctance to offer visas to foreign postdoctoral researchers as“an act of national self-harm”, pushing away young scientists on whom the big breakthroughs of the future (and associated commercial spin-offs) may depend. Though Britain seems to be moving inexorably closer to the EU, there will be hard limits to how far and how fast. At least until1 May, this is Nigel Farage’s world again and a Labour government just happens to live in it.Frankly, it wouldn’t hurt for politics to revolve a bit less around the sharp-elbowed middle classes, or for apprenticeships and the more than 50% of 18-year-olds who don’t actually go to university to get some love. (Though it should also be said that some of those institutions most at risk of going bust serve “red wall”, Reform-leaning areas where local students come in on the bus every day to study something practical – maybe nursing or pharmacy – before going home at night to look after their own children).But remoulding Labour policy too closely around the threat from Reform nonetheless has consequences, both political and economic. It’s dangerous to assume that disappointed liberal left voters have nowhere else to go when, in a fractured and volatile political climate, they clearly have options. It cannot be seen as wildly elitist to say that there’s a hard choice to be made between immigration and growth; that manufacturing matters but the knowledge economy is a massive engine for future prosperity; thatthree quarters of a million jobsdepend directly or indirectly on higher education; that we should have learned by now what Brexit era thinking does to national prosperity. So in forging this new era, ministers should remember that tough doesn’t always mean unbending. Steel’s usefulness comes, in part, from it being so unexpectedly flexible.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsCuts and closuresOpinionHigher educationUniversitiesLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

The only thing missing was Jana Wendt.But the reality is that this election is less a straight two-horse contest and more a scrappy three-legged race, a fragmented series of skirmishes playing out across the nation through disaggregated networks.Asthis week’s Guardian Essential Report illustrates, if “someone else” were a candidate for government it would currently have its nose narrowly in front.If a federal election was held tomorrow, to which party would you give your first preference vote in the House of Representatives (Lower house)?Of course, “someone else” is not a single entity. There are stark differences between the candidates sitting outside the majors; but they all exist as rational responses to limited choice in a world of infinite options.The Greens, defending an historic high of four lower-house seats while eyeing off further gains, emerged in the 1980s as a reaction to the dominance of Labor’s industrial base and its impact on the environment. It added salience around the climate crisis before broadening its social and economic justice chops in a bid to pitch itself as more than a party of protest.One Nation was the 1990s nativist reaction to globalisation that peeled working class votes away from both majors; and presaged Clive Palmer’s 21st century indulgences as the real local expression of Temu Trump. While their combined numbers are lower, they contribute an outsized sense of fear and loathing from the right.The “teal” independents are something altogether different, a modern-day revolt from the liberal wing of the Liberal party based on core values, particularly its refusal to address climate change. With its current policy focus and appeal to lower income workers in outer metropolitan areas, theCoalitionappears to have given up on winning back these seats.The teals’ most relevant antecedent might actually be the Catholic-aligned DLP, which split from the Labor through the 1950s and 1960s over home grown communism, keeping it out of power for nearly two decades.If the teals become anything like the political fixture the DLP was, they could be equally as disruptive, exercising real power through a disaggregated network, anchored with common infrastructure but tempered by a determination not to manifest into a formal institution.These dynamics make for an even noisier political discourse, amplified by a changing media ecosystem which sees young people finding new sources of authority through which to interpret the world.Where do you get most of your information about news and current events?As much as the vote intention table marks a tidal change, these figures show the profound shift in the way voters are consuming information with 42% of under 35s getting most of their news from a non-traditional source.These are often filtered through the eyes of lone wolf influencers, freed of the constraints of journalism, for whom reach is its own virtue.Like the political parties, the rise of these alternate voices can be read as a rational response to structural weaknesses in old gatekeeper media models, particularly when filtered through commercial self-interest or, in the case of ABC, political interventions.It is here where the atomisation of both politics and media finds a common landing point, an algorithmically charged attention economy where bravura jumps to the head of the queue.Pointedly, the major parties have accepted the role of influencers in the media, with leaders making themselves available for long form interviews with those who have earned an audience.The prime minister has embraced influencer podcasters, inviting them to cover the budget and even inserting coded words into his final speech of the term to this parliament. And just to show they are not “delulu to the solulu”, the Coalition is all-in repurposing Drake.Whether the leaders of the major parties will be forced to embrace independent representatives with the same pragmatism remains to be seen, although a final table shows that the expectation is that one of the two majors will form power in their own right.What do you think the most likely federal election outcome will be?What’s most interesting here is that only a bare majority of those intending to vote away from the major parties expect to see minority government.While there is a clear difference between desire and expectation, the consensus settling around the likelihood of one side securing a working majority may be a natural response to the instability generated by the ultimate insurgent influencer.But even if it doesn’t happen this cycle, the age profile of third-party voters means the time is fast approaching where more active power-sharing arrangements will become a reality.The truth is the complexity of our times does not lead itself to binary choices. Embracing diversity not as a performance but as a design principle will only make the future governments – whatever their flavour – more faithful custodians of the public will.For those of us who are still drawn into the theatre of the leaders’ debates and the head-to-head battle for supremacy, it might be a case of enjoying it before the worm turns.Peter Lewis is an executive director of Essential, a progressive strategic communications and research company.

Why isn’t he afraid of being replaced?Evan MoffittTue 15 Apr 2025 11.51 EDTLast modified on Tue 15 Apr 2025 12.31 EDTShareBy the time you read this article, there’s a good chance it will have already been scanned by an artificially intelligent machine. If asked about the artist David Salle, large language models such as ChatGPT or Gemini may repurpose some of the words below to come up with their answer. The bigger the data set, the more convincing the response – and Salle has been written about exhaustively since he first rose to art world stardom in the 1980s. The question is whether AI can ever say anything new about the artist and his work, or if it’s for ever condemned to generate more of the same.A similar question lingers beneath the surface of the paintings that Salle has been making since 2023, a new series of which he has just unveiled at Thaddaeus Ropac in London. His New Pastorals were made with the aid of machine-learning software, though that’s not immediately apparent from looking at them. Each monumental canvas bears broad, gestural strokes of oil paint seemingly applied by the artist’s own hand. Close study however reveals large patches of flat, digitally printed underpainting. This is the mark of the AI model which Salle has been training to generate his work – or at least something uncannily close to it.The tool can synthesise things in a matter of seconds. This evolution in painterly terms might take decadesThis machinic collaboration began with a game. Salle has long been sceptical of digital painting tools,writing in 2015that “the web’s frenetic sprawl is opposite to the type of focus required to make a painting, or, for that matter, to look at one”. Nonetheless, there is a sprawling quality to his own paintings, which layer images from such a wide range of pop and art historical references that the eye often doesn’t know where to rest. In 2021, Salle got the idea to develop a virtual game that would allow players to rearrange those painted elements using drag-and-drop tools.View image in fullscreenOne of the most highly valued painters of his generation … Salle.Photograph: Robert WrightAlthough the tech proved impractical, in the process Salle met Danika Laszuk, a software engineer at the tech startup EAT__Works, and Grant Davis, creator of the AI-powered sketchpad app Wand. Together they fed an AI image generator work by artists whose technique Salle considers foundational – Andy Warhol for colour, Edward Hopper for volume, Giorgio de Chirico for perspective, Arthur Dove for line – then asked it to produce images based on specific text prompts. “What I did was send the machine to art school,” Salle says.At first the machine was not a model student. Eerie, cartoonish figures with unnatural sheen recalled the images produced by OpenAI’s Dall-E Mini. “What’s so fundamentally unsatisfying about this kind of digital imagery?” Salle wondered. The answer, he felt, resided along the edges of its forms. “Because it’s only pixels, there’s no real differentiation between the edge of something and the thing behind it,” he explains. “There’s no way to make the edge meaningful, and in representational painting, those edges carry such a large amount of information about an artist’s style.” So he fed the machine scans of gouaches he had been making and watched the AI respond to their watery edges. “It could read the physicality of the brush stroke,” he recalls. “It fundamentally changed the machine’s way of thinking about itself.”Salle has taught at various institutions over the years, and this process felt a bit like a feedback session at an art school. Except the AI model is a very fast learner, and within a few sessions it could generate images that Salle might have come up with himself, if he’d only had more time. “The machine can synthesise things in a matter of seconds,” he says. “This evolution in painterly terms might take years or even decades.”Born in Oklahoma but raised in Wichita, Kansas, Salle was the model of precocity when he burst on to the New York scene in 1980. By 1987, he was one of the most highly valued painters of his generation, and at age 34 became the youngest artist to ever have a mid-career survey at the Whitney Museum of American Art. Such a stratospheric rise meant Salle’s market had further to fall once figurative painting was no longer in fashion, but the artist continued to labour on ever more ambitious series, including the troublesome suite of paintings at the heart of the New Pastorals. Now, figurative painting is back with a vengeance, and Salle has met the moment – or, perhaps, the moment has met him.View image in fullscreenIce Flow (2001), one of the original Pastoral paintings that Salle fed to the AI.Photograph: Robert McKeever/© David Salle/Licensed by ARS NY, NYTo produce his latest works, Salle trained the AI on the dozen sweeping Pastorals he completed between 1999 and 2000. Landscape paintings through the looking glass, they feature a couple idling by a lake, copied from a 19th-century opera scrim, rendered in harlequin colours and overlaid with inset images and designs of wildly differing styles. These vistas almost look like they were edited in Photoshop, but Salle rendered them entirely analogue. “The first thing they teach you in colour painting classes is how to establish your palette,” he recalls. “I was really showing off. I thought, ‘I can make a painting with three separate colour palettes work and you can’t stop me.’”Initial reviews of the Pastorals were mixed. Some critics described them as cold and emotionless, a charge often levied at Salle, whose demeanour can be as remote and cerebral as his paintings. “The result seems more a jumble of ingredients than a thoroughly cooked dish,” David Frankelwrote in Artforum.View image in fullscreenSuspenders (2025).Photograph: John Behrens/© David Salle / ARS New York, 2025With the New Pastorals, however, something seems to have changed. The brushstrokes are looser, faster and thicker, more abstract expressionist than anything else Salle has ever done. Their subject matter, meanwhile, is totally helter skelter, as if Salle has pulsed his older paintings in a blender. Headless bodies zoom in and out of the frame. Objects no longer seem attached to solid ground. Unnervingly, these works look more hand-painted than their referents, at least until you draw closer to their surface, where the paint is so thin in some areas that it could only have been applied by a machine.Salle always felt he hadn’t finished with the Pastorals, though he says there were other reasons why they were a good match for his AI experiment. “I realised that those paintings would give the machine material that it would understand in its own way,” he explains. “It took all these faceted shapes with different colour harmonies, and it just went to town with them – but kept the DNA of the transition, the horizon line, the mountains, the water, the couple and the figures, and then overlaid that with brushstroke edges.”Wand app creator Davis considers the introduction of the Pastorals a breakthrough moment for the model, as it required a new technique “which basically takes an image and abstracts the content on a conceptual level in order to recreate different variations”. In other words, the machine began to digest Salle’s paintings on a formal level. The Pastorals may also have been well suited to the task because the genre of landscape painting – and especially theatrical backdrops – resembles certain digital technologies in its production of illusionistic space. The New Pastorals reject the art historical imperative to create depth in a flat painting.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A floating stack of teacups anchors the composition in an otherwise turbulent space, much like the nails that Picasso and Braque painted on to their Cubist still lifes. The many fragmented, colliding bodies in Stack, on the other hand, are much harder to decode. “I’ll select an image that’s very eccentric precisely to provoke myself to do something that I probably would not have done otherwise,” Salle says.Nonetheless, the artist isn’t worried that AI will ever outpace or replace him. He sees it as another tool, like a brush or an easel. “I don’t think the machine’s taught me very much at all,” Salle declares. “I haven’t reconsidered how I think about pictorial space or composition. I’m simply taking what the machine offers after I’ve told it what I want.”View image in fullscreenWashing (2025).Photograph: John Behrens/© David Salle / ARS New York, 2025In some sense, his postmodern paintings are perfectly suited to such an experiment: sampling omnivorously from so many subjects and styles, they seem less concerned with their original sources than gleefully unbothered by the concept of originality altogether. In 1985, when Salle was at the height of his fame, the art historian Rosalind Krauss dismissed originality as a “modernist myth”; every work of art borrows from other sources, whether it acknowledges them or not. At least in their process, human artists may not differ so much from their robot kin.What AI might borrow from Salle is another question. The data collected by EAT__Works is proprietary, so his feedback won’t fuel any other artist-machines in the near future, though photographs of his new paintings, uploaded to the gallery’s public website, could conceivably be used as prompts for further AI-generated images. “In theory our model could autonomously spawn images,” Davis admits, though “the best images come from a technique that is very hands-on”. For now, AI still needs humans to train it – that is, until the student becomes the teacher.David Salle: Some Versions of Pastoral is atThaddaeus Ropac Londonuntil 8 JuneExplore more on these topicsPaintingArtArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingExhibitionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s the antithesis of gay culture – so why do I love her?Tue 15 Apr 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 15 Apr 2025 11.51 EDTShareAs a self-evidently gay man, I’ve generally been spared the awkwardness of coming out. That was, until I became a Swiftie. In recent years I have become adept at gauging the temperature of a room before revealing my predilection. Is this a safe space? Will I be sidelined or treated as a pervert because of who I choose to love? Should I lie, or just be evasive? I want to live authentically, but at what cost?Taylor Swift is at once the closest thing we have to a monoculture and the most divisive pop star of modern times. As a self-identified Swiftie, I believe her gift lies in the ability to take hyper-specific experiences and render them universal. I’ve never performed a 149-date world tour while reeling from the heartbreak of having been ghosted by Matty Healy of the 1975, but listening to I Can Do It With a Broken Heart, her song about that indignity, has helped me put on a brave face when faced by life’s more quotidian challenges. By writing a 10-minute epic about her three-month fling with Jake Gyllenhaal, Taylor gives fans space to mourn our own failed situationships or private disappointments – however fleeting or insignificant they may appear to others.When I come out as a Swiftie, I’m generally met by one of two reactions. It’s either “she saved my life” or “are you joking?” Gay men tend to lean towards the latter. This despite being a demographic typically enthralled by female pop stars, whether they’re “main pop girls” or had two “blink and you miss them” hits 15 years ago (Alexis Jordan, thank you for your service). I’ve tangled with what makes Taylor an exception to this rule. Gay culture thrives on camp and irony, whereas Taylor is aggressively earnest. Her music is designed less for the club and more for yearning over a boy you double-messaged in 2015 and never heard back from.Typically, gay men like to be perceived as tastemakers, considering anything once cool to be tragic the second it hits the mainstream. We police celebrities with the same critical eye that we cast on ourselves (try having self-esteem when gay Twitter has you convinced that Chris Pratt has a “dad bod”). Taylor is unavoidably uncool: the consensus is that she is allergic to “serving” on a red carpet and has a charming dorkiness which no cavalry of stylists seems equipped to eradicate.From Judy Garland to Britney Spears, gay men tend to idolise stars with tragic backstories, equating their struggles with our own, and finding strength in their strength. Taylor is the furthest thing from an underdog. While Mariah Carey says her sister attempted to pimp her when she was 12, Taylor was raised by bankers on a Christmas tree farm and given a gender-neutral name in order to succeed in corporate America (as she arguably has). Her own perceived sense of victimhood centres on tales of high school ostracism and being interrupted by Kanye West at an awards show in 2009 – an event that has been referenced on four of her subsequent albums, most recently last year. (OK, maybe there is something inherently camp about publicly nursing a 16-year grudge.)Taylor Swift: You Need to Calm Down – videoUnlike Madonna or Lady Gaga, she hasn’t explicitly cultivated a gay audience. Her 2006 debut included the lyric: “So go and tell your friends that I’m obsessive and crazy / That’s fine, I’ll tell mine you’re gay.” That version was withdrawn, resulting in a much-memed eBay listing for a “Taylor Swift debut CD (homophobic version)”. In 2019, she was inspired to write the Lover single You Need to Calm Down after a friend pointed out that her position on gay rights was unclear. With lyrics such as “Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD?” – referencing the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation – the result was well-meaning but heavy-handed. She played New York City’s Stonewall Inn for a surprise Pride month performance, but her activism stalled soon after. In a relative absence of a consistent stance on the matter, some Swifties – or “gaylors” – have constructed elaborate conspiracy theories about a supposed secret relationship between Taylor and supermodel (and former BFF) Karlie Kloss (arguably two of the straightest women to have ever lived).Taylor Swift’s people shut down speculation about her sexuality – but risked rebuking her LGBTQ fansRead moreI wonder whether the resistance goes deeper. Gay culture encourages us to evolve, reinvent and leave the past behind: if society says you are unworthy for long enough, you start to believe it. The skinny bullied child transforms into a muscled Adonis, essentially becoming the boys we feared in high school. Taylor’s Eras tour embraced all her previous incarnations, however messy or cringe those teenage corkscrew curls and fairytale ballgowns were. Perhaps her refusal to erase her awkward history is confronting for her gay male fans to witness. What if we could all regard our past selves, however naive or clumsy, with tenderness instead of embarrassment?I love being queer. But being in gay spaces can evoke complicated feelings. There’s joy at having found a sense of belonging that many of us were denied growing up, coupled with the insecurities that arise when a traumatised community starts to eat itself – imposing impossible standards about what counts as hot, aspirational or cool. For me, watching the Eras tour was a comparatively simple pleasure. Surrounded by demented Swifties as I honked along to We Are Never Getting Back Together, I was undeniably cringe. But for three hours, I was free.Explore more on these topicsTaylor SwiftPop and rockLGBTQ+ rightscommentShareReuse this content"

They also certified him as a bona fide celebrity and sex symbol – the kind that can inspirelookalike contests.Australians might be forgiven for not knowing the 27-year-old actor is one of us: aside from a handful of small roles (including his feature film debut, aged 17 in Stephan Elliott’sSwinging Safari– “I think I said two words, probably ‘shag me’,” he says) – he’s mostly played Americans and Brits.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningElordi’s casting as Dorrigo Evans in the screen adaptation of Richard Flanagan’s2014 Booker prize-winningepic,The Narrow Road to the Deep North, out this month on Prime Video in Australia and later this year on the BBC in the UK, marks his first lead role playing an Australian.The trailer for The Narrow Road to the Deep North.Partly inspired by the legendary Edward “Weary” Dunlop and partly inspired by Flanagan’s own father, Dorrigo is an Australian Army medical officer turned Japanese prisoner of war on the Burma-Thailand railway, fighting to keep his comrades alive. He takes psychological refuge from the brutality of the jungle, back-breaking labour and his captors in memories of a unresolved love affair.Like Flanagan’s novel, the five-part series takes place within three distinct timeframes: the prewar “summer of love” Dorrigo shares with his uncle’s much younger wife, Amy, played by Odessa Young (warning: graphic sex); the years as a PoW in the jungle (warning: graphic gore); and the 1980s, as an ageing, cynical and emotionally remote Dorrigo (played by Ciarán Hinds) takes stock of his life.View image in fullscreenDorrigo Evans (Jacob Elordi) meets Amy Mulvaney (Odessa Young) for the first time in a bookshop.Photograph: Ingvar Kenne/Curio/Sony Pictures TelevisionThe preparation for the PoW scenes was gruelling, requiring more than just emaciated bodies. The reality of forced hard labour coupled with starvation meant Narrow Road’s PoW survivors had to be skin and sinew.The cast undertook a medically supervised six-week boot camp in rainforest south of Sydney to achieve the effect. Elordi says the on-screen camaraderie mirrors the close relationships the actors formed while shedding weight over that time.“We were all in it together, so there was this great overwhelming amount of love in the whole process,” says the actor.“It was incredibly challenging but deeply necessary, of course … because nobody wanted to phone that in or make a mockery of it.”View image in fullscreenThe Narrow Road to the Deep North is partly set in a PoW work camp in Thailand.Photograph: Ingvar Kenne/Curio/Sony Pictures TelevisionSkin in the gameNarrow Road marks an important first for director Justin Kurzel and screenwriter Shaun Grant – the collaborative duo have never worked on a television series before – but the sense of moral responsibility around retelling traumatic episodes of Australian history is familiar ground. Their 2011 film,Snowtown, told the true story of one of Australia’s most grisly series of murders, while their 2021 film,Nitram, examined the events leading up to Tasmania’s Port Arthur massacre.Added to this was the gravitas of Flanagan’s book, the winner of seven major literary prizes including the Booker, and a work that earned the author the highest of praise, with the Economist dubbing Flanagan “the finest Australian novelist of his generation” and the New York Review of Books counting him “among the most versatile writers in the English language”.Like Flanagan, whose father was a Japanese PoW during the second world war, both director and screenwriter felt they had skin in the game. Kurzel’s grandfather was one of the Rats of Tobruk, and Grant’s grandfather was a survivor of the Burma-Thailand railroad.The Narrow Road to the Deep North first look review – Jacob Elordi’s war epic is big, bold and deeply pleasurableRead more“In a lot of ways, [he] was who I was writing it for,” says Grant. “My grandfather was a very flawed man, and even though I loved him dearly, I may have looked at him and judged him in certain ways.“When I first read Richard’s book, it felt like I really got to know my grandfather for the first time, to feel what he must have gone through … because he never talked about any of that himself.“The only time I remember him talking about that time was when I mentioned to him I’d watched The Bridge Over the River Kwai. ‘We never whistled,’ was all he said.”View image in fullscreenIn his later life, celebrated as a war hero, Dorrigo (played by Ciarán Hinds) grapples with memories of his time working on the ‘Death Railway’.Photograph: Ingvar Kenne/Curio/Sony Pictures TelevisionWhile Hinds’ older Dorrigo carries the trauma of survivor’s guilt, a disdain for sentimentality and an obsession with self-reliance, Elordi believes his young Dorrigo hints at many of the flaws that only reveal themselves later in the character’s life.“A lot of who he is was there before the war – there’s this inherent stoic selfishness … and a lust for the immediacy,” Elordi says of Dorrigo, who embarks on an affair with Amy while engaged to his future wife, Ella (played as a young woman by Olivia DeJonge, and later by a wearily resigned Heather Mitchell).“He’s like a man on an odyssey his whole life – a singular hero’s journey – and I think that is greatest flaw,” says Elordi. “But strangely, in some ways, I also struggle to call it a flaw … it’s what made him human, and what got him through the war.”A cinematic odysseyFellow Tasmanians Kurzel and Flanagan have enjoyed a close friendship for many years, which added a further layer of weighty responsibility to the project, the director says.Some characters in the series come across significantly more sympathetically than in the book: like Simon Baker’s Uncle Keith, whose capacity to attract a beautiful young wife and keep her pulling beers behind the sticky counter of his country pub is more believable on screen; and Major Nakamura (Shô Kasamatsu), who seems almost as trapped in the jungle as the Australians he is guarding. This is simply part of the organic process of transforming literature into film, Kurzel says.View image in fullscreen‘In terms of making a TV series, it is a piece of cinema’ … Justin Kurzel.Photograph: Andreas Rentz/Getty Images“As soon as you put anyone on screen, you find the good and bad in them,” he says. “That’s what’s so special about cinema – you can see it on the actors’ faces, you can feel another dimension to them.”There was no discussion with Flanagan about redressing one of the few criticisms levelled at the book: that its depiction of the Burma-Thailand railway construction largely ignored the fact that while about 2,800 Australian soldiers perished during its construction,almost 100,000 south-east Asian civilians also lost their livesunder the same conditions.Kurzel disputes the criticism.“There are really beautiful moments and observations in the book from the [Australian] soldiers recognising that other slave labour was happening at the time. And Richard [also] included the point of view of the Japanese soldiers after the war, [and the impact] of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.“But in terms of making a TV series, it is a piece of cinema. There is something so singular about Dorrigo. It is a story told from his point of view and that’s the way it played out – we wanted everything to be seen through the prism of Dorrigo.”The Narrow Road to the Deep Northwill premiere on Prime Video in Australia, New Zealand, the US and Canada on 18 AprilExplore more on these topicsTelevisionRichard FlanaganAustralian televisionJacob ElordifeaturesShareReuse this content"

But while he is widely celebrated for his work in literature and activism, Zephaniah’s influence on music remains relatively overlooked.Emerging from the dub poetry scene, Zephaniah channelled personal experiences of systemic racism and state violence into intelligent spoken word. Albums such as Rasta combined politically charged poetry with dub rhythms and studio effects, laying the cultural groundwork for UK genres such as trip-hop, jungle and dubstep. We revisit his unique collaborations in electronic music, hearing from the artists who had the honour of working with him.Natty x Mala x Benjamin Zephaniah – Word & Sound (2019)Zephaniah’s Rastafari-inspired wisdom, Natty’s roots-infused minimalism and Mala’s DMZ-era dubstep combine to raise the consciousness vibration in Word & Sound – an uplifting, intergenerational union years in the making. “Benjamin was like an older brother to me, we were sometimes on the phone for hours,” Natty says. “So when I asked him to be part of a project I was doing, he wrote his verse immediately.” They recorded at Akala’s Ladbroke Grove studio in London then spent hours listening to Zephaniah’s stories – including his rightous refusal of an MBE.Natty says the vocals were meant for the trackBadman (Rastafari mix),but when Mala reached out, the dubstep producer was sent them instead. “Working with such powerful voices was something else,” says Mala. “Their words guided my creative process. Benjamin’s verse is a reminder to stay true and keep growing in heart and spirit. Rest in peace, sir, we salute you.”Natty continues to include the track in his live sets in memory of his friend. “Whenever we met, we’d sometimes spar, as we both studied martial arts. I remember how strong he was, which made his passing even harder to accept. He was just a down-to-earth, brilliant human being. I’m so grateful to have known and learned from him.”Kofi Stone – May Sound Crazy (ft Benjamin Zepheniah) (2024)Born-and-bred Brummies Kofi Stone and Zephaniah are a force to be reckoned with in this collaboration – one of Zephaniah’s last, recorded in summer 2023. He steps into the resilient role of mentor in this ambient electronic-infused hip-hop track, as Stone reflects on growing up in Birmingham and navigating poverty and racism. “It was truly an experience I’ll never forget,” Stone says.Ahead of the recording, Stone met Zephaniah outside the Birmingham Hippodrome, where he was narrating the Peaky Blinders ballet. “Before the show, we spoke at length about family, music and the state of the world,” recalls Stone. “He later drove us to the studio and recorded his verse in just a few takes. The whole process was surreal and beautiful.”The video to the track was produced months later. “Benjamin was actually quite unwell at the time,” says Stone, “but he was determined to make the shoot. We filmed his scene on a rooftop car park in Birmingham’s Chinatown.” That was [another] day I’ll never forget.”Bomb the Bass – Empire (with Sinéad O’Connor & Benjamin Zephaniah) (1995)Zephaniah joined Bomb the Bass and Sinéad O’Connor to deliver a critique of colonialism in this trip-hop-influenced production, imagining a life-sucking vampire as a metaphor for empire. Tim Simenon, AKA Bomb the Bass, says: “I remember smoking a lot of weed with Sinéad while recording Empire. She sang the lead vocal in one take, then added harmonies and backing vocals.”Simenon instinctively knew that Zephaniah’s voice would contrast powerfully. “He was such a warm, open guy. We spent a long day in the studio, bouncing ideas around until we landed on the spacious delivery we recorded. He gave the final mix an approving head nod – he was super pleased with the result. We mostly spoke about music, especially dub. We shared a love for Big Youth, Lee ‘Scratch’ Perry and On-U Sound.”LB Dub Corp: I Have a Dream (ft Benjamin Zephaniah) (2013)I Have a Dream pairs Zephaniah’s cheeky twist on Martin Luther King’s iconic speech with atmospheric dub techno. It’s one of two tracks featuring him on Luke Slater’s LB Dub Corp albumUnknown Origin, the other being Take a Ride. “When I reached out about combining a track with his poemI Have a Scheme, he was up for it straight away,” Slater says. “We somehow ended up debating vegan food in China.”Reflecting on their final exchange, Slater said: “Benjamin had just received the album copies I sent and told me he played the track for his students. I was humbled. I miss him in this dimension, but his words live on.” He had intended to ask him to collaborate a second time. “Then a week later he was gone. He left too soon. His words always carried a message – not always comfortable, never bland. His delivery cut through class barriers and reached people from all walks of life.”Swayzak – Illegal (ft Benjamin Zephaniah) (2000)The duo Swayzak captured Zephaniah’s rebellious spirit in this unapologetically anarchic track. “Working with Benjamin was an unexpected delight,” says James S Taylor. “There was no ego, no pressure, just good vibes.” The collaboration quickly grew into a friendship. “We talked deeply about politics and the British empire,” David Brown says. “The Brummie West Indian poet – quite a person to have in one’s life.”A 2024 “redraft” of Zephaniah’s 1999 poem Illegal was released under the titleDo Something Illegalas a tribute to Zephaniah under Brown’s ambient alias, the Eightsome Reel. The track ends with the sound of heavy rain, recorded the day Brown learned of Zephaniah’s death. “It hit me hard – I was in East Kilbride when I heard, a place where he once lived.”Moby – Where is Your Pride (ft Benjamin Zephaniah) (2024)Released in June 2024 as part of his album, Always Centered at Night, Moby’s Where Is Your Pride? is a tribute to Zephaniah. He says: “As a vegan activist and as a wise and compassionate man, Benjamin inspired me for many years. I hope Where Is Your Pride? honours his legacy and also draws people’s attention to his life, work and principles.”Explore more on these topicsBenjamin ZephaniahElectronic musicReggaeDance musicPoetryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The reluctant stars of A New Kind of Wilderness talk about a world without MariaPatrick BarkhamTue 15 Apr 2025 05.00 EDTSharePeace hangs over a farm in ruralNorway. The last of the melting snow lingers in hummocks and bikes are strewn outside the Payne family’s small rented cottage. Nik Payne materialises from behind the barn where he has been feeding the cows. One of his three children, Falk, 12, is lying on the sofa with a fever and a Biggles novel; later, Freja, 15, and Ulv, nine (known as Wolf or Wolfie), return from school. Their home is as warm and chaotic as any family’s – boots and coats strewn in the hallway, a fridge covered in photos, shelves of books – but with a few differences: there is no television and behind the living room door is an unobtrusive, very personal shrine.The Paynes find themselves the reluctant stars of a film, A New Kind of Wilderness, which has won awards at Sundance and other festivals around the world. This documentary begins, deceptively,as Variety put it, “like Swiss Family Robinson updated for the era of Instagram cottagecore”. The children, with their older half-sister Ronja, are being raised by Nik, an Englishman, and his Norwegian wife Maria to be “wild and free”: home-schooled, creative, growing their own food, living closely and gently with nature.Then tragedy strikes. In 2019, Maria falls ill with cancer and dies, aged 41. With sensitivity and intimacy, film-maker Silje Evensmo Jacobsen follows what happens next as the grief-stricken Nik tries to stay true to the beliefs and daily patterns of living he created with Maria, home schooling his bereft children and trying to protect his family. I defy anyone to watch it dry-eyed.View image in fullscreenUlv and Maria in A New Kind of Wilderness.Photograph: Maria VatneNow the Paynes are travelling the world, attending Q&As at film festivals where the documentary has been rapturously received. At their first festival, they all watched the film again with the audience. “That was a mistake, because it still affects us in many ways and we’re fighting back the tears,” says Nik. “Now we sometimes go in for the last 10 minutes.” Is it traumatic to relive their tragedy? “I see it as good, a cathartic process, bringing it up again,” he says. “Grief is an ongoing thing. Grief changes you for ever. It’s part of you for ever but it’s not the defining part.”The film is so intensely moving perhaps because the people at its heart are not showy or spectacular. Nik, who makes yoghurt and bakes bread as we chat in his kitchen, is a private, deep-thinking man who radiates self-sufficiency. Watching him grieve on film is agonising.“At the start, the grief takes your breath away. You’re left gasping for the next breath. The only thing you can do is just breathe. It’s the contemplation of having to endure things for a long time that becomes unbearable, not the thing itself,” he says. “It was so important for me that I had the kids. You haven’t any choice but to get up. It’s impossible to be miserable all the time because they come up with spontaneous joy. They are in their grief in a different way, for shorter periods. They don’t sit in it, like we do.”View image in fullscreenNik Payne.Photograph: Elin Høyland/The GuardianHe and Maria met through a mutual friend when Nik, who had grown up on a dairy farm near Chester, worked as a flying instructor in Portugal. “We really hit it off,” he says. Soon after, he visited her in Norway. “Within six weeks, I’d moved over.” Maria’s daughter from an earlier relationship, Ronja, was four at the time, and the three of them chose to live in the countryside; 364 days after Nik moved to Norway, Freja was born. They bought a smallholding and Maria taught photography and film-making, and then started a blog about their life. “I was the one who did the farm and grew the food,” says Nik.Jacobsen saw Maria’s blog and in 2014 made a pilot film about the family living close to nature. No broadcasters picked it up, but when Jacobsen got back in touch after Maria’s death, Nik decided to let her into the family’s shattered life because Maria would have wanted it. “For me, it was a completely unnatural thing. Maria was more extroverted, more into film-making, and had wanted to start this project,” he says. “In her blog, she shared everything about our lives – the good stuff but also the hard stuff, including her own illness. She was very honest, so I decided to go for it as a kind of legacy for her. Maybe it will help someone out there.”What emerges is a series of dilemmas as harsh reality challenges Nik’s pure ideals, particularly his quest for self-sufficiency and a creative education for his children. In the absence of Maria, he tries so hard to provide everything for them: he grows food, cooks, brushes Wolfie’s long blond hair and teaches them at home even when he knows his Norwegian is not quite up to scratch. But he must also earn a living. Did he reach a point where he was overwhelmed by trying to do it all? “Probably every day, and then I had to start again the next day. That’s why I had to send them to school.”This is a climactic moment in the film. Did sending them to school feel like a defeat? Or doing the right thing? “It’s a continuous feeling of defeat or disappointment. They really did enjoy the home schooling and they would have liked to continue. I had hoped that I could give them that, but I couldn’t see a way to do it.”View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenFrom top: Freja, Falk and Ulv. All photographs: Elin Høyland/The GuardianDespite their initial fears, the children settle into mainstream education, although this forces another uncomfortable confrontation with reality when Freja brings home a school iPad (all Norwegian children are issued them). Many tech-sceptic parents will recognise the grimace on Nik’s face when his children huddle round the iPad in rapture as Freja plays a game.It’s heartbreaking how alone Nik appears at this time. He had some counselling while Maria was dying but it was halted rather abruptly and, as stubbornly self-reliant as ever, Nik vowed to become his own therapist. “Maria always talked about ‘doing the inner work’. For years, I didn’t know what she was talking about, but I started to, slowly but surely.” What about friends? Talking wouldn’t have helped, he says. “I was just alone. It’s the loneliness of the last speaker of a dead language. That’s how I felt.”It was sometimes comforting having the film-maker in their home. “Silje was very good – she came and hung out with us without filming and became a friend I could talk to off camera,” he says. But Nik worried about exposing the children. “She wanted to film how Freja was feeling, and I had to put my foot down and say, ‘I don’t want you to do any more now.’ There’s a scene where Freja has read a letter from Ronja and I came in because I just wanted to check Freja was all right. Often I’d be hiding outside the bedroom if she was being talked to by Silje, just to …” He tails off. “We all enjoyed having Silje around most of the time, but there were definitely times when it was, ‘Ohhhft, I could do without that.’”Being filmed selling their dream farm was one of those moments. Nik’s labouring and tree surgery couldn’t pay their mortgage. All this pain is leavened by beauty and humour, much of the latter provided by Wolf. When Falk mourns their farm for having everything, Wolfie chips in: “But not pet whales.”View image in fullscreenUlv on the trampoline.Photograph: Elin Høyland/The GuardianWhile Freja and Falk are cautious and thoughtful, like their dad, Wolfie is a bundle of energy, arriving home from school on his bike like a whirlwind before performing multiple somersaults on the trampoline.“You need some comedic relief in a movie like that, I think,” says Freja of her little brother, who has, according to Nik, “been eating his weight in pancakes and jam” at festival hotel buffets. “The fun part [of the festivals] is when they call up your name if you’ve won something,” says Wolfie, who points to a gold starfish-shaped gong from Egypt and another award from Hungary on their windowsill. The film has been shown on Norwegian television and is now being released in Japan, where their chic Nordic knitwear (all knitted by Granny – Maria’s mother) has proved particularly popular.For much of the two years Silje filmed the family, Nik assumed that if the project was ever finished it would play at some obscure eastern European film festival “watched by three people, one of whom is asleep”. He first saw it at home by himself and “blubbed all the way through. It was difficult to be objective, to see what sort of film it really is, but I was happy there wasn’t anything in there I couldn’t stand behind.” He had no clue it would be so well received until Sundance, when the audience whooped and whistled, giving a standing ovation when they realised the family were in the auditorium.At home, theSundance world cinema grand jury prizeis placed in the shrine beside Maria’s photograph, plus two peacock feathers and other precious objects they remember her by. Maria would be so delighted by the award, thinks Nik. “She studied film and some of the guys that she studied with have said she dreamed of winning something at Sundance.”They still remember Maria at dinner. “We light a candle before each meal and hold hands. We’re not religious as such but we give thanks for the food, the day we’ve had and each other, and we send love up to Maria,” says Nik.View image in fullscreenNik and the family cat, Raa-Tee.Photograph: Elin Høyland/The GuardianThe Paynes are perhaps closer than many families – with more chat at mealtimes – but they don’t want to be defined by their grief. Freja is happy at school; Nik rolls his eyes about her smartphone-time but she also raises and sells chickens for pocket money. Nik hopes to home-school Falk and Wolf again for a year before they start secondary. He is also writing a book about his experiences and aiming to buy a modest smallholding to pursue farming and self-sufficiency. The film may be successful but documentaries don’t tend to make much money; Nik says he hasn’t received any revenue from it. “I’m fortunate enough not to be a money-oriented person. I would actually feel uncomfortable if I was making money out of that. I like the fact that it’s something I can give.”In the film, Nik shrugs off his dad’s suggestion that he find a new partner, but now says he enjoyed a brief relationship last year – “It was good to realise that I’m still alive” – before realising they had different visions for their lives. Does he feel lonely? He pauses for a longer-than-usual thought. “Sometimes, maybe. I’m somebody who is naturally good with his own company. I read a lot, I think a lot, there are plenty of people around I can talk to, if I want to. Sometimes, at dinner time when the kids are bickering or talking about fart humour, I think, oh God, I wish there was an adult to talk to.”The children aren’t having that.“No!” says Wolf. “He wants to talk about farts. We don’t.”“It’s like being at a chimpanzee’s tea party with him,” says Freja, and the sunny Norwegian spring day is brightened by their laughter.A New Kind of Wilderness is out on 16 May.

The cast open upStuart HeritageTue 15 Apr 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 15 Apr 2025 02.50 EDTShareOver the last few years, we have found ourselves inundated with sadcoms. Again and again, we’ve been deluged by ostensible comedies that are so concerned with grief and trauma that the laughs end up feeling like a distant afterthought. Striking the right balance between comedy and drama takes absurd levels of effort and craft at the best of times. Doing it with a premise as bleak as BBC Three’s new series Just Act Normal is almost impossible.My hands are tied with embargos, so I have to be vague about certain plot details, but Just Act Normal is a show about three young siblings who decide to struggle on as normal after their mother – a perennially unreliable woman with substance abuse issues – disappears. Their lives are suddenly spent trying to navigate the complex systems of the adult world while processing the grief of abandonment in real time. Sounds like grim stuff (Disney’sGood American Familyrecently tackled a similar subject in the form of full-blown melodrama), and yet there’s a palpable lightness of touch to Just Act Normal. You could almost call it joy.“We were always, like, ‘This is a warped fairytale,’” says director Nathaniel Martello-White of the show’s complicated tonal balance, as we talk on Zoom. “The kind of comedy and drama in the series reminds me of the way that fairytales swing from extreme moments of joy to intense moments of pain and destruction. So I’d always tell these guys to try to find those kinds of archetypes and references for the characters.”“These guys” are Akins Subair and Chenée Taylor (also present on the Zoom) who play Tionne and Tiana, two of the siblings who suddenly find themselves alone in the world. Janice Okoh adapted Just Act Normal from her 2013 playThree Birds, and to say that the play left these youngsters with big shoes to fill is a woeful understatement. Taylor’s part, for instance, was initially played by Michaela Coel.View image in fullscreenAstonishing … (from left) Akins Subair, Chenée Taylor and Kaydrah Walker-Wilkie in Just Act Normal.Photograph: Ben Gregory-Ring/BBC/The Forge“I wasn’t familiar with it,” Taylor says of the play. “I didn’t try to find it to watch, either, just because I didn’t want it to influence my performance in any way.” On following a presence as large as Coel’s, she says: “It scared me for a second. But then I thought about it and said, ‘No, it doesn’t scare me.’ They’re two different things, the play and the series, do you know what I mean?”Subair had even less familiarity with the material, only auditioning the weekend before filming began. “I got the job on Friday, and I was going to a football game on the Sunday, so I just had the Saturday to familiarise myself with the entire script and get everything cemented in my head.” Subair is a Londoner andShaheen Baig, the show’s casting director, sent him a YouTube video of the West Midlands dialect he needed to master. “But as you can imagine, with all of it happening so abruptly, I didn’t really have time to go over the YouTube video countless times,” he says.What’s remarkable about this is that you completely buy Taylor and Subair (and Kaydrah Walker-Willkie, who rounds out the trio as younger sister Tanika) as siblings. They enmeshed at speed, according to Taylor, over a series of Nando’s dinners, and the result is a comprehensive portrait of a group of people struggling through a painful experience.View image in fullscreen‘Nobody in my family is from the industry’ … Chenée Taylor in Just Act Normal.Photograph: Ben Gregory-Ring/BBC/The ForgeYou could call it loss, but that isn’t quite the word for what they go through. “Their mother is a functioning addict,” says Martello-White. “The reason why these three children have this resilience is that, although their mum loved them, they’ve also been managing that aspect of their lives. When Tianna steps up as the surrogate mother of the family, she’s been playing that role for the last four or five years.”As well as Okoh’s script, Martello-White credits the successful balance of comedy and drama to the casting. “While it was a very, very important, serious subject matter, it was being dealt with in this quite mischievous, playful way,” he says. “The process became about finding actors who can deliver that flavour. I was looking for people who have this kind of charisma and authenticity, which these two have in abundance.”Both Subair and Taylor are television newcomers. “Nobody in my family is from the industry,” reveals Taylor, aBirminghamnative. “I moved to London when I was 18, so I could go to a part-time drama school, and work part-time. I really hustled. I worked in a bar, I worked in a theatre. When you tell people you want to be an actor, they all say ‘Oh, go and work in a theatre, you can make connections.’ That is not what I did. I served drinks and I took people to their seats.”“Similar to Chenée, I didn’t go to drama school,” adds Subair. “I actually studied economics. But acting has always been plan A for me. Once I graduated, I went to a drama school spinoff called Hackney Showroom, which essentially provides opportunities for people of working-class backgrounds who may not have had the opportunity to go to these prestigious schools such as Rada or Lamda.”View image in fullscreenFantastic … Sam Buchanan and Jamelia in Just Act Normal.Photograph: Ben Gregory-Ring/BBC/The ForgeThe cast is rounded out by an impressive list of heavy hitters. Romola Garai plays a teacher caught between concern and self-interest.Back to Black’s Sam Buchanan does a fantastic job confounding the trope of the estate drug dealer. Ivanno Jeremiah is heartbreaking as the children’s estranged father. And then there is Jamelia (most recent screen credit: Celebs Go Dating), who damn near steals the show as a kind of maternal stand-in figure.“She’s very funny,” laughs Martello-White. “Just for that role, I wanted to do something meta and cast a musician as a Tina Turner impersonator. Obviously Jamelia is a Brummie, and she’s an incredible musician, so it was kind of, ‘Oh, let’s see what Jamelia is doing.’ And she really wanted to start getting into more comedy and premium TV, so all those things aligned. I’m really glad it worked out, because she’s just got so much in front of the camera. Again, it’s a very serious storyline so you really want it to feel grounded, but we were also looking for that absurdity, which she did fantastically.”More than anything, though, Just Act Normal is an incredible showcase for some astonishing young actors. This is already shaping up to be a landmark year for amazing new discoveries – it can’t hurt that Baig is also the woman who found Owen Cooper forAdolescence– and Just Act Normal only accelerates that. The play might have left the actors with big shoes to fill, but we’ll be talking about this cast for years.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionDramaRomola GaraiBBC ThreeBirminghamfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I am serious about giving up acting … [There are] a lot of things I want to do with my life”.Blanchett was speaking as BBC Radio 4 prepared to air her first major radio play,an adaptation of Wallace Shawn’s play The Feverabout a woman who undergoes a political and spiritual awakening. Blanchett has just completed a five-week run on stageas Arkadina in Chekhov’s The Seagullat London’s Barbican theatre, and her most recent major film role, opposite Michael Fassbender as a married spy in theSteven Soderbergh-directed thiller Black Bag, was released in March.Blanchett has won numerous awards for her acting, including two Oscars (best actress for Blue Jasmine in 2014 and best supporting actress for The Aviator in 2005) and two best actress awards at the Venice film festival (for I’m Not There in 2007 and Tár in 2022).She recently finished working on a new film directed by Jim Jarmusch, Father, Mother, Sister, Brother, which is due for release in 2025 (though was surprisingly omitted from therecent announcement of the lineup for the Cannes film festival), and is currently working on Alpha Gang, a sci-fi comedy directed by David and Nathan Zellner, as both actor and producer. She is also attached (again as both actor and producer) through her production company Dirty Films to The Champions, a film to be directed by Ben Stiller.Despite her high levels of activity, Blanchett says in the interview that she is uncomfortable with her position as a celebrity actor.“I’ve always felt like I’m on the periphery of things, so I’m always surprised when I belong anywhere. I go with curiosity into whatever environment that I’m in, not expecting to be accepted or welcomed. I’ve spent a lifetime getting comfortable with the feeling of being uncomfortable.”She added: “No one is more boring to me than myself and I find other people much more interesting. I find myself profoundly dull.”Explore more on these topicsFilmCate BlanchettRadioRadio 4BBCRadio industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Hantavirus is a rare but potentially fatal disease spread by infected rodent droppings.The medical examiner, Dr Heather Jarrell,told the Santa Fe New Mexicanthat someone suffering from hantavirus without treatment can die “very quickly” after the later stage sets in, potentially in 24 to 48 hours. “It’s not uncommon to find someone down on the floor as part of a terminal collapse, so to speak, and that may very well have been what happened,” she said.The disease causes flu-like symptoms such as fatigue, fever and muscle aches at first – before respiratory symptoms appear approximately a week later, including coughing, shortness of breath and the lungs filling with fluid, according to the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC).According to the report, the property contained eight outbuildings that showed signs of infestation, while the main house was “clean”, with no signs of infestation. However, there were sightings of rodents, a nest and faeces on vehicles on the property, and live traps were found in the outbuildings.The assessment was carried out to determine the level of hazard to first responders and emergency personnel, and concluded the level of risk in the main residence was “low”.Edward Helmore contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsGene HackmannewsShareReuse this content"

There’s her childhood growing up as an adopted mixed-race girl in a white family in 1960s Romford in eastLondon, and her time as the impossibly cool frontwoman of the Selecter. Black is a brilliantly blunt straight-talker and very funny. Here she is joking about her open marriage in the hippy 70s: “I did get the hump one time, when I came home, and she was using my frying pan.” (She is still happily married to her husband.)Pauline Black: ‘My most unappealing habit? Bluntness’Read moreBlack was adopted as a baby and at that time in Romford racism was everywhere. “It would come at you like a slap.” Even in her family, she remembers an uncle singing the praises of Enoch Powell. When she was 10, Black was sexually abused by a neighbour (her parents’ reaction was appalling). Her childhood made her mistrustful; lonely and alienated, she spent hours practising the piano and reading. In 1979, Black was working as a radiographer in Coventry when the Selecter took off – and she changed her name from Pauline Vickers to Pauline Black. (“I don’t think my family ever forgave me.”)The Selecter were not the biggest band signed to 2-Tone Records, but they were pioneering: six out of seven members were people of colour and they had a female singer. DJ Don Letts says Black was the first lady of 2 Tone and today, she is still rocking her 70s rude girl look: the sharp boy’s suits and pork pie hats. After three years, she left the band, did some acting and TV presenting before the Selecter re-formed. Black co-wrote this documentary, and arguably she exercises a bit too much control; that said, given everything in her personal history, you can see why she wants to tell it her way.Pauline Black: A 2-Tone Story is on Sky Arts and Now on 16 April.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsMusic documentarySkaRaceLondonreviewsShareReuse this content"

Recently, she’s taken up writer-director duties (she made her debut in 2018 with acomedy called Half Magic) while continuing to star as well, and this sophomore effort impresses with its mildly acidic observations of contemporary mores. There aren’t exactly belly laughs in this tale of single yoga instructor Ann (Graham), but quite a few of zingers and bits that stick the landing nicely thanks to fluent direction and good comic timing from Graham and her excellent supporting cast, which is filled out by cracking actors who might not often be given as much spotlight as they get here.That’s entirely fitting given that the plot, as the title might suggest, is all about the greater value of the friends and loved ones you make throughout life as opposed to the toxic monsters you’re saddled with at birth. In Ann’s case, that pretty much goes for her whole nuclear family, from zealous Christian wingnut dad (Michael Gross) and narcissistic mom (Julie Halston) to her admittedly damaged but still totally vile sister Clio (Julia Stiles, having fun sinking her teeth into the role). Graham’s script perhaps makes Ann just a bit too nice and a co-dependent martyr to these nightmare people.However the plot moves along when a video of her letting off steam and denouncing all of her relatives in an angry rant (while wearing a bikini) goes viral, thereby boosting business. Meanwhile, she’s got charming buddies, including sharp-tongued Roz (Andrea Savage), chef Max (Thomas Lennon) and polyglot Frances (Odessa Rae) who are close enough friends they don’t mind telling her the truth when necessary. The fizzy group chemistry is palpable every time the gang gets together on screen.That honesty is sorely needed when Ann starts dating Steve (John Brotherton), a lovely bloke who’s kind, mostly stable, and great in bed. The “but” comes in the shape of his preteen daughter Lilly (Ella Grace Helton, tremendous), a spoiled, manipulative psychopath in a ballet school tutu who feels threatened by Steve loving anyone apart from her. While contemporary narrative grammar might lead viewers to expect fireworks from the ending, it is instead a little anti-climactic – but all the more realistic for that. It results in a film that feels like the product of lots of therapy, meditation and – judging by Graham’s still impressively svelte physique – lashings of yoga. Good for her, she deserves a bit of success after all the dross she had to do for the money over the years.Chosen Family is on digital platforms from 21 AprilExplore more on these topicsFilmComedy filmsJulia StilesYogaComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

A serial killer who terrorised south London for decades has been caught, and Isabel, one of his victims many years ago, has been told of the arrest. “He’s called Nigel,” she says, sardonically, to her former partner, Edward, who was in bed beside her when their home was invaded by the killer. “What were you expecting? Adolf?” he answers.Dean previously told the story of a daughter’s escape from the family home where her father had chained her up, inGirl A, and of a school shooting inDay One, both excellent and disturbing novels. She is out this time to explore a series of sadistic crimes, but also the impact they have had on the survivors. A love story too, that of Isabel and Edward, who meet as students. But how does any romance survive after the violence and cruelty of what they go through? Dean cleverly weaves together past and present for maximum impact, moving from the courtroom where a series of victims are explaining how Nigel Wood ripped their lives apart, to the burgeoning lives of Isabel and Edward inching inexorably towards their meeting with a killer. This is a classy, elegant thriller – just like its protagonist, the enjoyably prickly Isabel.Jensen depicts with great tenderness a family struggling for money but not for loveAlafair Burke brings us another slice of sheer class inThe Note(Faber & Faber), in which May, Lauren and Kelsey head to the Hamptons for a long-awaited reunion. Friends at summer camp in their youth, they have all, in different ways, since been publicly shamed. While knocking back the drinks, the trio are irritated by a couple stealing their parking spot. “It’s like there’s no such thing as shame any more. So it’s not just about a parking spot … People are objectively horrible now,” rants May. After more drinks, they decide to leave a note on the couple’s car. Karma. “He’s cheating. He always does.” But then the man goes missing and the three of them find themselves in the middle of a missing persons investigation, which brings to light old secrets and crimes. Burke is a pleasure to read, her characters believable and problematic and interesting. And the twists and turns of her plot are perfectly planned.There are three strong women at the heart of Louise Jensen’sThe Liar(HQ): Mel, a social worker, and her daughters Jen, 26, and Amy, 13. Their close relationship is the novel’s beating heart, and Jensen depicts with great tenderness a family struggling for money but not for love. But then Mel heads off to see her brother, leaving Jen in charge of meeting the new lodger, Luke. Then Mel stops getting in touch and Luke starts behaving strangely, going through their things and asking odd questions. Does he know anything about Mel’s disappearance, and was Jen right to let him into their house? The problems build as Amy chats naively to a stranger online and Jen starts to wonder who she can trust, while secrets from her past come back to haunt her. This is a nicely put together thriller shot through with panache.Chuck Wendig’sThe Staircase in the Woods(Del Rey) takes a seemingly straightforward format – “five teenagers went into the woods. Only four of them came out” – and adds a healthy dose of horror to it. There’s the police investigation, of course, asking Lauren, Nick, Owen and Hamish what happened to Matty that night. But the four friends know that they’ll never be able to admit the truth – that a strange staircase appeared in the woods, and Matty walked up it and vanished at the top. Twenty years later, they have tried to forget what happened. “Don’t even think about it. Don’t think about that day. Don’t put his name in your mind.” But they’re brought back together when the staircase reappears, and decide to go looking for the friend they abandoned years earlier. I won’t spoil what lies at the top, but it’s pleasingly nightmarish and very messed up. I’ll be honest: it’s more horror than thriller, so count yourself duly warned. But for all ye brave enough to enter here, it’s a deliciously scary tale of friendship and courage – as well as evil, murder and all that jazz.To orderThe Death of Us,The Note,The LiarorThe Staircase in the Woods,click on the titles or go toguardianbookshop.com.

The Thicket takes place in a hard, snowbound wilderness interspersed with equally hard, snowbound little townships consisting mainly of bars and brothels. You can see the breath in the air and the blood on the snow. The plot is staple horse opera: a kidnapped maiden must be rescued by a motley group of good-ish guys with mixed motives, headed up by Dinklage playing a bounty hunter character offering a similar vein of dry, world-weary cynicism as his breakthrough role as Tyrion in Game of Thrones, only much less aristocratic. He is joined by Gbenga Akinnagbe as his right hand man, with whom Dinklage has nice chemistry, and Levon Hawke, as a naive young Christian whose sister has been kidnapped by ruffians.The ruffians are where the film really does something unusual, via a simple but intriguing gambit. In the book on which The Thicket is based, the main villain, a man, is called Cut Throat Bill. Here, Cut Throat Bill is played byJuliette Lewis. It isn’t exactly a case of trendy, gender-blind casting; while the character is still called Cut Throat Bill, and assumed by those who haven’t met him to be a man, as soon as Lewis encounters anyone, it is very clear that the character is perceived as female. “He’s a she,” and so on. Cut Throat Bill doesn’t correct them, but continues to go by that name. You might read the character as genderfluid or trans, but existing in a world that didn’t have any vocabulary for this, and the film makes no attempt to retrofit modern ideas on to a historical setting. Cut Throat Bill is Cut Throat Bill.Be warned though, if you’re looking for a joy-filled queer-friendly narrative, this isn’t it. This is a western in the mode ofThe Proposition: grim characters dying grim deaths with a reasonable amount of downtime between kills. Indeed, for those seeking the thrills and spills of an action-packed shoot ’em up, it’s probably somewhat too stately. But it is an odd, mostly compelling yarn, and acted with gusto and shot with real physical commitment to the wide open spaces and raw chill of the elements.The Thicket is on digital platforms in the UK from 21 April, and on DVD from 26 May. It is streaming on Prime in Australia.Explore more on these topicsFilmWesternsPeter DinklageJuliette LewisreviewsShareReuse this content"

Six or so months after Enoch Powell had delivered his infamously racist “rivers of blood” speech in Birmingham, David Winnick – who was then the MP for Croydon South – had decided to attack the Tory fashion for bemoaning immigration to the UK from such countries as India and Pakistan and expressing faux sympathy with deprived communities in British cities. “Many of those who act as the champions of the white person against immigrants,” he said, “have not in the past gone out of their way to defend the interests of the white working class.”As theEconomistjournalist Joel Budd points out in this nuanced, enlightening book about the people and places Winnick was referring to, this was the first time “white working class” had been used to describe a certain kind of Briton. And in that sense, that small parliamentary moment was a prescient glimpse of a subject that would explode half a century later, when hostility to immigration fed into the result of the 2016 referendum on Brexit. At that point, the term “white working class’” became more ubiquitous than ever, and an insurgent political right made up of Powell’s political heirs – split between Tory Brexiters and the forces led by Nigel Farage – affected to speak for a kind of voter they claimed had been neglected and betrayed.Underdogsis based on a powerful argument: that as those political changes happened, the media’s understanding of whole swaths of the UK – and England in particular – was warped. In places that had backed Brexit, microphones tended to be pointed at irate older men who probably did not have that much to moan about, while younger, less angry, more economically precarious people were overlooked.The book’s best material is about the messy and often fitful ways that society progresses“The white working-class Britons with the problems,” Budd points out, “are not the white working-class Britons with the complaints.” More specifically, “a young woman living in a poor coastal town… who is now working in a shop and trying to raise a child without much help from her sickly mother or her erratically employed ex-boyfriend… has very severe problems. A retired miner who is in a stable marriage, who owns his house and two cars, has many fewer problems.”To get nearer the truth, Budd tends to concentrate on such elemental themes as place, housing and work: his is the kind of journalism that works as accessible sociology. Early on in the book, he divides largely working-class communities into three broad categories. “Heartlands” are old industrial centres, often seemingly locked into decline. An “enclave” is the kind of place – sometimes on the periphery of a big city – “that was once overwhelmingly white and working class but is becoming less so”. Most interesting, perhaps, are what he terms “colonies”, to which people have moved from other places. Some are archetypal new towns, but Budd explores Thetford in Norfolk, “one of the oddest andmost wonderful placesin Britain” where local factories drew families from east London half a century ago, and many latter-day cliches quickly fall apart. When he talks to the locals, he finds that “awareness of their own history as migrants takes the edge off xenophobic instincts … in half a dozen trips to Thetford, I have never heard anyone complain that immigrants are failing to assimilate”.The book’s best material is like this, all about the messy and often fitful ways that society progresses, and written in elegant, understated prose that acts as the proverbial window pane. The New Parks estate in Leicester, Budd says, was once kept largely white thanks to the reluctance of black and Asian people to try moving there, and plentiful instances of local young men committing shocking acts of racist violence. Now, by contrast, its population is increasingly diverse, and white residents offer level-headed opinions that would gladden liberal hearts: “It’s not good for Leicester to be split into whites, blacks, Asians, Chinese or whatever.”Up close, even people with apparently reactionary instincts can turn out to have more nuanced thoughts, something highlighted by a sixtysomething resident of the same city whom Budd calls John. “There’s two sides now,” John says. “There’s the immigrants, and there’s families that were born here.” But only a breath or two later, he offers the opinion that “Britain’s always been a racist country… the English working class thought they were a cut above the Irish, then above the Windrush [sic], then above the Asians.” Even people who might recently have been derided using the dread – and rather snobbish – insult of “gammon” sometimes turn out to be more complicated than they first let on.View image in fullscreenWythenshawe in Manchester, where a community centre was flooded with donations ‘when word got around that newly arrived Afghan families needed them’.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianEveryday life, moreover, contains plenty of evidence of the quiet solidarity and small kindnesses people who live outside working-class communities barely see. In the south Mancunian neighbourhood ofWythenshawe, some people “speak sharply about asylum seekers”, but a community centre “was flooded with pushchairs and other donations when word got around that newly arrived Afghan families needed them”. At one point, Budd wonders if the nastiness that defines some well-heeled rightwing politicians is often projected on to places where it runs a lot less deep, meaning that “the prejudices of the suburban golf club are imputed to the council-estate boxing club… a kind of ventriloquised xenophobia.”There’s an occasional sense that these insights should have been developed further: when the narrative flow is disrupted by apparent reprises of Budd’s past journalism about the rise and fall of armed robbery and the cult of so-called highly modified cars, it feels as if he is wasting space on things that barely touch his key themes. He also ends up making a series of half-cocked political points that sometimes verge on the risible: “Britain does not need lots more social housing”, for example, is a claim that would probably cause most of the people he encounters to loudly guffaw. But most ofUnderdogsvividly illustrates the point it was written to make: that in a political era as overheated and mendacious as ours, the plain truths of everyday life need to be heard and understood. In that sense, this book is not just well-timed but admirably powerful.Underdogs: The Truth About Britain’s White Working Classby Joel Budd is published by Picador (£20).

Following on the heels of a successful Rachel Zegler-led revival of Romeo and Juliet, which supposedly broke records for the greatest share of under-25 ticket buyers for a Broadway show, another non-musical from the theatrical canon has a gen Z update of sorts, also featuring a familiar yet youthful face. Sadie Sink, best known for Netflix’s Stranger Things, stars in John Proctor Is the Villain, which turns on the ubiquity of The Crucible in high school English classes.But the show, from Broadway-debuting playwright Kimberly Belflower, is not a strict retelling of that Arthur Miller classic. Proctor takes place in a “one-stoplight town” in Georgia, where beloved teacher Carter Smith (Gabriel Ebert) has just saved the high school’s nascent and endangered feminism club by agreeing to serve as its administration-handling sponsor. Overachieving and excitable Beth (Fina Strazza) is delighted, especially now that she’s befriended Nell (Morgan Scott), a recent transplant from Atlanta who’s even more up on intersectional-feminism discourse than she is. Two more founding members, Ivy (Maggie Kuntz) and Raelynn (Amalia Yoo), seem like they may be involved in the club more out of loyal friendship – which is just what Raelynn needs in the aftermath of a recent breakup.Smash review – canceled TV drama gains new life on BroadwayRead moreThe girls, along with boys Mason (Nihar Duvvuri) and Lee (Hagan Oliveras), also populate Mr Smith’s junior-year honors English course (for simplicity’s sake, and presumably to reflect the school’s smallness, the class has the unlikely low enrollment of just seven or eight students). In the midst of a unit on The Crucible, the class sees the return of their own quasi-harlot figure: Raelynn’s former bestie Shelby (Sink), who supposedly seduced Raelynn’s now-ex-boyfriend before disappearing from school for months on end. As the girls grapple with this awkwardness, it casts a new light on their interpretations of Miller’s allegory for red scare “witch-hunts” – a term that, as Mr Carter points out, has been used with increasing frequency lately.Further developments are best left for discovery; even with plenty of portent roiling below the chipper banter of earnest teenagers, preview audiences still audibly gasped at certain shifts in relationship dynamics. The play is set in 2018, during a period of both reckoning and hot-potato caution over rising #MeToo accusations, but it’s not pitched as a Crucible for Our Times (not least because it may already count as a period piece). Instead, Belflower captures both the giddiness and devastation of girls starting to get a fuller picture of the world and their place in it, for better and worse.Though some of the performers are still quite young – Sink has played characters older than Shelby, but not by much – their embodiment of adolescent nerves can nonetheless come across like Saturday Night Live cast members playing teenagers in sketches. That’s not a hello-fellow-kids attack on their authenticity, though. Quite the opposite: it’s an acknowledgment of how funny and endearing the cast is, even or especially in their more outsized mannerisms. Strazza is especially grabby as a 16-year-old whose combination of book smarts and small-town inexperience make her read, at times, like an awkward elementary-schooler, and Scott shows off ace comic timing. While the actors and Belflower don’t mock characters’ sincerity, the writing does poke some good-natured fun at the endless asterisking that comes with young people attempting to do right by their progressive attitudes. Eventually, genuine anger and frustration pop through.The Last Five Years review – Nick Jonas and Adrienne Warren soar in relationship musicalRead moreSome theater buffs may blanch at a play with so little subtext; befitting the impulsiveness of youth, many characters eventually blurt out what they’re thinking. (Take a look at the play’s title for some hints on where those thoughts are going.) There ultimately isn’t much moral ambiguity in play, either. And even those more open to what could be described as a thornier and more intellectualized Degrassi marathon might resist some of the details – like how nearly every pop-music reference made by these high school juniors happens to sync up almost perfectly with the easily scannable tastes of countless decades-older thirtysomethings. (It’s not surprising or unbelievable that these girls love Taylor Swift and Lorde in 2018, of course, but isn’t it also a little easy?)Yet as much as the play feels informed by pop music, teen movies and TV soaps (and a millennial’s attempt to see through gen Z eyes), it also carries an impressive theatrical charge. Belflower’s dialogue flows beautifully even when it tests the boundaries of realism, with well-placed laugh lines that relieve more and more tension as the show goes on; it’s a thrill to watch the characters find their voices. Some key later moments in this barreling 105-minute one-act, especially its extended climax, might have been eye-rolling in another medium. In a theatrical context, though, this material feels more thoughtful about the potentially cathartic nature of performance, and what it means for that performance to cross between the private and the public. In the end, John Proctor Is the Villain doesn’t feel like a show designed to goose youth-audience ticket sales; it feels like one that will engage and electrify a teenage audience, and plenty of adults too.Explore more on these topicsBroadwayTheatreUS theaterreviewsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.It was about seven minutes into my cycle ride that the first signs of addiction became apparent. My ebike’s “power assist” button felt more like a morphine clicker as we climbed the misty hills of Bucovina in northern Romania. Sergiu, my group’s guide, knew what I was up to. “Be honest with yourself – only use ‘turbo’ if you have to!” he shouted. My thumb cowered under the handlebar.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.On previous adventures I’ve resisted assistance, maintaining that battery power is the preserve of the unserious. Nowadays, though, my pins aren’t as powerful, and on these vertiginous hills the extra oomph was near essential. But as with all drugs, moderation is key. After all, one wouldn’t want to run out of juice on hills that are home to wolves, bears and lynx.Romania cycleI’d been invited to take part in tour operator Slow Cyclist’s inaugural ebike ride (and hike) along a section of Romania’sVia Transilvanica. Dubbed the “Camino of the east”, the trail ties together ancient trade and livestock droving trails, threading its way south-west from Putna, near the Ukrainian border, to the village of Drobeta-Turnu Severin, 870 miles (1,400km) away and within spitting distance of Serbia.Equal parts eco-tourism attraction, art project and economic lifeline, the Via Transilvanica is a trail with a tale. It was conceived by environmentalist Alin Ușeriu and his brother Tiberiu (once imprisoned for armed robberyand now a celebrity ultrarunner) who successfully navigated corruption, mafia interests and the natural obstacles of the Carpathian mountain range. It’s as much a triumph of resilience as of route planning. Over four and a half years, defying the odds, they carved a path uniting seven regions, powered by hundreds of volunteers. The result? A compelling invitation to lose yourself in Romania’s time-travelling countryside.Having been strong-armed into attending a family wedding back home, I arrived two days into the adventure. By chance, that meant narrowly missing a huge storm, which had given the others in my group a good dousing the day before. I caught up with them, a little windswept but in good spirits, outside a 16th-century monastery in Vatra Moldoviței, about 20 miles south of Putna. It has one of eight Unesco-listed churches in the region that are unique for their exterior frescoes, which were designed, Sergiu told us, as “bibles for the illiterate”. They’ve been remarkably well preserved thanks to some clever architecture and posh paint. The Voroneț blue, made from rare lapis lazuli, still pops.View image in fullscreenThe painted Church at Moldovita Monastery.Photograph: Robert Wyatt/AlamySome parts of the trail are too steep and slippery for all but the most advanced bikers, so we tackled the morning’s section on foot. The rain had abated and the air was full of the scent of wet conifer, exotic soil and wood smoke. The views were already living up to the snaps inSlow Cyclist’s brochure: Swiss-style mountain meadows, pine-spiked peaks and farmsteads which wouldn’t look out of place in a Robert Eggers folk horror movie.Cow bells pealed, though I soon realised they weren’t being worn by heifers, but by the hulking Bucovina shepherd dogs that guard the herd from wolves, bears and passing hikers. “Stay in the pack or they’ll think they’ve separated you,” warned Sergiu. The beasts slowly approached with bellowing barks, but Sergiu’s ready bag of treats kept the peace.I tore downhill – tongue out, heart hammering – chasing the blur of bikes through the trees. No bears, alas, but brilliant ridingIf you’re hiking or biking in these hills, Sergiu is a good man to have at the helm. Besides being to the mountain born, he was chosen byTășuleasa Social– the NGO run by the Ușeriu brothers – to map the Via Transilvanica from a cyclist’s perspective. He duly did a recce of all 870 miles on two wheels. “If you don’t know the trail, you can die,” he warned. “Some climbs are almost vertical.” Indeed, this is the debut route in the Slow Cyclist’s new Expedition Series – built for more adventurous cyclists, rather than the lunch-with-cycling crowd.That said, our midday stops were things of simple beauty: cold cuts, the reddest of tomatoes and homemade cheeses. With moreish plum brandy on the table, I felt fortified for the afternoon ride. Support vehicles and a friendly team were on hand with pumps and Allen keys before we put our push irons to the task.View image in fullscreenLunches of cold cuts and homemade cheeses.Photograph: Ryan Le Garrec“We’re about to go uphill. Would anybody like a sugar hit?” asked Sergiu. As we burned through calories up to a rudimentary ski station with another almighty view, we were grateful for the nutty bars he’d handed out. So much open space and not a soul in sight. I checked with my group and they had met only three other hikers since the trip began.The next morning began with a gentle weave through meadows dotted with pudding-shaped haystacks. Then, without much warning, we dropped into an ancient forest – the kind that feels like the setting for a Brothers Grimm tale. “What’s living in here?” I asked. “Bears, deer, even lynx sometimes,” said Sergiu casually. “But you’ll be lucky to see them.”The forest marked my first attempt at single-track riding. I hung back on purpose, letting the others slip ahead, then tore downhill – tongue out, heart hammering – chasing the blur of bikes through the trees. No bears, alas, but brilliant riding.Way markers by different sculptors stand sentry every kilometre of the trail. ‘It’s the world’s longest art gallery,’ said our guideIt was here that I noticed the 250kg slabs of anthracite, way markers by different sculptors which stand sentry every kilometre of the trail. Each one is carved and marked with a bold orange T (for Transilvanica). “It’s the world’s longest art gallery,” said Iancu, our second guide. “The trail was built by volunteers – people who gave up their free time for something bigger than themselves, so I think that says a lot.”One of the Via Transilvanica’s missions is to stem the flow of people leaving the countryside, giving them a reason to stay or even come back. Over lunch on my second day’s ride, with Iancu translating, I spoke to our host, who told me the number of visitors she receives has increased sixfold since the trail opened in 2022.That night’s lodgings at La Moara guesthouse – all carved wood and Alpine dreams – offered another wink to Switzerland. At dinner, I couldn’t resist a second helping of the găluște broth: meaty semolina dumplings floating in a dill-filled cuddle of a soup. The mains were chicken paprikash and a towering heap of baked polenta mixed with unpasteurised cheese from our hosts’ own flock.View image in fullscreenDamien Gabet with the owner of Maria Bidian – Punct Gastronomic Local restaurant in Transylvania.Photograph: Damien GabetOn the final day, the afternoon run was up a ski slope and the varying fitness levels of the group became more obvious. Thumbs hovered over the power assist button, but even at max power it was a challenge. By now, I’d found my stride and was loving the sweat session. Others were struggling, though, which made things a little stop-start. I’d advise checking, before you book, whether others in the group are more or less at your level.That notwithstanding, the Slow Cyclist team has struck a lovely balance between cardio and culture, offering a rosy glimpse of Romania’s past and present – via a muddy dive into its dreamy countryside. Over three days, I’d ridden through fairytale landscapes and eaten like a happy Saxon farmer. I’ve already vowed to return to ride more of the trail.We crested the final hill in a loose, panting line and stopped while Sergiu made friends with a farmer who was following cows around with a milk pail.

The arrival of asparagus season always feels like a little celebration of spring and longer, brighter days ahead. British asparagus, the best in the world, adds a fresh, seasonal touch that makes this rice really special. It’s the perfect one-pot recipe for the first al fresco meal of the year, with simple ingredients that come together beautifully, and with saffron bringing its delicate aroma and golden warmth. This is a great minimal-effort way to enjoy the new season – and every bite.Spring lamb and asparagus rice with saffron and finoPrep10 minCook35 minServes42 tbsp olive oil300g lamb leg steaks, diced1 onion, peeled and finely chopped3 garlic cloves, peeled and finely sliced1 tsp sweet smokedpaprika1 pinch saffron, soaked in 2 tbsp just-boiled water for 10 minutes300g Spanish short-grain rice(eg, bomba)120ml fino850ml hot chicken stock, or vegetable stock300g British asparagus, trimmed and cut into thirdsJuice of ½ lemonSalt andblack pepperYou’ll need to soak the saffron in two tablespoons of just-boiled water for 10 minutes.Put the oil in a wide, shallow pan on a medium heat, then fry the lamb pieces, turning often, for five or six minutes, until browned all over. Lift out with a slotted spoon and set aside.In the same pan, saute the onion and garlic for five minutes, just until softened. Stir in the smoked paprika and saffron, then add the rice. Deglaze the pan with the sherry, then let it bubble away until it’s nearly evaporated.Return the lamb to the pan, pour in the hot stock, then simmer for 15 minutes without stirring. Scatter the asparagus over the top and leave to cook for another five minutes, until both the spears and the rice are tender.Squeeze over the lemon juice, season and serve straight from the pan.Explore more on these topicsSpanish food and drinkEasterSpring food and drinkRiceFoodLambMeatrecipesShareReuse this content"

Our panel of expert cooks has a host of ideas …Anna BerrillTue 15 Apr 2025 09.00 EDTShareWhat are the best sides to pair with lamb at Easter?“Lamb has a deep, rich flavour; it’s distinctive, but it’s versatile, too,” say Jay Claus and Syrus Pickhaver ofRake at The Compton Armsin north London. “As long as you render the fat slowly and fully, so the flavour is released and the lamb is tender, you can take it in all sorts of directions.” Something “with good salinity”, be that gherkins or anchovies, is as good a start as any in their book, as is erring towards a “Greek vibe” for Anna Hedworth, author ofService(think “yoghurty, fresh or sharp things, such as tzatziki or salsa verde”). Happily, lamb also lends itself “beautifully to an abundance of fresh herbs, and to spring produce – asparagus, wild garlic, peas, fennel and globe artichokes,” adds Ben Allen, head chef atthe Parakeetin north-west London.When it comes to specific sides, however, that all really depends on how you’re cooking the lamb. That said, we can all agree potatoes are non-negotiable. “If the lamb is quite simple [with herbs and garlic, say], it can take the robustness of a dauphinoise,” says regular Guardian columnistGeorgina Hayden. The richest spud dish of all gets Claus and Pickhaver’s vote, too – but with added anchovies to tick their salty box: “Slice potatoes and onions thinly, add anchovies and layer in an oven dish. Cover with cream, milk and some butter, then bake gently.” Hedworth, meanwhile, keeps things simpler, preferring to roast cubes of potato with lots of olive oil, garlic, rosemary and lemon peel, until “crisp on the outside and soft inside”.Don’t forget to eat your greens, either. Hedworth suggests braising cabbage or cavolo nero to dress up with salsa verde: “Blitz whatever herbs you can get your hands on – mint, tarragon, dill, parsley – with garlic, dijon, red-wine vinegar, olive oil and salt.” Otherwise, give peas a chance: “These should be Birds Eye and unsullied by anything more creative than salt and butter,” say Claus and Pickhaver. Carrots, on the other hand, should be accompanied by thyme and honey and cooked “so they’rereallysticky”, Hayden says, or a mustard cream, which is on Rake’s menu alongside a Barnsley chop: “Thin strands of carrot are soaked in sweet vinegar, then we add creme fraiche and a lot of dijon; the creaminess matches the fatty lamb, but it’s light and sweet.”For a taste of sunnier climes, Hedworth puts cherry tomatoes (halved, if large) in a tray with smoked paprika, onion seeds, sugar, salt, olive oil and a mix of toasted and ground coriander seeds, cumin seeds and cardamom seeds. Roast until “fully soft and starting to blacken”, then pile on to Greek yoghurt: “The lamb juices melt into the tomatoes and yoghurt, making them really delicious.” For another simple side, Allen would be inclined to knock up a Turkish-style salad with chickpeas, cucumber, plenty of herbs and sumac. “Then just toss everything in olive oil and a squeeze of lemon for a vibrant, refreshing side.”And if you’re going down the spiced lamb route – a slow-cooked shoulder with harissa, for example – rice would be very nice. “I’d make a lovely, herby pilaf to soak up all of those juices,” Hayden says, alongside some spiced carrots and braised fennel to seal the deal for the weekend’s big meal.Got a culinary dilemma?
