Then she changed her mind – and scooped comedy’s biggest prizeWed 27 Aug 2025 10.53 EDTLast modified on Wed 27 Aug 2025 15.25 EDTShareThere’s efficiency, then there’s the process that led to Sam Nicoresti winning the most prestigious award in live comedy. “A year ago my girlfriend asked me to marry her,” says Nicoresti onaccepting the £10,000 prize last weekend. “[When] we were talking about how to pay for the wedding, I joked and said, ‘It’s easy, I’ll just win the Edinburgh comedy award’.” Can it be true? Is Nicoresti not only the first transgender winner of the so-called Oscars of comedy, but the first ever to manifest victory by force of strategic will?“It’s amazing what you can do,” she grins, three days after her triumph, “if you set your mind to something.” And that’s what Nicoresti has done in the last 12 months, turning around a niche career in alt-comedy, pointing it towards stardom, and pressing her pedal to the metal.Her winning show Baby Doomerwas palpably the set of a comic zeroing in on a mass audience – notwithstanding the hot-potato status of her subject, life as a trans woman, nor her background in leftfield humour with a collective called Weirdos. Nicoresti’s previous biggest hit was a satirical multimedia show with the memorable title Cancel Anti Wokeflake Snow Culture.The comic, originally from Birmingham, is quitting Edinburgh in a state of exhaustion – and probably still some shock – when we speak. Of the moment when her name was announced and her place confirmed in the ex-Perrier award pantheon (former winners: Steve Coogan, The League of Gentlemen, Bridget Christie and many more), Nicoresti says only that “it was very surreal. You get swept off the stage instantly into the press junket. They won’t let you go back to your friends. It felt like the president had been assassinated and I was being ferried away to be sworn in.”In case the awards organisers are listening, she suggests an improvement. “They should decide who the winner is at the start of the fringe. It’s weird to leave it to the very end when you’re tired and haggard and ill. Everyone wants to ask you questions, and all you want to do is sleep.”View image in fullscreen‘They should decide who the winner is at the start of the fringe’ … picking up her Edinburgh Comedy award.Photograph: Roberto Ricciuti/Getty ImagesThere’ll be time for sleep soon enough – although not that soon, as the London run of Baby Doomer is imminent and has just been extended. Audiences can expect a high joke-count show built around one big-hitting anecdote, which recounts a humiliating experience in a changing room. The comic works up that story – of being misgendered; of trying on an ill-fitting dress – into something fantastically farcical, without soft-soaping what it implies about life as a trans woman today. That’s characteristic: the show addresses its creator’s difficulty fitting in as a woman, but its chosen analogy for Nicoresti’s transition, proffered with great nerdy enthusiasm, is the metamorphosis of the hobbit Sméagol in Lord of the Rings into the monster Gollum. Elsewhere, it alludes to the comic’s recent breakdown, and her visit to a PTSD support group – all with lightness of touch, conviviality, and more joyful self-deprecation than self-pity.How conscious was Nicoresti that she was, for the first time, making a non-niche, crowd-pleasing standup show? “This year we came in strong,” she admits, “with a dream and a goal in mind. In previous years, I’ve focused on the art and just wanted to make something silly. But the fringe is so expensive now that it doesn’t make sense to bring up work that isn’t ready.” She was also scarred by her experience with2022’s Wokeflake, whose title and concept attracted critical attention, but at a level that the show, then only a work-in-progress, wasn’t quite ready for. Says Nicoresti: “I wasn’t prepared to make that mistake again.”This is a concept show, but the concept is that I am doing ‘a standup hour’For Baby Doomer, she assembled a creative team that included first-time director (and longtime comedy promoter) David Hardcastle, and performed the show almost 30 times prior to the fringe. “I usually approach each show with a concept, whether it’s about dreams, aliens, or whatever. And I saw this one as a concept show too, but the concept was that I was doing ‘a standup hour’” – as opposed to the sketch, character or multimedia work she’d majored in previously. All of Baby Doomer’s routines went through rigorous testing, as five- or 10-minute sets in comedy clubs, before making it into the show.That’s an exacting standard to set yourself, particularly if you’re making a show on a topic that’s both personally and politically sensitive. Nicoresti had intended, she tells me,notto address gender at all in Baby Doomer. She first came out as transgender as part of the process of making Wokeflake – and, across the months and years of its stage life, that show documented the early, uncertain stages of her transition. “So when I moved on to the next show, the rule I set myself was: I’m not going to mention it at all. I failed! Actually this whole show is a monumental failure!”View image in fullscreen‘The joke is king’ … Nicoresti performing Baby Doomer.Photograph: PRIt wasthe supreme court ruling in April, that the legal definition of a woman did not include transgender women, that prompted a rethink. “I hadn’t wanted to get pigeonholed. I didn’t want to seem as if I was ‘going on about it’. But then the ruling happened and I thought, ‘Oh no, it probablyisgood that we talk about this.’” But the “talking about it” was subject to a strict directive. “As a private citizen, I’m angry, I’m upset and scared. But as a comedian, the joke is paramount. You don’t want to make people feel like they’re being preached to. The joke is king.”She feels similarly about headlines this weekend greeting the first transgender comedian to win Edinburgh’s comedy award. “Obviously, it’s cool,” says the comic (who cites “seeing more queer and trans people coming to my gigs” as her main ambition post-award triumph). “But you can see there’s a framing happening that you’re not in control of. With these two shows, I’ve tried to express something about how a queer experience can actually be universal. And because of that, I got some acclaim. But part of the acclaim is ‘trans this, trans that’. So it’s a little ironic.”On balance, Nicoresti might prefer to be seen simply as another great comic to win the award. Ask what inspired her career in comedy, and she’ll regale you with personal icons (Vic and Bob,Bill Hicks,Maria Bamford), and with tales of transcribing comedy acts in her teens, breaking them down into their component parts (“that’s a rule of three, that’s a callback”). While studying at the University of Sheffield, she found her tribe among the alt-comics, circling acts such asJohn KearnsandThe Delightful Sausage. “I fell in with people making weird stuff and I realised I like making weird stuff,” she says. “Alternative comedy is fully in my bones. It’s more adjacent to theatre and film, in trying to express something that maybe you don’t feel you can put into words.”It’s really hard to be a standup if you don’t know what you’re about, the audience will smell it on youFor Nicoresti, that something was her gender identity. And it wasn’t until she came out as trans that she felt able to give solo standup a good go. “It’s really hard to be a standup on stage if you don’t know what you’re about,” she realises now. “Because the audience will smell it on you, that there’s something you’re hiding or not expressing. The more open I’ve got with myself, the more I’m able to dig down and find those experiences that are funny on a deeper-rooted level.”Not that self-knowledge has made life easy. As Baby Doomer suggests, being transgender may be, for Nicoresti at least, as much a journey as a destination – and not one without its bumps in the road. Happy to report, after the quasi-spiritual experience described in the show, when she passed nine times throughthe Mên-an-Tol stones in Cornwall, famed for their healing properties, “I’ve felt fine since. Absolutely fine! I mean, life is hard at the moment, but it’s hard for everyone. I take the RD Laing approach of, it’s perfectly rational for us to feel insane.” But generally, she says, “I’m feeling good right now.”And ready, after triumphing at the comedy awards, to take the entertainment world by storm? Well, one thing at a time. There’s a wedding to organise first. And as for the comedy, “the cycle is always the same,” says Nicoresti. “In January and February I get depressed and decide that I am the worst comedian in the world. Then in March I have a kernel of an idea, and we go again. Maybe that process might take longer now, because after the award I’ll get to tour this show. But apart from that – well, I’ve never won it before, so I don’t know what happens next.”Sam Nicoresti: Baby Doomer is at Soho theatre, London, 2-13 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsStageComedy (Culture)Comedy (Stage)Edinburgh festivalFestivalsEdinburgh festival 2025Awards and prizesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here’s a look back at their two-year romanceElle HuntWed 27 Aug 2025 14.01 EDTLast modified on Wed 27 Aug 2025 14.58 EDTShareIt’s a love story; she said yes. Taylor Swift, not long ago hailed asthe world’s most famous “childless cat lady”, is tying the knot. She announced her engagement to footballer Travis Kelce, her partner of two years, on Instagram on Tuesday. The post was liked more than 14.5m times in just two hours, and reportedly crashed the platform for many users.View image in fullscreenSwift cheering Kelce on during the 2023 game when they went public as a couple.Photograph: Jason Hanna/Getty ImagesKelce is a tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs. He and Swift publicly debuted their relationship in September 2023, when she attended the Chiefs’ game against the Chicago Bears in Kansas City, Missouri. (The Chiefs won.) The fact she popped up in Kelce’s private suite alongside his mother, Donna, and other friends and family, and left with him for a private afterparty, led fans to speculate that this wasn’t their first date.View image in fullscreenKelce tried to get backstage to meet Swift when  her Eras tour came to Arrowhead Stadium, Kansas City.Photograph: Fernando Leon/TAS23/Getty Images for TAS Rights ManagementSwift and Kelce had in fact been publicly linked since the summer of 2023, but this was no tabloid gossip-mongering – the source of the speculation began with Kelce himself. Attending her Eras concert at Arrowhead Stadium in July 2023, Kelce tried to get backstage to meet Swift and give her a friendship bracelet with his phone number on it. He later told the story on New Heights, the podcast he hosts with his brother Jason, saying he was “disappointed” and “a little butt-hurt” to miss out on the introduction.Kelce’s name-drop on his podcast was quick to reach Team Swift – and clearly piqued her curiosity. Weeks later, news outlets reported that the pair were “hanging out”. He eventually responded to the rumours in mid-September. “I threw the ball in her court, and I told her, ‘I’ve seen you rock the stage at Arrowhead. You might have to come see me rock the stage at Arrowhead’,” he said on The Pat McAfee Show. Swift popped up in his family box days later.Part of fans’ excitement about the emergent “Tayvis” pairing derived from the fact that Kelce was seen as such a significant departure from Swift’s previous partners. In the past, she has been linked to fellow musicians (including John Mayer, Joe Jonas, Harry Styles, DJ Calvin Harris and the 1975 singer Matty Healy) and actors (Jake Gyllenhaal, Tom Hiddleston and, most recently, Joe Alwyn). Kelce not only bucked the pattern of fellow entertainers, but also captured Swifties’ imagination as being a stand-in for the popular jock Swift often pined for in the songs she wrote as a teenager.View image in fullscreenThe frenzy over Tayvis peaked when Swift showed up at MetLife Stadium, New Jersey.Photograph: Elsa/Getty ImagesThe frenzy over Swift and Kelce’s relationship peaked on 1 October 2023, when Swift showed up at MetLife Stadium to watch the Chiefs play the New York Jets with a celebrity entourage, including Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds, Sophie Turner, Sabrina Carpenter, Queer Eye chef Antoni Porowski and Hugh Jackman. The audience for that gamepeaked at morethan 29 million viewers, making it the best-watched game since the February Super Bowl (in large partdue to more femaleviewers) – largely thanks to Swift’s star power.View image in fullscreenSwift and Alwyn kept a low profile.Photograph: Christopher Polk/NBC/NBCU Photo BankSwift and Kelce’s highly public appearances together, months after meeting, contrasted significantly with her earlier relationship with British actor Joe Alwyn. They kept a low profile over the six years they were together, based mostly in London. News of their breakup spread in early April 2023, weeks after the start of Swift’s globe-trotting Eras tour. “Tayvis” was born five months later.View image in fullscreenTayvis arriving at the SNL afterparty after their ‘PDA moment’ backstage.Photograph: Gotham/GC ImagesThey weren’t just quick to go public with their relationship, but quick to progress. In October, Swift and Kelce were photographed having “a PDA moment” (public display of affection) backstage at Saturday Night Live in New York, having both made surprise appearances on the show. The same month, Kelce was reported to have bought a new home, worth $6m, offering more privacy for his relationship. Helater spoke admiringlyof Swift’s handling of the attention on her: “The scrutiny she gets, how much she has a magnifying glass on her, every single day, paparazzi outside her house, outside every restaurant she goes to, after every flight she gets off – and she’s just living, enjoying life.”In November, Kelce was photographed in the audience of Swift’s Eras Tour show in Argentina. She then amended the lyrics of her song Karma to refer to “the guy on the Chiefs, coming straight home to me”, andwas later filmed running offthe stage and into his arms, sending fans into another frenzy.Kelce, for his part, joked that Swift is his “good luck charm” on the field. Her frequent appearance at games has certainly been beneficial for the NFL, leading to significant spikes in viewership figures of women and girls. In January 2024, an eight-year-old Swiftie attended the Chiefs’ game against the Buffalo Bills in New York with thesole intentionof meeting her idol – and was plucked from the crowd by Jason Kelce.View image in fullscreenKelce jokes Swift is his ‘good luck charm’ on the field.Photograph: Julio Cortez/APAfter her shout-out in Argentina, Kelce delighted fans by joining Swift on stage at Wembley for her reworked Eras Tour show, with a revised setlist to include songs from her new album The Tortured Poets Department. He carried her in his arms, fanned her and dusted her face with a makeup brush before she launched into I Can Do It With a Broken Heart. Two songs from that album, The Alchemy and So High School, were both understood by fans to refer to her relationship with Kelce.View image in fullscreenMeeting the royals and making their relationship ‘Instagram official’.Photograph: FacebookSwift and Kelce’s relationship has often been described as a union of entertainment and sporting royalty; in the UK for the Eras Tour in June 2024, they met actual royalty. Swift’s selfie of the pair with Prince William, Prince George and Princess Charlotte also marked her making their relationship “Instagram official”.In a barnstorming year for Swift, she broke yet another record at the MTV video music awards in September, where she became the most-awarded artist in the event’s history with her win for video of the year for Fortnite. She thanked Kelce in her acceptance speech: “Everything this man touches turns to happiness and fun and magic, so I want to thank him for adding that to our shoot.”In September, weeks before the US presidential election, Swift endorsed Kamala Harris in an Instagram post she signed “childless cat lady” – a reference to Trump running mate JD Vance’s disparaging description of Democrat voters. The endorsement was received with relief by many Swift fans, not least given the support for Trump reported within Kelce’s wider family, but it was not enough to secure a victory for Harris. Swift’s Eras Tour finally concluded on 7 December after 149 shows, breaking numerous records, including for the biggest-selling tour in history.View image in fullscreenSwift  wearing a ‘T’ chain at the Grammys.Photograph: Neilson Barnard/Getty Images for The Recording AcademyAttending the Grammys in February this year, Swift incorporated a subtle shout-out to her partner, accessorising her Vivienne Westwood mini-dress with a body chain bearing his initial “T”.Though known as Kelce’s “good luck charm”, Swift’s appearance in this year’s Super Bowl crowd was no match for the Philadelphia Eagles (her home town team), who defeated the Chiefs 40-22. She was reportedly givena frosty reception, and was booed by thousands in the crowd. With Trump just returned to the White House for a second term, commentators chalked up the heckling to Swift’s endorsement of Harris.View image in fullscreenTayvis on the New Heights podcast.Photograph: Youtube/New HeightsAfter the end of their respective “eras” – Swift’s concert tour and Kelce’s NFL season – the couple retreated from the public eye to enjoy the first quiet patch in their relationship – though not for long. In August, Swift announced a new album: The Life of a Showgirl, penned during the European leg of her Eras tour. She appeared on the Kelces’ podcast New Heights to dish the details, speaking for more than two hours – and affording fans an unprecedented level of access into her private life. She acknowledged the podcast’s part in the start of their relationship, saying of Kelce’s highly public wooing of her: “This is sort of what I’ve been writing songs about wanting to happen to me since I was a teenager.”Kelce, for his part, spoke admiringly of his partner’s athleticism, intelligence and vocabulary. In a profile interview for GQ’s September issue, he swooned over Swift and their relationship: “Whenever I’m with her, it feels like we’re just regular people.”View image in fullscreen‘Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married.’Photograph: Taylor Swift/Instagram/ReutersThe couple’s engagement announcement on Tuesday took some punters by surprise: after the New Heights episode, bets were placed for Swift to be the performer at next year’s Super Bowl and/or for Kelce to propose on the pitch. In fact, the couple got engaged almost two weeks ago, Kelce’s fatherconfirmedto the press.View image in fullscreenSwift’s engagement ring.Photograph: Taylor Swift and Travis KelceOne of the five photos posted to Instagram on Tuesday was a closeup of Swift’s ring: a large diamond set in a yellow gold band. Tree Paine, Swift’s infamous publicist,confirmed only that the ring was designed by Kindred Lubeckand the diamond is an “old mine brilliant cut”.Swift captioned the images with “Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married”, a quote from her song So High School. For fans, as well as perhaps Swift herself, it’s nothing short of a fairytale romance – a nerd, pining from the bleachers, finding happy ever after with the homecoming king.Explore more on these topicsTaylor SwiftCelebrityTravis KelceSocial mediaShareReuse this content"

The latter is the rebranded name for pipe cleaners, although that might have passed you by.“It’s not catching on like ‘innocent men’ did,” quips Hacker, referring to the hilariousfourth wall-breaking viral clipof him and his former CBBC continuity co-star Lauren Layfield corpsing.My bug hotel efforts may be at the Premier Inn end of the insect accommodation market but Hacker is encouraging. He’s surprisingly useful for someone lacking opposable thumbs – and whose paws his puppet master Phil Fletcher (who also does Hacker’s voice) has to operate using sticks, while watching the action on a monitor below the desk.In a genius move, Fletcher’s quick-witted canine has been hired as Blue Peter’s new presenter tobring his comedic chaosand legions of fans to the show as part of an attempt to update it to appeal to a new generation of kids.Hacker says he’s “proud” to join Blue Peter, pointing out he’s the first presenter who “can’t blink”. In addition to assisting the other presenters with the makes and delivering his trademark one-liners, he says he will be doing some red carpet “showbusiness junkets …I’m dead good at them”. But unlike his intrepid co-hosts, “I’m not climbing Nelson’s Column, cocker”.View image in fullscreenTara Conlan makes an insect hotel with the help of Hacker T Dog.Photograph: BBCHis arrival is part of a revamp ofBlue Peterthat sees it move to a new central Manchester location with a cosy, “apartment style” set. It now lives in an airy, refurbished Victorian market hall that Hacker reckons has an “Ikea showroom” vibe – appropriate from a presenter who can be packed flat.The changes are a strategy to target the TikTok generation and signal a more relaxed era for the 67-year-old show. The large studio fostered by the show’s late legendary editorBiddy Baxteris replaced with smaller, zoned filming areas and a social media filming backdrop. With its bright colours, exposed brick walls, upcycled furniture and industrial-style shelving and greenery, Blue Peter’s new set is Mancunian-loft-development-meets-Monica’s-apartment-in-Friends.Presenter Shini Muthukrishnan thinks it, “feels so homely.”Co-host Joel Mawhinney says it “feels a lot more like an apartment where we’re all just having fun”. Which is a lot better than the old studio: “It was actually quite jarring for some kids, because if they’re online and watching other shows, they don’t really see that any more.”Another part of the revamp is a lot more controversial – Blue Peter living up to its catchphrase “Here’s one I made earlier” and no longer being filmed live. Therewas an outcrywhen that was announced, with some saying viral moments such as the infamous1969 episode involving Luluthe pooing elephant would be lost.View image in fullscreenPresenter Shini Muthukrishnan with Hacker T Dog.Photograph: James StackBut, speaking to some ex-Blue Peter hosts who have been assembled for my behind-the-scenes tour of the new set (Blue Peter’s like a wholesome Hotel California; you never really leave), Konnie Huq points out Lulu’s scene was actually pre-recorded: “The majority of the shows were live, but … ‘as live’ is the same thing. You’ll still get all of that, because it’s not ever going to be a show that isn’t ‘as live’.”In fact, Mawhinney reckons, “we might get actually more viral moments” because the presenters will be more “relaxed” and “some of the best stuff” happens in rehearsals, which will now be filmed.It might not be live any more but episodes can be updated close to transmission to reflect topical events, which can also be covered in films for the programme’s YouTube channel, explains show editor Ellen Evans, adding: “We’ve noticed a real shift. More and more kids are watching stuff on demand.”On average, 1.8 million under-16s watched Blue Peter each week last year, up 13%, with almost half of them watching on iPlayer. Its YouTube channel hit 40m views, up 400% year-on-year.Although viewers can still watch it on CBBC at 5pm on Fridays, the vibe now is “digital first” and individual elements, such as the “makes”, will also become box sets on iPlayer and YouTube. Current presenter Abby Cook reckons the changes are “positive, because it’s meeting kids where they are … instead of making them be there at five o’clock on a Friday, it’s going: ‘You can have Blue Peter whenever, whatever.’”Other changes include filming out and about more across the UK and making the speed of the show “more dynamic … much more in tune with what else kids are consuming elsewhere”, says Evans.The former presenters back the moves: Anthea Turner argues Blue Peter has “always grown with its audience” and “the genie’s out of the bottle and we have to go with it”.Radzi Chinyanganya thinks TV is at an “inflection point” and “if you don’t adapt you die”, but wonders what the loss of a training ground for live presenting skills might mean for the future of the industry.Part of Blue Peter’s success is down to the fact it has “kept evolving” and been “ahead of the times”, with its appeals, inclusivity and environmentalism, argues Diane-Louise Jordan.Some viewers just dislike change she explains: when she joined the show in 1990 as the first black presenter from a working-class background, there were, appallingly, “sackloads of awful mail … saying I was going to bring the programme down – it was going to never be the same.“People don’t think they like change when they see something that’s a bit different. Within a few weeks, everything had settled down.”For those wondering if the clock is TikToking for the beloved BBC brand, Evans is already planning events for its 70th birthday in 2028 and says, reassuringly, the new elements will “future-proof” Blue Peter for generations to come.The new series of Blue Peter airs at 5pm, Friday 5 September on CBBC and BBC iPlayerExplore more on these topicsBlue PeterTelevisionChildren's TVfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Tempted by our culture and a stable democracy, swathes of immigrants are coming here for a new life. While the rest of us toil at work and struggle to get on the housing ladder, many “foreign nationals” are enjoying luxury accommodation and hanging out idly in the streets. Still, it’s nice that Ellen DeGeneres has found happiness in the Cotswolds now that her chatshow has ended.Having relocated from the US after Donald Trump’s re-election last year, Degeneres and her wife, Portia de Rossi, have spent the summer effectively doing full-time English cosplay. In recent weeks, DeGeneres has shared with her 135 million Instagram followers such idyllic countryside pastimes as: buying sheep, riding a horse, mowing grass, the sheep escaping, naming a chicken Linda, taking a dog to the pub, and the sheep escaping again.In one reel, De Rossi grapples with finding the BBC’s catch-up service to watch Wimbledon. Leaning into her phone, desperation in her smiling eyes, she asks: “Siri. Siri? How can I get … What do I want?!” It is like watching Paddington but instead of a bear learning to use the escalator, it’s an actor trying to work iPlayer.The couple are two of a number of uber-wealthy North American celebrities who have enjoyed the un-air-conditioned greenery of England this summer: US vice-president JD Vance, pop star Shawn Mendes and Steve Jobs’ daughter have all been spotted in the south-west, with some – such as Mendes – opting to stay in the UK long-term. This follows famous faces includingJohnny Deppand Lena Dunham, who have found a British home in recent years. Predictably, it has encouraged more of their kind to follow: luxury estate agents say agrowing number of Americansand high-wealth families are seeking a foothold in England.Oddly, my colleagues in the British media have not been concerned by this particular wave of immigration. The Daily Mail, which has spent the summer decrying asylum seekers and migrants,last week wrotehow “sweet” it is to see De Rossi “living her dream”. Nor have any politicians warned about the crisis. On the contrary, home secretary Yvette Cooperrecently told parliamentthere could be short cuts for migrants based on “the contribution” – which is not at all code for cash investment, you understand – they have made to the country. At the time of writing, Conservative Robert Jenrick has not been picturedprotestingoutside any Cotswold mansions. This is despitereportsthat DeGeneres has just bought a larger Gloucestershire property that could have gone to hardworking locals.There are already worrying signs these foreign millionaires don’t respect British values, including the etiquette to not order food 10 minutes before closing time because the chef’s gone out back for a smoke. When he was recently in his village’s cafe, Canadian Mendes reportedly“got a telling-off”because he was ordering food “right before the kitchen closed”.I’m as welcoming as the next person – sometimes I sit outside hotels with a sign that says, “Celebrities welcome here!” – but it’s a legitimate concern that people from different backgrounds won’t integrate. Going to the pub or rearing chickens is not enough. Celebrities need to do more to acclimatise to the British way of life. Can Mendes describe the difference between Count Binface andBingate? Does Dunham know whether Ant stands on Dec’s left or right? And has De Rossi ever been to the big Asda?Look, I’m not saying that we should be scheduling thedeportation flightsfor celebrities now, but I’m also notnotsaying that. Otherwise it would almost be as if there were “good” immigrants and “bad” ones; that our political culture creates a narrative that says white millionaires should be welcomed to Britain and people of colour who are in need should be vilified. Anyway, I haven’t got time for this. I’ve got to check DeGeneres’ Instagram. I’m worried she hasn’t got a TV licence and is just ticking the “yes” box when it flashes up on the iPad. You know what foreigners are like – always milking the system.Explore more on these topicsThe super-richOpinionImmigration and asylumReal estateCelebritycommentShareReuse this content"

The non-batting runner, having only made it a certain way around the field, gets tagged out by a fielder trying to “steal”, or sneak up, on a base from the one behind. As far as the non-metaphorical meaning goes, no one in this movie is actually apprehended in the act of theft. But in a world where home runs are unavailable to most, the idea of cheekily trying for covert advantage and survival through quick wits is clear.Charlie Huston’s violent crime novel of the same name from 2004 has been adapted for the screen by the author, and Darren Aronofsky directs with gleeful energy, flair and a dark humour that straddles the mischief/malice borderline. Incredible to think that his last film was the solemn and inertly sententiousbody-image drama The Whale. This has more of the confrontational extravagance and energy of his earlier work; it’s not as purely deranged as Aronofsky’smeltdown film Mother!, although, speaking of mothers, there is no doubt who the hero of this film considers to be his best friend.Austin Butler plays Hank, a former baseball star and booze-addicted bartender in New York whose disastrous exit from the sport – and from his own bright future – is progressively disclosed in nightmare flashbacks. The only good thing in his life is his smart, beautiful girlfriend Yvonne, played by Zoë Kravitz, a paramedic whose professional skills come in useful. When Hank good-naturedly agrees to look after a cat belonging to his dodgy British friend Russ (a very broad, mohawk-sporting performance from Matt Smith), poor Hank winds up getting savagely beaten by some scary Russians to whom Russ owes a great deal of money.The assault has serious consequences, not least Hank’s encounter with two other villains: a pair of Hassidic guys (played by Vincent D’Onofrio and Liev Schreiber). Their kindly mother Bubbe, played by Carol Kane, sagely tells Hank not to show his teeth if he isn’t going to bite.Most importantly, Hank comes into contact with a coolly self-possessed New York police officer, played byRegina King, who is airily insensitive about what Hank is going through, but perceptive about him in ways that no other character really is. When talking to (or interrogating) Hank, she asks if he played baseball; Hank coldly admits to playing only at high school level, and this cop instantly senses the lie, the symptom of self-harming pride and grief on which he is challenged by no one else in his life, but can’t work out if it means something more.‘The 90s were remarkable – we weren’t all living in existential terror!’ Darren Aronofsky on Caught Stealing, his love letter to New YorkRead moreThe late-90s setting is signalled bySmash Mouth’s Walkin’ on the Sunon the jukebox, Jerry Springer on the TV, a landline answering machine and characters resentfully lending people their flip-top mobile phones and telling them not to “use up my minutes”. In fact, the story itself perhaps comes from an era ofElmore Leonard, Ed Bunker and Quentin Tarantino; the shocks and twists and jolts are nasty and unexpected, and the stunts and car crashes are dished up in a chaotic swirl.I was disconcerted, however, when Butler’s character, a sweet-natured guy for whom we’re supposed to be rooting, seems to get over one particular horror with relative ease: I couldn’t quite decide if this was a drawback in his performance or something diluting the black comedy. Either way, Caught Stealing is a very enjoyable spectacle. At one stage, Hank hits a few balls and instantly a crowd of people gather round, awed – and an old-timer tells him he has “one hell of a swing”. The film has it too.Caught Stealing is out on 28 August in Australia, and on 29 August in the US and UK.Explore more on these topicsFilmCrime filmsThrillersComedy filmsDarren AronofskyFilm adaptationsAustin ButlerreviewsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Whether your child is just starting reception or well into secondary school, it’s a big adjustment after six weeks off. Arming them with tools to cope with the change, and the right kit, can ease this period for everyone.My eldest daughter is going into year two and after over-buying everything on the school’s list when she started in reception, I now buy just a few essentials every year. And I make sure I’m buying products that last.Here are the best tips, tricks and buys that will last beyond half term from parents (and children) to mark the return to the classroom.Back-to-school essentialsView image in fullscreenRunning into the new school year ready and raring to go?Photograph: SolStock/Getty ImagesName everythingBuy a batch of sticky labels with their names on it – I get my kids to put them in their uniforms and kit themselves. Try to keep the first few weekends of the new school year free, because however well adjusted and excited kids are about the new year, the change is always a big deal. They often come out of school with little to say and suddenly open up at bedtime or on a car journey, so being around without too much going on in those first few weeks can really help.Steph Douglas, KingstonName stickers and stamps are a firm favourite, as they’re an easy way to keep track of everything from pencil cases to T-shirts.

I always go first and share something about my day – who I’ve seen, something funny that happened or what my favourite thing of the day was. This works for us with opening up the conversation even in the post-school tiredness phase.Emily Veall, HampshireLunch boxI’ve had a green Yumbox lunch box for six years.

Apart from the basic clothes, if you wait until your child is at school you can then see what they actually need. In my daughter’s first year of school, for example, I bought some black PE trainers that weren’t used until about March – by then, she had grown out of them. I also got a backpack for her, but in the first year she only needed the school’s book bag.RGCheap water bottlesI’ve had to throw out more water bottles than I care to think about and it’s sickening thinking about the money I’ve spent on them – and the waste generated (although many of ours have been repurposed for toys and crafts). I’ve also had to deal with lots of bottle leaks from cheap plastic bottles – and bags full of water and sodden books and paper.RGUniform with logosI always buy a few uniform sets with the school logo on (handy for school photo days) but you probably don’t need every item to have one – just check your school’s requirements. Uniform without a logo is significantly cheaper and there are often discounts running.RGExplore more on these topicsLife and styleThe FilterSchool holidaysBack to schoolfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Davey said he believed Keir Starmer was right to engage with Trump, but said it was vital that someone raised the issue ofGazain a way that could not be ignored.“The humanitarian crisis in Gaza must stop. The famine must end. The hostages must be returned home. There is one man, more than anyone else, who has the power to make it happen,” he wrote in a Guardian piece explaining his decision.“Donald Trump could do those things today if he chose to. He has more power than anyone else finally to force a ceasefire and put Israel and Palestine on the path to a lasting peace, with a two-state solution. But so far, he’s decided not to. Instead, he’s given Netanyahu his full support.”Davey said the invitation to state banquets was “one of the great privileges of being the leader of my party”.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer hands Donald Trump a letter in February from King Charles III, inviting him to an unprecedented second state visit to the UK.Photograph: Carl Court/PAHe said: “Receiving an invitation from the king is an enormous honour, and I take very seriously my duty to our sovereign.“To refuse an invitation like this goes against all of my instincts. But having thought and prayed long and hard about it with Emily [Gasson, Davey’s wife], I have come to the conclusion that on this occasion I must refuse.”Davey said although he deeply disagreed on many issues with Trump, including on Ukraine, his engagement with Vladimir Putin and his use of tariffs, his decision to boycott the dinner was purely a stand on Gaza.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And no one uses this moment to demand that the US president picks up that phone to Netanyahu and the Qataris and does the right thing.”Davey said the war in Gaza was now causing such acute suffering he was determined to use every lever he could as an opposition leader.“I feel a responsibility to do whatever I can to make sure the people in Gaza are not forgotten during the pomp and ceremony.

The church throws a fair before school starts, he said, describing it as a “staple point in this community”. He was devastated to hear aboutthe shooting, holding back tears as he said he wanted to bring flowers to pay his respects. He did not attend the school, but has many friends connected to it and described the neighborhood as tight-knit.“It’s everything. We’re so tied together. Block parties are huge. The community here just gets along so well,” he said. “Something like this happens, it doesn’t matter what our beliefs are, we’re going to band together.”Louie kneeled at a stoplight pole outside the police line, pulling the flowers from their plastic and placing them on the ground, starting a makeshift vigil.View image in fullscreenA man lays flowers outside of a police perimeter at Annunciation school.Photograph: Stephen Maturen/Getty ImagesThe assailant, identified by police as Robin Westman, killed themself as well. Police said Wednesday they are investigating any potential motives and executing search warrants related to the shooter. FBI director Kash Patel said the bureau is “investigating this shooting as an act of domestic terrorism and hate crime targeting Catholics”. In addition to the two children killed, 14 children and three adults were injured.Yellow police tape lined the block, preventing people from walking up to the church. News cameras gathered, swarming to get video footage of elected officials and police vehicles moving around the site.A Red Cross van, with a red tent beside it, handed out snacks and water. White tents sat outside the church. Men wearing shirts that said “Chaplain” in yellow letters were on site, one wearing an “I ♥ Jesus” hat.Neighbors walking by the police line to get groceries at a nearby Kowalski’s Markets or walking their dogs stopped to look at the scene, some making calls to loved ones or snapping photos.

It comes less than three months after the targeted killings of state lawmaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark.The shooting, at a church beside a Catholic school, has shaken this community. Two places of sanctuary – a learning environment, a spiritual home – were attacked, puncturing a sense of safety. Neighbors who heard gunshots ran out of their homes to help.

Weston Halsne told the outlet that the shooting was “super scary” and that the students had not practiced active shooter drills in the church, just in the school.The school’s principal, Matt DeBoer, addressed his school community in a press conference on Wednesday afternoon, telling them: “I love you, you’re so brave, and I’m so sorry this happened to us today.”Teachers and students were heroes to one another, he said. The school lost “two angels”. He implored people to commit to making sure no other community, school, person has to experience what his school experienced today.“I beg you,” he said. “I ask you to please pray, but don’t stop with your words. Let’s make a difference and support this community’s children, these families, these teachers. Never again can we let this happen.”Explore more on these topicsMinneapolisGun crimeUS school shootingsUS crimeSchoolsChildrenMinneapolis school shootingnewsShareReuse this content"

The Axios website reported that Trump’s son-in-law and former senior adviser, Jared Kushner, was also in attendance.Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, said the US was putting together a “very comprehensive” plan for “the next day” after the war.In an interview with Fox News on Tuesday, Witkoff said he believed the war inGazacould be ended in the next four months. “We’re going to settle this one way or another, certainly before the end of this year,” he said.Asked about a plan for governing postwar Gaza, Witkoff said: “It’s a very comprehensive plan we’re putting together on the next day that I think many people are going to … see how robust it is and how well meaning it is, and it reflects President Trump’s humanitarian motives here.”No details have been disclosed about the proposals under discussion.The White House said: “President Trump has been clear that he wants the war to end, and he wants peace and prosperity for everyone in the region.”Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, also met his Israeli counterpart, Gideon Sa’ar, in Washington.The meetings came after Pope Leo XIV demanded that Israel stop its “collective punishment” of the population in the besieged territory.Ten Palestinians, including two children, have died from starvation in the last 24 hours,health authorities in Gaza said on Wednesday.At least 313 people have died from hunger, including 119 children, since the war in Gaza began and Israel intensified its siege on the Palestinian territory.The pope said: “I beg for a permanent ceasefire to be reached, the safe entry of humanitarian aid to be facilitated and humanitarian law to be fully respected.”He referred to international law and its “prohibition of collective punishment, indiscriminate use of force and the forced displacement of the population”.The pope was interrupted twice by applause as he called for a ceasefire in front of thousands of people in the Vatican auditorium.Israeli tanks rolled into the outskirts of Gaza City overnight, destroying houses and displacing residents. Tanks shelled the Ebad al-Rahman neighbourhood on the northern outskirts of the city, causing injuries, as Israeli forces sought to clear a path into Gaza City before an expected offensive.Israeli strikes and fire killed at least 76 people throughout Gaza in the previous 24 hours, the Gaza health authorities said.Explore more on these topicsTony BlairDonald TrumpIsraelGazaPalestinian territoriesIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

This covers those who may possibly save money on purchases under £500,000 and concern those buying over this level as well.”It said a third of homes for sale were priced at more than £500,000, with London and the south-east of England in line to be most affected by a change.The website’s latest monthly snapshot of the property market showed the number of sales agreed was up by 5% year on year in July and that average prices had risen by 1.3%.One in 10 homes listed had been reduced in price, above the five-year average of 6% of homes. Homes that have been reduced are typically on the market for almost two and a half times longer than those that are priced well when they go on the market, Zoopla said.Richard Donnell, an executive director at Zoopla, said: “Sellers need to understand local market conditions when considering how to market their home, setting the right price and how quickly they would like to sell. The risk of being too ambitious on price is your home taking more than twice as long to find a buyer, or not selling at all.”Jeremy Leaf, an estate agent and former chair of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, said: “The market inevitably lost a little steam over the summer period with so many decision makers away and listings continuing to pile up.”He said agreed sales were going ahead but added: “Unfortunately, perhaps the government do not appreciate that even rumours of a new property tax can have a detrimental impact on housing market confidence and activity, which we certainly witnessed on the ground since the story broke last week.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I can’t do these kind of things,” Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu, an asylum seeker housed at the Bell hotel in Epping, told his trial at Colchester magistrates court on Wednesday.Speaking through an interpreter, he added: “This is anti-Christian – these are just children, innocent children.”Kebatu, who told the court he was a sports teacher in Ethiopia, denies three counts of sexual assault against two 14-year-old girls and a woman in Epping town centre on 7 and 8 July this year. He also denies one count of inciting a girl to engage in sexual activity and one count of harassment without violence.He told the court he only said “hello” to the schoolgirl and her friends in Epping town centre and nothing more because he was “worried” about his asylum case.Earlier on Wednesday, Kebatu’s adult accuser told the court via video link that she was shocked and angry after being touched on the thigh by Kebatu and witnessing him touch one of the girls on 8 July.Kebatu claimed she was drunk and had threatened to call the police if he failed to come to her house, the court heard.Questioned about why he could be seen in CCTV footage on his knees saying sorry to the woman, the defendant said: “At that time she was drunk, she was very agitated and I just wanted to calm her.”He added: “I was going to the Bell hotel at that time and I was worried about the ramifications on the other immigrants.”The woman, who exercised her right to remain anonymous, said she was “shocked” and “uncomfortable” after Kebatu touched her when she had offered to help him with his CV. She said she also saw him touching one of the girls.Molly Dyas, defending Kebatu, asked the woman if she had made up the allegations because she was angry that Kebatu was an asylum seeker.The woman replied: “I didn’t make up any allegation. I know exactly what I saw. I’ve no issue with asylum seekers … I was angry that he had touched a 14-year-old girl.”She said the defendant was “begging, pleading and apologising” when she confronted him about an alleged sexual assault on the girl.Cross-examining Kebatu, the prosecutor Stuart Cowen said: “You are a sexual predator who tried to assault one girl and one woman in exactly the same way. That is the truth, isn’t it?”Kebatu responded: “I am not such a person. I can’t do these kind of things.”The defendant said he had been living in the hotel for about a week before his arrest, after travelling through Sudan, Libya, Italy and France in order to get to the UK. He told the court he paid about €1,800 (£1,550) to board a small boat and cross the Channel.Cowen acknowledged that Kebatu’s case had “attracted quite a lot of publicity because of the defendant’s personal circumstances”.Kebatu’s arrest last month sparked weeks of violent demonstrations outside the Bell hotel. Epping Forest council has since won a court injunction to stop the hotel being used to house asylum seekers.The district judge Christopher Williams adjourned the trial until 4 September.Explore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Spending on Send provision has sky-rocketed and risks the financial sustainability of local government.“Rather than assuming that more money or more of the same is the answer, we need to ask more fundamental questions. Is a cash transfer – or a label that means young people are treated and come to see themselves as different – the right way to help them?”He added: “Across the political spectrum, and amongst a growing range of practitioners, it is now recognised that there is a level of ‘overdiagnosis’ [in] our system. We need to cut through the complexity to better understand the drivers of demand we are seeing.”Supporting kids with Send is expensive. But the cost of not doing so is far greater | Carrie GrantRead moreHunt, who is Conservative MP for Godalming and Ash, and has also served as chancellor and foreign secretary under the Conservatives, said: “As a society, we seem to have lost sight of the fundamental reality that child development is a messy and uneven process.“Our laudable desire to ensure young people are happy and well-supported is at times manifesting in excessive impulses to medicalise and diagnose the routine in a manner that can undercut grit and resilience.”The government is expected to publish a white paper later this year detailing how it plans to reform the Send system. Parents are concerned that education, health and care plans (EHCPs) – legally enforceable documents that detail a child or young person’s needs, and the support they require – will be targeted.In January this year the number of EHCPs in place rose to 638,745 – up 10.8% on the same point last year. The Policy Exchange report, Out of Control, says EHCPs should be limited to students in special schools and that school mental health support should be targeted at those “that most need it, rather than blanket offers”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is most certainly not widely accepted that there is an overdiagnosis – this is something put out by people like him to deflect from these failings.”The Department for Education was approached for comment.

If the draft passes it will go into effect in October. The measure will not, however, carry penalties for those who exceed the two-hour daily limit.I’ve been waging war on my phone addiction | Rhik SamadderRead moreThe draft urges primary school students – those aged six to 12 – and younger children to avoid usingsmartphonesor tablets after 9pm, while teenagers and adults are encouraged to put their devices to one side after 10pm.The proposal, the first of its kind to apply to all residents, triggered a backlash on social media. Some users condemned it as an attack on individual freedom, while other said the time limit was simply unworkable.“I understand their intention, but the two-hour limit is impossible,” one user wrote on X. Another said: “Two hours isn’t even enough to read a book or watch a movie (on my smartphone).”In response, Koki said the time limit was not mandatory and acknowledged that smartphones were “useful and indispensable in daily life”. But he added: “I hope it will be an opportunity for families to think about and discuss the time they spend on smartphones as well as the time of day the devices are used.”The proposal has not gone down well with many of Toyoake’s 69,000 residents. Officials received 83 phone calls and 44 emails over a four-day period after the announcement, 80% of which were critical of the measure, according to the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper.Officials say the proposal was designed to address behavioural problems associated with excessive smartphone use, including truancy among children who can’t bear to leave their phones at home when they go to school.Koki said there was also anecdotal evidence that adults in the town were glued to their phones when they should be sleeping or spending time with their families.Toyoake’s initiative reflects growing concern about thenegative health impact, especially on children, of hours spent hunched over smartphones and tablets.In 2020, a region in westernJapanpassed an ordinance – also non-binding – limiting children to an hour a day of gaming during the week, rising to 90 minutes during the school holidays.Young Japanese spend an average of just over five hours a day online on weekdays, according to a survey released this year by the Children and Families Agency.Explore more on these topicsJapanAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Of these Kobbie Mainoo, Benjamin Sesko, André Onana, Harry Maguire and Manuel Ugarte were the headline acts given first starts and who failed to quieten a rambunctious crowd all night.United began and ended under the pump. A Vernam corner from the left threatened to arrow over the hapless Onana before the goalkeeper scurried back and tipped over. Dave Artell drilled his unit to tap the ball about then up tempo and stampede at United. Or rush to a man in red livery to squeeze them – precisely how they took the lead.Under pressure Amad Diallo miscontrolled, tried to retrieve the ball, he and Ugarte bumped into each other, pratfalled, and Grimsby took over. A quick right-left Darragh Burns diagonal put Vernam in, and he beat Onana at his near post: the Cameroonian should have saved so here was the latest howler from a United man between the sticks.Now, the Mariners’ second. A short Vernam corner on the left was returned and the No 30 sliced in a delivery. Onana rose above a thicket of players and, farcically, missed a clearing punch, the ball dropped to Warren, who rolled home against the club he left in 2019.Cue a Grimsby support in party mode, their taunts a cutting “can we play you every week”, and “Premier League/you’re having a laugh”. They had a point. Grimsby were in cruise control, toying with their shellshocked guest. When Sesko managed a header you were reminded that United were allowed to attack – too.View image in fullscreenCharles Vernam shows his delight after giving Grimsby the lead.Photograph: Chris Radburn/ReutersAt the interval Amorim hooked Tyler Fredericson, Patrick Dorgu and Ugarte for Matthijs De Ligt, Mbuemo and Bruno Fernandes. Calling for the cavalry showed how dire United were.In bucketing rain Grimsby poured forward and a Burns effort went for a corner as, again, United’s noses were bloodied. The downpour, becoming biblical, made the surface greasy – perfect for a side on a mission to pen themselves into football immortality.United were in a catch-22 of needing to press to pull a goal back while not daring to leave space for Artell’s ruthless unit to prosper again. Example: Grimsby moved along their right, swapped passes, and lifted a high-ball in – the omnipotent Vernam leaped and bounced a header into the ground which Onana clutched.Quick GuideBrighton and Fulham march onShowStefanos Tzimas claimed a debut double as Brighton cruised into the third round if the Carabao Cup with a crushing 6-0 victory at Oxford.The Greece Under-21 striker, who cost £20.8m from the German club Nurnberg, struck twice in seven second-half minutes before fellow newcomer Tommy Watson sealed the Seagulls' first win of the season.First-half finishes from Olivier Boscagli – another debutant – and the midfielder Brajan Gruda set Albion on course for a resounding victory at the Kassam Stadium before Diego Gomez increased the advantage on the hour.Raul Jimenez ensuredFulhamavoided a shock as they dispatched the Championship sideBristol City2-0.The Mexico striker Jimenez pressured George Tanner into scoring an early own goal and then grabbed the second as the Cottagers cruised through.Marco Silva, the Fulham manager, had been stung by City in the competition before, when they knocked his top-flight Watford side out with a 3-2 result at the same stage eight years ago, but Jimenez ensured there would be no repeat.PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Amorim’s substitutions had failed to engineer any dominance and when Diallo was flagged offside his manager dipped his head in anguish – a regular sensation for him.Amorim, despairing, sent for a favourite player, Mason Mount, who replaced Ayden Heaven. Yet when Mbeumo struck United still seemed a universe away from levelling. But they do possess spirit, as personified by Maguire whose intervention took them to penalties and the heartbreak of defeat this way.Amorim was not spotted on the touchline witnessing the kicks – as odd as the decision to have his new £70m leader of the attack, Sesko, as taker No 10. Again, expect this to be dissected.Explore more on these topicsCarabao CupGrimsbyManchester Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The US president followed through on his threat to punish one of the world’s largest economies for its purchases of discounted Russian oil.What might the impact be on India’s economy?Washington added an extra 25% duty on top of the 25% imposed earlier this month, citing India’s refusal to stop buying Russian crude and defence hardware.The duties, which are 16 percentage points higher than China, 31 points higher than most south-east Asian countries and 35 points above South Korea, have pushed US tariffs on Indian goods to levels that the investment house Nomura likened to a “trade embargo”.The US is India’s largest export market, worth $86.5bn (£64.1bn) a year. Around two-thirds of shipments are covered by the 50% tariff, threatening jobs and growth across sectors reliant on US demand.“No Indian product can stand any competitive edge under such heavy import taxes,” said Garima Kapoor of Elara Securities. Economists say the tariffs could erase up to one percentage point from India’s GDP growth this fiscal year.Unemployment is a worry. India’s overall jobless rate stood at 5.6% in June, rising to 7.1% in cities. A major drop in US exports could hit millions of workers, economists say.Where will the biggest impact be felt?India’s giant generic pharmaceuticals sector and its electronics and petroleum products are exempt from the tariffs. Aluminium, steel and copper remain at 25%, but job-heavy sectors such as textiles, jewellery, seafood and leather are squarely in the line of fire.Exports from affected sectors could plunge 70%, from $60.2bn to $18.6bn, while overall shipments to the US could fall by 43%, said Ajay Srivastava, a former Indian trade official and founder of the Global Trade Research Initiative, a Delhi-based thinktank .Companies rushed shipments ahead of the 27 August cut-off. With the tariff wall now up, exporters must either swallow costs, which will be impossible for many, or cede market share to countries such as Vietnam, Bangladesh and Mexico.India’s $179bn textiles industry includes $37.7bn in exports, with the US buying nearly $10.3bn. Mithileshwar Thakur, of the Apparel Export Promotion Council (AEPC), said Indian exporters now faced a 30% cost disadvantage compared with Bangladesh, Vietnam and Cambodia. “This is an earthquake,” said Kirit Bhansali, chair of the Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council.Even if tariffs are lowered later, competitors may have already locked in US market share. “Competitors like China, Vietnam, Mexico, Turkey, and even Pakistan, Nepal, Guatemala and Kenya stand to gain, potentially locking India out of key markets even after tariffs are rolled back,” Srivastava said.Can India wean itself off Russian oil?India, the world’s third-largest oil consumer and top buyer of Russian seaborne crude, could wean itself off Russian oil over time. But right now it views Russia as an all-weather friend – a vital defence and energy ally amid the trade turmoil that Trump has unleashed. Russia supplies about 40% of India’s oil needs, up from less than 1% before the Ukraine war. Even though discounts on Russian crude have narrowed from $20–$25 below benchmark Brent crude in 2022 to about $2.50 a barrel now, India continues buying because it secures energy reliably and relatively cheaply.A sudden reduction could also leave India vulnerable to global price swings. It will continue buying oil from wherever it gets the best deal and take measures to protect its national interest from US tariffs, India’s ambassador to Russia, Vinay Kumar, told TASS at the weekend. He also said India was able to pay for Russian oil in rupees, which meant it didn’t have to use its US currency reserves. “Now, we have a working system of trade settlement in national currencies. There is no problem now in payment for oil imports,” he said.Indian firms are calculated to have saved $17bn by buying cheaper Russian oil since the start of the war in Ukraine, but that could be dwarfed by the impact of tariffs on exporters, which could cut India’s US exports by nearly $37bn this financial year, said Srivastava.What is India doing to mitigate the impact?Narendra Modi’s government has urged Indians to buy domestically made goods. “I appeal to the citizens of our country to prioritise purchasing goods that are made in India,” the prime minister said this week. The government also plans to shake up the nationwide goods and services tax, cutting most rates to 5% or 18% to boost spending.Essentials such as food, textiles and cement will become cheaper, while luxury goods remain pricey. The government is reportedly assembling a multibillion-dollar package to free up cash for exporters.India has been seeking to diversify its markets and recently signed a free trade deal with the UK. But exporters say much more is needed. The Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) has called for a state-supported one-year moratorium on repaying the principal and interest on loans to free up cash for diversifying markets. “We are staring at a crisis which will force shutdowns and cause unemployment,” said the FIEO’s president, SC Ralha. The AEPC has appealed for interest relief to counter high borrowing costs of between 8% and 12%, compared with 3% in China and Malaysia.India is also cautiously warming up to Chinese investment as part of a strategic pivot in response to escalating US tariffs. Modi is making his first visit to China since relations went into a deep freeze following a brutal clash along their disputed border in 2020 to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit.He said this week the world was living through an era of “economic selfishness” in which countries pursue their own interests first. “No matter how high the pressure, India will continue to build its strength to withstand it,” he added. “India is ready to pay a very heavy price to protect its interests.”Explore more on these topicsIndiaTrump tariffsRussiaUS economyInternational tradeTariffsSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

That era is gone.”If Gove’s silence on dynamic alignment was notable, the reluctance ofNigel Farageto get drawn into this debate has been even more so.In May, when Starmer announced his outline agreement with the EU, Farage was not even in the country.The Reform leader also failed to mention the issue during a press conference in Edinburgh on Wednesday. Instead, the party put out a statement from a spokesperson accusing the government of “cosying up to the EU and leaving us entangled in reams of retained EU law”.Labour officials are open about trying to draw Farage into a fight they believe he cannot win.“Since we signed our reset deal, Farage has sat there like a lemon and chucked out a few source quotes to his core audience,” said one. “It is about time he answered questions on his approach to EU relations.”Judging by Farage’s silence over the issue on Wednesday, the Reform leader can read the polls as well as Thomas-Symonds.A survey by More in Common on Wednesday showed 54% of voters now believe that closer relations with the EU would be good for Britain, while only 18% of voters disagree.Voters are even willing to undermine British sovereignty to boost the economy, with 44% saying the government should prioritise the economy, compared with 38% who say it should focus on sovereignty.Luke Tryl, the executive director of More in Common, said: “Rather than wanting politicians to re-litigateBrexit, most want the focus to be on practical discussions that work out how to balance the economic benefits of a closer relationship with protecting national control.”There are limits to Labour’s increasingly vocal desire to be closer to the EU, however.Thomas-Symonds would not contemplate re-entering the single market or the customs union. “It isn’t about revisiting the issues of the past, it’s about a ruthlessly pragmatic assessment of the national interest today,” he said.There are also limits to how successful an electoral strategy it could be. While voters do want to trade more closely with Britain’s European neighbours, they care about the issue far less than the one Farage has spent the last two days talking about: irregular migration.According to thelatest figuresfrom the pollster YouGov, 51% of voters put immigration among their top three priorities, compared with just 10% who list “Britain leaving the EU”.Explore more on these topicsTrade policyEuropean UnionNick Thomas-SymondsMichael GoveForeign policyBrexitThe SpectatoranalysisShareReuse this content"

But, Aronstein said, Ukrainian drone attacks on refineries and storage facilities had made this the most severe crisis in recent years.“The attacks are massive, coordinated, and repeated; they come in waves, and the refineries simply do not have time to repair the damage caused by the previous attack before the next one occurs,” Aronstein added.Refinery in flamesWholesale prices for A-95 – Russia’s most widely used petrol – hit record highs last week, climbing to about 82,300 roubles (£760) a tonne, almost 54% higher than in January.At first glance, fuel shortages inside Russia jar with its status as one of the world’s top energy exporters, shipping crude to markets such as China and India.Trump this weekimposed sweeping tariffs on US imports from India, citing Delhi’s reliance on discounted Russian oil.But crude oil has to be processed into petrol and diesel, and much of Russia’s refining system is geared toward export products.Analysts say one of the industry’s main weaknesses is the lack of any real buffer in domestic petrol production. Output only just covers domestic demand, leaving the system highly vulnerable to disruption.Refinery in flamesAnd while drone strikes usually disable only part of a refinery’s capacity, sanctions have cut off Russia from western technology, making repairs slower and more complicated.Even before the most recent attacks, Moscow had moved to tighten its gasoline export ban in July to cope with a surge in domestic demand.Russian social media has beenfloodedwith clips of frustrated motorists complaining about shortages and soaring prices.“We’ve been waiting for hours, and no one knows if we’ll even get our cars filled,” said one man as he drove past a snaking queue in the far-eastern city of Dalnegorsk.Strike on Russian refineryThe Motorist’s Den, a popular Russian car channel on Telegram, quipped that “it feels like petrol will soon be poured into champagne glasses rather than fuel tanks”.Another widely shared post joked: “Filling up now is almost like a trip to a boutique: you set out for a litre, and return with an empty wallet and the philosophical thought that maybe walking isn’t so bad after all.”The current crisis has been sharpened by timing: August is traditionally the toughest month for Russia’s fuel market, when the harvest season pushes up demand, refineries undergo scheduled maintenance and exporters chase higher seasonal prices abroad.What is usually a predictable squeeze has this year tipped into a full-blown shortage after Ukrainian drones knocked out key facilities.Crimea, annexed by Russia in 2014, has been among the hardest hit. The peninsula, which usually hosts a flood of Russian holidaymakers in the summer, has had its airports shut because of the drone threat, forcing visitors on to roads and piling further pressure on already scarce supplies. Officials have urged calm.Ukraine war briefing: Russian troops inside Dnipropetrovsk region, Ukraine saysRead moreThe Kremlin-appointed head of Crimea asked residents “to understand the restrictions on 95-octane petrol”, warning that the situation could drag on for another month. “All possible measures to stabilise prices are now being taken both by the federal government and by us,” he said.While the shortages are disruptive and politically awkward for the Kremlin, analysts caution they are unlikely for now to derail Russia’s war effort or heavy industry.Video of cars queuingMuch of the country’s industrial fleet and military equipment runs on diesel rather than petrol, and Russia still has a surplus of it.“There is still a long way to go before the transport, agriculture and industrial sectors – or, most importantly, the army – experience any significant fuel shortages,” said Sergey Vakulenko, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, who previously worked at the Russian oil major Gazprom.Still, with Ukraine showing no sign of slowing its drone campaign, economists say that the fuel squeeze could drag on well into the winter.If the worst comes to the worst, Vakulenko said, authorities could be forced to resort to gasoline rationing.Explore more on these topicsRussiaUkraineEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It is a dry comedy of grief and regret which wears its dreamy melancholy and ennui like a well-tailored if fussily old-fashioned suit, and it returns Sorrentino to the various mysterious tableaux of political power that recurred inIl Divo from 2009, about political mandarin Giulio Andreotti, and his2013 film The Great Beautyabout a dissolute journalist and hedonist bidding a bittersweet farewell to everything he holds dear.And above everything else, Grazia returns Sorrentino to the star of those films, 66-year-old Toni Servillo, his male muse and alter ego, an actor able to suggest fathomless depths of sadness or lenient humour with a single smile. (Oddly, that last film Parthenope assigned the Servillo-esque role of the knowing outsider to Gary Oldman, who had to play a bafflingly supercilious version of the author John Cheever.) Maybe this film, concluding as it does on a distinctive note of euphoric sentimentality, does not add up to quite as much as the director thinks; but it intrigues, it exhilarates and it shows that Sorrentino is Italian cinema’s heir to Antonioni.The scene is Rome, and Servillo is Mariano, the president ofItaly, nearing the end of his term of office, admired for his rectitude and stately bearing and perhaps also, in having won the presidency, for having thwarted an extremist candidate. (A rather amazing set piece scene at La Scala has a tuxed member of the audience call out to him “You saved us from that fool!”) He is a widower and distinguished former judge renowned for an impossibly large and dry book on the minutiae of legislation; he is also a stickler for the letter of constitutional law, with the nickname “reinforced concrete”.Mariano is assisted by his lawyer daughter Dorotea (Anna Ferzetti), who is exasperated by his reluctance to make decisions; he must decide on whether to sign off a bill making euthanasia legal, and also whether to give pardons to a woman who killed her abusive husband in his sleep and a man who killed his dementia patient wife. Eccentrically, his only pleasure is listening to rap music on his earphones, and Sorrentino, as so often in the past, supplies plenty of distinctive electro-pop on the soundtrack, buzzing and clanging like an MRI scanner. And it seems his only friend is his personal protection officer Labaro (Orlando Cinque), who gives him forbidden cigarettes.The awful truth is that the end of his term of office has given him an inkling of the end of his life, but this has not brought Mariano any peace. In fact, he is in agony, haunted by the thought of his late wife being unfaithful to him 40 years before. And with whom? Mariano suspects his contemporary Ugo (Massimo Venturiello), who has slippery ambitions of his own. The only person who knows for sure is his wife’s best friend and Mariano’s old classmate Coco Valori (Milvia Marigliano), a dyspeptic and opinionated critic; she is a very Sorrentino-esque character, a type in fact played by Servillo in The Great Beauty. She refuses to betray the confidence. As he prepares to lay his robe of office down, Mariano suspects he will never know, and a lifetime’s devotion to the establishment of facts will only mock his ignorance of the only fact that matters to him. But … does it matter? What does matter, given that our destiny is dust?La Grazia is a stylish, soigné film, ruminative and enigmatic. Like The Great Beauty it broods on theRomanitàof the capital; the Romanness, the way in which its history is inscribed on its buildings for those who understand it. And the set piece moments are tremendous: Mariano is guest of honour at a veterans’ dinner for Italy’s mountain infantry, the Alpini, and suddenly bursts into song with them. Perhaps most knowingly, there is a scene where he hosts an official reception for the Portuguese president and simply looks on motionless as the visitor attempts to process toward him across a courtyard in the driving rain, along a red carpet which is being swept away by the wind: a dream image of the vulnerability and absurdity of official pomp. Arguably, none of this would count for as much, or anything, without Servillo: but it’s a satisfying meditation on the pleasures and sadnesses of solitude in old age.La Grazia screened at theVenice film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsPaolo SorrentinoItalyVenice film festivalEuropeFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Here is how to make your own, from strawberries and cream to apple pie paniniTim DowlingWed 27 Aug 2025 10.28 EDTLast modified on Wed 27 Aug 2025 10.45 EDTShareTesco’s recently introducedbirthday cake sandwich– an unholy assemblage of jam, soft cheese, frosting and sprinkles, stuffed between two slices of brioche – may well be the world’s most depressing foodstuff, a cake designed to be eaten in one go, possibly on your birthday, probably alone.The birthday cake sandwich follows hard on the heels of M&S’s strawberries and cream sandwich – a UK version of the fruit sandwiches, or furutsu sandos, sold in convenience stores in Japan. The M&S sandwich received a certain amount of criticism, along withsome surprisingly good reviews. But both sandwiches were controversial, not least from a nutritional standpoint (the Tesco sandwich contains 31.5g of sugar, over a third of the recommended maximum daily intake for an adult), but also because they upset our notion of what a sandwich is. Aren’t they supposed to be savoury? Aren’t they supposed to be lunch, rather than dessert?View image in fullscreenMarks & Spencer’s strawberry and cream sandwich, which is filled with fruit and light whipped cream cheese on fluffy sweetened bread.Photograph: M&S/PABur sweet sandwiches are not uncommon – anything with jam in it counts – and the sandwich itself is not a rules-based enterprise: it’s more of a continuous trial-and-error process – even as you eat a sandwich you’ve just made, you’re thinking about how it could be better next time. When it comes to sweet fillings, you’ve got to try at least a few before you reject them out of hand. Here are 12 ideas to get you started.View image in fullscreenA Japanese sweet fruit sandwich with strawberry, pineapple and kiwi.Photograph: Dariia Chernenko/AlamyA note: most sweet sandwiches do not require a recipe, and are subject to endless modification. Feel free to experiment with different breads, flavours and proportions – you may as well have it the way you want it.‘The Earl of Sandwich is rolling in his grave’: Tesco’s birthday cake sandwich divides opinionRead moreFirst up, a deep-fried peanut butter and jelly (clear jam) sandwich, from food blogger Davie Leite at the website Leite’s Culinaria. Arguably, the classic PB&J is already a sweet sandwich – but the addition of a sugary deep-fried batter turns this humble childhood treat into the kind of snack that helped kill Elvis.The recipeoffers two extra options I immediately rejected: sliced banana (no thank you) and a white chocolate ganache for dipping (are you kidding?).View image in fullscreenTim’s deep-fried peanut butter and jelly sandwich.Photograph: Tim Dowling/The GuardianA sturdy sourdough bread is recommended. I might have sliced it a little too thick – of no consequence taste wise, but it makes it harder to fry. Be careful not to go overboard with the fillings. Slap it together as you normally would, dip the whole thing into the batter, and deep fry it in hot oil, flipping once.If you’re looking for rare examples of foodstuffs that are not improved by deep-frying, you can start here. You could tinker with proportions all day and still not make something palatable out of this heavy, greasy, sticky mess. In case it was just me, I forced some on my oldest son, who simply shook, went quiet, then said, no.View image in fullscreenA sweet fried sandwich with chocolate and banana.Photograph: Reji Ittiachan/AlamyOther sweet fried sandwiches includethe grilled Nutella banana sandwich, agrilled Nutella and marshmallow sandwichand thebanana french toast sandwich. The classicMonte Christo sandwich, while technically savoury (it’s ham and cheese on french toast), is traditionally served in the US dredged in icing sugar, with jam. As an American, I apologise.The Japanese strawberry and cream sandwich – or ichigo sando – on which M&S based its version, is easy enough to recreate at home. Justwatch recipe developer Marc Matsumoto. I substituted brioche slices for the authentic Japanese milk bread: it’s easier to find.First, carefully wash, top and dry your strawberries – five per sandwich. Whip a generous quantity of double cream, sweeten to taste and set aside.The final key component in this recipe is strawberry jam – spread a thin layer on both bread slices and heap the whipped cream on top in shallow pyramids. On one half push your largest strawberry into the centre of the cream and then position four more round it, pointy ends facing the corners of the bread.View image in fullscreenUse five strawberries per sandwich and a generous quantity of cream.Photograph: Tim Dowling/The GuardianPlace the other slice on top and gently push down at the corners and edges until the top is sort of domed and the edges of both slices are nearly touching. Now wrap the whole thing snugly in cling film and leave in the fridge until it firms up – about half an hour. Then remove, unwrap and slice crossways. If you’ve been careful, you should end up cutting right through the middle of three strawberries – presentation counts.This is delicious, and why shouldn’t it be? Ultimately, what’s not to like? Jam, strawberries, cream, brioche – it’s basically a Victoria sponge.View image in fullscreen‘What’s not to like’ … Tim’s strawberries and cream sandwich.Photograph: Tim Dowling/The GuardianIf you’re after a more decorative fruit sando, you can make these rathersophisticated flower versions using grapes, kiwi, tangerines and strawberries.The ice-cream sandwich was invented in New York City at the turn of the last century, as an improvement on small slabs of ice-cream served between sheets of paper by street vendors. The idea caught on. “There are ham sandwiches and salmon sandwiches and cheese sandwiches and several other kinds of sandwiches,”announced the New York Mail and Express in 1899, “but the latest is the ice-cream sandwich.” They cost a penny, and quickly became a fad.It’s hard to be precise about what went on the outside of those first ice-cream sandwiches. A reporter sent out to investigate by the New York Sun in 1901 described it as “a thin, delicate, freshly baked and altogether agreeable sweet cracker”.The ones I remember from childhood were chocolate, rectangular and pleasingly bland.This recipe is a decent approximation, without getting too complicated – flour, sugar, cocoa powder, butter, bicarbonate of soda, a pinch of salt, milk and a few drops of vanilla, whisked to a smooth consistency, dropped in uniform spoonfuls on to a lined baking tray and baked for about 10 minutes, but keep an eye on them.Once they’re cool, they need to be frozen for an hour before they’re stiff enough to squish a scoop of ice-cream between. Refreeze until needed. This recipe contains an important advisory: the ice-cream must be of the worst sort – soft and airy – for this to work. The ice-cream sandwich isn’t everybody’s idea of a good time – a lot of people don’t like biting into ice-cream – but I would eat these for breakfast.View image in fullscreen‘I would eat these for breakfast’ … an ice-cream sandwich.Photograph: Tim Dowling/The GuardianOther variations includethe chocolate chip cookie ice-cream sandwichand the Italianbrioche con gelato, which is literally some ice-cream in a bun (apparently Siciliansdoeat these for breakfast).The apple pie panini sounds plausible enough: take the basic constituents of an apple pie, jam them between two slices of bread and toast.This recipe, from justataste.com, combines thinly sliced apple, mascarpone whipped with honey, and bread (they use raisin bread, but I couldn’t find any, so I returned to my brioche loaf).View image in fullscreenThe apple pie panini.Photograph: Tim Dowling/The GuardianMy version, alas, was not an unalloyed success: the mascarpone melted and leaked out everywhere, while the apples remained uncooked, and the brioche went gluey in the heat of the sandwich press. It could work with different bread and different filling, but that, I think, would be a different sandwich.Finally, if you are so minded, you can reproduce your own birthday cake sandwich at home, such asthis one from Love in My Oven. A cake sandwich is, after all, just a cake with the icing on the inside – the “bread” here is just a sheet of sponge. This recipe is loosely based on sandwich cakes currently available from vending machines in US shopping malls. But if you’re going to produce a single slice of cake for your birthday, it seems somehow fitting that you should have to make it yourself. Many happy returns.Explore more on these topicsSandwichesFoodDessertCakeBreadFruitfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Former participants also recommend gloves, because the desert sand gets, well, everywhere.It sounds like an absolute nightmare.Don’t worry, none of that will be repeated this year.How can you be sure?Because the Orgy Dome blew away just as the festival began.What do you mean, blew away?“Our build team worked so hard this past week toerectour lovely space,” the Orgy Dome team posted on Instagram.Fnar.“Unfortunately,” they continued, “the winds yesterday undid all that labor and wrecked our structure.”Any other casualties?Yes. Dust storms ripped through the Burning Man site, destroying camps and installations and injuring at least four people.Sounds like another great festival disaster, like that one on that island.You’re referring to Fyre Festival, the 2017 luxury music event that went so wrong it spawned two documentaries and earned one organiser six years in prison.And it all started with a simple spelling mistake.Then there are all those years at Glastonbury when peace, love and rock’n’roll were replaced by rivers of mud.Honestly, who would put on a music festival?Even Burning Man has had its share of past troubles: in 2023 a tropical storm stranded 70,000 people on the site.Is there no chance of getting thedome up and running this year?Probably not, but the organisers are still hoping to arrange some workshops.A workshop is not an orgy, as I have previously learned to my cost.Every day is a school day.Do say:“We welcome the combination of love in all its forms – just not this year.”Don’t say:“If you happen to see a tornado made of condoms, text us.”Explore more on these topicsFestivalsPass notesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The lifeless bodies of children killed while queueing for water. Emaciated hostages, still held captive by Hamas almost two years after those appalling terror attacks.These images and countless more have horrified us all in recent months. The humanitarian crisis inGazamust stop. The famine must end. The hostages must be returned home.There is one man, more than anyone else, who has the power to make it happen. One man who could pick up the phone to Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, and tell him to end the aid blockade that is causingsuffering and starvationon such an appalling scale. One man who could use his influence on Qatar and other Gulf states to help secure the urgent release of Hamas’s hostages.Donald Trump could do those things today if he chose to. He has more power than anyone else finally to force a ceasefire and put Israel and Palestine on the path to a lasting peace with a two-state solution.But so far, he’s decided not to. Instead, he’s given Netanyahu his full support. Last week, when he was making his bogus boasts about ending six wars, Trump said Ukraine is “the only one left” – showing he doesn’t even see what’s happening in Gaza as a war he wants to stop.In three weeks’ time, Trump will touch down in the UK for his second state visit, which willinclude a state banquetat Windsor Castle hosted by King Charles.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump with the late Queen during his state visit to the UK in June 2019.Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PAOne of the great privileges of being the leader of my party is that my wife, Emily, and I are invited to attend state banquets. Receiving an invitation from the king is an enormous honour, and I take very seriously my duty to our sovereign. As a member of parliament, I have proudly sworn by almighty God that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to His Majesty King Charles, his heirs and successors. To refuse an invitation like this goes against all of my instincts.But having thought and prayed long and hard about it with Emily, I have come to the conclusion that on this occasion I must refuse.This is not about the many other issues on which I profoundly disagree with President Trump. I think Keir Starmer is right to engage with him, although I do wish he were tougher with Trump on everything from tariffs to Vladimir Putin. Indeed, I argued last January that we should use the offer of a state visit – something Trump so desperately craves – as leverage to persuade him to do the right thing. I believe the US is an important ally, no matter who is in the White House, and I strongly believe in sitting down and negotiating with the president, no matter our disagreements.So what it comes down to now is this: I fear we could have a situation where Trump comes to our country, is honoured with a lavish dinner at one of our finest palaces, and nobody reminds him that he has the power to stop the horrifying starvation, death and captivities in Gaza. And no one uses this moment to demand that the US president pick up that phone to Netanyahu and the Qataris and do the right thing.I feel a responsibility to do whatever I can to ensure the people in Gaza are not forgotten during the pomp and ceremony, and to ensure the UK makes Trump’s personal responsibility for securing peace inIsraeland Palestine an issue.Boycotting the state banquet is not something I ever wanted to do, but I believe it is the only way I can send a message to both Trump and Starmer that they cannot close their eyes and wish this away. Donald Trump must act now to end the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza and get the hostages released.Ed Davey is leader of the Liberal DemocratsExplore more on these topicsGazaOpinionDonald TrumpBenjamin NetanyahuPalestinian territoriesIsraelMiddle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

Might the next stop be relative calm and a bit more civility?Wed 27 Aug 2025 09.55 EDTLast modified on Wed 27 Aug 2025 11.37 EDTShareThere is that scene in so many westerns films, of the kind forever playing on daytime TV,when all seems lost but suddenly the cavalry comes riding over the horizon.The cavalry came to save me this week and they were wearing the uniforms of Transport for London, which runs the buses and many of the railways in the capital. TfL, as it is known, wants all who play stuff on their mobile phones without headphonesto get out of town by sundown. Or at the very least to stop it. Signs are going up to that effect. Yeehaw! Go get them!I don’t want to be grumpy Uncle Albert. The public space is just that. It’s communal: I like communal. We share the joys, the mundanity and sometimes the grind of navigating a crowded capital. I don’t use taxis. I know the crush of being sardined on an early morning tube train and exiting smelling a bit like the armpit of the bulky builder I was sandwiched next to. I have had great late nights heading home to the suburbs from centralLondonafter an evening out on a jolly, overpopulated, everyone-crushed-together tube train.My favourite such journey, in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic – by which time the fear had subsided and relief was unconfined – was on a cheek by jowl, booze-fuelled carriage, with half of the inhabitants chanting “we’re all gonna get Covid”, the other half laughing. Notwithstanding the seriousness of the virus, we knew where the sentiment came from. It was a shared experience.Who can say that same sentiment applies to the dead-eyed sorts riding the tube and buses while transmitting tinny sound from their mobile phones? True, they are sharing, but it’s very much their bespoke experience; it’s very much an overshare.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: TfLI long ago made my peace with the sound escaping from people’s headphones. It’s annoying, but par for the course in a public sphere. But do I want a bespoke sharing experience with the guy blaring Champions League football highlights​ on his iPhone from the night before? No. Do I need to know what’s huge on your screechy TikTok? No, no. What’s all the rage in Bollywood? No, no, no. A whiny clip from a soap opera? No and no, thrice no. Whether your relative in Kraków or Kingston, Jamaica or Manilla or Washington state passed his or her exams? Hell no! Good luck to them. Good luck to you – but put some headphones on.​We all have rights and in the noisy, vibrant cities of this country, there’s room for free expression, but here’s the thing: we also have a duty of care. Your decision – and yes, it is a specific decision – to share your experience with me, without any consideration of me or anyone else, was always prohibited under the bylaws ofTfL. Now they will erect signs reminding you of that and asking that you be considerate.True, signs only get you so far; they don’t act as a muffler or an off button. But in this case they set a benchmark and highlight rules that the travelling public, seeking respite, aware that many an overground railway train already has “quiet carriages”, can reasonably ask to be enforced on the buses and the capital’s tube lines.So perhaps this is the end of “headphone dodging”, as they call it. Perhaps it is just the beginning of the end. I don’t know how an overstretched transport authority – already struggling to catch fare dodgers – can possibly have the resources to police it. But I am hoping it won’t really have to.There are rules, often unspoken, about what seems legitimate practice in shared space. You might not like a particular busker, but many have the imprimatur of being licensed by public authority, which means your personal like or dislike takes a back seat to the view of others. As for the ones that aren’t licensed, if they are too annoying to too many people, they are silenced by society’s indifference and pointed refusal to part with any money.The TikTok sharers, the Bollywood blarers, the football highlights transmitters, the open mic’d menaces: they break the rules both unspoken and official. Let the “headphones on” signs go up – and let the people be the cavalry.Hugh Muir is executive editor, OpinionExplore more on these topicsTfLOpinionTransportLondonPublic transportRail transportcommentShareReuse this content"

Social media thrives on mimicry – but this was a step too farEsme HewittAt its best, the internet can be a space where people share stories and ideas. But the line between inspiration and theft can easily become blurredWed 27 Aug 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 27 Aug 2025 10.32 EDTShareLast month, I wrote an article aboutbeing adopted by a British couple during the era of China’sone-child policy. Three days after the story ran in anational newspaper, my phone buzzed with a flurry of messages from a friend who had sent me a TikTok post by an influencer telling her life story to camera. Twenty seconds into her video, my jaw plummeted. She had recited entire sections of my article, word for word, to her 20,000 followers. She didn’t even have the courtesy to give me a credit.When I wrote that piece, the idea of exposing personal details of my life to scrutiny or criticism was terrifying. Even so, it felt right to share this story in the hope that others might find comfort if they too had had similar experiences. What I wasn’t expecting was for someone to take my words and claim them as their own.The influencer spoke of her adoption but she took sections of the article in which I discussed my intimate thoughts and feelings, and passed these off as her own. She recited how “in my early twenties, I measured my self-worth in how many matches I got on Tinder or how many boys I was texting”, and having “imagined a childhood in China and being raised by my biological parents”. Taking the exact phrases I had written, she reposted them to her followers, and then thanked users in the comments when they complimented her. I understand that imitation is the highest form of flattery but this was blatant stealing.View image in fullscreenEsme Hewitt’s article about her life that appeared in the Times, and was plagiarised on TikTok.I commented on the video: “Have you heard of plagiarism?” Soon afterwards, her husband appeared in my DMs on Instagram.He told me I wasn’t “the only Asian in the world adopted in that time frame”, dismissed me as “not that special” and even claimed I had copied his wife’s original videos. I called them both crazy and immediately blocked him.After this, I felt I had to set the record straight. So the next morning I made a video arguing that the influencer was plagiarising my work and included clips of her video alongside my article as proof. In response to myTikTok, she and her husband posted a video, insisting: “Her story and experience is also my story and experience … I did not steal her story.” Hours later she posted another video, apologising for using my words and saying she was sorry for any hurt feelings, and that her intent was not “malicious”. She also messaged me privately to apologise.Plagiarism– passing off someone else’s words or ideas as your own without sourcing or credit – is a career-ending offence in most industries. At university, it was drilled into me that you could be expelled if your essay included too much text that borrowed from existing work without giving it credit. The message was explicit: you do not plagiarise.View image in fullscreenEsme HewittYet on social media the message is far more ambiguous. While TikTok explains that copyright protects “original works of authorship” and bans users from posting content that infringes anyone else’s intellectual property, it also states that copyright does not extend to underlying ideas: “For example, a person may own the copyright to a film, but not the underlying plot or themes that are expressed in the film.” With Instagram, the platform encourages creators to post original content, but in practice plagiarism and infringement often go unnoticed unless a creator spots and reports it themselves. YouTube, at least, has built-in systems that can scan videos and let rights holders set the rules, but there is little to protect smaller creators whose ideas are stolen, or when work is lifted from across the internet.Platforms thrive on mimicry. Originality is rare. So much so that when someone creates something new, it’s often copied by thousands of others in a matter of hours, with little or no credit given to the original creator.The media critic and gaming YouTuber Harry Brewis, also known asHbomberguy, made a video on plagiarism in 2023 which became a surprise hit (it has clocked up some 38m views to date). He gave 17 examples where YouTube creators had stolen words, content and ideas from smaller creators or online forums, observing that “plagiarists seem to have this belief that they are better than their targets…: ‘Your ideas are wasted on you. They’d be much better served in my videos.’”Aspiring creators need content to help them gain followers, and established creators reliant on advertising revenue need to churn out content at pace. Any work, be it a piece of writing or a video, requires time and effort, but the incentive is to make a lot of work, quickly. In theory, audiences prize originality and fresh, exciting content – but for creators who post every day, publishing new content so often is unrealistic, leading some to copy and imitate others.The line between inspiration and theft can easily become blurred. An original idea trends when people are able to take a concept and make it their own, allowing memes and in-jokes to develop. Once enough people replicate an idea, it transforms into a trend and the source often disappears entirely. Take, for example, theNothing beats a Jet2 holidaytrend, which has inspired some 2.9m videos. Creators have taken the sound from the Jet2holidays advert and overlaid it on clips of things going spectacularly wrong – a tent catching fire, someone flying off a boat – turning the original ad into something entirely new.The flip side of this is that once an idea exists online, it’s regarded as fair game to copy without credit. My video went viral, with thousands of users in the comments supporting me and debating online plagiarism. My story then gained another life. Other creators posted “drama” and explainer videos of the situation I had already outlined in my video. I was delighted to see the situation sparking a wider debate, but I couldn’t help but be sceptical of their motivations. Were the people now weighing in on the story doing so to shed light on plagiarism or to chase views?At its best the internet can be a space where people share stories and ideas, and where creativity inspires more creativity. Giving credit is non negotiable. It creates a positive cycle where new ideas build on old ones, and where the time and effort someone has put into their work is recognised. In giving credit where it’s due, creators may feel incentivised to create rather than race to produce quick shareable content in the fear that their work might be stolen. Originality deserves celebration – and not to be reduced to simply content mined for virality.Esme Hewitt is a freelance journalistExplore more on these topicsPlagiarismOpinionTikTokChina's one-child policyDigital mediaSocial mediacommentShareReuse this content"

Think againJ Oliver ConroyNew lawsuit aimed at Amazon questions the legitimacy of the word ‘buy’ when it comes to owning a movie on your devicesWed 27 Aug 2025 13.09 EDTLast modified on Wed 27 Aug 2025 14.54 EDTShareA possible class-action lawsuit againstAmazon Prime, one of the world’s biggest platforms for streamingfilmandtelevision, has raised an odd question: what does it mean tobuysomething?The proposed lawsuit, which was filed last week in federal court and firstreportedby the Hollywood Reporter, alleges that Prime’s practice of offering users the chance to “buy” (as opposed to “rent”) content is inherently deceptive. The suit argues that buying something implies perpetual possession – but that Amazon, like many other streaming services, is really just selling its customers viewing licenses that can be revoked at any time, in keeping with fine print that most customers do not read or understand.Regardless of whether the lawsuit is ultimately successful, it speaks to a real problem in an age when people access films, television series, music and video games through fickle online platforms: impermanence. The advent of streaming promised a world of digital riches in which we could access libraries of our favorite content whenever we wanted. It hasn’t exactly worked out that way.‘Death to streamers!’: can a New York video store start a revolution?Read moreMany movie fans are already familiar with a certain scenario. Let’s say that you are seized, this Friday night, by an urge to rewatch one of your favorite films, Double Indemnity. (You are a popular and sociable person – charismatic, attractive, with many friends – but feel under the weather this weekend.) If you are especially prudent, you own the film on a physical format – such as a Criterion Collection Blu-ray – but if not, you just typewatch double indemnity 1944into a search engine and see what comes up.Given that beloved older films and television shows are increasinglydifficultto find on streaming platforms, you will be relieved to see the film listed on any of the services you subscribe to, such as Netflix, Hulu or HBO Max. When you click on the links, however, there is a high chance that one of those dreaded landing pages appears: “REMIND ME WHEN THIS IS AVAILABLE” or “THIS TITLE IS NOT CURRENTLY AVAILABLE IN YOUR COUNTRY.”There are ways to watch the film thatdon’t involvepaying, but let’s say that you’re a scrupulously honest person. Fortunately, Amazon Prime has Double Indemnity available on demand: you can rent the movie, for 48 hours of playback, for $3.79 – or “buy” it for $14.99. The second option is more expensive, but if it is truly one of your favorite movies you may decide to buy it so you can watch it again whenever you want. And in just a couple of clicks – faster than Barbara Stanwyck can light a cigarette in the darkened living room of a California villa – the Paramount logo is blooming on your television screen. Not bad, right?The problem is that you aren’t downloading the movie, to own and watch forever; you’re just getting access to it on Amazon’s servers – a right that only lasts as long as Amazon also has access to the film, which depends on capricious licensing agreements that vary from title to title. A month or five years from now, that license may expire – and the movie will disappear from your Amazon library. Yet the $14.99 you paid does not reappear in your pocket.If you’re a film buff, like me, you may already have heard ofthings like thishappening. In 2018, users of iTunes who had purchased titles for their digital libraries were unhappy to learn that the company haddeletedsome of them without telling them. Last year, customers of Funimation, an anime streaming service that was acquired by another company,discoveredthat the titles they had purchased from Funimation would not be ported over to the new platform. Video game and music fans have reported similar frustrations.If online chatter is any indication, a class-action lawsuit against Prime would have some takers. Reacting to the news of the suit, someone on Redditdescribedbuying the director’s cut of Aliens from Prime; after watching it for 10 years, “I went to my purchased movies in the Amazon app and it is now gone. No explanation and no recourse.”“Happened to me,” another person wrote. “Bought the original Battlestar Galactica series. Now it’s gone.”(Amazon did not respond to my request for comment at the time of publication.)Disappointment with streaming’s limitations are a major reason that many pop culture fans have, in recent years,returnedto a format long thought dying: physical media. Like vinyl records, which have had an unexpected renaissance, film discs and other seemingly old-school technologies have been embraced in recent years by a small but passionate segment of film and TV buffs. Earlier this year, the first new physical video store in many yearsopenedin New York.In particular, movie fans haverediscoveredBlu-rays, which debuted in 2006 as a higher-definition successor to DVDs, as well as their new and even higher-definition sibling, the 4K UHD, which has become the gold-standard for “home cinema” enthusiasts. I’m one of those physical-media fans. I have about 400 movies on disc, mostly Blu-rays, hidden in a cabinet beneath my TV. In the age of streaming, some of my friends think I’m deranged.But the films look great, don’t need the internet to watch and – most importantly – never disappear.Explore more on these topicsFilmAmazon Prime VideoDigital mediacommentShareReuse this content"

It’s time to try the truthWed 27 Aug 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 27 Aug 2025 04.39 EDTShareSo begins another chapter in the liberation struggle. Released from bondage to the EU, Britain finds itself subjugated to a more insidious foe. The border that should have been sealed is wide open. The foreign hordes are still coming, but their passage is no longer directed by bureaucrats from Brussels. This time, national emancipation depends on breaking the tyranny of human rights lawyers.That is the plot to Nigel Farage’s Brexit sequel, previewed on Tuesday in an airport hangar in Oxfordshire. The Reform UK leaderlaid out plansfor “mass deportation” of migrants – all who arrive without permission, plus those who are here already and came by illicit channels.Tens of thousands will be targeted. There would be cash incentives for anyone volunteering to leave. Refusers would be rounded up, detained in camps and flown to their countries of origin or, if those places won’t have them, some other place. A remote island, maybe. The exchequer would remunerate receptive governments.If deportees face the likely prospect of torture or death on arrival, well, that would be unfortunate but not sufficient grounds to stop the flights.There would be no legal recourse to sanctuary because the UK would withdraw from international treaties and conventions that grant protection to refugees. TheEuropean court of human rightswould have no say. The universal principles it upholds would be expunged from domestic statute, to be replaced by custom-made British rights. And in that category, there is only one entitlement Farage holds sacred – the freedom of the settled British population to live unmolested by the phantom multitude offoreign criminals posing as refugees.By calling his plan Operation Restoring Justice, Farage is hinting at future redress for the grievance, much aired in radical rightwing circles online, that police and courts operate “two-tier” policies with a systemic bias in favour of immigrants. The inference is that courts might be used as instruments of nationalist restitution, dismantling liberal multiculturalism, putting native-born Britons first.This is not an original programme. The last Conservative government passed several laws on the premise that the illegal traffic in boats across the Channel would be deterred bythreats of detention and deportation. When it didn’t work, blame fell on European convention rights that prohibit sending people to unsafe places. Ministers legislated again, creating a statutory power for ministers todeclare a country safe: Rwanda, specifically, regardless of evidence to the contrary.A bill to assert the primacy of British rights over European ones has been rattling around Tory policy cupboards for longer still.David Cameron pledged oneahead of the 2010 general election, and again in 2015. A version of it resurfaced under Boris Johnson, and even made it as far as a first reading in parliament in 2022, but no further. The problem each time has been the same. A bill that repudiated international treaties would signal Britain’s withdrawal from the community of reliable democracies, sabotaging diplomatic relations and burning alliances. No responsible prime minister would consider it. Even irresponsible ones have shied at the cost.That is no impediment to theReform UKleader. He welcomes objections to his plans on the basis of what a law-abiding government should do because his offer to the electorate is wilful transgression and denial of consequence. When politicians whose methods are deemed to have failed say a plan is reckless, Farage’s audience hears a recommendation. Recklessness sounds like a virtue if it means the status quo is in jeopardy.The Reform plan doesn’t entirely ignore the logistics of implementation. There is a cost estimate of £10bn over five years, including £2.5bn for the construction of detention centres in as yet undetermined locations. The numbers are fictions, big enough to sound serious but small enough to be easily covered by some bogus revenue source in a future manifesto.Diplomatic obligations to honour treaties are swept aside with an invocation of national emergency. Public order is imperilled by uncontrolled migration, Farage says. Then he executes a rhetorical pivot from the undesirable character of those arriving by boat – “suspected of being involved in some form of terrorism” – to the prospect of unrest in communities where there is “rising anger” and “despair” at the influx of these marauding interlopers. His warnings are threats. His forebodingfans the flames.The call to arms is amplified by what used to be called the Tory press, but now treats Farage with deference as prime minister-in-waiting. There is a lot of presumption in that posture when the next general election doesn’t have to be held before summer 2029. Reform UK currently have four MPs, 316 seats short of a working majority.But not much about Farage’s candidacy fits the conventional template of party politics. By any measure of success except parliamentary representation and ministerial offices held, he is the most significant leader of his generation. No policy action of the 21st century matchesBrexitin terms of consequence for Britain, nor even comes close. Boris Johnson can take credit for cajoling a majority to vote leave in 2016. David Cameron earns a place on the podium of shame for blundering into a referendum in the first place. But Farage’s agitation was the key. He set the goal, branded it “independence” and connected it to the high-voltage rail of anti-immigrant feeling.Whatever else leaving the EU was meant to achieve – autonomy in tariff rates, regulatory sovereignty, bendier bananas – border control was baked in as the test of a proper Brexit. Free movement had to end. That is whyTheresa May ruled out single market membershipbefore negotiations in Brussels had even started, and why Keir Starmerkeeps it off the table.That taboo prevents the prime minister properly describing the economic cost of Brexit. It mutes any recognition of all the other dimensions of national self-harm involved in withdrawal from a continental trading bloc at what history will judge to be the worst possible moment to go chasing delusions of free-trading global grandeur.Starmer is stranded in a strategic cul-de-sac, managing a stagnant economy. He struggles to address the frustration and dismay of a demoralised electorate, while the principal author of their predicament rehearses the remake.There was a tactical case to avoid making the last general election a relitigation of Brexit. There are reasons still to choose words carefully when commenting on an issue that stirred strong emotions, not to belittle the hopes and expectations of leave voters or conflate their sincerity with the venal cynicism of campaigns that lied about what was on offer.But are we really going to spend the next four years watching Farage leaf casually through the familiar playbook, running the same campaign to the fawning applause of the same courtier commentariat? Is it too much to expect aLabourgovernment to raise, by way of rebuttal, the Reform leader’s proven failure as an arbiter of the national interest? We tried listening to him. His probity and judgment were sold as the product called Brexit. It turned out to be a piece of shit. Enough people already know this is the truth, but it would be liberating to hear it from the prime minister.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But my loathing runs deeper than thatWed 27 Aug 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 27 Aug 2025 15.25 EDTShareIt’s one of those topics that comes up over drinks or dinner at the moment: whether or not you think AI is going to steal your job. So far, I’ve felt relatively confident that while AI could no doubt have a fair crack at writing a newspaper opinion column, there is something I do as part of my work that AI cannot: reporting.Except now, it seems, AI is claiming to be doing that as well. Last week, it was revealed thatat least six reputable publicationshave had to take down published articles because it turned out that they were probably pieces of fiction written by AI and then passed off by somebody as works of journalism under the name of Margaux Blanchard. One of these was a piece for Wired titled They Fell in Love Playing Minecraft. Then the Game Became Their Wedding Venue, which quoted a “digital celebrant” called Jessica Hu, who does not seem to actually exist. Another publication, called Dispatch, received a pitch from “Blanchard” about an ex-mining town called Gravemont that had been repurposed as a training ground for death investigation. Gravemont doesn’t exist either.When I get into social conversations on subjects like ChatGPT, I try to fight the red mist that descends on me. I hate ChatGPT. And I call it hatred because it provokes a physical reaction in me of something just below real anger. I don’t find it scary, or annoying, or confusing. I hate it.So I’ve been trying to get to the bottom of what it is exactly that I hate. There are decent reasons to rejoice at the advent of the AI age. It seems likely that it will have the capacity to revolutionise, for instance, scientific endeavour: a scientist friend of mine described how AI would speed up the process of coming up with and testing hypotheses in his field. Mundane work tasks will also take less time with the help of AI.But there are also plenty of reasons to chafe against it. There’s the well-documented environmental impact of using ChatGPT. But with respect to Earth, this isn’t the element that has me wringing my hands the most. It’s not even that people are actively buying into a piece of technology that is likely to make many of their own jobs obsolete, or the way that the AI overviews on, say, a Google search often blithely give you straight-up wrong information. Nor the fact that the people at the forefront of the AI revolution have the crashingly terrible vibes of your classic tech bro loser.Here’s the part I suspect may be too tragically reactionary of me: I am worried that a reliance on ChatGPT will erode people’s ability to use their brains. I do believe that the creative imagination in particular is a muscle, and one that is rewarding to exercise. Recently I was helping a seven-year-old work on her creative writing for school. She had to describe a forest, so I asked her to close her eyes and picture one, and tell me what she could see. Oh, we didn’t need to do that, she told me. We could just ask AI to make one.I heard secondhand about an editor asking ChatGPT for help restructuring an article. And again, call me a luddite, but I just thought: no! Some things are supposed to be difficult! It is good for the brain to have to rise to a task! I read about someone using ChatGPT to order from a restaurant menu. It is one of the small joys of life to select what food you want to eat at a restaurant. Why cede that to a machine when you don’t have to?But that’s not even the worst of it, in my view. The worst of it is the way ChatGPT seems to be creeping into people’s personal lives. Using ChatGPT to design a workout plan, to fix a problem in some coding or to summarise a dense document, fine, fine, fine. If you like. But when I hear about people using it to write a birthday card, a best man’s speech or a breakup text, a tiny part of my soul dies. And I don’t think this is the high and mighty position of someone who’s a writer by trade. None of these pieces of writing need to be perfectly expressed or grammatically flawless. They need to come from the heart and be real.At the root of my hatred of ChatGPT is that people’s willingness to use it in this way implies they are happy to turn meaningful interactions like these into something transactional: a task to be completed efficiently and moved on from. So much of the value of, say, receiving a letter, whether emailed or in the post, comes from knowing that somebody sat down and thought about what to say. A human being spent some of their precious time and mental effort on communicating with you.I am well aware that in 15 years’ time I may be wrapping up my seamlessly AI-optimised work day, turning to my AI-powered AutoSpouse and laughing at this article. How naive I was, worried about nothing! I love you, machine programmed to mimic love! I realise, too, that my hatred of ChatGPT might one day relegate me to the scrap heap in terms of future employment opportunities, for not knowing how to wrangle AI into doing things for me. Fine. I’ll go and live in the woods and be miserable. But I will be miserable in an analogue manner, and with my ability to think intact.Imogen West-Knights is a writer and journalistExplore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

The trend is so widespread that it’s even got a name:Mar-a-Lago face. Among women the look is characterised by huge lips that look as if they could suck up a small child whole, frozen facial expressions, and cheeks so bulbous you could hide a gerbil underneath them. Men also have the slickfrozen faces, but instead of bigger lips they’re pairing them with bigger jaws. In recent years,surgeons have reporteda large increase of male clients demanding stronger jawlines.I wouldn’t normally be snarky about someone’s looks but let’s be clear: nobody is born with Mar-a-Lago face. These are not human faces, they are luxury meat-masks meant to signal wealth and in-group belonging. People such as Laura Loomer, Kristi Noem, and Matt Gaetz can afford excellent surgeons and subtle cosmetic work but, unless they’ve all had botched procedures, it seems they deliberately chose to look like AI-generated caricatures. One can only surmise that they live in such weird little bubbles, where everyone is addicted to filler, that this sort of conspicuous consumption of cosmetic surgery has become desirable.Having the right look is certainly desirable to optics-obsessed Donald Trump, whose chief concern for his underlings appears to be how they perform on TV. In 2017, an Axios report claimed that Trump wanted his female staff to “dress like women” and demanded that his male employees have a “certain look.” Over the years it seems the “certain look” has only become more extreme.An obsession with traditional gender norms also seems to factor into today’s exaggerated aesthetics. Earlier this year a New York-based dermatologisttold Politicothat fashion often shifts to more traditional gender expression in culturally conservative times. “It’s ironic … that they’re so against trans-ness and gender-affirming care for trans people,” the dermatologist said of Trump’s inner orbit. “Because, you know, they’re all doing their own gender-affirming care.” The Zambian bum-stick chimps seem positively sophisticated in comparison.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Labour strategists have seen Europe as a fissile topic, and Sir Keir’s opposition to Brexit in the 2016 referendum as a liability with swing voters. The prime minister has moved Britain closer to Europe, but in timid increments. The summit that formally “reset” relations early this year was long on statements of ambition, but short on substance. The government’s private recognition that economic logics impel Britain back into a European orbit has been in constant tension with fear of making that case in public.The balance now appears to be shifting. In aspeechon Wednesday, Nick Thomas-Symonds, the Cabinet Office minister responsible for EU relations, made the argument for closer regulatory alignment with Brussels in newly combative terms. The government is negotiating an agreement that would eliminate costly checks and licence requirements for food and drink exports to the continent. Mr Thomas-Symonds expanded his advocacy for that plan into an attack on Conservatives and Reform UK for peddling “snake oil” and willing Britain to fail by denying the need for closer EU cooperation.Mr Thomas-Symonds alsospoke enthusiasticallyabout proposals for a “youth experience” scheme, allowing 18- to 30-year-olds to travel and work in the Schengen area on extended visas in exchange for reciprocal access to the UK for continental visitors.This has long been mooted in Brussels, but ministers were initially allergic to the prospect lest it be mistaken for an agenda to restore the level of free labour movement associated with EU membership, or cynically misrepresented in those terms.It is no such thing. Polling evidence indicates clear majority support for a programme that would, for time-limited periods, open up new European opportunities for young people. That is hardly surprising when opinion polls also show considerably more dissatisfaction with Brexit and its consequences than is widely reflected in political discussion of the subject. A clear majority says that it was amistake to leavethe EU.That shouldn’t be confused with willingness to undergo the kind of upheaval and social division that a campaign to rejoin the union would entail. But it does suggest that the government could be more aggressive in its criticism of Boris Johnson’sBrexit, and more courageous in facing down the militant Eurosceptic minority that has for too long arrogated to itself the right to speak for the whole nation.AlthoughNigel Faragehas pledged to reverse Labour’s rapprochement with the EU, the Reform UK leader is notably reluctant to make a defence of Brexit the centrepiece of his bid to be prime minister. Indeed, none of the once ubiquitous high priests of Euroscepticism seem especially keen to be associated with the fulfilment of their cherished goal. That is a vulnerability in the opposition that Labour should be exploiting with more vigour.The manifest failure of Brexit to deliver any of its advertised bounties, coupled with the challenge of Donald Trump’s unreliable,protectionist administrationin Washington, make an indisputable case for Britain to seek greater strategic intimacy with the continental trading bloc on its doorstep. The government is moving in that direction, but too stealthily, behind public opinion, following where it could be leading.Explore more on these topicsBrexitOpinionEuropean UnionKeir StarmerLabourNigel FarageEuropeForeign policyeditorialsShareReuse this content"

A change in priorities is neededWed 27 Aug 2025 13.25 EDTLast modified on Wed 27 Aug 2025 14.06 EDTShareFollowing a startlingvictoryfor Marine Le Pen in European elections last June, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, foolishlycalleda snap legislative poll. The idea was to give voters a salutary wake-up call, daring them to repeat their embrace of Ms Le Pen’s far-right National Rally party in a domestic election. The unanticipatedresultwas a suddenly deadlocked parliament, in which the influence of the National Rally and the left significantly increased, and a lame-duck status for Mr Macron’s second term.That failed gamble has now led to another, which appears equally doomed. This week, Mr Macron’s fourth prime minister in two years put the future of his minority government on the line, in an attempt to pass a deeply unpopular budget this autumn. François Bayrou, intending to deliver his own wake-up call to MPs, has unexpectedlycalleda confidence vote to take place early next month. MPs will be challenged to either endorse in principle Mr Bayrou’s view that austerity is necessary to reduce the public deficit, or vote for the government to fall.Mr Bayrou may have thought that he might as well beat MPs to it. Last December, his immediate predecessor, Michel Barnier, was ignominiouslyforced outafter failing to push through his own spending cuts. But the chances of the prime minister’s bet coming off appear slim in the extreme: the combined forces of the French left and Ms Le Pen’s far-right MPs are set to vote against Mr Bayrou, which would be more than enough to seal his fate.The prospect of a second centre-right government collapsing over failed austerity has alreadytriggered market unease, with rising interest payments on public debt reflecting France’s lack of monetary sovereignty. The country’s borrowing costs are ultimately shaped byEuropean Central Bankpolicy despite a deficit nearly twice the eurozone average. On Tuesday, Mr Bayrou’s finance minister attempted to spook MPs by suggesting that if government borrowing was not reined in, France may even find itself going cap in hand to the International Monetary Fund. But it is the government that needs to embark on a political rethink rather than the public or opposition MPs.While rhetorically calling for collective sacrifice to restore the nation to fiscal good health, Mr Bayrou hasfocusedoverwhelmingly on the less well-off, pensioners and welfare recipients, as he seeks in the region of €44bn worth of savings. In a country where Mr Macron’s first-termabolitionof a wealth tax has contributed to rising inequality and a boom in the assets of the super-rich, that has not gone down well. As one leftwing MPsuggestedthis week, the prime minister’s chances of political survival would be far higher if he chose to put an end to the “fiscal gifts to the rich and to large companies, which Macron has increased like never before”.The chances of that happening are, of course, zero (although Mr Bayrou has vaguely hinted at the possibility of asking for a “specific effort” from the very wealthy). It thus appears likely that Mr Macron’s first autumn task will be to find yet another prime minister or call fresh elections with Ms Le Pen’s party far ahead in the polls. With a wave of planned strikes and demonstrations due to begin two days after Mr Bayrou’s fate is decided, Mr Macron’s presidency is petering out amid domestic acrimony and political stasis. He has only himself to blame.Explore more on these topicsFranceOpinionEmmanuel MacronNational RallyEuropeMarine Le PeneditorialsShareReuse this content"

Plus letters fromHilary Lang, Mike CowleyandJanet DubéWed 27 Aug 2025 13.07 EDTLast modified on Wed 27 Aug 2025 21.30 EDTShareDavid Lammy is good with words. He says “we need an immediate ceasefire”, in response to Israel’s horrific double tap attack on Nasser hospital (Israel bombed Gaza hospital a second time, killing rescuers, say health officials, 25 August). But he is, as usual, hopeless at following up the fine words with any action.Ofer Cassif makes clear that the UK government is already “complicit in this devastating human-made catastrophe” (Protests in Tel Aviv, army reservists refusing to serve: in Israel, more of us are saying no to this endless war, 25 August), but lists a number of steps that Keir Starmer and Lammy could take to end this complicity. These include the immediate unconditional recognition of Palestine, acknowledging Benjamin Netanyahu as a war criminal and supporting new West Bank sanctions. Above all, they must “recognise the people of Gaza as victims of a continuing genocide”, with the actions that would have to follow from that under thegenocide convention.It is depressing beyond words that the government refuses to call the destruction ofGazaand its people a genocide until the international court of justice delivers its final verdict, which will take years and by which time there may not be anyone left alive in Gaza.I don’t know how Starmer and Lammy live with themselves, knowing that their refusal to take every possible step to stop Israel’s horrific assault on Gaza makes them complicit in everything Israel does. Shame on them.Richard BarnesWindermere, CumbriaOnce again, a completely inadequate response from our government to this latest war crime from the Israeli government. Our government could respond with real sanctions against Israel. Instead, we get the same old 10 minutes of hand-wringing and then business as usual. I can’t decide if this is the result of an almost pathological fear of offending Donald Trump or a total moral vacuum at the heart of the Labour party. Either way, it gives me little hope for the future of our country.Hilary LangFrome, SomersetOwen Jones is right (From the streets of Baghdad, I saw a clear line to the bloodshed in Gaza, 26 August). The politicians who authorised military campaigns in Libya, Syria and especially Iraq continue to be feted by a culpable media as grandees and voices of experience to be tapped for insights into the latest global crises. If Tony Blair, George Bush and others had instead been held to criminal account, or at least seen their reputations flayed in the public eye, the political space available to those complicit in Gaza’s horrors would have been significantly narrowed.That should not discourage us from raising our voices. The huge mobilisations against the Iraq invasion helped caution UK governments against attempting to justify future military adventures as freedom exported at the end of the barrel of a gun. If the people of Gaza can sustain hope in hopeless conditions, we have an inescapable duty to hold to account those with responsibility closer to home.Mike CowleyEdinburghThere is no discounting anything that Martin Griffiths, the former UN under-secretary general, wrote (I’ve seen the UN at its best. As it turns 80, with a world in crisis, it must recover its courage, 26 August). But if the deaths and injuries in Gaza, the courage of doctors, journalists, rescuers and families, the ever-present risk of violating international law (Israel’s attack on hospital in Gaza may constitute a war crime on many fronts, 25 August), the pleas of NGOs and inevitable global condemnation are insufficient to deter Israel, or oblige the US to withdraw support, what can the UN do that it isn’t already trying? It is the decisions of states that allow the defiance of UN resolutions to continue in Palestine and elsewhere.Janet DubéPeebles, Scottish BordersHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

We beg to differ, because the evidence points exactly to the opposite.Every year the Greek statistical authority, Elstat, publishes its Survey on Qualitative Characteristics of Resident Tourists. TheJuly 2025 editionpresents comprehensive evidence that Greek residents’ trips and nights spent on trips for leisure, recreation and holidays have been rising since 2021. Both the number of trips and the total number of nights spent on vacations are at their peak for the past decade. The overwhelming majority (more than 85%) of Greeks’ vacations take place within Greece, and more than 70% occur in the summer months of June, July and August.Further evidence demonstrating the increased ability of Greeks to take vacations is provided by Elstat’s annual Household Budget Survey. Thelatest editionshows that the category most closely related to vacations, “Restaurants, cafes and hotels”, presents the fastest rise among 12 sub-categories of expenditure; its share in total household expenditure is the highest of the past 16 years, and is now higher than before the crisis.The numbers speak for themselves: with a remarkable economic recovery, reflected in rising employment and real incomes (as documented by Eurostat), Greeks are taking more and longer vacations, which they overwhelmingly spend inGreece.A number of Greeks, however, do have difficulties making ends meet, and raising their welfare standards is our government’s top priority. On that, we firmly believe we are on the right track.

Two matches in, she has shown that she has never been more ready for the challenges to come.Raducanu continued to demonstrate the fruits of her recent labour by putting together another devastating performance, demolishing the qualifier Janice Tjen 6-2, 6-1 to return to the third round of the US Open.Coco Gauff digs deep to survive Ajla Tomljanović test in US Open marathonRead moreThe challenge for Raducanu on Wednesday was figuring out a talented but unheralded opponent whom few players in the tournament have had the opportunity to watch, let alone face in a match.Once again, the British No 1 showed that she is playing her best tennis since winning the title here in 2021 here and that confidence is growing with every victory. Another dominant showing on Louis Armstrong Stadium was spearheaded by a supreme serving performance, which allowed her to step inside the baseline and dominate until the end.“I’m particularly happy, because I felt like my opponent was playing really good tennis,” Raducanu said. “I thought that she was very dangerous and any ball that I put midcourt was going to be punished. So I’m very pleased with how I kept dictating the points, I kept dictating the play, and didn’t let her too often get her front foot on the court. She’s obviously been playing very well, done a lot of winning, and took out Veronika [Kudermetova] in the first round. I was on full alert playing today.”This was a tricky challenge against an opponent whose ranking belies her form and quality. Despite being just six months older than Raducanu, the 23-year-old Tjen turned professional only last June after opting to take the US college route. Starting from the lowest rung of the ITF circuit, and receiving no wildcards, Tjen had compiled a 95-10 record over the past 15 months. From being unranked last June, she now stands at No 149.Tjen’s playing style bears more than a passing resemblance to one of the most distinctive champions of the 21st century: Ash Barty. She similarly pairs a potent, spinny forehand with a nasty, varied backhand slice and a willingness for pushing forward to the net. She played a brilliant opening‑round match to topple the 24th seed Kudermetova, which made her the first Indonesian player to win a grand slam main‑draw match in 22 years.Much like in her opening-round win against Ena Shibahara, however, Raducanu burst into the match producing a high level from the beginning. She served almost flawlessly, ending the set with 76% of first serves in, winning 84% of those first-serve points and firing down five aces in her four service games.“I thought that I served very well and I put quite a few aces on the board,” Raducanu said. “It always helps me when I’m serving well. It just kind of seeps into the rest of my game.”View image in fullscreenEmma Raducanu fired down five aces in her four service games of the opening set.Photograph: Clive Brunskill/Getty ImagesRaducanu’s confidence behind her serve imbued her with the freedom to swing more freely on her groundstrokes. She put the excellent Tjen backhand slice under relentless pressure throughout the set with her cross‑court backhand, striking the ball early and cleanly as she repeatedly pinned the Indonesian in her backhand corner.The straightforward opening set further inspired the most proactive version of Raducanu, who forced herself even further inside the baseline, taking bigger cuts of the ball earlier in the point. She smothered Tjen, who has no experience of competing against an opponent playing at such a high level and pace.In recent months, Raducanu has stressed the importance of improving the quality of her shotmaking in order to play more matches on her own terms. Although she has established a level of consistency, she felt she was relying too heavily on her court sense and fighting spirit rather than the quality of her ball-striking. Raducanu’s serving, the cleanliness of her groundstrokes and the way she bullied a lower-ranked opponent from on top of the baseline from start to finish showed that she continues to make progress.After two emphatic wins against two qualifiers, the third round will likely provide a far greater measure of Raducanu’s level. She awaits the winner of the second round match between Elena Rybakina, the ninth seed and 2022 Wimbledon champion, and another qualifier in Tereza Valentova.Explore more on these topicsUS Open Tennis 2025Emma RaducanuUS Open tennisTennisUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

If Celtic have deep regrets over misfires in Kazakhstan,Rangersendured a night of historic shame in Belgium, utterly incapable of recovering from their very poor first‑leg performance. Though by contrast to his horror show, that night of blunder was a positively creditable showing.Russell Martin’s stewardship is in grave danger after 10 games in charge. “It’s probably the toughest night I’ve had as a head coach, it doesn’t change the fact that I think we will progress, move forward and grow,” he said.Grimsby v Manchester United, Club Brugge v Rangers, and more: Champions League and Carabao Cup – liveRead moreThe response of the club’s new ownership, for whom Martin is the first managerial appointment, is keenly awaited though he said afterwards that a quiet word with Kevin Thelwell and Patrick Stewart had assured him of their continued faith. The depth Rangers plunged down in the first half made a mockery of Martin’s continued self-belief.“Madness, really,” he offered in explanation. “We apologise to the fans that travelled and the fans back home. There’s not enough harmony or care for each other quite yet. We knew that coming in. We have to build that. That harmony has been disrupted for sure.”His starting team selection, including eight summer signings, had been short on European experience. Looking ahead to a derby where both Glasgow’s giants’ managers enter under dark clouds, Martin said: “The only thing we can do tonight is accept the pain, accept the humiliation, accept the hurt and then use it as fuel.”View image in fullscreenRangers’ misery piles up as Hans Vanaken scores.Photograph: Soccrates Images/Getty ImagesBrugge sought to finish the tie quickly. Too easy. In the fifth minute, Nicolo Tresoldi nodded in. To compound early disaster, high farce as the Rangers defender Max Aarons found himself out of position. His solution? Hauling back Christos Tzoli for an indisputable straight red. Martin sent on the benched club captain James Tavernier, attempting to stop the bloodletting with the patient already long dead. “It’s not the standards I want to uphold:” said Tavernier afterwards. “We didn’t represent the club in any good form at all.”The screw had been ruthlessly turned, Tzolis stuck the woodwork via Jack Butland’s fingertips, Rangers’ goalkeeper was left unprotected throughout. Next, the veteran Hans Vanaken nodded in Tzolis’s corner, before striking the angle with a volley. The left-back Joaquin Seys made it three, then four, twice unmarked at the back post. Aleksandar Stanković’s free header made it five.Quick GuideBenfica edges past Mourinho's FenerbahceShowJosé Mourinho and Fenerbahce fell short of returning to the Champions League on Wednesday, losing 1-0 at Benfica in the qualifying playoffs.Benfica — the first club Mourinho coached — had two goals disallowed on video review in the first half before their Turkish forward Kerem Aktürkoğlu scored with a rising shot in the 35th minute for the only goal over the two legs.CopenhagenandQarabagof Azerbaijan also advanced to complete the 36-team lineup for the league phase, with the draw being made Thursday.Mourinho is a two-time Champions League winner but has not coached in the main stage of the marquee competition for six seasons. Fenerbahce’s absence now stretches to 17 seasons.Qarabag are back in the Champions League eight years after their debut campaign, winning 5-4 on aggregate against Ferencvaros despite a 3-2 defeat in Baku on Wednesday.Copenhagen won 2-0 at home against Basel to advance 3-1 on aggregate.The 36 sides who have qualified for the Champions League group stage this season are: Tottenham, Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester City, Chelsea, Newcastle, Napoli, Inter, Atalanta, Juventus, Barcelona, Real Madrid, Atlético Madrid, Athletic Club, Villarreal, Bayern Munich, Bayer Leverkusen, Eintracht Frankfurt, Borussia Dortmund, Paris Saint-Germain, Marseille, Monaco, PSV Eindhoven, Ajax, Sporting, Union Saint-Gilloise, Galatasaray, Slavia Prague, Olympiakos, Pafos, Bodo/Glimt, Kairat, Qarabag, Benfica, Club Brugge, Copenhagen.Associated PressWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.For all the sheer dreadfulness of Rangers, Brugge augmented the growing reputation of Belgian club football’s resurgence, echoing their decent showing last season in the group stage and knockouts. After the break, Tzolis, understandably coveted across Europe, swiftly scored the sixth, seizing on Tresoldi’s showboat backheel. Just as in the first half, Rangers were a goal down within five minutes of the whistle.Infamy loomed. Rangers’ previous club‑record European defeats were 6-0 against Real Madrid in 1960, 7-1 against Liverpool in 2022. Any relief from being the worst of all European nights lay only in Brugge stepping off the pace rather than any Rangers revival. “I don’t think we’ll be beat 6-0 again,” Martin said, severely tempting fate with Sunday calling.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueClub BruggeRangersEuropean club footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

That’s something that I’m really proud of and something that I really wanted.“I grew up wanting to play Ryder Cups. I grew up wanting to fight alongside these guys. It broke my heart not to play. It really did. You work for ever to make these teams but ultimately I was chosen to do a job. I was chosen to be the captain of this team.“My ultimate goal to start this thing was to be the best captain that I could be. I really want to leave this process knowing I did everything I could as a captain and I was ­worried if I played, I might not be able to do that.”It is ­understood that Bradley had turned to one of his assistants, Jim Furyk, to produce a comprehensive ­dossier on all that Ryder Cup captaincy involved.

He denied that ­comments from European players past or present influenced his thought process. Rory McIlroy had decreed publicly that it is not possible to be a playing captain, with the Northern Irishman’s sentiment ­delivered even more strongly by Sam Torrance, Nick Faldo and Ian Woosnam.“I just am not worried at all about what they do or say,” Bradley said. “I care about our team. I’m not quite sure how he [McIlroy] would know if it’s not possible. No one has ever done it really. I said through this process I wish I could call Arnold Palmer and get his advice. The simple fact is the Ryder Cup is a completely different animal than it was in the 60s.“They can make comments on what I can and cannot do. No one would have known. I was confident that if I did need to play, I had incre­dible vice-captains that I could lean on, an incredible team I could lean on. But I’ve said through this process over and over and over, I was going to do what I thought was best for the team, and this was the decision that I thought was best.”Donald Trump, who is expected to attend the Ryder Cup, had called for Bradley to play. “That was really surreal,” Bradley said. “When you see stuff like that, you start to wonder how you get to this point in your life but I was deeply, deeply honoured to hear him say that.”View image in fullscreenCameron Young, who has been picked as a wildcard, finished behind Keegan Bradley in the US points list.Photograph: Andrew J Clark/ISI Photos/Getty ImagesBradley admitted Maverick McNealy, who finished 10th in the US points standings, was entitled to feel sore at not being selected. “Please be angry with me and make the next team,” he said to McNealy.Bradley would not reveal how many players he contacted to inform them they would not play at ­Bethpage. Jordan Spieth and Brooks Koepka are the most high-profile absentees from the US team but due to poor form there was never any viable concept of either being picked.Luke Donald, Europe’s captain, will name his wildcards on Monday. Shane Lowry, Sepp Straka, Viktor Hovland, Ludvig Åberg, Jon Rahm and Matt Fitzpatrick are expected to be on Donald’s list.

The advantage has swung between them, at times from one race to the next, in the first part of the season, often with little to choose between the two. Neither driver has been able to definitively claim the upper hand entering the championship run-in. It looks set to remain a nip-and-tuck fight to the wire.Piastri came out on top in the early phases, his consistency and calm control edging out Norris, who made errors as he pushed a car that is not quite to his liking.McLarenhave been admirably determined to give both drivers an equal shot, insisting they will not employ team orders, a policy which can be expected to continue until (and if) one of their drivers claims an unassailable advantage.Unusually for teammates in a title fight, Piastri’s and Norris’s relationship has remained friendly, with some hard but fair racing andonly one coming together in Canada, for which Norris held up his hands. However, as the stakes rise, it should be an enthralling affair.View image in fullscreenLando Norris and Oscar Piastri share the podium in Hungary.Photograph: Guido De Bortoli/LAT ImagesOnwards and upwards: Hamilton and FerrariBefore the summer break, Lewis Hamilton cut an unusually disconsolate figure as the struggle of his debut season at Ferrari was writ large. The seven-time champion, perhaps like no other driver, needed a holiday. He qualified in 12th in Budapest, describing theperformance as “absolutely useless”and stating that Ferrari should perhaps find another driver. He was similarly unimpressed with taking 12th in the race, after which he even cast doubt on his future in the sport.“There is a lot going on in the background that is not great,” he said. When asked if he would return after the break, he gave a strangely equivocal response. “Hopefully I will be back, yeah.”Clearly it has been a long slog for Hamilton as he adjusts to his new team: a run of 16 races without a podium, including his last two for Mercedes, represents the longest streak of his career. That stat will not matter a jot to the British driver who is focused on the big picture atFerrari. Realistically, there was no doubt Hamilton would be back: he is a fighter, and not one to throw in the towel with a whimper. He posted “no days off” on social media during the break, which suggests he is energised once more.The key for him and Ferrari over the final 10 races is to build confidence, bond better with his engineers, find a groove with the team and, crucially, cultivate a sense they are moving forward with everyone in sync. The car will not radically improve now with all focus on the 2026 model but Hamilton and Ferrari can at least build a rhythm and momentum that will be vital if they are to compete next season.View image in fullscreenLewis Hamilton finished 12th at the Hungarian Grand Prix, a demoralising blow for the seven-time champion.Photograph: Rudy Carezzevoli/Getty ImagesNew-look Red Bull must convince VerstappenMax Verstappen finally committedto staying with Red Bulljust before the summer break in Hungary, ending a season-long debate about his future. It came shortly after the team had sacked their team principal Christian Horner after the British Grand Prix. That was the end of an almost two-year power struggle at Red Bull, in favour of the Verstappen camp.Nonetheless, while the defending world champion will surely lose his title, the remaining races are still important. Stability and performance have been the Dutchman’s demands all season, especially given the turmoil atRed Bulland a car that has been hard to handle. He will expect improvements under his new boss Laurent Mekies looking ahead to the regulations of 2026, which will be key given that his role in 2027 remains undecided.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Red Bull need to demonstrate that the new era will be a success and how Mekies helms his period in charge will be crucial.How Verstappen handles it will be fascinating, the team having taken a bold gamble in sacking Horner, not least given the same figures who ensured his removal might be a tad nervous given the images of Verstappen aboard the Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff’s yacht during the summer break.View image in fullscreenMax Verstappen focuses ahead of the race at Imola.Photograph: Mark Thompson/Getty ImagesEvery point counts in fight to finaleMcLaren have a car which is the class of the field this season and will not be caught, with 11 wins from 14 meetings, but behind them the convergence in form has led to a fine competition.Ferrari, whose recent upgrades were a good step, and Mercedes are in a tight battle for second place. With theScuderiajust 24 points ahead, and after Charles Leclerc’s pole in Hungary, they believe they might yet grab a win, while George Russell already has one for Mercedes. Both teams can expect to battle it out to the end, while behind them Red Bull, 42 points down on Mercedes, will seek another victory in Verstappen’s hands, with two already this year.However, the midfield represents an even more fascinating prospect. Williams are fifth-placed as the best of the rest, a testament to the remarkable turnaround under their team principal James Vowles. They have not finished fifth since 2017 and to see off the likes of Aston Martin and Alpine, who have far greater resources, would be a coup.Every place in the championship comes with more prize money, so every race is vital. Just 35 points cover Williams to Haas in ninth place, a relatively small margin that could turn over several meetings. The contest will be every bit as fiercely fought and unforgiving as the race for the title.Explore more on these topicsFormula One 2025Formula OneMotor sportOscar PiastriLando NorrisMax VerstappenLewis HamiltonanalysisShareReuse this content"

For most teams the answer would be “with great difficulty”, but Chelsea are a different beast.Terrifyingly, despite their domestic dominance, the Blues left room for improvement last season. As Sonia Bompastor told the club’s website: “We did well in terms of trophies and results last season but we were not always happy with the performances and didn’t show as much consistency as I would like. We’re working on giving even more clarity to the players for them to execute what we want them to achieve on the pitch.”Women’s Super League 2025-26 previews No 3: BrightonRead moreThe difference going into the new campaign is they have a more settled squad and a more settled manager. There have been incomings,Ellie Carpenter the highlight, but this has been a summer of consolidation and of building towards the performances they want to see week in, week out. “I wouldn’t say there will be a big difference from last season,” said Bompastor. “This season, we will go further and in more detail on what we were trying to achieve last season.“Last season was about getting to know each other on the pitch. Now, we are in a better position to go into the details of how we want to work together.”The challenge of maintaining their stranglehold on the league title is getting harder each year. This season Arsenal are buoyed bytheir Champions League winand Manchester City are helmed by a new manager and welcoming back their injured cohort. Both clubs are desperate to unseat Chelsea, who face a stern test in the season opener when they welcome City to Stamford Bridge. It will be a chance for the champions to make a statement.Chelsea are still searching for their missing piece, too, their tough exit from the Champions League at the hands of Barcelona only made worse by Arsenal’s eventual triumph. With Barcelona’s financial struggles well documented and Arsenal’s underdog victory a surprise, the European door is open for whichever team push hardest at it.How they finished in the past five seasonsThe managerBompastor’s first season was phenomenal. Improving on the success of the preceding season while adapting to a new country and culture with your family is remarkable and has resulted in a well-deserved place on the shortlist for the Ballon d’Or women’s coach of the year award. Known for being a ruthless competitor, Bompastor has proven herself a worthy successor to Emma Hayes. The Champions League frustrations aired by Bompastor and her team after they had secured a domestic treble speak to the drive and ambition of the manager and her players.Off-field pictureChelsea have never been afraid to spend big to get the players they want, withNaomi Girma’s signing in Januaryshowing that is not about to change. The women’s side of the club was controversially split from the men’s and sold to Blueco, Chelsea’s parent company, for £200m in April. The valuation was justified in May when the Reddit co-founder, and husband of Serena Williams,Alexis Ohanian bought a 10% stakein the club for £20m. Ohanian has spoken publicly about the big ambitions he has for Chelsea and the deal prompted a lot of teams to turn green with envy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The arrival of the Australia defender Carpenter from Bompastor’s former side Lyon is the highlight, though. Carpenter has twice won the Champions League with Lyon and has played in two World Cups and three Olympics with the Matildas. “Everyone has been so welcoming, the staff and the players,” she said. “I’m enjoying the sessions; it’s a great environment to work in, and it will bring the best out of me. It’s all very positive, and I’m excited to see more.”View image in fullscreenEllie Carpenter takes part in some sheep herding during Chelsea’s pre-season training camp in the Netherlands.Photograph: Harriet Lander/CFC/Getty ImagesStepping upThere are so many exciting young players at Chelsea it is hard to choose. Aggie Beever-Jones and Hannah Hampton arguably had their “stepping up” campaigns last term. This season it’s Wieke Kaptein’s turn. The midfielder has shown flashes of brilliance when she has come into the side. “She just brings to the team a lot of quality out of possession,” said Bompastor when Kaptein played during the unusual four back-to-back games against Manchester City last season. “She’s a young player but she is really confident on the ball but also works so hard off the ball.”It was a good summer for …As with Arsenal, it would be unfair to not mention all of Chelsea’s Euro 2025 winners. Niamh Charles scored her penalty in the final shortly after coming on, Lauren James scored twice against the Netherlands despite injury struggles during the tournament, Beever-Jones shone in her cameos and scored against Wales, Keira Walsh is the metronome of England’s midfield, battling Lucy Bronze was sensational in so many ways andHampton shrugged off Mary Earps’s shadowand then some with two heroic performances in penalty shootouts to add to a breakthrough tournament.View image in fullscreenHannah Hampton saves from Aitana Bonmatí during the penalty shootout as England defeated Spain in the Euro 2025 final.Photograph: Michael Probst/APMain initiative to attract more fansChelsea announced way ahead of the season details of the four WSL games they will play at Stamford Bridge, in an attempt to get fans committed to showing up en masse. They mostly picked showpiece games, having previously tended to play lower-level opposition there, choosing their opener against City, their fixture against promoted London City Lionesses and games against Arsenal and Manchester United. They have sold The Bridge Pass, which enables fans to buy a ticket for all four fixtures.

Franchises will not be obliged to spend up to the cap, but a so‑called salary collar will be introduced to guarantee a minimum level of investment in the hope of ensuring the Hundred remains competitive.It is understood that about 12 players in each squad will be allocated via an open auction with franchises able to bid as much as they want, as long as they stay within the overall cap. Beyond that franchises will have the flexibility to negotiate directly with up to three players and offer them longer-term contracts for the first time.View image in fullscreenAustralia’s Glenn Maxwell could switch his summer commitments to the Hundred under new recruitment plans.Photograph: Darren England/AAPWhile not a completely free market, it is anticipated that the new model will lead to the biggest amount of movement between franchises since the start of the Hundred, as well as giving the players more freedom.Increasing the salary cap should help firmly establish the Hundred as the second-biggest short-form competition in the world after the IPL. and attract some of the overseas players who have previously preferred to spend the summer playing in Major League Cricket in the United States, such as Steve Smith, Glenn Maxwell and Quinton de Kock.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Hundred board is comprised of four representatives from the ECB and one each from the eight host venues and new investors, giving the franchises the balance of power.In a potentially intriguing development, Ravichandran Ashwin’s announcement that he is retiring from the IPL on Wednesday has raised the prospect of the first Indian player being recruited by a Hundred franchise next year.The Board of Control for Cricket in India bars current Indian players from appearing in foreign franchise leagues, but this restriction no longer affects Ashwin, who the Daily Telegraph reports is eager to explore playing in the Hundred and other global competitions.Dinesh Karthik became the first Indian player to feature in the South African SA20 competition this year, so there is a precedent for Ashwin to follow after his domestic retirement.Explore more on these topicsThe HundredCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

West Ham are broken and there is no easy fix. The rot is deep and relegation is on the cards unless something drastic happens before the transfer window shuts on Monday. Even then, it would be hard to disagree with the view that substantial change will remain elusive untilDavid Sullivan, the club’s most dominant figure over the past 15 years, sells his shares.A big stadium means nothing when the wider infrastructure remains so dysfunctional. West Ham are being left behind by Bournemouth, Brentford and Brighton. They look stale and outdated. Their recruitment is chaotic, with too many voices competing for attention. Multiple sources say that certain agents continue to have Sullivan’s ear, trying to influence his judgment on signings and managers.None of this absolves Graham Potter and his trusted head of recruitment, Kyle Macaulay, of blame.Potter has lost 12 of his 22 gamessince replacing Julen Lopetegui as head coach in January. His 3-4-2-1 has left a ponderous midfield even more exposed. West Ham have conceded 11 goals in their first three games and have no resilience. It was obvious Wolves were going to win once they made it 2-2.In Potter’s defence he inherited a poor squad from Lopetegui, who inherited an ageing squad from David Moyes, who inherited an unbalanced squad from Manuel Pellegrini. Underinvestment is not the issue. West Ham are working with a limited budget this summer but they have spent in recent years. It shows that one of Sullivan’s biggest failings is who he chooses to empower.View image in fullscreenLucas Paquetá apologises to the travelling fans after West Ham’s 3-2 defeat at Wolves in the Carabao Cup on Tuesday evening.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PAParting company with Moyes in 2024 was not the mistake; it was not having a proper succession plan. Lopetegui was an awful choice, just as Tim Steidten was a dismal pick as technical director a year earlier. Moyes spent badly on expensive signings in 2022. Steidten did not live up to his reputation. The German’s biggest contribution was his role in blowingthe £105m received for Declan Rice.For some people, putting Steidten in charge was the worst mistake Sullivan has made. The former Bayer Leverkusen man’s work includes spending £27.5m on the underwhelming striker Niclas Füllkrug and bestowing upon West Ham the snail-paced midfield of Guido Rodríguez and Edson Álvarez.He also turned down an opportunity to sign Dean Huijsen before the centre-back joined Bournemouth, who sold him to Real Madrid for a huge profit a year later. There are plenty of stories like that. Jørgen Strand Larsen and Marc Cucurella also got away. There was interest in Mateus Fernandes before the midfielder’s £12m move to Southampton, who are now telling West Ham they can have him – for £60m.The damage was done by the time Steidten made way for Macaulay. The flaws in West Ham’s recruitment are evident in no one wanting to buy their players. The sale of Mohammed Kudus to Tottenham for £54.5m this summer came from a position of weakness. West Ham had to sell to buy but the only useful offers came for Kudus. This is a squad cobbled together by an assortment of people. West Ham are stuck with expensive, underperforming centre‑backs. They had to accept a loan for Álvarez and are yet to sell the 31-year-old Rodríguez.This was never a one-window fix, but Potter and Macaulay have made the situation worse this summer. The place is undisciplined. It is staggering to hear that a current player has criticised the club to potential targets. Potter focused on banishing the toxicity in the dressing room during pre-season but the problems have not gone away. Lucas Paquetá, who is of interest to Tottenham, is open to leaving.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

West Ham instead spent much of their budget on the Senegal left‑back El Hadji Malick Diouf and the Denmark goalkeeper Mads Hermansen, who has struggled since joining from Leicester for £15m.These are buys that should have been made only after the vast hole in midfield was filled. Now West Ham are panicking. Multiple sources say Sullivan started the summer determined to let Potter and Macaulay do what they wanted. Callum Wilson was not a Potter pick but he could have blocked the 33-year-old striker’s arrival on a free transfer. The narrative about interference from above is disputed.View image in fullscreenMads Hermansen covers his face in despair after conceding against Sunderland on his West Ham debut.Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt/AMA/Getty ImagesIt is felt that Potter and Macaulay set their sights too high. They are accused of naivety, of misjudging West Ham’s appeal to talents such as Jacob Ramsey and Harvey Elliott. Time has been wasted. Chelsea thought it was a joke when West Ham bid for Andrey Santos last week. West Ham were advised not to go in for Barcelona’s Marc Casadó before bidding for the midfielder. It is not clear why a powerful striker has not been targeted, while a new winger would help given that Crysencio Summerville has been out since January. Kudus has not been replaced. His departure has left West Ham dependent on Paquetá and Bowen for creativity.Potter can argue that his shift to a controlled possession style will work once he has the players to fit his system. He needs time, but the clock is ticking. Macaulay is said to be under pressure to prove himself to Sullivan. The 76‑year‑old has resisted the temptation to impose players on Potter and Macaulay so far – he relented when it came to Hermansen, signing him instead of the Botafogo goalkeeper John Victor, whom West Ham are now trying to bring in on loan – but some expect Sullivan to become more dominant. Macaulay and Potter will hope thatbuying the Monaco midfielder Soungoutou Magassashifts the mood. They are also trying to sign a fast striker.A swift turnaround in results is needed. A few more defeats will likely lead to Potter’s sacking. But what would another managerial change achieve? Sullivan will still be making the appointments. He has never shown an inclination to pay compensation for an in‑demand manager. It is always someone unemployed. It will be more of the same.Explore more on these topicsWest Ham UnitedDavid SullivancommentShareReuse this content"

The government spokesperson, Sophie Primas, said after the meeting that Macron fully supported Bayrou and the government was in a “fighting spirit”.Bayrou, a centrist and Macron ally, announced this week he would call a confidence vote for 8 September, seeking parliament’s support for his austerity measures to cut public spending and reduce public debt.Opposition parties have said they will vote to oust Bayrou, who polls show is the least popular prime minister since 1958. Bayrou’s proposals for a €44bn budget squeeze, which includescrapping two public holidaysand freezing most welfare spending, are widely unpopular.Primas said Macron believed there should be neither “denial nor catastrophising” about the state of France’s public finances and that opposition parties must show “responsibility”.She said the government’s budget proposals were necessary. “France is a solid country with solid economics … but we must take the reins of our destiny,” Primas said. Describing Macron’s remarks to cabinet, she said: “It’s a strong signal that we are sending to the financial markets that we want to have a France that is even more solid.”Macron is still dealing with the fallout from a political crisis that began last summer when he called a surprise snap election that resulted in a deadlocked parliament with no absolute majority. Since then, the national assembly has been split between the left, the far right and the centre.Michel Barnier,the rightwing prime minister chosen by Macron last September to try to bring together the fragmented parliament, was ousted after only three months in office when his budget plans were rejected and the government was toppled.Bayrou followed Barnier and he will have been in office for only nine months if the government is toppled once again. Even if Macron replaces him swiftly, it is not certain that a new appointee would be able to secure consensus on a budget for next year in the bitterly divided parliament.Calls were growing on Wednesday for Macron to call another snap parliamentary election less than 18 months after the last. Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally favours a new election as it hopes it can gain seats.France on the brink: how a budget deficit became a political crisisRead moreA large majority of French people want parliament dissolved for another election, according to polls by Ifop, Elabe and Toluna Harris Interactive. Macron said earlier this month that he wanted to avoid dissolving parliament again but he has also suggested he could not rule out the option.Macron’s former prime minister Édouard Philippe, who now heads the centre-right Horizons party, said that if a stalemate persisted and no other government could come up with a budget, an election seemed inevitable.Gabriel Attal, another former prime minister and the head of Macron’s centrist Renaissance party, said he did not think a new election would necessarily bring stability or clarity.Bayrou warned that France’s debt is unsustainable, particularly as interest rate rises push up the cost of borrowing. After years of overspending, France is on notice to control its public deficit and cut its debt, as required under EU rules. All political parties agree that public debt is an issue but they disagree on how to tackle it.Explore more on these topicsFranceEmmanuel MacronEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

His non-executive role is one of a number that are understood to have been introduced to bring in expertise from outside government to help civil servants gain a strategic perspective on policy decisions.Jackson is expected to use his three-year term on the Cabinet Office board to push the government to modernise. The tech founder, who set up Octopus in 2015, has won respect in Westminster after building the energy supplier’s global reach to secure a valuation of £9bn for the company in less than a decade.He has maintained strong links in the government after previously serving as head of the pressure groupLabourList.

The teenager’s family is suing Open AI and its chief executive and co-founder, Sam Altman, alleging that the version of ChatGPT at that time, known as 4o, was “rushed to market … despite clear safety issues”.The teenager discussed a method of suicide with ChatGPT on several occasions, including shortly before taking his own life. According to the filing in the superior court of the state of California for the county of San Francisco, ChatGPT guided him on whether his method of taking his own life would work.It also offered to help him write a suicide note to his parents.A spokesperson for OpenAI said the company was “deeply saddened by Mr Raine’s passing”, extended its “deepest sympathies to the Raine family during this difficult time” and said it was reviewing the court filing.Mustafa Suleyman, the chief executive of Microsoft’s AI arm,saidlast week he had become increasingly concerned by the “psychosis risk” posed by AI to users. Microsoft has defined this as “mania-like episodes, delusional thinking, or paranoia that emerge or worsen through immersive conversations with AI chatbots”.In ablogpost, OpenAI admitted that “parts of the model’s safety training may degrade” in long conversations. Adam and ChatGPT had exchanged as many as 650 messages a day, the court filing claims.Jay Edelson, the family’s lawyer, said on X: “The Raines allege that deaths like Adam’s were inevitable: they expect to be able to submit evidence to a jury that OpenAI’s own safety team objected to the release of 4o, and that one of the company’s top safety researchers,Ilya Sutskever, quit over it. The lawsuit alleges that beating its competitors to market with the new model catapulted the company’s valuation from $86bn to $300bn.”Open AI said it would be “strengthening safeguards in long conversations”.“As the back and forth grows, parts of the model’s safety training may degrade,” it said. “For example, ChatGPT may correctly point to a suicide hotline when someone first mentions intent, but after many messages over a long period of time, it might eventually offer an answer that goes against our safeguards.”Open AI gave the example of someone who might enthusiastically tell the model they believed they could drive for 24 hours a day because they realised they were invincible after not sleeping for two nights.It said: “Today ChatGPT may not recognise this as dangerous or infer play and – by curiously exploring – could subtly reinforce it. We are working on an update to GPT‑5 that will cause ChatGPT to de-escalate by grounding the person in reality. In this example, it would explain that sleep deprivation is dangerous and recommend rest before any action.”In the US, you can call or text theNational Suicide Prevention Lifelineon 988, chat on988lifeline.org, ortext HOMEto 741741 to connect with a crisis counselor.

When contacted by the Guardian, Upton said she did not want to comment.Leeds teaching hospitals NHS trust said it barred Upton from its mortuaries and maternity wards in spring this year.A Facebook page for Florrie’s Army said it offered a baby funeral service as well as providing clothing, handprints and photographs.View image in fullscreenAmie Upton said she started Florrie’s Army in memory of her own stillborn daughterPhotograph: Ben Lack Photography LtdZoe Ward contacted Upton after her baby boy Bleu died of brain damage at three weeks old in 2021, and said she thought the service sounded “brilliant”.She told the BBC as part of an investigation into Florrie’s Army that she had expected Bleu to be looked after in a professional setting, including in a refrigerated cot. However, when she visited Bleu at Upton’s home she said she was terrified to find her son’s body in the living room “watching” cartoons in a baby bouncer.“I realised it were Bleu and she [Upton] says: ‘Come in, we’re watching PJ Masks.’ There’s a cat scratcher in the corner and I can hear a dog barking and there was another [dead] baby on the sofa. It wasn’t a nice sight.“I rang my mum and I’m saying: ‘This ain’t right’ … I was screaming down the phone [saying]: ‘It’s mucky, it’s dirty, he can’t stay here.’”She said she was left upset and angry by the “weird” experience. “I didn’t want him in that house,” she said.Another couple were led to believe their baby was being kept at a funeral home in Headingley until she could be buried but more than a week later were told their daughter was at Upton’s home 5 miles away.The woman told the BBC she believed her child’s body had not been kept at the correct temperature, saying it was “really smelly, like she’d been in there and not kept cool”.The BBC reported seeing evidence that babies’ bodies were not being kept in a refrigerated cot, though Upton did have one. The woman’s mother said: “It was just crazy. If I told somebody of this story … they’d think it was a horror film.”The hospitals trust said it had been notified of “several serious concerns” over the past few years, which had been raised with the police, external safeguarding services, relevant regulators and the coroner’s office.The trust said it had been monitoring Upton’s attendance at Leeds’s two major hospitals, St James’s and Leeds General Infirmary, since 2021 and had since banned Upton from its maternity wards and mortuaries.Rabina Tindale, the chief nurse at the trust, said: “Some families have believed services are linked to or supported by the trust. We must be clear that neither Amie Upton or Florrie’s Army is endorsed by, or associated with, Leeds teaching hospitals.“Since 2021 we have had specific safeguarding measures in place, including monitoring Amie’s attendance when visiting deceased patients at the mortuary in her funeral service role. Any visitors to the mortuary are always accompanied by mortuary staff. Any handover of a body is undertaken in line with trust policies and procedures and takes place to an authorised funeral director.”InEnglandand Wales, there are no regulations governing funeral homes, including how bodies should be handled or stored. Two professional associations, the National Association of Funeral Directors and the National Society of Allied and Independent Funeral Directors, have a joint code of conduct, which includes standards for inspections, but membership is not compulsory.Explore more on these topicsLeedsNHSHospitalsYorkshireNorth of EnglandEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The issue has touched the groups’ lives in different ways, highlighting its broad risks to health.“We can all sit down and agree that we and our children shouldn’t be fed literal poison,” said Dana Ames, a Johnson county, Texas, detective who is investigating contamination from sludge on local farms.Alarming levels of Pfas in blood of those living near US air force base, study findsRead moreIn Oklahoma, farmer Saundra Traywick lives in an area where she saystoxic sewage sludge is spreadas fertilizer. Her family and animals get sick, and the potent stench can be unbearable.Mike “Lucky” Pruitt, a biker who lives in a dairy- and oil-producing region in Texas, wonders whether Pfas from sludge contributed to the rare brain cancer that killed his six-year-old son; in Johnson county, Texas, Ames took the unprecedented step of opening a criminal investigation, which is ongoing, over sludge that polluted local farms and water.Billy Randal, a trucker, just learned about the sludge’s dangers, and fears that people hauling the substance are exposed to toxic waste. And in Massachusetts, Kyla Bennett, a former US Environmental Protection Agency scientist and cancer survivor, is part of a lawsuit that couldlead to sludge being banned.The alliance has a real chance of success, those involved say, because it includes everyone from liberal scientists to people on the far right – they are willing to set aside political differences for the fight.“The American people are smart – once we figure out what’s occurring, we have a whole lot more in common than we don’t, and this is a basic human right,” said Ames, the Texas detective. “We all deserve safe and clean food and water.”The alliance is aiming to hold rallies thatit hopes will draw thousands of people in Austin, Texas, and Washington DC in the coming months. Those involved are aiming to get Trump’s attention and to pressure the Texas legislature to act.Getting Trump’s attentionSludge is a mix of human and industrial waste, and a byproduct of the wastewater treatment process that regulators allow to be used as fertilizer because it’s rich in nutrients that help plants grow. It alsovirtually always teems with Pfasand other dangerous chemicals, which contaminate water,cropsandlivestock, while also sickening farmers and contaminating the nation’s food supply.Maine became the first stateto bansludge, also called biosolids, after itfound Pfas had contaminated cropsor water onat least 73 farmswhere the substance had been spread. The state establisheda $70m fundto bail out affected farmers.Pfas are a class of about 15,000 compounds that are dubbed “forever chemicals” because they don’t naturally break down. The chemicals are linked to a range of serious health problems like cancer, liver disease, kidney issues, high cholesterol, birth defects and decreased immunity.View image in fullscreenMaine became the first state to ban sludge after it found Pfas had contaminated crops or water on at least 73 farms where the substance had been spread.Photograph: Portland Press Herald/Getty ImagesIn the Biden administration’s final days, the EPA issued a draft risk assessment for Pfas in sludge that could in effect ban the substance, but Republicans in Congressslipped a riderinto the current appropriations bill that would essentially kill the process by withdrawing key funding. The rider was inserted just a few weeks after the EPA met with a sludge industry trade group to hear its grievances about the assessment.Ames said the EPA “has gone rogue” and she suspects Trump is unaware of the situation. The president has publicly said he wants clean water and food, Ames said, and she suspects he will act if alerted.“As his voters and his base, we want his ear, and we want to make sure that the president knows what’s going on,” Ames said.In Massachusetts, Bennett, the scientist, who is now with the Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (Peer) non-profit, has been frustrated with the Biden and Trump administrations’ policies on sludge, and has sued the EPA under the Clean Water Act to force the agency to regulate the substance. Peer is assisting with letters for the action, though it is not directly involved with organizing the rallies.It’s not often that Peer works with folks on the right, but the “strange bedfellows” are a hopeful development, Bennett said.“This is an issue that should transcend politics because it affects human health and people are humans before they’re Republicans and Democrats,” Bennett said.‘We’ve got to make a change’In 2021, doctors diagnosed six-year-old Rylan Pruitt with a rare and aggressive brain cancer. After 30 rounds of radiation treatment and several months of chemotherapy, he died, leaving behind distraught parents looking for answers.There was no family history of cancer, and his father, Mike “Lucky” Pruitt, began to hear about the risks of Pfas. He turned his attention to the huge dairy and oil operations – both known sources of Pfas and other chemical pollution – in the rural community in which he lives.Only about 50 other people have developed the type of cancer that killed Rylan – and one of them was a young girl who lived about 11 miles (17km) away, Pruitt said. He said he put together the pieces, like family history, how the cancer was “stupidly and exceedingly rare”, and the research that has connected sludge and Pfas to rare pediatric cancers.“For me it’s: ‘This is why this is happening, and we’ve got to make a change,’” Pruitt said.View image in fullscreenRylan Pruitt.Photograph: Courtesy of Mike ‘Lucky’ PruittHis 15,000-member motorcycle group, theRylan Strong Network, pressures lawmakers on issues around pediatric cancer and health insurance. He contacted every Texas legislator asking them to support a bill that would require measuring Pfas in sludge. So far, very few have responded, and previous versions of the legislation were killed.“It’s all about who has the biggest checkbook,” Pruitt said.In Oklahoma, Traywick’s non-profit, Save Oklahoma Farms and Ranches, has had similar results in pressuring lawmakers. Her kids’ immune disorders, the flies that gnaw her donkeys’ legs raw and the unmeasured effects of suspected Pfas on land and water – none of it has so far convinced state legislators to act.But, she said, she is more optimistic as “a growing movement of people is waking up to the fact that this is not Democrats versus Republicans or left versus right – we all want our children to have a healthy future,” Traywick said.In New Jersey, Randal, founder of the national Truckers Movement for Justice, just learned about the sludge from Ames, and worries about what people hauling the waste are exposed to.Exposure to some Pfas could increase risk of multiple miscarriages – studyRead moreThe truckers, with thousands of members in the US and Mexico, recently worked with environmental groups to petition the US Department of Transportation to strengthen regulations around hauling fracking waste. The problem with sludge is similar, Randal said. Many drivers have to clean their trucks, there are few protections and they are not made aware of the Pfas and other risks in what they are hauling.“We have truck drivers handling this shit and they don’t have a clue about what they’re working around,” Randal said. “Industry laughs all the way to the bank and it’s time for it to stop.” He plans to mobilize truckers to join the rallies.In Johnson county, Texas, Goldman Sachs-owned Synagro, sold local farmers the tainted sludge that a lawsuit alleges polluted local waters and destroyed the land. The farms’ drinking water was found to be contaminated at levels more than 13,000 times higher than the federal health advisory for Pfos, one kind of Pfas compound, and affected meat was as much as 250,000 times above safe levels, thefederal lawsuit against Synagroalleges. Synagrodeniesthat the Pfas came from its sludge.Last year, Ames opened the first-ever criminal investigation into the situation, and Johnson county joined Peer’s Clean Water Act lawsuit. “We’re coming together and we’re saying: ‘No, this isn’t a third-world country, and there’s no reason why in America our food should be poisoned like this,’” Ames said.Explore more on these topicsPfasFarmingTrump administrationUS CongressUS politicsHealthPollutionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For 2.6 million of them, the additional heating added 3C to their heat exposure.In many cases, this was deadly. The researchers estimated that warming due to deforestation accounted for 28,330 annual deaths over that 20-year period. More than half were in south-east Asia, owing to the larger populations in areas with heat vulnerability. About a third were in tropical Africa, and the remainder in Central and South America.The study waspublished on Wednesday in the journal Nature Climate Change. Researchers in Brazil, Ghana and the UK compared non-accident mortality rates and temperatures in areas affected by tropical land clearance.Previous studies have shownhow cutting and burning trees causes long-term localised warming, but the new paper is the first to calculate the ensuing death toll.Prof Dominick Spracklenof the University of Leeds said the message was that “deforestation kills”. He expected many people would be shocked by the findings because the local dangers of deforestation were often lost in the global climate debate and the market-focused expansion of agricultural frontiers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The forests directly benefit local communities. They regulate temperature, bring rainfall, and support the agriculture people depend on.

Now a new study has found that ocean acidification could leave the apex predators without their critical survival weapon.Shark jaws carry several rows of teeth and new ones quickly push forward to replace losses.However, rapidly acidifying oceans are damaging shark teethand could speed losses past replacement rates. Sharks with bad teeth could struggle to feed themselves efficiently, “potentially affecting shark populations and marine ecosystem stability”, the study said.Ocean acidification is caused byrapid carbon dioxide absorptioncreating a chain reaction that lowers pH levels. Projections suggest oceans could be far more acidic by the year 2300, falling from a current average pH of about 8.1 to 7.3, a change that will have “profound implications for marine organisms”, the study said.To test acidification effects, researchers kept 60 freshly fallen shark teeth in artificial seawater tanks, one matching the current ocean average pH of 8.1, another with the projected 7.3 pH. The teeth, safely collected from a German aquarium, had already been naturally discarded by six male and four female blacktip reef sharks.View image in fullscreenMaximilian Baum, who conducted the study, with a blacktip reef shark jaw. He found increased root corrosion and altered serration.Photograph: Roman Müller-BöhmAfter eight weeks, teeth in the more acidic tank suffered about twice as much damage, said Maximilian Baum, the study’s lead author and a researcher working with Germany’s Heinrich Heine University’s Institute for Zoology and Organismic Interactions. Effects included “increased root corrosion … and altered serration”, he said.Dental stress would add to sharks’ other problems, which include prey shortages caused by overfishing.Reducing human-caused CO2 emissions is vital tomitigate ocean acidification. Previous research has found acidificationdamages denticles, a toothy scale on sharks’ skin.Even moderate drops could affect more sensitive shark species, such as those that usefewer rows of teethor haveslower replacement rates, said Baum.How the ‘evil twin’ of the climate crisis is threatening our oceansRead more“I think there will be effects on the teeth of ocean predators in general when they are highly mineralised structures like we have in sharks,” he said.Previous studies have shown thatacidification harms shells, corals and mussels, “and that was also the reason why we did this study, to show us the effects on larger predators”.More optimistically, Baum believes sharks may adapt by increasing tooth replacements and improving strengthening and repair.Lisa Whitenack, a professor at Pennsylvania’s Allegheny College who is a shark tooth expert and not part of the study team, said the new research added to initial findings on shark teeth and acidification. She too suggested tooth replacement may keep pace with acidification losses and added that corroded teeth may still be effective.“It will be interesting to see in future studies if the damage to teeth seen in studies like this one results in a functional effect on a tooth’s ability to do its job … [and if] damaged teeth can still cut or puncture prey.”Explore more on these topicsOcean acidificationSeascape: the state of our oceansMarine lifeSharksAnimalsWildlifeGreenhouse gas emissionsnewsShareReuse this content"

They collected pollen samples from these plant species to understand their nutrient content.At the lab, the team measured each pollen sample’s macronutrient content and calculated its concentration of protein, fat and carbohydrates.Clear patterns emerged when the researchers compared each bee species’ diet with their physical traits. The nutrient content of the pollen changed through the seasons, the study also found. This shift in protein would then influence the bees’ nutritional preferences across the seasons.Researchers were surprised by the protein differences among the studied flowers. Some flowers consist of only 17% protein while others contained as much as 86%.The pollen’s nutrient content also changed throughout the season. For example, the study shared that spring flowers have more protein-rich pollen, while late-summer flowers are richer in fat and carbs.Justin Bain, the lead author on the study, which is published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, said: “all pollen contains protein, fats and carbs but each has a different mixture of micronutrients. Some are very high in protein like a steak. Others are more like a salad.”The team also found that coexisting bee species occupied two distinct nutrient niches. Larger-bodied bees with longer tongues preferred pollen high in protein but lower in sugars and fats, while bees with shorter tongues looked out for pollen richer in carbohydrates and fats.Individual bees will adjust their diets as their colonies develop and grow, which means their nutritional needs change through the seasons.Paul CaraDonna, senior author on the study, said: “We now have a better idea of what bees are bringing home in their grocery bags. Although this work is from one ecosystem in the Rocky Mountains, it paints a very important picture for scientists to build upon.”He said the study showed the “huge amount” of variation in macronutrients in natural ecosystems and how bees’ nutrient needs are not “one-size-fits-all”. CaraDonna believes the findings from the research can provide “some of the best information” on the availability of nutritional resources found in wildflowers and how pollinators use these resources.“We can incorporate this work into our thinking about garden design, so we can select the right flowers that best support the nutritional needs of wild pollinators.”Global pollinator populations continue to face threats of habitat loss, the climate crisis and poor nutrition. The authors said the study highlighted the need for conservation efforts to focus on nutritional diversity. This would ensure that the mixes of plants that support the dietary needs of wild bumblebee species continue to exist.Michael Walsh, the founder ofThe Urban Apiarist, who was not involved in the study said the “fascinating” research proves that bees do not forage randomly. Walsh believes the study further evidences the “remarkable” way bees solve problems as a colony. “Bees show a kind of collective intelligence. Studies like this show how specialised and vulnerable bees are. We need to protect both bees and their ecosystems – our food systems depend on them.”Explore more on these topicsBeesInsectsAnimal behaviournewsShareReuse this content"

A second cabin bag, typically a small wheelie suitcase, of up to 55x40x20cm, can be brought on board for a fee, normally lower than the price paid to put baggage in the hold.It was reported this year that Swissport staff handling easyJet flights werepaid bonuses of £1.20 a bagto enforce similar rules at the boarding gate.O’Leary said anxiety over punitive charges for small infractions was exaggerated: “I go regularly and do boardings in Dublin, and we don’t have an issue with the small bag, this kind of mythical, oh, only the zip was outside – if the zip was the only thing that was outside the sizer, it gets on, there’s no issue.”But, he said: “I am still mystified by the number of people with rucksacks who still think they’re going to get through the fucking gate, and we won’t notice the rucksack. We will. And you will be paying for the rucksack. You’re not getting on if it doesn’t fit.”O’Leary said the number of people paying fees was going down as more brought on compliant cases. “We’re not trying to catch people out here. Most people, 99.9% of our passengers, comply with the rules. The amount of people who pay a gate bag fee is less than 0.1% of our passengers, and that’s still 200,000 passengers a year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A balance of those firms optimistic about the next quarter fell back from -43% in May to -29% in August.Alpesh Paleja, deputy chief economist at the business lobby group, said the survey still “painted a grim picture of the services sector”, adding that “pockets of resilience” were unable to reverse a downward trend going back more than a year.Services account for about three-quarters of economic activity in the UK and the sector acts as a bellwether for the state of the economy.Paleja said: “Rising employment costs continue to drive cost pressures higher, while subdued demand conditions are holding pricing power in check. The impact is being felt in lower hiring, investment and profits, with companies increasingly shifting focus to short-term firefighting.”The CBI quarterly survey comes after similar concerns were voiced by respondents to a monthly S&P Global health check of the industry, which registered its biggest drop in new orders in almost three years in July.A study this week by the Resolution Foundation updating official unemployment figures found thatthe rate in June of 4.7%had already accelerated to 5% in August as firms delayed replacing staff with new recruits.The “nowcasting exercise” revealed the pressure on the government ahead of the autumn budget, when the chancellor will say she wants to increase economic growth and employment.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

No ifs, no buts.”The foundation has reported that more than 420 companies, which employ more than 12,000 workers, haveadopted a four-day week since the pandemic, while South Cambridgeshire district council became thefirst UK council to permanently adoptthe working pattern in July.The Scottish government said it would use the findings to inform its wider public service reform programme to “support more efficient and innovative working practices”. For the time being, however, it has stopped short of rolling out a four-day week more widely.Explore more on these topicsFour-day weekScotlandWork-life balanceWork & careersnewsShareReuse this content"

As a result, fertility rates fell overall, and are now at the lowest rates on record.”The stats also showed that the long-term trend of the average age of parents rising steadily over the past 50 years is continuing: the average age of mothers and fathers both increased by 0.1 years in 2024, with mothers aged 31 and fathers 33.9, according to the ONS’s annualBirths in England and Walespublication.Over the last two decades, the average age of mothers and fathers has increased by two years for mothers, and just under two years for fathers. Mothers living in London had the highest mean age across all English regions and Wales at 32.5 years in 2024. The lowest was in north-east England, where it was 30.In 2024, the average age of mothers in England and Wales having their first-born (29.4) was noticeably lower than those having later-born children (31.8 for second, 32.9 for third, and 33.9 for fourth), suggesting that mothers tend to leave larger gaps between their first and second children than for subsequent children.When broken down by age group, the fertility rate for the age group 25 to 29 has decreased the most for both mothers and fathers, although there were falls for all under-30s. Conversely, it increased for mothers between 30 and 39, and for fathers it increased between 35 and 39 and decreased between 30 and 34.There were also notable increases for older fathers, with the fertility rate increasing for those over 60 and those aged 50-54, although it fell slightly for fathers in their 40s.The stats also shed light on regional disparities. Two regions experienced an increase in the fertility rate, representing the first regional increases since 2021: the West Midlands increased from 1.56 in 2023 to 1.59 in 2024, and London increased from 1.33 in 2023 to 1.35 in 2024. The north-west experienced no change and all other regions recorded declines.Luton was the area with the highest fertility rate at 2, while the City of London’s was the lowest at 0.32.InScotland, official data published on 26 August showed the country had the lowest number of births and the lowest birthrate since records began in 1855.According toNational Records of Scotland data, there were 45,763 live births last year, the lowest recorded. The overall fertility rate fell to 1.25 – below the rate for England and Wales – while the death rate also fell to the lowest on record, raising further fears about the widening age gap in Scotland.Bernice Kuang, a demography researcher at the University of Southampton, said the fall in fertility rates could be a temporary result of people postponing having children.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Instead, most follow the UK’s “persistently strong two-child norm”, in contrast with other countries, where one-child families are more common.She said: “We might see fertility continue to decline and then rebound once the age at first birth stops climbing. But if it turns out that today’s young people postpone childbearing and then ultimately end up not having children, fertility rates may further decrease.”Kuang added that a larger share of young people said they did not intend to have children compared with earlier cohorts.She said there was a “dire need” for more housing and childcare support, which remained “extremely unaffordable for many people”. Her research has found that young people are reluctant to start families “when there is economic uncertainty and apprehension about the future”.“Policies that support families in the long term tend to be more effective in encouraging people to have children, versus one-off support, like cash transfers or parental leave at the time of birth,” she noted.Ian Pearson, the author of Society Tomorrow: Growing Older in 21st Century Britain, said the disparity between live births and fertility rates could be explained by larger families in some groups, especially younger migrants, while the wider population is ageing and increasingly reluctant to have children.He said: “Internationally, the UK is following the same trajectory as most wealthy countries: fertility peaks at lower levels of development, then declines as education, prosperity and women’s autonomy rise. Unless childcare, housing and long-term stability are addressed, we should expect the fertility rate to remain low or even fall further, rather than bounce back.”Politicians have been voicing concerns about the falling birthrate, in particular over the question of how a decreasing number of people of working age can support an ever increasing number of pensioners. In July, the education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, said the falling birthrate had “worrying repercussions” and thatshe hoped tobe able to make it easier for women to have children.Explore more on these topicsPopulationOffice for National StatisticsScotlandEnglandWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

Days later, Ontario premier Doug Ford – a blunt-spoken, burly populist with a knack for politics – entered a high-stakes meeting with other premiers and the prime minister wearing the hat. The move kicked off a frenzy of online orders and created a rare moment of political consensus.But Ford’s love of the hat cost the province nearly C$300,000 (US$218,000),according to reporting by the Trillium.According to newly disclosed public election finance filings, the Progressive Conservative party of Ontario paid C$278,910.71 to Jackpine Dynamic Branding, the company producing the viral hats, during the province’s election campaign period last spring.The party also transferred more than 600 hats – bought for C$23.19 each before the election – to the campaign, according to the Trillium.Liam Mooney, who runs Jackpine Dynamic Branding with his fiancée, Emma Cochrane,previously told the Guardianthe couple wanted a simple but firm message with the hat. “It was a small act of patriotism to respond to these big threats and this big bluster,” Mooney said.Their online store, which sold red and navy blue headwear featuring the wording “Strong and Free” and “Canada Is Not For Sale”, as well as “Fort et libre” and “Le Canada n’est pas à vendre”, was quickly overwhelmed with traffic. The couple ended up selling tens of thousands of the hats, which they eventually managed to produce in Canada after weeks of manufacturing headaches.Ford and campaign surrogates also wore the hat often during the provincial election in February, in which his government won in a rare, third majority mandate.Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

He said: “It is important that we gain insight into this so that our populations – this applies to both Greenland andDenmark– can see what it is we are up against.”Rasmussen said officials would make it “very clear to the US” that a foreign influence campaign in Greenland with Washington’s backing would be contrary to all international rules.Mette Frederiksen, the Danish prime minister, said she was taking the claims “very seriously”. “Any interference in internal affairs in the kingdom of Denmark, and Greenlandic democracy, is unacceptable,” she said. “I note that the Americans do not clearly deny that the situation is as DR presents today. And that is of course serious.”Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to acquire Greenland since taking office, driving tensions between Denmark and the US to unprecedented levels. The former Danish colony is part of the kingdom of Denmark, although it is now autonomous with the exception of its foreign and security policy, which remains controlled by Copenhagen.In an unusual move aimed at highlighting the gravity of the situation, Denmark’s highest-ranking civil servant will attend the meeting.The charge d’affaires was summoned in the absence of Trump’s incoming US ambassador, Ken Howery, who is yet to be confirmed by the US Senate. A date for his arrival in Copenhagen is yet to be confirmed but Howery, a co-founder of PayPal, a friend of Elon Musk and the ambassador to Sweden under Trump’s first administration, is expected in the Danish capital in October.View image in fullscreenDenmark’s foreign minister, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, has said any alleged US influence would be ‘totally unacceptable’.Photograph: Kin Cheung/APAccording to DR, the three unnamed American men are accused of attempting to permeate Greenlandic society to weaken relations with Denmark through what it described as “infiltration” and “influence operations”.One of them, who it is claimed compiled a list of Trump supporters, has reportedly appeared in public with Trump numerous times. He is also accused of creating a list of those who do not support the US president and of advising on issues that “put Denmark in a bad light” in the US media. These allegedly include theforced removals of Greenlandic children by Danish authoritiesand a separate scandal over theforced contraception of Greenlandic women, for which Frederiksen issued a long-awaited apology on Wednesday.The two other American men whose activities have reportedly caused Danish authorities concern previously worked under Trump and are known to travel frequently to Greenland from the US.A government source said that with the population of the capital, Nuuk, beingabout 20,000 people, “it’s pretty obvious who is walking around and doing this”.A number of high-profile Americans with political connections and business people have flocked to Nuuk since Trump’s election.In January, Donald Trump Jr was joined by the political activistCharlie Kirk, who cofounded the pro-Trump conservative organisation Turning Point USA. In March, before Greenland’s election, Drew Horn, a member of the first Trump administration and the chief executive of the Washington DC-based mineral investment company GreenMet, said there were “tens of billions” of dollars ready to be invested in Greenland immediately. Tom Dans, Trump’s former Arctic commissioner and an investor, described Greenland as “really frontier in the true sense of things”. None of the men have been implicated by Danish authorities.Greenland’s foreign minister, Vivian Motzfeldt, said she did not know of any “shady activities” taking place in Greenland. She told newspaper Sermitsiaq: “There is nothing new in what I have been presented with, beyond what we already know.”Aaja Chemnitz, a member of the Danish parliament for the Greenlandic party Inuit Ataqatigiit (IA), said the latest reports reflected a US effort. “We have seen before that they have been trying to influence the people of Greenland, but of course also Greenlandic politicians. This is just a continuation of that.”But she said she had not seen evidence of an impact on people’s views. “I don’t think it is working. The Greenlandic people have been an object for people trying to influence us over many many years.”She said life for the Greenlandic people continued to be worse than for Danish people living in the Danish kingdom, especially as a result of underinvestment and the historic injustices against Inuit people.Trump says he ‘doesn’t rule out’ using military force to control GreenlandRead moreAlthough she said the US remained “on the table” when it came to investment in Greenland, the impact of Trump’s words about acquiring Greenland – by force if required – had had an impact. Greenland, she said, was “much more sceptical towards the US than before”.Pele Broberg, who leads Greenland’s opposition party, Naleraq, which is seen as the most Trump-friendly of Greenland’s political parties, said he was baffled by the diplomatic clash, saying the claims were based on previously reported events from January.“Should we never talk to anybody but Denmark? We don’t get what the big issue is right now,” he said.He denied claims that the White House was trying to influence opinions in Nuuk, adding: “But what I do know is that the Danish, French and German governments are trying to influence the Greenlandic government every single day … It’s just business as usual.”This is thesecond timeDenmark has summoned the US charge d’affaires since Trump assumed office. The first such meeting, in May, was over reports that US intelligence agencies had been ordered to increase espionage in Greenland.The US Department of State did not immediately respond to a request for comment.A representative of the US government said in a statement to DR: “Individual US citizens may have interests in Greenland. The US government does not control or direct the actions of private citizens.”They said the US “values the relationships with the governments of Greenland and Denmark,” adding: “The president, vice-president and secretary of state have all been clear: the United States respects the right of the Greenlandic people to determine their own future.”Speaking on behalf of Horn, Sabrina Katz, vice-president of operations and Arctic lead at GreenMet, said: “Drew is no longer affiliated with the Trump administration and is now fully focused on private sector work. Our efforts in Greenland are solely driven by commercialisation objectives and are not connected to any government role or agenda.”Dans is understood to deny any part in the reported influence operationQuick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

This bizarre dinosaur roamed the flood plains of what is now north Africa 165m years ago,palaeontologists have revealed.The fossil, the oldest known ankylosaur specimen, was unearthed near the central Moroccan town of Boulemane. Its extravagant armour has confounded existing theories of how the ankylosaurs, a major group of plant-eating dinosaurs, evolved.“It’s absolutely bristling with spikes all over its body,” said Prof Richard Butler, of the University of Birmingham and the project co-lead. “It has these incredibly distinctive spikes around the neck – an armoured collar that is absolutely enormous and totally out of proportion to the rest of the body, smaller spikes projecting out of the ribs, and at the end of its tail it would have had some kind of weapon.”The dinosaur’s anatomy was so outlandish that piecing together the body plan from the incomplete jumble of fossilised bones was not an easy task.“We put all the armour out on a table and tried to figure out where, most logically, it would fit,” said Butler.View image in fullscreenAcademics investigate the armour of the specimen.Photograph: Lucie Goodayle/The Natural History Museum, LondonAnkylosaurs span the mid-Jurassic to the late Cretaceous epoch, when an asteroid crash-landing wiped out the majority of species, and are characterised by a squat, slow-moving and heavily armoured physique.“They’re probably a bit dim-witted as they have relatively small brains, but they’re very successful,” said Butler. “They’re around for about 100m years.”Spicomellus afer, now the earliest known example of the group, would have been around 4m in length and weighed around two tonnes. The fossil is missing the end of the tail, but fused vertebrae suggest that it would have culminated in a club-like structure, presumably used as a weapon to lash at rivals or predators. This suggests that adaptations for tail weaponry evolved around 30m years earlier than previously thought.The more modest body armour of later ankylosaurs is typically interpreted as having evolved as a physical defence. The sheer extravagance ofSpicomellus’sspikes, which would have protruded through tough skin, is more suggestive of dominance or mating displays, the researchers concluded.“When you see the neck collar of this thing, it seems like total overkill,” said Butler. “It does seem like the kind of thing that would’ve complicated its life.”View image in fullscreenBones believed to belong to theSpicomellus aferspecimen were marketed online for up to £10,000.Photograph: Lucie Goodayle/The Natural History Museum, LondonA source of frustration is that the quarry whereSpicomelluswas excavated has been targeted by fossil hunters. The research relied on around half of the skeleton, which is held at the Dhar El Mahraz Faculty of Sciences in Fez, but fossilised bones believed to belong to the same specimen have been marketed online for up to £10,000, said Butler.“There’s a huge problem with fossil poaching in Morocco,” he said. “Bits of this specimen have been for sale in the market in Europe and North America. There’s probably a significant amount [of the specimen] that has gone on to the market, often purchased by wealthy individuals. It’s quite a sad aspect of this story.”Explore more on these topicsDinosaursFossilsnewsShareReuse this content"

Macedonian writer-director Teona Strugar Mitevska ticks down the days from seven to one and wrings a performance of flayed, hard-bitten intensity from Noomi Rapace, who marches down the corridors with a face full of fury. Rapace is a long way from her breakout role in The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo; tonally, though, not so much. If Mother Teresa never goes so far as to set about the sisters with an axe, the sense that she might injects Mitevska’s film with a pleasing dose of danger.It is 1948, we’re in the broiling heart of Kolkata and Sister Teresa has tired of her teaching role at the Loreto Entally convent. “I’m a woman in a system run by men,” she complains to sympathetic Father Friedrich (Nikola Ristanovski), although she has also heard a call from the big man upstairs.Teresa applies to the Vatican for permission to set up her own mission, but the response takes an age, her patience wears thin and she has a more immediate problem. When her heir apparent, Sister Agnieszka (Sylvia Hoeks), admits that she is pregnant, Teresa is duly scandalised. She loves Sister Agnieszka but is repulsed by her, too. “I would never jeopardise my mission for earthly pleasures,” she declares in one of many examples of overly on-the-nose dialogue.Ahead of the film’s premiere, Rapace billed the film as a “punk-rock” reframing of the 20th-century saint, although the handling is arguably more Euro-metal than punk. There’s plenty of reverb guitar on the soundtrack, culminating in an extended headbanging session as the brides of Christ dance on the convent landing at night. It’s an approach that finally generates more heat than light and leaves Teresa exposed but not necessarily examined.Watch a clip from MotherTeresa, it’s clear, is desperate to strike her own path and tend to the poor and the needy. But are these motives purely altruistic?In the opinion of the writer Christopher Hitchens, this white saviour was not a friend of the poor but of poverty itself, and viewed the slums of Kolkata as a happy hunting ground for impressionable Catholic converts. Mother does little to disabuse us of that view, although its frequent God’s-eye shots of the action leave open the possibility that a higher power is guiding her hand and testing her faith. Teresa treats Agnieszka’s pregnancy as an infuriating distraction, another mess to be cleaned up before she can make her escape. It may, though, be the great moral challenge by which her mission is judged.Time is running short and Teresa craves an answer. So now she picks up the pace, steamrolling through the convent like a heaven-sent Nurse Ratched. She’s wiping the blood off the sisters’ wimples. She’s plucking maggots out of the body of a wounded beggar, who giggles and masturbates throughout the procedure. Her eyes are glittering; her skin looks as taut as a drum.Teresa is torn and the film is, too. As the clock ticks down to judgment day, Mother veers on and off the path of righteousness, constantly summoned back to its duties of presenting a faithful, fact-based account of its subject. But it’s at its best and most fun when it plays like a giallo horror movie: the lurid tale of a fanatical nun who’s confused God with Satan and herds her excitable flock right into the flames.Mother screened at the Venice film festival.Explore more on these topicsVenice film festivalBiopicsDrama filmsMother TeresaIndiaFestivalsReligionreviewsShareReuse this content"

Toews’s family descended from Russian Mennonites and spoke Plautdietsch, an unwritten language. They grew up in a world with little privacy, many unofficial rules and the threat of excommunication. Toews and a boyfriend had planned a bike trip across Europe, one in which they would sit on the grave of John Keats and smoke too many cigarettes.Before she left, her older sister Marj asked a favor: would Toews write letters to her while she was away? Marj, then 24, had recently moved back home and was in a period of deep depression. She had stopped talking, but she would still write. “She was so sick,” says Toews, sitting across from me at a picnic table in Toronto’s Trinity Bellwoods park.Toews began writing to her sister, partly because she loved talking to her and partly because she hoped it would save her life. “Which, of course, is a ridiculous idea,” says Toews. “That me writing letters would keep her alive. But I really took it seriously.”Anyone with a formidable older sister knows their unrivaled power. They are a portal to the wider world, brave in their primacy. Marj Toews was one such older sister. She was six years older than Miriam, who worshipped her from day one. “She was so much the subject of my investigation into this world,” Toews tells me. “I needed her. Who she was to me was something so necessary.”Marj has never stopped being a subject of investigation for Miriam Toews: both her remarkable life, and her death by suicide at the age of 52. Since that European excursion with her ex-boyfriend, Toews has authored 10 books, one of which, Women Talking, was adapted into an Oscar-winning film starring Frances McDormand and Rooney Mara. Her latest, A Truce That Is Not Peace, was released on Tuesday and is her first memoir written from her perspective. (Her first work of nonfiction, Swing Low, was written in the voice of her father).View image in fullscreenFrances McDormand as Scarface Janz in director Sarah Polley’s adaptation of Toews’s 2018 novel, Women Talking.Photograph: Michael GibsonToews is also an enthusiastic grandmother of four. She lives near downtown Toronto, with her 90-year old mother, Elvira; her partner; and her daughter Georgia’s family, including their two young sons.When Toews and I first encounter each other, a snaking line of hand-holding toddlers in fluorescent safety vests are weaving their way into the park. A smiling Toews stands vigil as they pass, trying to spot her grandson in the mix. It’s a muggy morning, and we, like the children, are in search of shade.At 61, Toews is older now than her older sister ever was, and around the same age her father was when he too died of suicide. Melvin Toews was a beloved schoolteacher in their home town of Steinbach in the Manitoba province of central Canada. He was a deeply devout man, a proud champion of his daughters and his wife, and somebody who experienced bipolar disorder his entire life. “My dad sort of had to be mentally ill in secret in that community,” says Toews. There was the danger of it being misinterpreted as a lack of faith. “If your faith was stronger, if you were a better Mennonite, you wouldn’t be depressed,” she says. His illness sometimes brought him into sustained periods of silence. The whole first year after Toews was born, he did not speak.It makes sense that though we are ostensibly here to talk about A Truce That Is Not Peace, our conversation stays mostly with both of them: the complexity of their deaths and the totality of how much they are missed. No matter how much time has passed, their absence is still raw. Becoming a grandmother has only intensified this feeling: Toews cannot help but think about how much Marj would have enjoyed this next stage of caregiving.Toews’s work is often centered on the question of why her father and her sister both chose to end their lives, and in A Truce That Is Not Peace, she acknowledges that she will never find the answer. It is that very paradox that keeps her on the page, turning it over again to try to understand them as they wished to be understood, and to stay close to them now that they are gone.Why do I still need to write? Why do I still need to make this thing in order to connect with other human beings so I don’t feel so alone and weird? It’s so embarrassingWhen she wrote the book, Toews had just turned 60. She was tending to both her young grandchildren and her elderly mother, whom she has previously called the love of her life. (Elvira Toews, a Lamborghini-loving, Toronto Blue Jays fan who bucked tradition to go to graduate school and become a social worker, leaps off the page in so many of Toews’s books. She is the kind of woman who eats a daily bowl of vanilla ice-cream with chocolate syrup, banana slices and walnuts, and when it’s over says: “How ’bout another one?”)Miriam Toews was already one of Canada’s bestselling authors, but the success of Women Talking launched her into a new level of international recognition, winning all of Canada’s top literary prizes and plaudits from everyone fromMargaret AtwoodtoBrad Pitt, who was a co-producer on the film adaptation. Yet, she could not shake the feeling that her need to continue to write was somehow newly shameful.“I was grappling with the urgency of it,” says Toews in regards to her writing, “And on the other hand the mortification. Why do I still need to write? Why do I still need to make this thing in order to connect with other human beings so I don’t feel so alone and weird? It’s so embarrassing.” She asked herself: hadn’t she said it all? What was left in her life to mine? Her nine previous books had already reflected back on many of her own experiences. Maybe it was time to finally heed the message she had received all those early years from her Mennonite forefathers: keep quiet.That would be dignified, Toews insisted. “I just wish I could be like a calm, serene, bemused grandmotherly person with wisdom,” says Toews. “But it seems as though – it seems like I haven’t really achieved that. And I have to understand that I never will.”At some point, we had to stop to laugh: it seemed too wonderfullyToewsianthat while she was talking about the indignity of an older female writer still expressing herself, we were surrounded by individuals who were contorting themselves into strange, acrobatic shapes. One was a shirtless man bending over a park bench like a stretchy rainbow, the other dangling frog-legged and upside down from a fabric sling strung up in a tree. “God,” says Toews. “It’s so perfect.”This time around, Toews is changing the way she tells these stories. Most of her previous books contain autobiographical information told through the prism of fiction. A Truce That Is Not Peace takes an inverse approach. The central conceit is a fictional prompt from a fictional conference in Mexico City, a send-up of the highfalutin literary circles Toews now finds herself in. The idea is something like this: organizers of this “Conversación” want her to provide an answer for why she writes. She sends them many attempts: associative, rangy, exasperated, rueful, funny ruminations on the futility of writing. Eventually, the committee uninvites her.The book is in many ways about the inherent failures of language. Marj Toews, like her father Melv before her, would fall into long periods of silence in her suffering. A Truce That Is Not Peace is constantly weighing Toews’s own urgent need to write against her sister’s and her father’s choice to periodically forsake words altogether. “Silence. Suicide. Writing. Within all of these, we are holding,” writes Toews. “Does her silence hold the perfect expression of her suffering? Is her silence a communications success, my writing a failure?”Silence, suicide and writing: these are sisters of sorts in Toews’s questioning mind: “Are writing and suicide related?” she asks. “The same thing? Or estranged relatives, at least? Angry siblings whose origins are the same. An attempt – a fragment of an attempt – to save life, preserve life, to freeze it in a moment, to end what is real, to survive by ending. To preserve, in silence, what is authentic.”Yet Toews is not cynical about the project of writing. It is nothing short of a choice to keep on living, long after we have buried our beloved dead. “Why must I draw a comparison between writing and suicide?” asks Toews. “To stay with her. To stay with them. Yes, you can imagine my suffering. Yeah, you fucking can. Try! Stay with me.”Despite their serious subject matter, Toews’s books have a rallying spirit to them, an angry jolt of energy that comes from a perpetual spirit of adolescent rebellion. In A Truce That Is Not Peace, that looseness feels more radical in nature, entirely liberated from plot. Toews has a deep distrust of narrative’s more controlling impulses.Perhaps it is because Toews has always been sensitive to modes of control, from the strict traditional Mennonite orthodoxy she grew up under. Or maybe it is because of the way some people in her religious community rushed to come up with neat and inaccurate explanations for why her father had died by suicide, which hurt Toews more than it provided comfort.Or maybe it was the new experience of having her novel about survivors of gas-facilitated sexual assault be made into a feature film and fully absorbed into the alienating awards cycle machine. “The reality is that [director] Sarah Polley did an amazing job,” says Toews. “We talked about it throughout, she was so sensitive to the whole thing, and it was an amazing experience.” The irony was not lost on Toews that going to Hollywood meant losing her authorial voice on a novel that was literally just women talking to one another. A Truce That Is Not Peace’s nonlinear structure makes it immune to such dangers. “I was thinking, OK, there’s no way this is going to be adapted,” laughs Toews. “Like, adapt this, motherfuckers. Just try.”With my mother, with my aunts, with my female cousins, there was a subversive humor that we could all rally. It was always against our oppressorsThere is of course a complicated answer to why write, and then there’s a simple one. “Why do I write?” writes Toews matter-of-factly towards the end of A Truce That Is Not Peace. “Because she asked me to.” Marj and Mel Toews introduced her to the world of books, a world that Toews thinks saved her life. “I love them and I miss them so much,” says Toews. “My sister, my God. It’s a visceral pain and it never goes away. It lessens, it lightens, it ebbs and flows.”It’s hard to overstate the patriarchal conditions Marj and Miriam Toews’s family were all subject to. Many of the women they grew up with lived hard lives. Their grandmother – their mother’s mother – buried six of her 13 children in infancy. Their father’s mother often cried out in her sleep, speaking the name of a group of men she grew up with in a little girl’s voice. She stole and drank bottles of vanilla extract during the day, lining her purse with a tea towel so that the glass would not make a sound. When Marj was 10, she was abducted off the street by a group of teenage boys in a car who dropped her off in front of her house hours later “doused with a vile brown liquid”. “Don’t be alarmed if I scream in my sleep,” Toews’s own mother cheerfully sometimes tells her family.But the women they grew up with also had a deep communion with one another that was borne out of the intense gender separation they experienced. They sang together. They raised their families alongside one another. And they laughed – a lot. “With my mother, with my aunts, with my female cousins, there was a subversive humor that we could all rally around and share. It was always against our oppressors, the rules that were put on us,” says Toews.Nobody made her laugh harder than Marj. “She was so funny,” says Toews. And what was it that made them laugh so hard? “That shared thing,” says Toews smiling, in the sly knowing language of sisters, “whatever that shared thing is.”A shared sense of humor is an underwater cable that connects so many siblings and so many of Toews’s books. It’s the language of subterfuge. What better way is there to chip away at an unreasonably sanctimonious authority than to laugh at it? Toews tells me that when she gave A Truce That Is Not Peace to her mother to read, her mother laughed and laughed, telling Toews: “It’s all true!”I ask Toews whether she dreams about Marj. “I do,” she tells me. “The details are often the same. She’s always telling me she’s OK. And she’s always looking good and happy. I would like to have that dream every night. Every night. It’s always a little bit hard waking up. But it’s always good to have the dream.”Miriam Toews: ‘I needed to write about these women. I could have been one of them’Read moreA Truce That Is Not Peace is dedicated to Marj. It contains some of those old letters between the two of them, back when Miriam was 18 and left for her overseas biking trip. Only one is written by Marj. It ends with her saying: “I very much miss being able to call you anytime or just come over + hang out. A sister’s place is in many ways even better than a friend’s – you’re always welcome, don’t have to make arrangements etc. etc. Can stay long or short, clean out the fridge, read the paper etc In short, not be on one’s best behaviour.”Toews’s writing is a way of building a suspended sister’s place where the correspondence is ongoing. It’s a place to go to not be on one’s best behavior. It’s both the dream and the waking up. “She taught me how to stay alive,” writes Toews. “Silence and words: both are good, both are failures, both are efforts, and in that effort is where life lies – notlies, but maybe it does – but where it exists. And the fragments in between are the spaces where she and I meet.”In the US, you can call or text the988 Suicide & Crisis Lifelineat 988 or chat at988lifeline.org.

The cartoon series was becoming quite popular so they thought: “Maybe the cartoon characters could come into a live-action film?” I thought: “No. This has to be real and in the sewers where it’s moody.” I didn’t get anything cinematic from the cartoon. I did from the comic book.Josh Pais (Raphael):They flew us to London to get body casted. I was in the back room of Jim Henson’s Creature Shop with my arms out to the side suspended by ropes. They started covering my body in plaster and did the back of my body first. Then they started my front, neck and my face. They put straws in my nose so I could breathe. The plaster gets warm as it sets and everything was heating up. I couldn’t hear and things started accelerating so I went inward. Later, they said they kept me in longer than they needed to see if I’d freak out.Leif Tilden (Donatello):I had no idea what it took to create these creatures. It was like the Nasa of puppetry. Falkor’s head from The NeverEnding Story was lying in the corner. Characters from The Dark Crystal and Labyrinth were hanging from the ceiling. I was down the rabbit hole.View image in fullscreen‘They put straws in my nose so I could breathe’ … a full body cast at Jim Henson’s Creature Shop.Photograph: Steve BarronDavid Forman (Leonardo):I did a lot of animal work. If you wanted a bear or gorilla, you’d come to me. A talking character was a challenge. Design-wise, we had creases and stretch in our joints. It was designed so we could kick, punch and have full dexterity. The costumes were built in stages. There was a chest piece, leg, feet and hand pieces. We married them together with elbow and knee props.SB:Jim [Henson] was worried about the weapons and fighting. It took a bit of persuasion but after a while he trusted me. I said: “I’m going to keep the spirit warm and tender and the tone will be something you’ll be proud of.” Luckily, he went for it. I don’t think it could have been done without him.Michelan Sisti (Michelangelo):I happened to be at the Creature Shop when Dave did his first test in the full suit. I remember him rolling around and doing all this stuff. After about 30 minutes, I asked him: “What’s it like?” He said: “Not good,” and he was in fantastic shape. He knew about the pain to come.It felt like your blood was boiling. One of us would lose it and shout: ‘Take the head off! Take the head off!’DF:I was used to working in heavy suits. Sweating, working blind, knowing my 360 degree markers. I did struggle with the weight of the costume because we had so many batteries in the shell to work the servos in the head. There was a lot of weight on our hips and lower backs. We were literally on all fours most of the time, looking like turtles, but in pain.LT:The suits were sculpted to our physical shape precisely so even the subtlest movement would move them. Also, you had to develop ways of living in a different temperature.SB:They knew these suits were going to be heavy and hot but they didn’t know how hot or heavy, until we were in North Carolina shooting. The heat was intense. Poor Josh was the only actor of the four who hadn’t done performance costumes before and he found it difficult. It brought on a bit of claustrophobia.JP:It felt like your blood was boiling. One of us would lose it and shout: “Take the head off! Take the head off!” Our heads were a separate piece and glued on so it wasn’t a simple process. They had to undo the glue. Sometimes, if one of us had that freak out, others would too. It was like a fever. The producers weren’t happy because it slowed everything down.DF:There’s very little oxygen in the head so between takes, we had blowers pointed at our open mouths to get some more air into us.MS:I was the experimental turtle. Everybody was overheating so they tried cooling vests designed for astronauts. I had one that circulated liquid. They put it on and asked me to work up a sweat. They turned on the pump and I immediately got an entire body cramp and fell over. The pump said, “Do not put ice in” and somebody put ice in it. The temperature change to my overheated core nearly killed me.JP:They created a room with plastic sheathing around it with air conditioners in. It had benches we would sit at with our arms up and heads down.View image in fullscreen‘It would have been easier if there were just two’ … Steve Barron, centre, with David Forman (Leonardo),left, and Leif Tilden (Donatello).Photograph: Steve BarronSB:We built a wooden horse for them to sit on that they could drape their arms over. There was a fan in the middle that’d blow air through the mouth. Looking at all four of them on that was like a Damien Hirst sculpture.LT:The first time the four of us were together for the opening “Cowabunga” sewer scene was a jungle of challenges. The art director created a sewer that was so realistic. It was moist and very slippery.JP:We were dying. There was water running under our feet. We were all having vision problems. If one of us stopped, we’d smash into each other. It was a relatively simple 45 second sequence but it took at least 12 hours. Everything kept going wrong.MS:The sewers were treacherous. Every time we jumped around the corner, one of us would slip and fall. Eventually, somebody suggested taking the bottoms off our legs and wearing sneakers. If you slow down the video when Dave comes into frame, you can see his legs as he jumps down.SB:It would’ve been a lot easier if there were only two turtles, that’s for sure.View image in fullscreen‘The temperature change nearly killed me’ … Michelan Sisti as Michelangelo.Photograph: Steve BarronSB:The turtle faces were radio controlled by nearby puppeteers. In North Carolina, sometimes a plane would land a mile away right in the middle of a take and suddenly, the turtles’ faces would twitch and start going crazy.SB:The campfire scene where they connect with Splinter is a big one. Michelangelo is crying and it’s clear how much they care for their father. There were a few underlying themes but the strongest was family.LT:We were stoned out of our minds. I smoked half a joint before we did it.JP: Leif pulled out a blunt and we were like: “Yeah. Come on!” We’d all been through so much. It gives me chills thinking about it. It was a spiritual experience and the buzz took it deeper.DF:That was a wonderful sequence. Connecting with our father, Splinter, and the whole ambience of that scene.DF:The fans are so grateful we kept in touch. They constantly thank us for being there for them in the 1990s. Grown adults say: “You were my childhood hero.” It’s helped all sorts of people for different reasons.JP:People come up to me with tears in their eyes saying: “You helped me through my childhood.” A lot had anger issues like Raphael and say watching the movie over and over made them see they weren’t alone. It’s an adult film for kids. It doesn’t talk down to them. It challenges them to step up within themselves.SB:Many more people have stayed connected to it than I expected. Youngsters have carried it into their 40s. Lots of people come forward saying this was the best adaptation. You take it with a pinch of salt – but it’s nice to hear.Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Movie is in US cinemas from Thursday 28 August.

(Netflix does not routinely report its viewing or box office figures, and no estimate is available for a similar type of cinema release in the UK.)While no details about the sequel have been confirmed, it is expected that Kang will return as director;she had the original idea for KPop Demon Hunters, before Appelhans (director of2021 animated feature Wish Dragon) was brought on board.KPop Demon Hunters is about three-member girl group Huntr/x, and focuses on lead singer Rumi, butin an interview with Variety in July, Kang suggested that a sequel might focus on fellow band members Zoey or Mira. “We’ve set up so much for potential backstory. Obviously, there’s a lot of questions that are left unanswered and areas that are not explored, and we had to do that because there’s only so much movie you could tell in 85 minutes … This was Rumi’s story, and we have backstories for Zoey and Mira.”The complex commercial relationship between Hollywood studio Sony, which developed the project, and Netflix, which distributed it, means that while the latter profited enormously from its success, both organisations need to agree on terms before production on a sequel can go ahead. The film was produced as part ofa deal between Sony and Netflix in 2021for direct-to-streaming films in whichNetflix reportedly paid for its $100m budgetas well as an upfront payment of$25m to Sony.Explore more on these topicsFilmSony PicturesNetflixFilm industryKPop Demon HuntersnewsShareReuse this content"

The brothers discuss their working methods, who inspires them, and what they disagree aboutWed 27 Aug 2025 03.00 EDTShareEarlier this year, the Cannes film festival saw a triumphant new appearance from European cinema’s kings of social realism and social conscience. The Dardenne brothers, Jean-Pierre and Luc, now 74 and 71, presented a movie that is one of their very best:Jeunes Mères or Young Mothers, a deeply compassionate, intelligent drama about a home for teen mothers or mothers-to-be in the directors’ home town of Liège in Belgium. These young women are faced with the existential question: is it sensible to give their infants up for adoption, or a fundamental loss of moral courage?Young Mothers review – outstanding return to form for the Dardenne brothersRead moreThe Dardennes have become known for intensely naturalist performances and handheld camerawork, radical simplicity and clarity. They have won the Cannes Palme d’Or twice, firstly for their dramaRosettain 1999, about a young woman who must look after her troubled mother in a trailer park – starring the then nonprofessional teenager Émilie Dequenne – and secondly the terrifying, faintly Greeneian dramaL’Enfant or The Child, from 2005, with Jérémie Renier as a petty criminal who gives his own baby away to a “private adoption” broker and then desperately tries to get it back.A string of other awards followed and with the imminent UK release of Young Mothers, which has incidentally earned them yet another prize at Cannes for their bulging silverware cabinet – for best screenplay – I logged on for a Zoom chat with the legendary brothers who, despite their films’ seriousness, are always infectiously genial, like cheerful academics.So how did Young Mothers come about, I ask? Luc replies: “We went in to research a maternity home with the idea of one character. Then we saw the life there, the five or six young mothers. And this was new for us, to envisage a whole group. We were attracted by it. We didn’t want to do a choral ensemble piece. We wanted each to have their story. And we decided that there would be light at the end of each tunnel. Sometimes a fragile, feeble light. But we didn’t want failure.”And the directing? I pointed out to them Martin Scorsese’s memory of seeing for the first time a movie by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger and wondering which of them shouts “Action!” and “Cut!” The thought makes both brothers giggle. “Sometimes it is my brother who says ‘Cut!’,” says Luc, laughing, “… and sometimes it is I!”“The most difficult word to say is ‘Cut!’,” interjects Jean-Pierre, laughing as well, and Luc adds: “Sometimes it can be our assistant who says it.” Having rehearsed extensively and intimately with the actors, the Dardennes are often positioned away from the camera, watching on the monitor and the responsibility for the cut will be devolved to this assistant.As for the actors: often, the Dardennes have worked with nonprofessionals, such as Dequenne and Renier, who then developed professional careers; and sometimes they worked with established A-listers such as Marion Cotillard, who got a best actress Oscar nomination for her performance in the Dardennes’ workplace dramaTwo Days, One Night. Are the big names directed differently to the amateurs?View image in fullscreen‘We wanted each to have their story’ … a scene from Young Mothers.Photograph: Christine Plenus“In terms of this rehearsal, it’s the same for all,” says Luc. “It’s then that we find a movement for the camera and start adding detail. Where it differs is how we talk to each actor. A professional will have their technique and they will know how to use it. They will naturally use their technique. They have to learn, to some extent, to forget it. You will have a situation where you tell an actor: OK, you light up a cigarette, you drink a coffee and read the newspaper. A professional will do it quite sleekly, but those little actions might completely overwhelm a nonprofessional.”Jean-Pierre says that improvisation is not what they do: “We rehearse a lot, we rehearse four to five weeks, but we leave some sort of leeway because the actors don’t have marks on the floors. No scene is ever exactly the same. The key is imprecision.” He adds, grinning: “What is the Italian word?Sfumatura! Hazy nuance and shade.”This approach is most important in working with children and teens who are so important to the Dardennes’ films, such the radicalised schoolkid inYoung Ahmedfrom 2019, and the exploited refugees inTori and Lokitafrom 2022. Luc says: “There is something of themselves that is always there. And we want that. If they just want to look down, they will look down and they are resisting the camera. Our model isAbbas Kiarostami. It’s how he directs. He lets them be.”View image in fullscreen‘All too short a life’ … Émilie Dequenne in Rosetta.Photograph: RONALD GRANTI raise the sad and painful subject of Dequenne, an iconic actor for the Dardennes who gave a luminous performance at the age of 17 in Rosetta anddied of cancer in March at the age of 43. Jean-Pierre says soberly: “It is very hard for us to talk about Émilie. Our very first memory that we will always cherish is when we first shot with her with the whole crew. On the very first day, we felt that the crew was drawn to her. Émilie bound us together and even she wasn’t aware of it. And then she went on to have a very varied and accomplished career and … all too short a life.”The political and social dimensions of the Dardennes’ films are often discussed, but less so their fierce, almost eerily spiritual elements; they are gritty parables of good and evil, with an almost Catholic emphasis on mother and child. Luc approaches the subject warily: “I would call it spiritual realism. We work from a social situation. But we don’t push it forward. It’s as if God is disappearing and it’s art’s responsibility to show, to lead, to guide. But never making a sermon.”Then there is the question of who guided the brothers themselves to work together in film? In school, says Jean-Pierre, there was a teacher who introduced them to cinema; he does not dwell on fact that the teacher was a priest: “He had a cine club and showed us many films: Bresson, Godard, Truffaut, Bergman, Bertolucci, Ken Loach. This triggered something. But at 17, we still didn’t think, oh one day we will make films together.” The vital moment came as they were working as assistants to the French theatre and cinema director Armand Gatti, who one day simply left these twentysomethings in charge while he went off to Germany to direct a play. The Dardennes picked up the clunky, but serviceable Sony Portapak cameras and made rough-and-ready documentaries in wobbly black and white.But it is at the end of our conversation that Jean-Pierre and Luc reveal their most compelling influence: their formidable mother, Marie-Josée. Luc says: “Our mother was a singer in the village. An operetta singer, singing in the Walloon dialect. And that she did for 20 years. She liked to sing for us. She sat us all down in front of her on the couch. She did a performance – I like to say she was our first actress!”View image in fullscreenMarion Cotillard in Two Days, One Night.Photograph: AllstarThe Dardennes also have two sisters: Marie-Claire, a theatrical props maker, and Bernadette, a nurse. During their childhood, the Dardenne brothers’ great passion, like so many other teen boys of that era, was for their tape recorder. Luc used it to record radio commentaries on the local football team he loved, Standard Liège, and the cheeky brothers sneakily recorded family conversations by hiding the device under the dinner table and playing it back afterwards – an early example of documentary realism. And their father, Lucien, was he influential? Luc replies: “He was very severe. He was in the resistance during the war and afterwards an industrial designer in steelworks. He painted a little in his youth.”Finally, I ask if they may ever make films separately, as the Coen brothers do? The question makes Luc laugh: “No! But our only disagreement – and you have to have one – is that I have an idea for a film but he doesn’t like it. He doesn’t want it. He’s scared because it’s a historical thing. It’s about the Spanish Inquisition. But …” Luc shrugs and Jean-Pierre shrugs as well, amiably. I point out that Robert Bresson made historical work. “When Bresson does a historical film it’s not his best …” says Jean-Pierre quickly. “But his Trial of Joan of Arc is very powerful,” replies Luc.Perhaps the Dardennes’ film about the Spanish Inquisition will never get made. Their togetherness is of paramount importance. As Luc puts it: “It’s good to be together to resist criticism – to face the critics together.”Young Mothers is in UK cinemas from 29 AugustExplore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsBelgiumEuropeinterviewsShareReuse this content"

This week, I spoke to Tems about her latest project: the Nigerian singer-songwriter and producer has been helping African women overcome many hurdles in the music industry.‘The future of African music is female and connected’View image in fullscreenGlobal giant … Tems at Lollapalooza Paris last month.Photograph: Kristy Sparow/GettyIn February, the singer Tems won the second of her two Grammy awards for the single Love Me Jeje, a milestone that made her arguably the most successful Nigerian woman in music since Sade Adu.“Dear God, thank you so much for putting me on this stage,” Tems said, flanked by her mother and members of her team. It was yet another win for the rising talent since her breakthrough five years ago on the track Essence with fellow Nigerian superstar Wizkid.As a newcomer in Nigeria’s music industry, Tems, born Temilade Openiyi, faced many challenges. Unable to afford beats for her songs, only a handful of people believed in her vision in those early days.Today, the 30-year-old is a household name, collaborating with megastars such as Beyoncé and Drake. She has also performed at festivals and on stages that many of her peers still covet – the 2023 NBA All-Star Game half-time show, Coachella in 2024, and at this summer’s Fifa Club World Cup final.Succeeding as a musician in Africa remains a tough endeavour and only a few make it to stardom. On that slope to success are many barriers, including lack of funding and infrastructure, that are even further compounded for women who additionally face misogyny. “There are some people who I looked up to in the industry but, surprisingly, they also wanted sex,” the singer Yemi Alade said inan interview in 2016.The Beninese-French singer Angélique Kidjo has also spoken ofpeople discouraging herfrom playing the drums, with one person insisting “drums are not made for women to play”.Tems told the Guardian: “When I first started gaining a platform, it was incredibly empowering to have women I admired, like Rihanna, Adele and Beyoncé, connect with my music. Their recognition validated my journey and, in some cases, led to opportunities to collaborate. Now, I want to give other women that same platform.”This is why, in early August, Tems assembled 20 of her countrywomen in the industry to help them forge their own paths to success.Tackling imbalancesView image in fullscreenBreaking barriers … participants of the Leading Vibe Initiative in Lagos.Photograph: Deeds StudioTems’s initiative isn’t the only one tackling these imbalances head-on. The Lagos-based nonprofitAudio Girl Africa, which describes itself as a “pan-African sisterhood building the future”, holds workshops and mentors female artists, A&Rs, marketers, and other music business professionals. In Nairobi, theSanturi Electronic Music Academy, founded in 2021, has trained dozens of female producers and engineers.At the continental policy level, theAfrican Union’s Afri’Talent cohort, launched in December in Ethiopia, supports women and youth in the arts, including music, as part of a drive to unlock $100bn for African creatives by 2030.Until now, no programme on this scale had been backed by an artist of Tems’s standing. The first edition of the singer’sLeading Vibe Initiative (LVI)was held in Lagos, Nigeria, this month to position African women as decision-makers and creators, not just performers or content add-ons.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Participants also got to useiZotope, audio software created for the programme, to boost their technical skills.“For many women, breaking through means having to work twice as hard to be taken seriously, while also shouldering expectations around how they should look, sound, or present themselves,” said Lola Ige, the head of marketing at Sony Music West Africa, who moderated a panel on image and team building.Pearl Ehanire, who attended the masterclasses and other sessions, said she came away not just with the right software but with renewed confidence and new collaborators.“One of the biggest challenges I’ve faced in my music journey is access, particularly to knowledge, mentorship, and the right gear … [Now] I feel so much more confident in my journey as a music producer,” Ehanire said. “I’ve also been able to connect with so many amazing female creatives in the industry … I’m unimaginably grateful for the experience.”Plans are under way to hold a second edition in Nairobi, Kenya in the coming weeks, and elsewhere around the world. And hopes are rising across the continent that the initiative becomes another catalyst for inclusivity in the creative sector.“The future of African music is female and connected,” the radio host and songwriter Klaire Onyeka, another participant, wrote on Instagram. “[I’m] excited to be part of such a purposeful community.”To receive the complete version of The Long Wave in your inbox every Wednesday,please subscribe here.Explore more on these topicsMusicThe Long WaveAfricaRaceWomennewslettersShareReuse this content"

The Estonian composer, whocelebrates his 90th birthday this year, had only just discovered the purity of Britten’s music when the latter died. Pärt’s six-minute tribute pits undulating string scales against the sombre toll of a single bell.It was a fitting opening to a wide-ranging concert in which the venerable Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra was put through its paces by Pärt’s Baltic state compatriot, Latvian conductor Andris Nelsons. Emerging from the most poignant of pianissimos, crisscrossing lines rose and fell before the conductor’s clenched hands wrang the final drop of pathos out of the final chord.Isabelle Faust was the late replacement for Hilary Hahn in Dvořák’s Violin Concerto, and although she kept one eye on the music to be on the safe side, this was an impressively organic reading of this amiable intermingling of 19th-century Romanticism and tangy folk idioms. Sleek and silvery at the top, and with a fine line in fluid phrasing, she highlighted the music’s shadier woodland tones while bringing a lightness and lift to the sunnier episodes that pepper the rhapsodic opening movement.View image in fullscreenPut through its paces … Faust and the  Leipzig Gewandhaus play Dvořák’s Violin ConcertoPhotograph: Chris Christodoulou/BBCFaust is disinclined to showboat. Instead, she discovered a poetic delicacy in the concerto’s flashier corners, with Nelsons and his Gewandhaus players her willing and sensitive partners. The central adagio was warmly spun, while in the finale – a spirited Czech furiant – her filigree fingerwork flickered like mercury over the orchestra’s earthier stomp.Nelsons was generally a surefooted guide to Sibelius’s Second Symphony, though occasionally the music betrayed its fragmentary nature. Well-paced, if a little too loud too soon, he teased out plenty of internal dramatics, ratcheting up the tension in the opening movement. In the ensuing andante, baleful bassoons over a darkly determined pizzicato tread powered the tempest-tossed music towards its implacable conclusion. The whirling scherzo was tense, bracing even, while the conductor’s deftly broadened tempi imbued the long-breathed finale with the necessary weight and nobility.Listen again on BBC Soundsuntil 12 October.

Asked the same question ahead of a literary conference in Mexico City, Miriam Toews mentions the teenage letters she sent from Europe to her sister Marjorie (Marj or M as she calls her) as the reason she became a writer. Sorry, that won’t do for an answer, she’s told. Try again.In a frenetic household set-up in Toronto, keeping an eye on her mother one moment, entertaining her grandchildren the next and warding off angry neighbours in between, she struggles to get her act together and makes a to-do list: “Wind Museum. Deranged skunk. North-west quadrant with ex. Conversación in Mexico City.” The skunk has distemper and keeps getting trapped in the window well. The Wind Museum is the collection she’d love to create, commemorating winds from all over the world (Harmattan, Calima, Mistral, Sirocco etc), if she can find a way to exhibit them. The ex is the father of her second child, who despite years of separation is still taking the royalties on her work – it’s time to meet him and end that arrangement.Most pressing, though, is the Mexico City business. Since early childhood she has been “afflicted” with a need to write things down: “the fingers in my mind would begin typing”, and she’d carry on all day, touch-typing in her head, “as though that were the only way of proving to myself that I was alive, that what I was experiencing was real”. That could be an answer of sorts. Too late, though: she’s disinvited from the conference; the word CANCELLED appears across her photo in the programme.A hopeless failure, then. But this book is a triumph – a meditation on writing, suicide, guilt and silence; a fragmented account of her life so far; and an illustration of why she’s one of Canada’s most admired writers (there’s nowa plaqueoutside her former home in Steinbach, Manitoba, where she grew up as part of a Mennonite community). Though the Mexico City organiser missed the point, those letters to her sister were indeed her prime reason for writing. “Why do I write? Because she asked me to.” That was the deal they made. “You live. And I’ll write.”Marj suffered from depression and in 2010 she killed herself, 12 years after their father Melvin had done the same. Toews wrote about Melvin, in his voice, in her book Swing Low (2000) and her relationship with Marj formed the basis for her novel All My Puny Sorrows (2014). Most of her work until now has been loosely autofictional. This time there are no disguises. She tells it as it is.“You people (meaning, my family) don’t talk about your pain,” Toews’s partner tells her, “you just kill yourselves.” Toews herself came close to doing so one day while walking by the river Assiniboine, in Winnipeg, but rather than throwing herself in the water she threw her mobile phone instead. “A parable of perfect silence,” she calls it, but it’s her sister’s silence that preoccupies her – all those years before she died when she didn’t speak. “Was my sister’s silence an attempt to translate something that couldn’t be said? Something that would cause too much pain if it were to be said?’ The questions keep coming, with Toews disinclined to present writing (“this strange non-thing”) as any more creative or worthwhile than her sister’s wordlessness: “If silence says more, why write?”Since early childhood she has been 'afflicted' with a need to write things downAs a hymn to their intimacy, maybe the writingdidhelp keep her sister alive. The letters she sent from Europe, which come in a brilliant run of 30 pages late on in the book, date back to 1982, when Toews was travelling with her boyfriend Wolfie. The two of them are hard up and she’s increasingly disenchanted with him, not least when he busks with a penny whistle in Covent Garden (no, she won’t hold out a beret for coins) or queues to get a book signed by John Fowles when they haven’t the money for food. In Oxford she lies on the grass, unaware there’s a cricket match going on. In Paris they’re chased out of a park by guards with whistles. In Rouen their bikes are stolen. In Corfu they’re pelted with pomegranates by a gang of children. They fall out, make up by having outdoor sex (“I still have tiny pieces of rock ground heroically into my back and ass”), fall out again. It’s hilarious. And she’s only 18. “Do you think I’ll soon be enjoying liquid lunches at theAlgonquin Round Table, hahahaha.”The hahahaha principle defines Toews. “Between you and me, I want to be a clown. I think Iama clown,” she tells Marj. It’s an inherited trait perhaps. Despite the sadness and depression, there’s a lot of laughter in the family, including an episode when they take a boat out to an uninhabited island, disembark for a picnic and return to find the boat has disappeared – rather than wail they all begin to laugh (later, miraculously, the boat drifts back to shore). Toews’s mother, a Scrabble genius, remains indomitably cheerful despite her losses, and is arguably the heroine of the book.“Narrative as something dirty, to be avoided – Iunderstandthis,” Toews writes, and she does avoid it, up to a point, bobbing about in time and place, riffing on the Wind Museum, recounting how she refused to marry the father of her son and broke up with the father of her daughter. The awful and the laughable overlap. Her sister is attacked by a carful of young men and drenched in rancid brown liquid. Their mother is kidnapped and robbed. Their father doesn’t speak for a year. It might sink a less buoyant spirit but Toews makes comedy out of the chaos.She does the same when she talks about her writing career. On a cruise with her mother, the pages of her manuscript are blown from the floor of her cabin into the sea. Her very first reading in another city is cancelled when the poet in charge runs off with her lover – Toews is left to sleep for three nights on a blow-up mattress in a garden shed.Her very existenceis farcical: she was conceived on the night of her grandfather’s funeral, in a marital effort to ward off morbidity.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

She’s wired, anxious, on an adrenalin high and prone to panic attacks, “crazy with grief, guilt and dread”. Having to write dismays her. She’d love to stop obsessing about word order and become “a benign but wise grandmother, with a soft lap”. Then again, from what we see of her with her grandchildren, she is that anyway. Meanwhile, writing absorbs her sorrow and rage.“Are you OK? I mean, you know,OK? I miss you so much,” Toews writes to her sister. “I wish I could take your sadness away.” She’s still trying, all these years later, closing with a 2023 letter to Marj (“You’ll like this”) about a stranger arriving at a Christmas Eve family gathering and being made welcome, though it turns out he has not been invited.

All property is held in common and centrally rationed in “a constantly recalibrating state of voluntary poverty”; collectivity is so rigidly enforced that even the family unit is considered a potential threat, with youngsters periodically rehoused in different families. Women (“sisters”) are assigned dowdy dresses in order to repress desire, and merely humming a tune is a guilty pleasure. This bleak way of life is rendered in a series of episodic dispatches, and the title character’s inner life is imparted in a free indirect third person as she grapples with doubt, shame and boredom.Ruth is knock-kneed and clumsy, prone to malingering and fixated on language. She feels guilty if she rehashes a joke – because self-plagiarism might constitute “empty speech”, which is a sin. Having been raised in such an austere environment, her mind is blown on her first day at a public high school: “Enumerating the varieties of blue jeans made her think very seriously of infinity … The running list of exotic clothing she’d witnessed … ennobled her impulse to stare..” Time and again her thoughts circle back to the riddle of visual pleasure. “Beauty was an argument, but for what?” For Stendhal it meant the promise of happiness, and it connotes something similar here: life force, connection. Ruth is terribly lonely, plagued by a “constant lugubrious awareness of her own isolation”; “all she wanted was a friend who knew she was suffering but would not make her talk about it”. Instead, she marries a man she finds boring, has three children with him and sinks into depression. Decades pass in the blink of an eye. On a road trip for their 21st anniversary, we find her staring out from the passenger seat like a sullen teenager: “Every passing car was an opportunity to project pathos; she made eye contact and tried to look like a woman abducted.”Reticence, dissociation, quiet quitting: these are the unsung heroes of self-care, as Riley’s protagonist can vouchThis is as much as we get by way of overarching narrative: not so much an arc as a flat line. In the most enjoyable plotless novels, the rhythms of inner life generate a momentum that substitutes for action. Here, Ruth’s diffident consciousness is a halting, intermittent presence; on the page as in life, she is overshadowed by her environment. Yet although the novel sometimes drags, Riley’s droll, sardonic narrative voice keeps the reader on board. She does a nice line in adverbial intensifiers: Ruth’s father is “deeply, magnetically pathetic”; a dog is “hypnotically dim”; a doctor is a “tiny and turbulently pink little man”. There are some memorable, elegantly economical descriptions: we encounter “a glossy, ursine sister”, “a cedar barn of a man”, a “squash-like cardinal”, and an “extremely vertical” visitor who “fell into handsome lines when quiet”. A group of women in an old black-and-white photograph look “like rats in kerchiefs”; an enthusiastic bather “hoisted up her skirt and slip and rushed into the water like a stung hen”.Riley’s narrator is part wry anthropologist, part reluctant memoirist. Hers is very different from the kind of candour we have become accustomed to in contemporary fiction: it’s essentially withholding, and the emotional payoff is to be found not in the explicit excavation of trauma, but in bittersweet moments of levity and flights of whimsy. At one point, Ruth considers naming her daughter Idea: “It meant her favourite thing; it required only the slightest blunting of the mind to sound like it had been a little girl’s name all along. And it had occurred unbidden … like relief from hiccups and most angels.” (She doesn’t go through with it.) Literary culture has become so mired in therapeutic discourse that we’ve almost forgotten there are other, subtler ways to explore pain. Reticence, dissociation, quiet quitting: these are the unsung heroes of self-care, as Riley’s protagonist can vouch. “Ruth detached with ease; her life was one long, loud Velcro release from the world.”Ruth by Kate Riley is published by Doubleday (£16.99).

Regrettably, it turns out that hundreds of hours spent mercilessly beating my friends and family at Mario Kart and causing vehicular chaos in Grand Theft Auto do not translate instantly to real-life driving skills and judgment. I love racing games precisely because they are unrealistic.Because I still don’t have my licence, I ride my bike everywhere. It’s a giant orange monster of a thing, big enough for my two children to ride on the back, and it looks ridiculous. It makesmelook ridiculous, next to the Lycra-clad middle-aged men on their carbon-fibre frames who zoom past me on the regular. It’s not something I could ever take out into the countryside or down some mountain trail. For that, once again, I must turn to video games.There are surprisingly few games about cycling, but rather like my abiding love for virtual golf, I have developed a longstanding mini obsession with them nonetheless. One of my all-time favourite games isLonely Mountains: Downhill, a mountain-biking game that has you performing extremely precise adjustments to your trajectory down increasingly treacherous mountains, soundtracked by minimalist nature sounds and the sound of your rider smacking into boulders.Knights and Bikesis another lovable cycling-based adventure with the vibe of a 1980s summer holiday, starring a couple of kids exploring an island on two wheels.View image in fullscreenPedal (not) to the metal … Wheel World.Photograph: Messhof/SteamLately I’ve been playing Wheel World, from California developer Messhof (who also made the one-on-one fencing classic Nidhogg). You ride around a sizeable island on an easy-to-handle racing bike, keeping an eye out for hidden paths and ramps and bike parts and taking on local riders in races when you feel like it. It’s a low-octane, cartoon-coloured Forza Horizon on a bike; a game that captures both the freedom and peace of cycling. You don’t feel like you’re controlling a vehicle; you can’t control gravity and wind and the contours of the road. Instead, you just ride.I’ve been recovering from an inconvenient, painful injury for most of this year (hence my periods of absence from the newsletter), so relatively undemanding, feelgood games are just what the doctor ordered. Wheel World is a racing game that calms the nervous system, a rare thing indeed. You are chosen at the start by an ancient bike spirit, and must challenge the island’s speediest champions to reclaim supernatural bike parts. Unlike in Lonely Mountains, none of this is particularly difficult – I was winning races effortlessly most of the time – but it feels really good to ride around, winding up hills and then freewheeling down towards the city at the centre of the island, heading out to the Provence-reminiscent farmland where you share the road with tractors. You don’t even have to worry too much about sticking to the tarmac.I’ve played a few racing games that are structured like Wheel World, but none thatfeellike it. It made me feel entirely at ease. It’s a whole game-world constructed entirely around bike worship, with no complications and no distractions. Tooling your ride is half the fun, as every new part slightly changes how it feels to pedal around (and they come in fun colours). The soundtrack is exactly energetic enough during races and exactly absent enough when you’re riding around enjoying the vibe and looking for something to do. After five hours or so I was clearly overqualified to take on the final race, but I didn’t want it to end, so I spent another evening exploring everywhere I hadn’t been yet instead. Everywhere I went was explicitly designed for two-wheeled pleasure.Sometimes in a period of physical or emotional recovery, you are in need of a huge game to get lost in; sometimes you just need something short and sweet with the power to lift your mood. Wheel World has helped me miss riding my real bike a little bit less.What to playView image in fullscreenTop Gear … Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater.Photograph: KonamiLongtime readers will know that I have bounced off every Hideo Kojima game I’ve ever played, but our critic Tom Regan was delighted to return to Metal Gear Solid 3, which is being rereleased later this week asMetal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater. “Snake Eater is a leaner, meaner Metal Gear, a cold war caper owing just as much to James Bond as it does Apocalypse Now,”he writes. “Kojima makes no secret of his love of Hollywood, yet where his works often balloon into unwieldy epics, this game is still his most filmic achievement to date. It’s silly, self-contained and enjoyably campy, veering from the sublime to the ridiculous with admirable swagger.

The setting is weird: an iridescent, far-future imagining of New England where organic and non-organic matter mingle in strange, alchemical ways. And the characters are undeniably quirky: one is a bird called Twig whose beak is made from driftwood. Strangest of all: you play as a lighthouse that has inexplicably become animate, sprouting tiny, spindly little legs to carry its wibbling, wobbling body.In the sea of action-hero young men and, to a lesser degree, women, the lighthouse stands out as an unlikely star. Creative lead Lee Petty is a little fuzzy on the details of how it came to be. Rather, he talks about the creation of the protagonist as he does the broader action-adventure experience: as if it rose out of his subconscious. Despite the ostensible absurdity, Petty believes there is a certain intuition about it. “You have a light, and light has a very strong connection with life,” he says. “You can imagine the verbs for the player, and the actions, puzzles, mechanics that fall out of that.”View image in fullscreen‘Life has continued to evolve in completely unexpected ways’ … Keeper.Photograph: Double FineThe lighthouse’s illuminated beacon is the primary way you interact with the game’s teeming island setting. In “unfocused” mode, you direct the beam about a fantastical environment, causing foliage and small creatures to grow, change and morph. In “focused” mode, the light’s power is concentrated: larger objects undergo transformation while some materials are repelled or attracted; this is the basis of the game’s more involved puzzles.Keeper’s world is one of gauzy, psychedelic purples and deep, verdant greens. We see bioluminescent rock formations, tree-sized tendrils protruding from their gigantic flower heads, and a gorgeous, whale-like creature floating through the sky, vegetation growing unexpectedly on its back. This ecological extravaganza is partly inspired by 1980s fantasy movies such as The Dark Crystal and The NeverEnding Story, “weird” and “imperfect” works, admits Petty, yet “so earnest in their desire to create a world that you haven’t seen before”.View image in fullscreenGauzy, psychedelic purples … Keeper.Photograph: Double FineReal life proved just as inspiring for the creative lead. During Covid lockdowns, he walked alone in the pretty foothills south of his San Francisco home. Petty gazed at the abundant vegetation while meditating on what the planet might look like should humanity cease to exist. He was also reading books and watching movies about mycelium networks, thinking deeply about the interconnectedness and interdependence of ecosystems.This deluge of feelings, real-world circumstances and reference material coalesced as a fever dream, says Petty. He envisioned a “a weird island, a sort of surreal, post-human thing, where life has continued to evolve in completely unexpected ways”.The game’s genesis arrived shortly after Petty’s award-winning employer Double Fine, maker of trippy platformerPsychonauts 2,Stackingand many other idiosyncratic titles, was acquired by Microsoft. The new management was receptive to his experimental idea: he was given the time and resources to explore the concept before locking down its form. Keeper seems to have embodied the laid-back approach of its making: the vibe is languorously dreamy with many opportunities to slow down and smell the enchanting and totally bizarre roses.“You’re not rushed along, you’re not given mission objectives. There are no pop-ups on the screen with meta-rewards,” says Petty. “You’re kind of left to dwell in the space.”And yet there is a grim irony that may yet sour this sweet, whimsical experience: Keeper’s vivid celebration of life is being funded by Microsoft at a time when the company’s cloud-based storage platformAzure has been usedto facilitate the preparation of deadly airstrikes and military operations in Gaza and the West Bank. The the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement has called for the boycott of Microsoft and Xbox products. Recently, unionised workers at French studio Arkane, also owned by Microsoft, issued an open letter stating that its parent company “has no place being accomplice of a genocide”. Microsoft has sinceclaimed to be investigatingthe use of its platform in this manner, which is, it claims, a breach of the terms of service.Petty, of course, is far removed from the decisions made by his bosses at Microsoft, and he stresses as much. He says this is the “downside” of being owned by a much larger organisation, one whose purview extends far beyond entertainment. “I’m not in control. Double Fine is not necessarily tacitly endorsing anything of our parent company,” he says. “We’re just trying to make great games.”Keeper is due for release on PC andXboxin OctoberExplore more on these topicsPCSummer games previewsGamesXboxXbox series S/XfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It begins as a blended-family satire with eco-arguments and generational clash bolted on. But with each act the ground on its earthy set turns, developing into what might be a state-of-the-nation play and entering into similar ground to Bartlett’s brilliantAlbionin its portrait of middle-class urbanites who have upped sticks for an alternative, “better” rural existence through sustainable farming.It grows into something bigger and more universal still, to become a play about how to live responsibly in the midst of toxic capitalism. Are the characters who seek freedom in fact in retreat? Is localism just a yearning for a purer past and can we rewild our way to a new pastoral idyll? Important questions are asked through the prism of a family headed up by Ruth (Hattie Morahan), her shaggy, laconic partner, Lip (Sam Troughton) and Ruth’s former stepdaughter, Milly (Nadia Parkes).Lip is ecowarrior and would-be guru in the mould ofJez Butterworth’s Rooster, although more privileged – his farm is a family inheritance – and not nearly as charismatic. Ruth shares his dream of getting back to a kinder, more elemental way of living – up to a point.View image in fullscreenExcellent performances … Nadia Parkes and Terique Jarrett in Juniper Blood.Photograph: Marc BrennerUnder the direction of James Macdonald, the lights do not dip. This draws our eye to the vivid daylight on Lip’s fields, and maybe also the idea that this story about ethical ways of living is of our world, and we are part of it.The set designed by Ultz (who also designed that of Jerusalem) is a grassy bank. It is a living, breathing thing, it seems, with birdsong, tufts of grass that occasionally tumble down and – less welcome – a small, strange insect found in this critic’s bra.The cast give excellent performances and the action is intriguing, the arguments holding us, but the story in itself seems contrived around the play’s ideas. Sometimes these announce themselves in the mouths of characters, especially Milly’s friend, Femi (Terique Jarrett). He is doing an MSc in contemporary rural economy at Oxford, we are told. He certainly sounds as if he is by the third act when he lectures Lip (and us?) on everything from Gen X legacies from Thatcher’s Britain to the economics of global capitalism.Lip, too, seems like an anti-Enlightenment construct – a luddite who puts his principles above life-saving modern medicine.There is plenty that captures current-day anxieties too around technology, globalisation and the disenchantment ofpreppersandsurvivalists. Vitally, it is thoroughly amusing, alongside the serious stuff. Milly is full of beady-eyed Gen Z attitude without becoming a caricature. Tony (Jonathan Slinger), the farmer next door who is trying to rejuvenate himself in his mid-life (crisis?) is simultaneously satirised and heartfelt.Despite its lecturing and trowel-load of ideas, it is compelling and ambitious, Chekhovian in glimmers. Bartlett masterfully weds levity through social satire with complexity and depth of subject matter.And there is something courageous in its biting off more than it can chew. It is not so much a state-of-the-nation play as a state-of-the-world drama, grappling with the very real and prevailing despair over how to live, fix the climate crisis, and find collective hope. Invigorating and welcome, except, of course, for the rogue insect.At Donmar Warehouse, London, until 4 OctoberExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreDonmar WarehouseMike BartlettreviewsShareReuse this content"

The bride was Elaine Sherman, mother of my friend Rhonda, who I’d known since seventh grade. Mrs Sherman was getting married for the second time and the dancing man was the husband’s son-in-law, though I don’t remember his name or what he was dancing to.As the title says, it’s a circle dance, where people get into the middle and do their thing. And this guy sure did – he was marvellous. I saw him and just grabbed my camera – boom! I was using a pretty wide-angle lens and a head-on flash: I like to have people all lit up, like stage lighting. All the way to the left of the picture is a woman with just part of her face showing – that’s my mom, Sunny, who was friendly with Elaine. I wonder now how I came to be looking down at the guy, because I’m only 5ft 1in. Was I standing on a stool or a chair? I doubt I’d have done that. I must have been holding the camera at some elevation.Usually I ask permission to take a picture, but people knew I was photographing. And Elaine was aware that I’d grown up taking pictures of my Jewish family and friends in Long Island, and was working on a series focusing on that community. I included this picture when I successfully applied for an artist grant to become a photographer documenting Jewish New York – which I did between 1978 and 1979.I was told about a club called the Coyote Hookers’ Masquerade ball. I went and was hookedThe year after I took this picture, I registered for a class taught by the Magnum photographerBob Adelman. He told me about a Valentine’s Day party at New York’s Copacabana nightclub: the Coyote Hookers’ Masquerade Ball. Coyote was an acronym for Cast Off Your Old Tired Ethics, and I went dressed as a girl scout and talked my way in with my camera. Since moving to New York in my early 20s in 1975, I’d spent a lot of time exploring and photographing the club scene, but that one really got me hooked – the costumes, the dance, the decor, the amazing sound system. Soon after I met an adventurous, fun-loving woman called Judi Jupiter on a bus back from Mardi Gras and we started hitting the clubs together:Studio 54, Paradise Garage and so many others. I’d often take my camera.Salons, strippers and sexy beach kisses: American street life – in picturesRead moreSo this photograph is a cross between my suburban home pictures and the club ones – it captures the excitement of nightlife. I think I do nightlife with a street photographer’s eye, in that I like to capture unexpected action. I don’t usually go places to take photographs, I photograph where I’m going.I had to cut right back on clubbing when I started teaching in Brooklyn in 1981. The photographs I took there over the years were the basis for my first monograph, which I didn’t publish until 2014. People commented on how full of life the people in those pictures appeared, even though the neighbourhood was so burnt out and destitute, but the people I’m always attracted to photographing are those who project confidence and joy. There’s so much misery and unfairness in the world and so many hard lives. Personally, I want to capture the reasons people want to go on – I’m drawn to the dandelion coming through the concrete.I do have a vintage print of this picture, which means at the time I found it interesting enough to print, which was quite unusual back then. It did eventually appear in my book Purgatory and Paradise: Sassy ’70s Suburbia and The City. It feels like a transitional photograph that combines my interests – family and friends, a celebration of life, dance and joy, unexpected talent. I can imagine this man standing around at the wedding, looking like a mild-mannered guy, and then, wow! What a dancer.Meryl Meisler’s photography is included in She Sells Seashells atAlice Austen House, New York, from 6 September to 21 FebruaryMeryl Meisler’s CVView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Dean GoldbergBorn: South Bronx, New York City, 1951Trained:“With Cavalliere Ketchum at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, then withLisette Modelin New York (and many workshops over the years).”Influences:“Diane Arbus,Jacques Henri Lartigue, my dad Jack and my grandfather Murray Meisler. Also Brassaï, Helen Levitt and Cartier-Bresson.”High point: “I’ve had many. Group and solo exhibits in the US and abroad, gallery representation, grants, fellowships, books and positive press are each a joyful new high to me. I take nothing for granted and am grateful for each opportunity. I believe that the best is yet to come for my career.”Low point:“I was one of three finalists for a central permanent installation at a subway station with the Metropolitan Transit Authority. During lunch while working as a teacher, I received the rejection email. Luckily no one was in my classroom at the time because I broke down in tears, sobbing on the floor.”Top tips: “I am not a commercial photographer – I am answering this from the viewpoint of a photographer who made the bulk of their living as an educator and now frequently exhibits in galleries, museums and sells limited edition prints.First and foremost, never give up! The fact that you love taking and making photographs is enough reason to keep doing it.Feeling stuck? Take a class or workshop.Find role models and a supportive community of artists who encourage one another in a competitive, often cut-throat world.You don’t want to be remembered as an ‘Unknown Artist’. Print, sign, date and store your best work using archival methods. Before you know it, you have vintage prints.Health and wellbeing come first.”Explore more on these topicsPhotographyMy best shotWeddingsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A lodger is someone who rents a room in someone else’s home, usually sharing living spaces such as the kitchen and bathroom. By contrast, tenants generally rent the whole property.Unlike a tenant, a lodger does not have exclusive rights to any part of the property – meaning you, as the landlord, can access their room (however, you should respect their privacy).Matt Hutchinson, a director at the flatshare website SpareRoom, says tenants generally have more rights than lodgers because the law recognises that homeowners and landlords are distinct roles, and sharing a home “requires a different set of rules”.He adds: “Homeowners who rent out (always furnished) rooms to lodgers do so under a licence rather than a tenancy agreement, which sets out the conditions of their stay in your property.“For example, you’re only required to serve ‘reasonable’ notice if you want your lodger to move out. That’s usually the length of the rental payment period, so typically one month, but it can be shorter. There’s also no minimum term required by either party.”Live-in landlords can ask lodgers for a deposit. But unlike a residential landlord letting an entire property on an assured shorthold tenancy (AST), there is no obligation to protect the deposit using a deposit protection scheme.Who can take in one?Most homeowners can take in a lodger, but if you have a mortgage, it is best to speak to your lender first.Mark Harris, the chief executive of the mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, says: “Even those lenders who don’t have an issue with lodgers may have certain caveats, such as a cap on the number of lodgers. Principality [building society] will only allow one, while Nationwide and Santander will allow up to two lodgers. Some lenders will forbid lodgers altogether.”Bear in mind that if you let rooms to more than two people, your property may then be classed as a “house in multiple occupation” (HMO) by your local authority. There are extra safety requirements and standards for HMOs, and you will often need a licence.If your home is leasehold, check the lease to see whether you need the freeholder’s permission to sublet part of the property. Council tenants can also sublet a room to a lodger, assuming the local authority gives the go-ahead. Private tenants can take someone in, too, as long as they have their landlord’s permission.Find the right personSpareRoom is the go-to site for lodgers and flatmates. As well as advertising your room, check the “room wanted” ads and sign up for alerts, so you will be aware of anyone looking in your area.Other websites worth checking out include Roomies UK and Ideal Flatmate, while MondaytoFriday and GetDigs UK specialise in weekday lets.Use word of mouth, too: ask friends, family or colleagues whether they know someone looking for a room. There is social media too: local Facebook groups are a good place to start.View image in fullscreenSpareRoom is the go-to site for lodgers and flatmates, but there are also other websites worth checking.Photograph: M4OS Photos/AlamyEarn up to £7,500 tax-freeThe government’s “rent a room” scheme lets you earn up to £7,500 a year (£625 a month) tax-free from letting out furnished accommodation in your home. The threshold is halved to £3,750 if you share the income with someone else. Most live-in landlords include bills in the rent.To determine how much rent to charge, research local market rates for similar rooms and adjust based on your specific circumstances. Consider factors such as the size and condition of the room, shared living spaces and the location.The income limit covers everything you charge your lodger – so if you charge them for cleaning, meals or laundry, you will need to count these fees or costs too.You do not need to do anything unless you earn above the threshold – in which case you will need to pay income tax on the amount above £7,500.“The tax-free threshold hasn’t been increased since 2016 and is no longer representative of average room rents today,” says Hutchinson. “This means many people who rent out rooms earn more than the threshold. If they do, they must opt into the scheme and complete a tax return to claim their tax-free allowance.”Do your homeworkWhen choosing someone to share your home with, it is important to check you are compatible.A quick chat will help you decide if someone’s lifestyle and personality fit with yours. Ask about working hours (including whether they work from home), smoking, pets, regular guests, cleaning habits and expectations.If you are in England, once you have found a potential lodger, you need to do a “right to rent” check to make sure they are legally allowed to live in the country. You can be fined or sent to prison for failing to carry out this check. To do this, you shouldask to see relevant documents. There is an onlineguidethat can help with this process.You may also want to carry out credit checks and ask for references before signing an agreement.Make an agreementA “lodger agreement” – or “licence to occupy” – is used by live-in landlords to rent out a spare room in their home. This is a different type of contract to an AST, which is what you would use if you let the entire property to tenants.You can include various terms in the lodger agreement, such as about rules on overnight guests and noise, cleaning responsibilities and use of common areas.Having everything in writing at the beginning can avoid disputes later on.The agreement should also set out the rent amount, payment frequency, how it should be paid (for example, by standing order) and any notice period required.View image in fullscreenIf you use the ‘rent a room’ scheme to earn tax-free income, you must provide a furnished room.Photograph: JulPo/Getty ImagesConsider your financesIf you are claiming benefits and take in a lodger, you must inform the Department for Work and Pensions at your local jobcentre immediately. Taking in a lodger can affect your benefit entitlements, and failing to report this change can lead to overpayments, penalties or even prosecution for fraud.If you normally get the 25% single-person discount on your council tax, this will end when a lodger moves in. However, if the lodger is a full-time student, the discount may still apply.Tell your home insurerMake sure your tell your buildings and contents insurer about your lodger, as failing to do so can invalidate your policy. You may need a home insurance policy that includes cover for lodgers, or you may have to pay an extra premium on your current policy.Your insurer may also add exclusions to your cover – such as theft if there is no forced entry.You will need to check with your provider whether the policy will cover your lodger’s possessions, or if they need to take out their own contents policy.Set up the roomIf you use the “rent a room” scheme to earn tax-free income, you must provide your lodger with a furnished room. This means providing a bed and mattress, wardrobe or other storage, and a desk or table if there is space.You will also need to ensure the room meets fire safety standards, such as having working smoke alarms, fire-safe furnishings and proper ventilation. You will need to comply with gas safety regulations, too. This means your gas appliances must be checked every year by a Gas Safe registered engineer.On moving-in dayIt’s helpful to be around when your lodger moves in – do not just hand over the keys and disappear. They could have questions, so being available makes settling in smoother. Of course, you do not need to hover while they unpack, but make sure they know where to find you if they need anything.Explore more on these topicsRenting propertyMoney hacksPropertyConsumer affairsConsumer rightsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I felt great in them, like a chip off the old blockAmy FlemingWed 27 Aug 2025 05.01 EDTShareIloved Dad’s old suede jacket. He’d had it for as long as I could remember, an artefact from his more rock’n’roll days, and it had been worn into buttery softness. When the lining finally disintegrated, and the suede thinned to imminent oblivion, he decided to retire it. But I couldn’t bear to see it go.I tried it on and felt great – like a chip off the old block. It wasn’t at all heavy and the softness extended to the buttons that were covered in matching suede material. Sure, it had a patina of London grime and smelled of Old Holborn tobacco, but I thought it was cool. I was about 13 and couldn’t afford to buy a suede jacket in a million years, so I claimed it as my own, and set about bringing it back to life, like the singing mending mice in Bagpuss.Mum and I picked out some blue fabric, which was incongruously bright, in hindsight. After she relined the jacket for me (a woman of many talents, she papered that wall behind me in the picture, too) it felt as good as new, if not better. What had been part of my dad’s identity became mine and I wore it until sections of suede had broken free and started dangling skankily into my tea – at which point it was unquestionably deceased.I had a habit of nicking Dad’s clothes, and they often became some of my favourite adolescent looks. The threadbare checked shirt I used as a nightshirt (and decorated by sewing tiny novelty buttons all over it – toadstools, pineapples and what-have-you); the suit jacket I took when I got a bit older, and wore as a coat (it wasn’t very warm, but who cares when you’re a teenager?); the pleated, heavy-wool kilt from when he was a small boy that I wore as a miniskirt.I was a big fan of badges and a Playboy bunny one was my favourite at the time. With its combination of cute rabbit and the naughty, sexy, adult world it signified – plus the sense that I was being subversive by wearing it – that bunny caught my imagination as womanhood loomedThe hat must be mentioned, too. Everyone was wearing bowler hats or wide-brimmed variations in the 80s – Bananarama, Debbie Gibson, Madonna – but my hat inspiration came fromthe 1985 cover of Face magazine with Felix Howardwho, at 13, had starred inMadonna’s Open Your Heartvideo. For this iconic shot, he was styled in a black felt hat with a strip of newsprint reading “Killer” tucked into the ribbon.Also of note: the Chinese lucky dolls I’d hung from the top button of the jacket. These were from one of my all-time favourite childhood shops, the late Neal Street East emporium in London’s Covent Garden. It was full of treasures from China, Japan and beyond – and had a “basement bazaar” of thrillingly affordable nicknacks, such as the fan you can just about see on the wall behind me in the hat picture. It was a magical place and everything I ever bought there felt magical, too.Explore more on these topicsFashionMy favourite childhood outfitYoung peoplefeaturesShareReuse this content"

I’ve simplified the original by making it entirely from pea pods and parmesan rind, not least to show just how much flavour and colour they hold.Pea pod risottoFlavourful pea pods are blanched, then shocked in iced water to stop them cooking further and so preserve their chlorophyll (to save on ice to make the iced water, simply put a bowl of water in the freezer for an hour). They are then blended into a vivid, emerald-green puree.Both pea pods and parmesan rinds are naturally rich in glutamates, which provide the deep umami flavours that make this risotto so satisfying and complex despite using what would typically be discarded. Use a jug blender, if you have one, but a Vitamix, Thermomix or a Nutribullet-style blender will also work brilliantly to create a very fine puree. In fact, you may not even need to pass the puree through a sieve, though it’s still important to check for any fibres and sieve if need be.Most risotto recipes call for the rice to be stirred frequently to create a creamy consistency. Here, however, I’ve adopted Blanc’s efficient method by just leaving it to tick over on a very low heat before stirring vigorously at the end to break down the starch and create that creamy consistency we know and love.Serves4350g empty pea pods, ideally organic (save the peas for another recipe)100g parsley stalks, or spinach2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra to serve1 small white onion, peeled and finely diced1 garlic clove, peeled200g risotto rice(carnaroli or arborio)125ml white wine, or 1 tbsp white-wine vinegar40g parmesan rindJuice and finely grated zest of 1/4 organic unwaxed lemon25g butter20g parmesan shavings, to serveSea salt andblack pepperBlanch the pea pods and parsley stalks in a large pan of boiling water for just a minute, until they turn a vivid green. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a bowl filled with 350ml iced water and stir so the greens cool rapidly. Blend in a high-speed blender for a minute, until very smooth, then pass through a sieve if need be.Put the oil in a saucepan set over a low-medium heat, then add the diced onion and saute, stirring, for a couple of minutes. Add the whole garlic clove and rice, and cook, stirring, for two minutes, until the rice turns translucent. Pour in the wine and bring to a boil so it reduces. Stir in the parmesan rind and 500ml of the pureed pea pod liquid, bring up to a very gentle simmer, then turn down the heat to very low and cover with a lid. Leave to simmer gently for 20 minutes, checking every now and then to make sure the risotto isn’t boiling.Take off the heat, stir vigorously for five minutes to help break down the starch and create a creamy consistency, then stir in another 200ml of the pureed pea pod liquid, the lemon zest and juice and the butter, and season to taste.Serve in shallow bowls topped with parmesan shavings and a drizzle of olive oil.Explore more on these topicsRiceWaste notFoodFood wasteItalian food and drinkCheeseVegetablesSummer food and drinkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Food styling assistant: Sophie Ellwood.FoodRomy Gill’s recipes for Indian-style tomatoesEnjoy Indian home cooking at its best with this vibrant curry and comforting spiced riceRomy GillWed 27 Aug 2025 01.00 EDTShareTomatoes are a staple in Indian cooking, bringing vibrant colour, tanginess, a little sweetness and depth to countless recipes. Their sheer versatility often helps bring a dish together, while their natural acidity balances spices beautifully. Firm ripe tomatoes are essential in cooking, because they hold their texture better, release only just enough juice without turning mushy, and also provide that crucial balance between sweet and sour. Today’s two dishes are prime examples of Indian home cooking and comfort food at its best.Tamatar rice (rice cooked in tomatoes and spices; pictured top)Serve this with any dal or meat curry, though if you ask me it’s best eaten by itself with yoghurt or a tomato raita – to make the latter, mix a small chopped, deseeded tomato into 150g yoghurt, then stir in 25ml milk, a small handful of chopped fresh coriander, a teaspoon of toasted crushed cumin seeds and season to taste.Prep10 minSoak15 minCook30 minServes4250g basmati rice250g firm ripe tomatoes(about 2 large ones), roughly chopped6 tsp melted ghee20g cashew nuts1 tsp black mustard seeds1 tsp cumin seeds10-12 fresh curry leaves2 banana shallots, peeled and thinly sliced1tsp saltJuice of ½ lemonYoghurt, to serveSoak the rice in cold water for 15 minutes, then drain and rinse thoroughly under the cold tap.Put the chopped tomatoes in a blender and blitz smooth. Once pureed, strain through a sieve into a bowl, reserving the liquid for later.Put two teaspoons of melted ghee in a wide pan or wok for which you have a lid, put it on a low heat, then lightly toast the cashew nuts – lift them out as soon as they start to change colour. Add the remaining four teaspoons of melted ghee to the same pan, tip in the mustard and cumin seeds and, as soon as they start to pop, stir in the curry leaves and thinly sliced shallots. Turn up the heat to high and cook, stirring, for three minutes.Pour in the reserved tomato liquid, cook over a medium heat for four minutes, then add the salt and rice, and stir to combine. Pour in 450ml just-boiled water, bring everything to a boil, then turn down the heat and stir in the toasted cashew nuts and lemon juice. Cover the pan with a lid and leave to cook for eight minutes – the idea is to let the rice absorb all the liquid, so don’t touch it.After eight minutes, take the pan off the heat and leave to rest for at least five minutes before serving.Tamatar ki sabzi(tomato curry)View image in fullscreenPrep10 minCook35 minServes3-430ml rapeseed oil1 tsp cumin seeds1 tsp black mustard seeds10-12 fresh curry leaves1 medium onion, peeled and thinly sliced20g piece fresh ginger, peeled and cut into julienne strips3 green finger chillies, slit open lengthways475g firm ripe tomatoes, cut into quarters1 tsp sea salt1 tsp ground turmeric1 tsp sambar powder1 tsp brown sugar15g chopped fresh coriander leaves, to garnishRice or bread, to servePut the oil in a deep, wide saucepan on a medium heat, and add the cumin and mustard seeds.

She was promised a refund when her house was sold but, instead, received a bill for a similar sum she reluctantly paid. She complained, and the company decided that it, in fact, owed her £2,650. The promised cheque never came. Instead, she received a bill for £3,000.That’s where I came in. British Gas blamed a faulty meter for the confusion and said an agent had erroneously recorded the £2,650 credit. It refunded her an unexplained £1,201 and declared the account clear.Unconvinced, Porter took her case to the energy ombudsman, which ordered British Gas to recalculate five years’ of bills. The result? A year after the house was sold, that £2,650 popped up again, as a debt.Back I went to British Gas. And, guess what? It says an agent recorded the £2,650 debt in error while implementing the ombudsman recommendations – just as agent error had apparently conjured a £2,650 credit months earlier. British Gas now says the account is actually in credit to the tune of £424.If you are a British Gas customer, beware. Based on this case, its arithmetic would seemingly shame a primary school class.We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

Now, nine years later, and at 97 years old, she has reached the sought-after milestone of 250 runs. Chambers first took part after her daughter Michele registered her for the free, weekly timed events that take place in parks and public spaces in several countries around the globe.Chambers was previously a keen climber but after having surgery on her leg in 2016 doctors signed her off from climbing that summer.“I was incensed, saying ‘what do you mean?’,” Chambers said. She recalled her daughter saying “Mum, sure you could do a wee parkrun instead” and daring her to complete one before her birthday.“I had never heard of parkrun,” Chambers said. But she went along to her first run, in Belfast’s Ormeau Park, on 17 September that year – and she hasn’t looked back since.“My daughter registered me and got me my card and off I went to Ormeau Park,” she said. “I discovered parkrun by accident.”The green 250 T-shirt is one of the more difficult to bag, behind only the 500 and 1,000.Photograph: Ormeau parkrunShe completed her first 5km parkrun in 44 minutes and 54 seconds, and the next week she ran her personal best of 38:09. “It’s taken me almost nine years to get to 250,” Chambers said. “I have now completed 251 parkruns, and 245 of those have been at Ormeau Park.”She added: “What I like is that the friends I made. Every week I look forward to seeing all the people I know and catching up on their news.”There is little that will put Chambers off from attending her weekly run. She doesn’t normally run on Christmas Day – when parkrunhas a special event– as she spends the day at her niece’s house and there is no parkrun nearby, but she does always try to run the second special event of the year, on New Year’s Day.Even a heart procedure last month didn’t make her miss more than one run. “I do parkrun in all weathers,” she said. “I look forward to it every week. I only miss it if I am physically unable to do it. I had a heart procedure on Wednesday 16 July, I missed Saturday the 19th – the surgeon told me not to do it. I did, however, show up on 26 July, much to everyone’s surprise.“I had four parkruns to do to reach my 250th and I was determined to do it. My surgeon even showed up for my 250th – I think he can be very pleased with his work. I told him I wanted to put it to the test.“I did parkrun in 1 hour 6 minutes the week before the TAVI [transcatheter aortic valve implantation] – for my 250th I did it in 51 minutes, so I think he did a good job.”Chambers with the volunteer team.Photograph: Ormeau parkrunParkrun was founded byPaul Sinton-Hewittin October 2004, with just 13 runners and five volunteers for the first event in west London’s Bushy Park. Now there are more than 11 million registered parkrunners, and more than 450,000 people across 23 countries take part each weekend.Runners can buy a different coloured T-shirt for each milestone they achieve – with the green 250 shirt one of the more difficult to bag, behind only 500 and 1,000 runs.Parkrun at 20: how a gentle jog turned into a 5km Saturday morning obsessionRead moreWhen Chambers ran her 250th parkrun this month she had a crowd of supporters to cheer her over the finish line – as well as the local television news.“I’m thankful that I’ve done it and very pleased for all my friends in Ormeau Park who have helped me and that it’s put Ormeau parkrun on the map,” she said.“The support on the day was unbelievable. It was a glorious day – a gift from God. I did a great time which I was very pleased with and having all the support at the finish line was very special. It was a bit overwhelming having the TV cameras there, but the publicity was great for Ormeau parkrun.”Chambers doesn’t plan to stop here – she has set herself a new target of running 300 parkruns.“I would also love to be the first centenarian to do parkun at Ormeau,” she said. “For me it’s very important to have a goal and something to work towards.”Explore more on these topicsRunningBelfastNorthern IrelandOlder peoplefeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.But dresses can be good to me. That said, a lot of plus-size designs on the market in the high street are, well, quite crap. They are frumpy, ill-considered and not fashion-forward or exciting. Which is why this summer I was inspired to launch acollaboration with dress brand Rixo– a 16-piece collection of size-inclusive dresses that evoke a sense of freedom, the idea that with one swish of a great dress over your head you are handled, you are stylish, you are good.Before I designed my own collection (I have found myself living inmy floral designfor most of the summer), I had to think carefully about what plus-size shoppers need from a dress.View image in fullscreenLinen tunic dress, £69.99,zara.comI know that dresses can be generous in silhouette, so I am not always restricted to those few that are actually in my size. Searching for kaftan-style or even just oversized options, and going into stores to examine the shape has proved fruitful in my search for dresses that may not have been specifically made for me. For example, a lot of high street retailers have a high summer rotation of oversized dresses, including atie-dye tunic from Zara(£69.99) that I recently tried on in store and, to my surprise, walked away with.Online is a more perilous battlefield to navigate unless you have already had a touchpoint with the brand and know how their sizing tends to run.I know that The Frankie Shop is typically generous in its sizing, so I didn’t hesitate to add itsoversized shirt dress(€245, or about £210) to my basket. Understanding brands, and knowing that sizing isn’t always as straightforward as what you see on the hangar, led me to find a dress that became my “made it” moment. It is a butter-yellow satin, floor-lengthBernadette dress(£815), which was a size 14 and still fit my size 24 body.I never deemed myself, or my dress, worthy of standing in front of a wall of photographers on the red carpetThe Fashion Awards are the biggest red-carpet fashion event of the year in the UK and, by virtue of my job as a fashion journalist, I have been fortunate enough to attend many times. However, in previous years I have never walked the red carpet. I never deemed myself, or my dress, worthy of standing in front of a wall of photographers and holding my head and shoulders as if I belong with all of the other brilliantly and beautifully dressed attendees.That was until last December, when I wore that yellow Bernadette dress and felt – perhaps for the first time in my life – that I was as worthy of being in that heralded space as everyone else. The dress was cut so that a sliver of shoulder was on show, it drifted over my shape rather than clinging to it, it nipped in under my arm so that it still gave me an element of shape, and the colour received more compliments that I could count.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Powder is essential in keeping wet formulations such as foundation on your face, and if the appearance of skin ageing bothers you, then the right pressed powder is your ally.Shine and greasiness in the wrong places, such as on the chin, nose and under the eyes, ismoreageing and a quality powder will not only mattify it, but can simultaneously reflect light and impart greater smoothness.I’ve recently been enjoying Saie’s newSlip Tint Undetectable Baked Setting Powder(£26). This is a sensible choice if you’ve previously been scared off, since it adds the sheerest veil of airy, very natural-looking powder and takes the edge off shine rather than removing it completely. If you’ve previously loved (the, in my opinion, perfect)MAC Mineralise Skinfinish Naturalpowder (£34) but are keen to lose the talc, this gives that same flattering eggshell finish without it.Charlotte Tilbury’s Airbrush Flawless Finish sets foundation almost as well as loose powder, controls shine and reboots hours-old makeup in secondsFor dull complexions, I would enthusiastically recommend Fenty’s new brightening shades of their classic pressed powder.Bright Fix Instant Brightening+ Blurring Powder(£27) delivers on its name. I particularly love the lavender shade to wake up my undereyes, but as is standard with Fenty, the shade range caters for everyone. It’s incredibly finely textured, noticeably blurs pores, and held up in the recent spell of hot, humid weather.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

What appears white in the pan is colourless on the skin, making it suitable for any skin tone (although there are two additional, deeper shades). Elf’sPerfect Finish HD Powderis a decent dupe for just £7.Explore more on these topicsSkincareSali Hughes on beautyBeautyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Within the iridescent marvel that is Croatia’s Blue Cave, four boats holding about a dozen people each have an allotted 10 minutes before we motor back out again so that the next batch of visitors can float in. About 1,500 people a day visit this beautiful grotto on the island of Biševo, the biggest attraction within the Vis archipelago, two hours and 20 minutes south of Split by ferry. After paying the €24 entrance fee, I’m left underwhelmed by this maritime conveyor belt. At least the 45-minute foot ferry from Komiža, on the archipelago’s main island of Vis, to Biševo’s Mezoporat Bay, the launch point for boats to the Blue Cave, is only €4.Croatia map for VisMany of the other cave visitors are on one of the countless speedboat tours departing from all over Dalmatia and crowding into Mezoporat Bay before whizzing off elsewhere. I’m staying on Vis itself to take a longer, slower, more satisfying look at the island, where I spent a night three years ago and which I’ve been hankering to revisit ever since. Despite the overwhelming popularity of the nearby Blue Cave and its speedboat tours, plus the boost in tourism on Vis after much of Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again was filmed here in 2017, I know there’s a quieter, mellower side to the island, and it doesn’t take long to find it.‘Actively relaxing’ I find is a fitting description for this breakIn sleepy Rukavac on Vis’s south-eastern coast, British couple Xania and Craig Wear welcome me into one of their four guest rooms in the large stone house they renovated after moving here 20 years ago. The former PE teachers run WearActive, offering yoga, kayaking, paddleboarding and cycling in Rukavac. On their seven-day, “relaxingly active” holidays you can do as much or as little as you like. “Actively relaxing”, I find, is just as fitting a description.View image in fullscreenKayaking just off Stiniva beach, Vis.Photograph: Mary NovakovichXania serves delicious plant-based food on the large shaded terrace, which has views of the sea. But before breakfast we walk to the flat rocks of Bili Bok beach, where Craig puts me through my yoga paces. Clean, salty air fills my lungs as I lunge and stretch by the Adriatic. I follow this with a swim at nearby Srebrna beach. Late afternoons are spent lazing on the pebbles at Tepluš beach, 10 minutes’ walk from the house. I could get used to this.The next morning, my hosts suggest kayaking 6 miles (10km) from Rukavac to Stiniva Bay, Vis’s most famous beach and a place of peerless beauty. Two giant limestone cliffs curve round the pebbly beach, nearly meeting in the middle. From the top of the hill behind the cliffs there’s a steep, rocky footpath to the beach, but it’s infinitely more enjoyable to paddle on to the beach, where only kayaks, paddleboards and small rubber dinghies are allowed. Craig is on a paddleboard, while Xania and I share a kayak, and my husband has a single kayak. At 8.30am there are only about four people here, and we have a blissful, peaceful swim.View image in fullscreenThe Blue Cave of Biševo is beautiful but can be very busy with visitors.Photograph: Mary NovakovichCraig knows I’ve always wanted to learn how to paddleboard, so on the way back to Rukavac we stop in tranquil Ruda bay. After some expert instruction, I’m on the board and paddling away, initial jitters soothed by the hypnotic motion of gliding on the water. Now I see what all the fuss is about.Vis town comes alive at night, the restaurant terraces along the Venetian harbour buzzing in the summer warmthAway from the water, my husband and I get to know Vis more intimately, crisscrossing its vineyard-covered interior and heading up and down its winding mountain roads. Its capital, Vis town, dozes during the day, most restaurants closing while the sailing crowd cruises. It comes alive at night, the restaurant terraces along the Venetian harbour buzzing in the summertime warmth.Smaller Komiža is the place for lunch, with everything from cheap pizzerias to smart restaurants. Near Gusarica beach we find Konoba Jastožera, a restaurant built on stilts over the water, where lobster pots hold the restaurant’s speciality.It’s only when I hear the soundtrack to the Mamma Mia! films that I realise we’ve stumbled on one of the sequel’s filming locations, and instantly expect high prices and low quality. Wrong on both counts. As long as we don’t order lobster, it’s one of the most affordable restaurants we’ve seen so far, with two courses for €25. It’s not all money, money, money here.View image in fullscreenMary Novakovich in Konoba Jastožera.Photograph: Adam BatterbeeFor an island that was off limits to foreigners until 1989, when the Yugoslav army base here closed down, Vis seems to be taking its time in developing its tourism (Biševo’sBlue Cave aside). I spot a few military tours about, taking people to the huge network of tunnels and bunkers left behind by the army. I get a fascinating glimpse into 1944 Vis when I hike up to the collection of caves at the foot of Mount Hum, where future Yugoslav president Tito and his fellow partisans hid from the Nazis.Then there’s the growth of active holiday companies bringing more people to the island, which Xania sees as a positive thing, even if it means more competition. “Vis would then become an island that’s known for its adventure holidays,” she says. “And then you have more people coming to do that kind of tourism.” I nod in agreement. The island’s natural rhythm – slow, unhurried – is one to be savoured, not raced through.The trip was provided byWearActive, whichoffers seven-night active holidays from€1,590pp,including breakfast, four lunches, three dinners with wine, five days of activities, transfers to restaurants on four evenings and from Vistown ferry terminalExplore more on these topicsCroatia holidaysEurope holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But the bafflement and hostility I faced in the 1980s taught me to live on my own termsAdele ParksWed 27 Aug 2025 01.55 EDTShareI became a pescatarian when I was 16. At the time, I wasn’t aware of any other vegetarians or pescatarians in my family or peer group, but it seemed like an obvious choice for me.It was the 1980s and BSE – the spread of which would soon result ina national crisis– had recently appeared in the UK. Emerging evidence and research indicated that eating meat could be detrimental to a person’s health. That, added to the horrific smell that wafted from the nearby tannery in Yarm and an abattoir just up the road in Stockton-on-Tees, was enough to convince me that eschewing meat was the right call.It seems hard to imagine now, but my decision was regarded as extremely strange by my loved ones, a definite sign of audacious insurrection. Nonconformity wasn’t something that was especially valued in a lower-middle-class family in the north-east of England at that time. People would have generally preferred it if I did as I was told. As a result of my unfathomable dietary preferences, mealtimes garnered a groundhog-day quality, peppered with endless, slightly hostile questions about what I would or wouldn’t eat.View image in fullscreen‘Nonconformity wasn’t something that was especially valued’ … Adele Parks(left)with her mother and sister.Photograph: Courtesy of Adele Parks“You’ll eat a bit of turkey at Christmas, surely?” family would say.“No, I won’t,” I’d reply, again.“But turkeyisChristmas.”“Turkey is poultry.”“This seems like a fad. Put some meat on her plate.”And so it went. But even when I was served meat, I ate around it. I stuck to my guns.To me, taking a decision on what I wanted to put in my body seemed perfectly reasonable and straightforward; after all, it wasmybody. I was often asked if the self-denial was an effort to stay slim or to draw attention to myself.Foodpreferences are a privilege of the well fed, so some felt I was moralising – it seemed that my personal choices made others feel worse about themselves. I remember friends discussing whether my assumed limitations in the kitchen would lower my social attractiveness (“a man needs a wife who can cook meat”). Many thought that I must be that thing dreaded in women: politically aware. And they were right – I was.View image in fullscreen‘Many thought I must be politically aware. I was.’ 16-year-old Parks(centre)at school.Photograph: Courtesy of Adele ParksMy pescatarianism led to greater activism as I became informed about bigger health and environmental issues. I was soon found protesting outside Boots, waving a placard that insisted on “beauty without cruelty”. I read Linda McCartney’s 1984 interview in the Vegetarian Society magazine and started to listen to the Beatles just because George Harrison and Paul McCartney were committed vegetarians. I was not trying to threaten anyone’s moral identity. I just didn’t like the idea of eating flesh.I politely declined meat at least twice a day for years. Once my parents accepted I was serious, I still had to convince boyfriends’ mothers, waiting staff at restaurants, almost everyone I met in Italy (where I spent a year in my early 20s) and absolutely everyone I met in Botswana (where I spent two years in my mid-20s). When I went to university, in 1987, the vegetarians were made to sit at another table (“for ease”); clearly, we were seen as oddities. When I suffered a slipped disc, one doctor went so far as to suggest the cause was the lack of meat in my diet.A moment that changed me: I slipped in the shower, realised I was exhausted – and transformed my lifeRead moreLooking back, I see how I was shaped by these challenges. I had grown up as a people-pleaser, excessively obedient, seeking approval from others as a measure of my own self-worth. I feigned interest in other people’s hobbies, I overcommitted my time and I took the blame for things that weren’t my responsibility in a constant quest to keep the peace and make everyone feel cheerful. Developing a preference for how I wanted to live my life and protect my body taught me to establish boundaries. Often, it was simply swapping a lamb chop for a slice of halloumi, but it was great practice for the big stuff. Every time breakfast, lunch and dinner were served, I got better at saying no – something women, in particular, are not necessarily very good at.Learning to articulate what made me feel comfortable, valued and happy gave me confidence that lasted well into my adult life. Over the years, I have had the courage to ask for promotions and pay rises; I have asked people to leave and to stay; I have apologised and asked for apologies; I have found seats at many tables. Speaking up and speaking out for what you believe in takes practice.Being a pescatarian is now considered uncontroversial. Even so, I am grateful for the baptism of fire that I endured as an “oddball”. These days, I celebrate any level of eccentricity or even obtuseness – it keeps people interested and interesting.Our Beautiful Messby Adele Parks is published on 28 August (HarperCollins, £16.99).

Now she cares for four grandchildren aloneSupported byAbout this contentOkba Mohammad andTom LevittWed 27 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 27 Aug 2025 05.34 EDTShareEach morning Zahia leaves the home she shares with her four grandchildren in the Algerian coastal city of Bou Ismaïl and heads to her job cleaning a primary school. For the past year she has lived alone with them, after the death of both her daughters ripped their family apart.Their tragic story started on 5 October 2021, when Zahia’s youngest daughter, Feryal, then 23, decided to leave Algeria with her husband, Aissa, and their son Amjad, aged 2. At the time neither had jobs – although Aissa worked occasionally as a horseback tour guide – but they were both determined to improve their lives.Thousands of people every year attempt to cross the western Mediterranean Sea from Algeria to the south of Spain,according to Frontex, the EU’s border agency, paying anything between €900 (£775) and €20,000 to smugglers. Feryal and her family were believed to have paid about €5,000.Zahia says she had not realised Feryal’s journey toEuropewould be clandestine: “She told me she would leave using official documents and that the organiser of the trip would get her a passport. She never told me she was going to migrate illegally.”The plan had been to reach the Balearic Islands, off the eastern coast ofSpain. Feryal and her family were said to have known the smuggler organising the trip beforehand.I have no father or brother. I took on the responsibility aloneSihamZahia’s other daughter, Siham, then aged 27, received a photo from Feryal just before the boat departed. Feryal appears calm, sitting next to Amjad, who is wearing a blue coat and a woollen hat with a smiling bear on the front. Feryal is shown making a peace sign with her right hand.It was the last message the family received from them.Hours turned into days with no communication from Feryal, her husband or the seven other passengers on the boat. Eventually, a few days after the boat’s departure, messages began circulating on Facebook about a small migrant boat that had set off from northern Algeria towards Spain’s Balearic Islands and then disappeared without a trace. With no word from Feryal, Zahia and Siham feared the worst.There is little help available to families searching for missing loved ones who have travelled illegally, and Zahia and Siham did not have the financial means to obtain a visa and travel to Spain themselves. Algeria intervenes only if the body of an Algerian citizen is found; it then coordinates with Spain through its embassy to complete the identity procedures and covers the costs of returning the body.So instead, Siham began contacting dozens of activists, rights organisations and other Algerians living in Spain she believed might have information about her sister’s fate. She also posted videos on social media recounting the story, hoping to find a lead.They sent my sister’s photos to some families … just to exploit their pain and ask for moneyZahiaIn one video, reviewed by the Guardian, she says: “I have no father or brother. I took on the responsibility alone and didn’t want to involve my mother so she wouldn’t be burdened. If I had a father or brother, I would have just stayed home crying and left this responsibility to them.”On 21 October 2021, a Spanish local newspaper, Diario de Ibiza, reported that the Guardia Civil had found two decomposing bodies – one of a woman and the other of a man (later identified as the boat’s captain) – on a beach in Formentera, another Balearic island. According to a burial permit document seen by the Guardian, the two bodies were then interred on 9 November 2021, in the island’s municipal cemetery.With news of the missing boat spreading on social media, others suspected that one of the bodies might belong to Feryal, though there was no official confirmation. Zahia says Siham was contacted by someone who used to work for an organisation in Spain that helps locate missing migrants and identifying bodies, often through unofficial channels. She says they were told the NGO had information about a body and were asked to provide official documents to assist in the identification process.There are reports of families beingasked to pay hundreds of euros in exchange for informationabout what has happened to missing loved ones. NGOs, forensic pathologists and funeral home workers in Spain have been investigated for circulating and leaking sensitive images and information related to the bodies of migrants found along the Spanish coasts, allegedly for financial gain.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They’ve put us in a miserable stateZahiaSiham was later sent photos taken during her sister’s autopsy via Facebook messenger by the former NGO employee, which Zahia says left her daughter in a state of shock and emotional collapse. In a live broadcast on Facebook, a recording of which has been seen by the Guardian, Siham says her sister’s photos were used to exploit and scam other families of missing migrants.“They sent my sister’s photos to some families, making them believe the body belonged to their children, just to exploit their pain and ask for money in exchange for more information or for returning the body to the country of origin,” she says. Zahia says Siham told her she was asked for money, but never told her how much or if she paid it.After Siham’s descriptions matched the body that was found, the authorities got involved and ordered a DNA test, but it took several months to confirm her identity and then even longer for the repatriation process to be completed. The body was finally transferred to Algeria in March 2023.Zahia says Siham struggled badly after seeing the photos of her dead sister. Then, last year she took her own life, leaving behind her four children. “My daughter couldn’t bear those pictures,” she says.‘It was steer or they would kill me’: why Sudanese war refugees are filling prisons in GreeceRead more“She was already suffering from anxiety, but after what she saw she fell into deep depression. She didn’t tell me everything to avoid worrying me. She kept all her pain to herself.”As she tries to fill the void left by the loss of her two daughters and grandson, Zahia blames the people smugglers and those who exploit relatives searching for loved ones who go missing on dangerous sea crossings. “I sit alone and talk to myself,” she says. “They’ve put us in a miserable state.”The bodies of Aissa and Amjad, her son-in-law and grandson, have still not been found, and Zahia says she wishes she had taken on the burden of seeking justice for what happened to them all while Siham was still alive.“She [Siham] had intended to file complaints against all the people who manipulated her during her search for her sister,” Zahia says. “But she died before she could do so.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentRights and freedomMigration and developmentAlgeriaAfricaMiddle East and north AfricaMigrationSpainfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The mayor of Kisarazu, Yoshikuni Watanabe, pointed out that the city had hosted Nigerian athletes during the delayed 2020 Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games, adding that project would not lead to “accepting migrants”.He added: “Our initiatives will involve cooperating in the education of young people based on discipline through baseball and softball, and it’s not a programme that will lead to relocation or immigration.”The mayor of Sanjo, Ryo Takizawa, said in a statement: “It is not true that the city has requested to accept migrants or immigrants from Ghana, and the city has no plans to make such a request in the future.”Some attributed the outcry to an article in the Tanzania Times that carried the headline “Japan dedicates Nagai city to Tanzania.”The word “dedicates” was translated on social media into the Japanese wordsasageru, which could be interpreted to mean the town was being “sacrificed” to Tanzania, according to the Asahi Shimbun newspaper.Nigeria’s government also appeared to have misunderstood the details of the programme, describing Kisarazu as a location open to “Nigerians willing to live and work [in Japan]”. Japan’s government, it added, would create a special visa category for skilled people from the West African country.Japan’s foreign ministry has reportedly asked the Nigerian government to issue a correction, while JICA – a government agency –saidseveral media organisations had published articles containing “inaccuracies and potentially misleading information”.“JICA is currently urging the relevant local media and the African government [sic] to promptly correct the inaccuracies contained in their coverage,” it said on its website.Explore more on these topicsJapanAsia PacificAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Days later, Ontario premier Doug Ford – a blunt-spoken, burly populist with a knack for politics – entered a high-stakes meeting with other premiers and the prime minister wearing the hat. The move kicked off a frenzy of online orders and created a rare moment of political consensus.But Ford’s love of the hat cost the province nearly C$300,000 (US$218,000),according to reporting by the Trillium.According to newly disclosed public election finance filings, the Progressive Conservative party of Ontario paid C$278,910.71 to Jackpine Dynamic Branding, the company producing the viral hats, during the province’s election campaign period last spring.The party also transferred more than 600 hats – bought for C$23.19 each before the election – to the campaign, according to the Trillium.Liam Mooney, who runs Jackpine Dynamic Branding with his fiancée, Emma Cochrane,previously told the Guardianthe couple wanted a simple but firm message with the hat. “It was a small act of patriotism to respond to these big threats and this big bluster,” Mooney said.Their online store, which sold red and navy blue headwear featuring the wording “Strong and Free” and “Canada Is Not For Sale”, as well as “Fort et libre” and “Le Canada n’est pas à vendre”, was quickly overwhelmed with traffic. The couple ended up selling tens of thousands of the hats, which they eventually managed to produce in Canada after weeks of manufacturing headaches.Ford and campaign surrogates also wore the hat often during the provincial election in February, in which his government won in a rare, third majority mandate.Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

He said items that could be useful for the investigation, including two firearms, engravings and prints, had been seized.Citing investigators, the Argentinian newspaperLa Nación reportedthat the missing work, Portrait of a Lady by the Italian master Giuseppe Ghislandi, was no longer hanging in the living room of the house, where it had been in the estate agency photo.In its place was “a generously dimensioned tapestry of a landscape and horses” that, marks on the wall suggested, had recently replaced another work. “Where we found a tapestry, not long ago, there was something else,” a police officer told the paper.Portrait of a Lady belonged to Jacques Goudstikker, a leading Jewish art dealer in Amsterdam who died in May 1940 fleeing the invading Nazis. His collection of more than 1,100 artworks, many of them classed as old masters, was acquired for a tiny fraction of its value by Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring.TheDutch newspaper AD reported this weekthat it had uncovered documents suggesting that by the end of war the Ghislandi portrait had fallen into the hands – it is not clear how – of Friedrich Kadgien, a high-ranking Nazi official, SS member and one-time senior aide to Göring.The painting is thought to have accompanied Kadgien when he fled theNetherlandsin 1946, first to Switzerland, then Brazil and finally to Argentina. It is believed to have remained in his family’s possession after he died in Buenos Aires in 1978.Authorities have said one of Kadgien’s two daughters, who owns the Mar del Plata house, and her partner were the subjects of a judicial investigation after complaints filed by the federal police, Interpol and Argentina’s customs agency, Arca.The complaints were prompted by the publication of the AD articles, which the Dutch paper said followed an investigation during which it several times contacted the late Nazi’s daughters, who declined to talk about their father or the artwork.The paper eventually sent a reporter to Argentina, who discovered that a house owned by one of the daughters was for sale and spotted the potentially incriminating photograph of the portrait on the website of the estate agency handling the property.AD reported on Wednesdaythat the property had since been taken off the site by the agency, Robles Casas & Campos, which confirmed it was no longer on their books, and that Kadgien’s daughter had changed her user name on social media.La Nación reported that it understood no charges had yet been brought, but that if the couple were found to have had the work in their possession, they could face possible prosecution for concealing criminal property, with no statute of limitations applying because the alleged offence took place in wartime.Explore more on these topicsArgentinaNetherlandsArtNazismHeritagePaintingAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Ifthe policyis applied precisely as outlined, a host of books face being purged, including George Orwell’s 1984 due to passages in the text that discuss sexual intercourse and rape.Academics and researchers who examine censorship say the policy specifically targets books that affirm LGBTQ+ identities – which they say is the goal of rightwing parents’ groups.“They’d been working on the government for months to get them to do this,” said James Turk, the director of the Centre for Free Expression at Toronto Metropolitan University.Turk says he and his colleagues are following more than 25 socially conservative groups acrossCanadathat have similar mandates.Turk pointed to the Miramichi Freedom Warriors, a New Brunswick-based group, and Concerned Citizens Canada based in Manitoba, which have also been demanding that books that positively represent queer communities be removed from public libraries and schools.Many of these groups emerged as anti-vax groups during the Covid-19 pandemic, and then used social media to widen their scope of causes, including strict parental oversight.“It’s a major initiative right now that grows out of this notion that ‘our kids are our property’,” he said. “It’s a very backward-looking, reactionary way of understanding how children learn.”Lobbying by some parents’ groups has also prompted Alberta to institute “opt-in” sex education in fall 2024, instead of “opt-out”, which means parents must now actively sign their children up for those classes.In June, following advocating from the Alberta Parents’ Union, Alberta also introduced new rules that require all presentations focussing on gender identity and sexuality to be vetted by the provincial government.The two groups in Alberta, Action4Canada and Parents for Choice in Education (PCE), have taken credit for precipitating the province’s book ban. The Alberta government confirmed it had metwith PCE to hear theirviews, as reported bythe Investigative Journalism Foundation (IFJ), a Canadian non-profit newsroom.The Alberta government defines “explicit sexual content”in its policyas “content containing a detailed and clear depiction of a sexual act”. Students from kindergarten to grade 12 cannot access any “content” in a school library that meets this definition.PCE sent an email to its followers after the ban came down, thanking them for their efforts in contacting government officials about “graphic” books, as reported by the IFJ.Alberta has not provided a list of specific books to remove, saying instead that schools must apply their new policy and toss books that do not fit their standards.‘Rapid acceleration’ in US school book censorship leads to 2,500 bans in a yearRead moreBut the province has identified four graphic novels as examples of books to be culled: Gender Queer by Maia Kobabe, Fun Home by Alison Bechdel, Blankets by Craig Thompson and Flamer by Mike Curato.All four are globally acclaimed coming-of-age stories about teenage life and young adulthood. Three of the books focus on stories that represent the LGBTQ+ community. PCE and Action4Canada also claim they alerted Alberta about the four books.Alberta’s education minister Demetrios Nicolaides and other provincial officials have insisted they are not looking to erase queer stories from school shelves, but Action4Canada and PCE openly express disdain for the LGBTQ+ community.Ira Wells, an associate professor of literature at the University of Toronto and author of the book On Book Banning, said Alberta’s ban will likely cause a purge of marginalized voices from school libraries.“What we are seeing in Alberta is as extreme as we’ve seen in the southern United States and other centers of book banning,” he said.Wells warned that the move set a dangerous precedent for the province and could have wider effects on the country.Canada’s provinces and territories each manage their own education system. But Wells argued that the issue of book bans was so concerning that the country’s federal government should consider intervention, through an order that would ensure book selection is based on an educator’s professional training and not on personal beliefs.“Anti-book banning legislation is something that the federal Liberals should absolutely be exploring,” he said.Explore more on these topicsCanadaCensorshipLGBTQ+ rightsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

For 2.6 million of them, the additional heating added 3C to their heat exposure.In many cases, this was deadly. The researchers estimated that warming due to deforestation accounted for 28,330 annual deaths over that 20-year period. More than half were in south-east Asia, owing to the larger populations in areas with heat vulnerability. About a third were in tropical Africa, and the remainder in Central and South America.The study waspublished on Wednesday in the journal Nature Climate Change. Researchers in Brazil, Ghana and the UK compared non-accident mortality rates and temperatures in areas affected by tropical land clearance.Previous studies have shownhow cutting and burning trees causes long-term localised warming, but the new paper is the first to calculate the ensuing death toll.Prof Dominick Spracklenof the University of Leeds said the message was that “deforestation kills”. He expected many people would be shocked by the findings because the local dangers of deforestation were often lost in the global climate debate and the market-focused expansion of agricultural frontiers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

If the draft passes it will go into effect in October. The measure will not, however, carry penalties for those who exceed the two-hour daily limit.I’ve been waging war on my phone addiction | Rhik SamadderRead moreThe draft urges primary school students – those aged six to 12 – and younger children to avoid usingsmartphonesor tablets after 9pm, while teenagers and adults are encouraged to put their devices to one side after 10pm.The proposal, the first of its kind to apply to all residents, triggered a backlash on social media. Some users condemned it as an attack on individual freedom, while other said the time limit was simply unworkable.“I understand their intention, but the two-hour limit is impossible,” one user wrote on X. Another said: “Two hours isn’t even enough to read a book or watch a movie (on my smartphone).”In response, Koki said the time limit was not mandatory and acknowledged that smartphones were “useful and indispensable in daily life”. But he added: “I hope it will be an opportunity for families to think about and discuss the time they spend on smartphones as well as the time of day the devices are used.”The proposal has not gone down well with many of Toyoake’s 69,000 residents. Officials received 83 phone calls and 44 emails over a four-day period after the announcement, 80% of which were critical of the measure, according to the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper.Officials say the proposal was designed to address behavioural problems associated with excessive smartphone use, including truancy among children who can’t bear to leave their phones at home when they go to school.Koki said there was also anecdotal evidence that adults in the town were glued to their phones when they should be sleeping or spending time with their families.Toyoake’s initiative reflects growing concern about thenegative health impact, especially on children, of hours spent hunched over smartphones and tablets.In 2020, a region in westernJapanpassed an ordinance – also non-binding – limiting children to an hour a day of gaming during the week, rising to 90 minutes during the school holidays.Young Japanese spend an average of just over five hours a day online on weekdays, according to a survey released this year by the Children and Families Agency.Explore more on these topicsJapanAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Police had been executing a search warrant on Tuesday in relation to alleged sexual offending by Freeman, who was previously known as Desmond Filby, when the shooting occurred.Court records paint a picture of a man with a deep distrust of police and embrace of conspiracies: he once, for example, attempted to arrest a magistrate during a bizarre court hearing in Wangaratta.Last year, a Victorian county court judge found Freeman was guilty of using a mobile phone while driving and refusing to provide a saliva sample to police in September 2020 on the Great Alpine Road.In idyllic Porepunkah, a manhunt this huge feels ‘surreal’ – and the alleged killer could be anywhereRead moreBut he lodged a legal battle after the judge cancelled Freeman’s licence and disqualified him from obtaining a licence for a period of two years from 8 April 2024.A supreme court judgment published last November, after Freeman sought a judicial review of the county court decision, showed he tried to argue that the police radar device used to detect speed may have been influenced by power lines and transformers, or microwave transmissions, in the area.During cross-examination in the county court, he accused an officer of arranging for one of her colleagues to cancel Freeman’s firearms licence after the incident, which she denied. Freeman said: “How was it fair that when I haven’t arrested you for the multitude of crimes you have committed and I haven’t exposed you or other police to the multitude of crimes they have committed, for the logs in their eyes, how is it fair that you go after me for the splinter in mine?”He told the court he had a difficult childhood but had overcome disadvantage, though “had a history of unpleasant encounters with police officers”.Freeman claimed that during the police intercept – which started while he was on the way to a local fish and chip shop with his children in the car, and ended when he sped down a dirt road in Porepunkah – he was acting in self-defence.“I felt threatened and preyed upon … Even the sight of a cop or a cop car … it’s like an Auschwitz survivor seeing a Nazi soldier,” he said.“What’s worse than a swastika is the inverted pentagram, the satanic symbol that they wear and they behave like it as well.”Freeman claimed he had been subject to past unlawful conduct by officers as part of a “a lifetime of bullying and predatorial (sic) behaviour by police”.A video of the interaction with officers, referred to in the supreme court judgment, showed Freeman calling the officers terrorists, and saying “out here with guns, guns, terrorising my kids again. I’ve been to court 15 times because of you corrupt scum. You corrupt filth.”Justice James Gorton noted in his supreme court judgment that Freeman, who represented himself in the proceedings, and in the county court, felt “genuinely aggrieved” at losing his licence for two years, as it would “seriously interfere with his and his family’s life” and lead to “hardship”.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailFreeman is believed to have lived in the region for most of his life. He claimed on social media to have taken a photo the nearby Kiewa Valley in about 2004 that was used in tourism brochures in the area.Other family members also live in the state north-east.In 2019, Freeman helped fundraise for his younger brother James Filby after the shock death of his wife. She died from a bacterial infection that also left James in intensive care.James Filby posted on Facebook this week: “My prayers are with the fallen police and their grieving familes(sic).”In 2021, Freeman was arrested while at a protest outside Myrtleford court, over 2019 allegations of sexual-related offending, according to a Border Mail article.In footage of him being taken into custody, the then 51-year-old man identified himself as Des Freeman when asked his name, the Border Mail reported.The Myrtleford court protest was in response to aprivate prosecutionbrought against the then Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, accusing him of treason during Covid. But it was struck out by the magistrate because charge information had not been provided to Andrews.View image in fullscreenPolice patrolling the area near the shooting in the high country town of Porepunkah on Tuesday evening.Photograph: Simon Dallinger/EPAIn a videoposted on Facebookin December 2021, Freeman told magistrate Peter Dunn that he was under arrest for “aiding and abetting” and “perverting the course of justice”.“You are now in my custody and under arrest. You are not free to leave,” he said.Freeman has a history of association with pseudolaw and “sovereign citizen” ideas and influencers.“Sovereign citizens” or pseudolaw adherents often have a range of conspiratorial beliefs, including that a country’s laws have become illegitimate and the government is corrupted, leading them to reject its authority.On a pseudolaw podcast in 2019, Freeman called himself a photographer from north-east Victoria. He described his battle with “newcomers from Melbourne” who he claimed had closed off a road “that’s been used for 120 years”.He described his day in court, which included telling the magistrate he had “no rightful authority” and instructing police to arrest him.“The police officers were informed that it’s their duty to make the arrest, which they refused to do. No surprises there,” he said.“The law is the law. No one is above it. I don’t care if it’s the queen or the pope or ‘Scumo’ or whoever it is.”A 2018 episode of A Current Affair featured Freeman and his family complaining about a neighbourly dispute at their then Mount Buffalo property.The report said Freeman and his family complained about their neighbour’s dirt bike stunts, loud chainsaws and verbal abuse five years before the broadcast.Freeman described the dispute as “full-out war” and said his neighbours were the “instigators” of it.The ACA report said Freeman and his family were leaving the property where they had lived for six years.Explore more on these topicsPorepunkah shootingVictoriaAustralian police and policingnewsShareReuse this content"

The government spokesperson, Sophie Primas, said after the meeting that Macron fully supported Bayrou and the government was in a “fighting spirit”.Bayrou, a centrist and Macron ally, announced this week he would call a confidence vote for 8 September, seeking parliament’s support for his austerity measures to cut public spending and reduce public debt.Opposition parties have said they will vote to oust Bayrou, who polls show is the least popular prime minister since 1958. Bayrou’s proposals for a €44bn budget squeeze, which includescrapping two public holidaysand freezing most welfare spending, are widely unpopular.Primas said Macron believed there should be neither “denial nor catastrophising” about the state of France’s public finances and that opposition parties must show “responsibility”.She said the government’s budget proposals were necessary. “France is a solid country with solid economics … but we must take the reins of our destiny,” Primas said. Describing Macron’s remarks to cabinet, she said: “It’s a strong signal that we are sending to the financial markets that we want to have a France that is even more solid.”Macron is still dealing with the fallout from a political crisis that began last summer when he called a surprise snap election that resulted in a deadlocked parliament with no absolute majority. Since then, the national assembly has been split between the left, the far right and the centre.Michel Barnier,the rightwing prime minister chosen by Macron last September to try to bring together the fragmented parliament, was ousted after only three months in office when his budget plans were rejected and the government was toppled.Bayrou followed Barnier and he will have been in office for only nine months if the government is toppled once again. Even if Macron replaces him swiftly, it is not certain that a new appointee would be able to secure consensus on a budget for next year in the bitterly divided parliament.Calls were growing on Wednesday for Macron to call another snap parliamentary election less than 18 months after the last. Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally favours a new election as it hopes it can gain seats.France on the brink: how a budget deficit became a political crisisRead moreA large majority of French people want parliament dissolved for another election, according to polls by Ifop, Elabe and Toluna Harris Interactive. Macron said earlier this month that he wanted to avoid dissolving parliament again but he has also suggested he could not rule out the option.Macron’s former prime minister Édouard Philippe, who now heads the centre-right Horizons party, said that if a stalemate persisted and no other government could come up with a budget, an election seemed inevitable.Gabriel Attal, another former prime minister and the head of Macron’s centrist Renaissance party, said he did not think a new election would necessarily bring stability or clarity.Bayrou warned that France’s debt is unsustainable, particularly as interest rate rises push up the cost of borrowing. After years of overspending, France is on notice to control its public deficit and cut its debt, as required under EU rules. All political parties agree that public debt is an issue but they disagree on how to tackle it.Explore more on these topicsFranceEmmanuel MacronEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

He said: “It is important that we gain insight into this so that our populations – this applies to both Greenland andDenmark– can see what it is we are up against.”Rasmussen said officials would make it “very clear to the US” that a foreign influence campaign in Greenland with Washington’s backing would be contrary to all international rules.Mette Frederiksen, the Danish prime minister, said she was taking the claims “very seriously”. “Any interference in internal affairs in the kingdom of Denmark, and Greenlandic democracy, is unacceptable,” she said. “I note that the Americans do not clearly deny that the situation is as DR presents today. And that is of course serious.”Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to acquire Greenland since taking office, driving tensions between Denmark and the US to unprecedented levels. The former Danish colony is part of the kingdom of Denmark, although it is now autonomous with the exception of its foreign and security policy, which remains controlled by Copenhagen.In an unusual move aimed at highlighting the gravity of the situation, Denmark’s highest-ranking civil servant will attend the meeting.The charge d’affaires was summoned in the absence of Trump’s incoming US ambassador, Ken Howery, who is yet to be confirmed by the US Senate. A date for his arrival in Copenhagen is yet to be confirmed but Howery, a co-founder of PayPal, a friend of Elon Musk and the ambassador to Sweden under Trump’s first administration, is expected in the Danish capital in October.View image in fullscreenDenmark’s foreign minister, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, has said any alleged US influence would be ‘totally unacceptable’.Photograph: Kin Cheung/APAccording to DR, the three unnamed American men are accused of attempting to permeate Greenlandic society to weaken relations with Denmark through what it described as “infiltration” and “influence operations”.One of them, who it is claimed compiled a list of Trump supporters, has reportedly appeared in public with Trump numerous times. He is also accused of creating a list of those who do not support the US president and of advising on issues that “put Denmark in a bad light” in the US media. These allegedly include theforced removals of Greenlandic children by Danish authoritiesand a separate scandal over theforced contraception of Greenlandic women, for which Frederiksen issued a long-awaited apology on Wednesday.The two other American men whose activities have reportedly caused Danish authorities concern previously worked under Trump and are known to travel frequently to Greenland from the US.A government source said that with the population of the capital, Nuuk, beingabout 20,000 people, “it’s pretty obvious who is walking around and doing this”.A number of high-profile Americans with political connections and business people have flocked to Nuuk since Trump’s election.In January, Donald Trump Jr was joined by the political activistCharlie Kirk, who cofounded the pro-Trump conservative organisation Turning Point USA. In March, before Greenland’s election, Drew Horn, a member of the first Trump administration and the chief executive of the Washington DC-based mineral investment company GreenMet, said there were “tens of billions” of dollars ready to be invested in Greenland immediately. Tom Dans, Trump’s former Arctic commissioner and an investor, described Greenland as “really frontier in the true sense of things”. None of the men have been implicated by Danish authorities.Greenland’s foreign minister, Vivian Motzfeldt, said she did not know of any “shady activities” taking place in Greenland. She told newspaper Sermitsiaq: “There is nothing new in what I have been presented with, beyond what we already know.”Aaja Chemnitz, a member of the Danish parliament for the Greenlandic party Inuit Ataqatigiit (IA), said the latest reports reflected a US effort. “We have seen before that they have been trying to influence the people of Greenland, but of course also Greenlandic politicians. This is just a continuation of that.”But she said she had not seen evidence of an impact on people’s views. “I don’t think it is working. The Greenlandic people have been an object for people trying to influence us over many many years.”She said life for the Greenlandic people continued to be worse than for Danish people living in the Danish kingdom, especially as a result of underinvestment and the historic injustices against Inuit people.Trump says he ‘doesn’t rule out’ using military force to control GreenlandRead moreAlthough she said the US remained “on the table” when it came to investment in Greenland, the impact of Trump’s words about acquiring Greenland – by force if required – had had an impact. Greenland, she said, was “much more sceptical towards the US than before”.Pele Broberg, who leads Greenland’s opposition party, Naleraq, which is seen as the most Trump-friendly of Greenland’s political parties, said he was baffled by the diplomatic clash, saying the claims were based on previously reported events from January.“Should we never talk to anybody but Denmark? We don’t get what the big issue is right now,” he said.He denied claims that the White House was trying to influence opinions in Nuuk, adding: “But what I do know is that the Danish, French and German governments are trying to influence the Greenlandic government every single day … It’s just business as usual.”This is thesecond timeDenmark has summoned the US charge d’affaires since Trump assumed office. The first such meeting, in May, was over reports that US intelligence agencies had been ordered to increase espionage in Greenland.The US Department of State did not immediately respond to a request for comment.A representative of the US government said in a statement to DR: “Individual US citizens may have interests in Greenland. The US government does not control or direct the actions of private citizens.”They said the US “values the relationships with the governments of Greenland and Denmark,” adding: “The president, vice-president and secretary of state have all been clear: the United States respects the right of the Greenlandic people to determine their own future.”Speaking on behalf of Horn, Sabrina Katz, vice-president of operations and Arctic lead at GreenMet, said: “Drew is no longer affiliated with the Trump administration and is now fully focused on private sector work. Our efforts in Greenland are solely driven by commercialisation objectives and are not connected to any government role or agenda.”Dans is understood to deny any part in the reported influence operationQuick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

But, Aronstein said, Ukrainian drone attacks on refineries and storage facilities had made this the most severe crisis in recent years.“The attacks are massive, coordinated, and repeated; they come in waves, and the refineries simply do not have time to repair the damage caused by the previous attack before the next one occurs,” Aronstein added.Refinery in flamesWholesale prices for A-95 – Russia’s most widely used petrol – hit record highs last week, climbing to about 82,300 roubles (£760) a tonne, almost 54% higher than in January.At first glance, fuel shortages inside Russia jar with its status as one of the world’s top energy exporters, shipping crude to markets such as China and India.Trump this weekimposed sweeping tariffs on US imports from India, citing Delhi’s reliance on discounted Russian oil.But crude oil has to be processed into petrol and diesel, and much of Russia’s refining system is geared toward export products.Analysts say one of the industry’s main weaknesses is the lack of any real buffer in domestic petrol production. Output only just covers domestic demand, leaving the system highly vulnerable to disruption.Refinery in flamesAnd while drone strikes usually disable only part of a refinery’s capacity, sanctions have cut off Russia from western technology, making repairs slower and more complicated.Even before the most recent attacks, Moscow had moved to tighten its gasoline export ban in July to cope with a surge in domestic demand.Russian social media has beenfloodedwith clips of frustrated motorists complaining about shortages and soaring prices.“We’ve been waiting for hours, and no one knows if we’ll even get our cars filled,” said one man as he drove past a snaking queue in the far-eastern city of Dalnegorsk.Strike on Russian refineryThe Motorist’s Den, a popular Russian car channel on Telegram, quipped that “it feels like petrol will soon be poured into champagne glasses rather than fuel tanks”.Another widely shared post joked: “Filling up now is almost like a trip to a boutique: you set out for a litre, and return with an empty wallet and the philosophical thought that maybe walking isn’t so bad after all.”The current crisis has been sharpened by timing: August is traditionally the toughest month for Russia’s fuel market, when the harvest season pushes up demand, refineries undergo scheduled maintenance and exporters chase higher seasonal prices abroad.What is usually a predictable squeeze has this year tipped into a full-blown shortage after Ukrainian drones knocked out key facilities.Crimea, annexed by Russia in 2014, has been among the hardest hit. The peninsula, which usually hosts a flood of Russian holidaymakers in the summer, has had its airports shut because of the drone threat, forcing visitors on to roads and piling further pressure on already scarce supplies. Officials have urged calm.Ukraine war briefing: Russian troops inside Dnipropetrovsk region, Ukraine saysRead moreThe Kremlin-appointed head of Crimea asked residents “to understand the restrictions on 95-octane petrol”, warning that the situation could drag on for another month. “All possible measures to stabilise prices are now being taken both by the federal government and by us,” he said.While the shortages are disruptive and politically awkward for the Kremlin, analysts caution they are unlikely for now to derail Russia’s war effort or heavy industry.Video of cars queuingMuch of the country’s industrial fleet and military equipment runs on diesel rather than petrol, and Russia still has a surplus of it.“There is still a long way to go before the transport, agriculture and industrial sectors – or, most importantly, the army – experience any significant fuel shortages,” said Sergey Vakulenko, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, who previously worked at the Russian oil major Gazprom.Still, with Ukraine showing no sign of slowing its drone campaign, economists say that the fuel squeeze could drag on well into the winter.If the worst comes to the worst, Vakulenko said, authorities could be forced to resort to gasoline rationing.Explore more on these topicsRussiaUkraineEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The Axios website reported that Trump’s son-in-law and former senior adviser, Jared Kushner, was also in attendance.Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, said the US was putting together a “very comprehensive” plan for “the next day” after the war.In an interview with Fox News on Tuesday, Witkoff said he believed the war inGazacould be ended in the next four months. “We’re going to settle this one way or another, certainly before the end of this year,” he said.Asked about a plan for governing postwar Gaza, Witkoff said: “It’s a very comprehensive plan we’re putting together on the next day that I think many people are going to … see how robust it is and how well meaning it is, and it reflects President Trump’s humanitarian motives here.”No details have been disclosed about the proposals under discussion.The White House said: “President Trump has been clear that he wants the war to end, and he wants peace and prosperity for everyone in the region.”Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, also met his Israeli counterpart, Gideon Sa’ar, in Washington.The meetings came after Pope Leo XIV demanded that Israel stop its “collective punishment” of the population in the besieged territory.Ten Palestinians, including two children, have died from starvation in the last 24 hours,health authorities in Gaza said on Wednesday.At least 313 people have died from hunger, including 119 children, since the war in Gaza began and Israel intensified its siege on the Palestinian territory.The pope said: “I beg for a permanent ceasefire to be reached, the safe entry of humanitarian aid to be facilitated and humanitarian law to be fully respected.”He referred to international law and its “prohibition of collective punishment, indiscriminate use of force and the forced displacement of the population”.The pope was interrupted twice by applause as he called for a ceasefire in front of thousands of people in the Vatican auditorium.Israeli tanks rolled into the outskirts of Gaza City overnight, destroying houses and displacing residents.

Last week a UN-backed monitoring bodyconfirmedthat Gaza was in the throes of famine and warned that without more aid, increasing numbers of people would lose access to food.As humanitarian conditions continued to worsen, the pope called for a suspension of hostilities.“I beg for a permanent ceasefire to be reached, the safe entry of humanitarian aid to be facilitated and humanitarian law to be fully respected,” Leo said. He referred to international law and its “prohibition of collective punishment, indiscriminate use of force and the forced displacement of the population”.The pope was interrupted twice by applause as he called for a ceasefire in front of thousands of people in the Vatican auditorium.The head of Save the Children said on Wednesday that starving children inGazawere now so weak that they did not even cry. “When there is not enough food, children become acutely malnourished, and then they die slowly and painfully. This, in simple terms, is what famine is,” Inger Ashing told the UN security council in New York.She went on to describe what happens when children die of hunger, as the body first consumes its own fat and then consumes its own muscles and vital organs. “Yet our clinics are almost silent. Now, children do not have the strength to speak or even cry out in agony. They lie there, emaciated, quite literally wasting away,” Ashing said.She added: “Everyone in this room has a legal and moral responsibility to act to stop this atrocity.”Despite calls for a ceasefire, Israeli tanks rolled into the outskirts of Gaza City overnight, destroying houses and displacing residents. Tanks shelled the Ebad al-Rahman neighbourhood on the northern outskirts of the city, causing injuries, as Israeli forces sought to clear a path into Gaza City before an expected offensive.Israeli strikes and fire killed at least 76 people throughout Gaza in the previous 24 hours, the Gaza health authorities said.View image in fullscreenPalestinians, many of whom have already been displaced, are being forced to flee Gaza City before Israel’s expected offensive in the area.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesThe Israeli military said it was operating in Jabaliya and on the outskirts of Gaza City to “dismantle terror infrastructure sites and eliminate terrorists”. It claimed to have killed a senior Hamas member, Mahmoud al-Aswad, who was the militia’s head of intelligence for west Gaza.Israel has said it will launch itsnew offensive in Gaza Cityregardless of whether a ceasefire is reached, describing the city as Hamas’s last stronghold in the strip.The city has become densely populated during the war as Palestinians have fled from other areas. Gaza City now holds about 1 million people – half the population of the strip – who Israel said would be ordered to leave.Humanitarians have warned that such mass forcible displacement is not only against international law but would exacerbate already dismal humanitarian conditions in Gaza.Israel has brushed off such concerns, with an Israeli military spokesperson, Avichay Adraee, saying on Wednesday that “evacuating Gaza City is inevitable”. Israel has already asked humanitarians in the north and south of Gaza to prepare for an influx of people and said increased number of tents had been sent to the territory.“Before transitioning to the next phase in the war, I wish to confirm that there are vast empty areas in the southern strip, just as is the case in the central camps and in al-Mawasi. These areas are free of tents,” Adraee said, sharing a map of separate, discrete “empty zones” in southern Gaza.Thousands of Gaza City’s residents have already left, fleeing intensifying Israeli bombardment. However, local church leaders said they would not leave and that people sheltering in the churches were too weak and malnourished to move and displacement would be “a death sentence”.“For this reason, the clergy and nuns have decided to remain and continue to care for all those who will be in the compounds,” said the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate and the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem in a joint statement.The Israeli military has regularly published evacuation orders over the last 22 months in Gaza, and much of the population has been displaced several times. The UN said in June that more than 80% of Gaza was designated as an Israeli military zone or subject to displacement orders.Continued displacement has worsened health and sanitary conditions, leading to the spread of disease.View image in fullscreenPope Leo XIV added to calls to end the war in Gaza.Photograph: Grzegorz Gałązka/SIPA/ShutterstockIsrael has yet to respond to a US-backed ceasefire proposal thatHamas agreed to last week. The proposal is reportedly almost identical to an earlier US proposal that Israel had previously accepted.On Tuesday night an Israeli security cabinet meeting was held without discussing the ceasefire proposal. Israeli media have claimed that the government of Benjamin Netanyahu is no longer interested in a ceasefire and instead wants a comprehensive end to the war including the return of all hostages and the departure of Hamas from Gaza.Qatar, one of the mediators for ceasefire talks, issued a rare rebuke of Israel on Tuesday, saying Israel “does not want to reach an agreement”.Donald Trump was reportedly planning to lead a meeting to discuss the postwar future of Gaza at the White House on Wednesday. His special envoy, Steve Witkoff, said Washington expected the war in Gaza to be settled by the end of the year.Witkoff told Fox News on Tuesday that the White House meeting would discuss “a very comprehensive plan we’re putting together on the next day”.The US state department said the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, would meet Israel’s foreign minister, Gideon Saar, in Washington.The war in Gaza has killed at least 62,895 Palestinians over the last 22 months, according to Gaza’s health ministry. Israel launched its war after Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people on 7 October 2023.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesIsraelPope Leo XIVMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Some even described the return as criminal.Abbas Araghchi, Iran’s foreign minister, tried to quell the backlash by saying the inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) would not be visiting any of the bombed sites and that discussions about these were still to be had.He said the return had been endorsed by Iran’s supreme national security council and that the inspectors would be allowed to visit the Bushehr nuclear site to oversee refuelling only – a role required by the international nuclear non-proliferation treaty.Rafael Grossi, the head of the IAEA, confirmed on Wednesday that inspectors were “back in Iran”.Iranian MPs complained that the readmission breached the terms of a law passed in July that banned the UN watchdog’s return on a broad basis in the wake of the Israeli attack on Iran. The representative from the city of Khomeini Shahr, Mohammad Taqi Naqdali, led the protests, saying the breach was a criminal act.“We have approved a law in the assembly that any type of cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency will be suspended unless the territorial integrity, security of nuclear scientists, and inherent rights of Iran are fully ensured, and this is confirmed by the report of the Atomic Energy Organization [of Iran] and the supreme national security council,” he said.“If anyone acts against this resolution, they are guilty and will be sentenced to a sixth-degree punishment in circumstances where there is no more severe punishment.”The protests show the dilemma the government faces in balancing a surge in nationalist sentiment against the risk of further UN sanctions or even new Israeli attacks.The UK, France and Germany have long threatened to trigger a “snapback” of former sanctions when a 10-year-old nuclear deal with Iran expires on 18 October.The three preconditions Europe has set out to avoid this are: Iran identifying the whereabouts of its stockpile of highly enriched uranium; the country permitting the full return of the IAEA inspectors who left at the start of the Israeli-US bombing campaign in June; and Tehran reopening talks with the US on its future nuclear programme.If this highly limited return of UN inspectors is enough to see off the return of sanctions, it will represent a bare-minimum concession by Iran.In a draft motion to be put to the UN security council, Russia isproposing to postpone the snapbackfor a further six months, giving Europe a further option if it feels Iran is serious about reopening diplomatic talks.If the Europeans do move ahead with a return to the sanctions lifted in 2015, the move cannot be vetoed by their fellow security council members Russian and China and would risk further inflaming relations between the west and Iran.The extra sanctions would not only reimpose the right to ban suspicious Iranian shipping but also place a broader obligation on states sympathetic to Iran – such as China – to enforce the sanctions, since they have been mandated by the UN.Referring to Israel’s attacks on Iran, Grossi said: “If you want to prevent a repeat of what we saw in June, these [inspection] activities must be resumed.”He added: “We have been in continuous talks with Iran to create conditions for the return. It is not easy, because as you can imagine some in Iran see the presence of international inspectors as detrimental to their national security, and some do not. So the question is what arrangements are needed so that we can return and do our job.”Grossi is currently under police protection after threats believed to have come from Iran.Explore more on these topicsIranIran's nuclear programmeIran nuclear dealInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)United NationsMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The facilities are predominantly in the south and centre of the devastated territory.More than 90,000 outpatient consultations involving wounds were carried out at the facilities in 2024. Bombs, shelling or shooting was involved in just under half of these, MSF said.Revealed: Israeli military’s own data indicates civilian death rate of 83% in Gaza warRead moreThe death toll in the Israeli offensive launched following the Hamas raid into Israel in October 2023 has risen to more than 62,000, according to a count by the ministry of health in Gaza that is used by much of the UN, and whichthe British governmentsays is a “reasonable figure”. Of these, more than half are women or children.The proportion could be higher. Figures from a classified Israeli military intelligence database indicate five out of six Palestinians killed by Israeli forces in Gaza have been civilians, the Guardianrevealed last week.Israeli officials say they take all “feasible” precautions to avoid civilian casualties and accuse Hamas of using civilians as human shields.On Monday, Israel twicestruck Nasser hospital, the last functioning public hospital in southern Gaza, killing 20 people, among them five journalists. Witnesses said the second strike came just as media and rescue crews arrived 15 minutes after the first bombing.Statistics of people wounded during the Israeli offensive have received less attention. More than 150,000 have been injured, according to theGazahealth authorities.2:36'Never forget me': UN diplomat reads killed Gaza journalist's letter to son – video“Explosive weapons are designed to be used in open battlefields, but are increasingly being used in urban areas,” MSF said. “The makeshift shelters in which people live following frequent displacement offer almost no protection against explosive weapons, and especially their secondary effects such as blast, shrapnel, and incendiary impact.”In two MSF hospitals, nearly 60% of lower-limb wounds were related to explosive weapons, often with open injuries to bone, muscle, or skin, the organisation noted.MSF said: “Most immediate fatalities occur at the scene of impact and thus are not captured in our data. Under-reporting of both injuries and deaths could be prevalent in vulnerable populations who are often not able to move away from sites of impact such as infants, children, people with disabilities, and older adults.”The harsh conditions of life in Gaza, where much of the population live in makeshift tents, and basic infrastructure such as sanitation systems or roads has been destroyed, contribute to the burden on the few functioning health facilities in the territory.Just over half the wound care-related conditions recorded by MSF were injuries due to unsafe living conditions, domestic accidents, and road accidents.MSF said it was facing critical shortages of essential supplies and was rationing food for patients being cared for in its facilities to only one or two meals daily.“It is likely we will not be able to offer any food for our patients in the coming weeks. MSF reiterates our call for an immediate and standing ceasefire ... We urge the Israeli government to directly allow and protect impartial and unrestricted medical aid into Gaza,” the organisation said.Israeli authorities said they facilitated the entry of medical supplies to Gaza. Earlier this month a spokesperson for Cogat, the ministry of defence agency responsible for administering Israeli restrictions, told the Guardian that, since the beginning of the war, more than 45,000 tonnes of medical equipment had been transferred to the Gaza Strip by 3,000 trucks.UNagenciesanddoctorswho have worked in Gaza have said that there is a critical shortage of medical supplies, which NGOPhysicians for Human Rightshave attributed to the “limited and delayed flow of humanitarian aid permitted by Israeli authorities”.The Hamas attack into Israel which triggered the conflict killed 1,200, mostly civilians. About 250 people were abducted.Explore more on these topicsGazaMédecins Sans FrontièresMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

The US president followed through on his threat to punish one of the world’s largest economies for its purchases of discounted Russian oil.What might the impact be on India’s economy?Washington added an extra 25% duty on top of the 25% imposed earlier this month, citing India’s refusal to stop buying Russian crude and defence hardware.The duties, which are 16 percentage points higher than China, 31 points higher than most south-east Asian countries and 35 points above South Korea, have pushed US tariffs on Indian goods to levels that the investment house Nomura likened to a “trade embargo”.The US is India’s largest export market, worth $86.5bn (£64.1bn) a year. Around two-thirds of shipments are covered by the 50% tariff, threatening jobs and growth across sectors reliant on US demand.“No Indian product can stand any competitive edge under such heavy import taxes,” said Garima Kapoor of Elara Securities. Economists say the tariffs could erase up to one percentage point from India’s GDP growth this fiscal year.Unemployment is a worry. India’s overall jobless rate stood at 5.6% in June, rising to 7.1% in cities. A major drop in US exports could hit millions of workers, economists say.Where will the biggest impact be felt?India’s giant generic pharmaceuticals sector and its electronics and petroleum products are exempt from the tariffs. Aluminium, steel and copper remain at 25%, but job-heavy sectors such as textiles, jewellery, seafood and leather are squarely in the line of fire.Exports from affected sectors could plunge 70%, from $60.2bn to $18.6bn, while overall shipments to the US could fall by 43%, said Ajay Srivastava, a former Indian trade official and founder of the Global Trade Research Initiative, a Delhi-based thinktank .Companies rushed shipments ahead of the 27 August cut-off. With the tariff wall now up, exporters must either swallow costs, which will be impossible for many, or cede market share to countries such as Vietnam, Bangladesh and Mexico.India’s $179bn textiles industry includes $37.7bn in exports, with the US buying nearly $10.3bn. Mithileshwar Thakur, of the Apparel Export Promotion Council (AEPC), said Indian exporters now faced a 30% cost disadvantage compared with Bangladesh, Vietnam and Cambodia. “This is an earthquake,” said Kirit Bhansali, chair of the Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council.Even if tariffs are lowered later, competitors may have already locked in US market share. “Competitors like China, Vietnam, Mexico, Turkey, and even Pakistan, Nepal, Guatemala and Kenya stand to gain, potentially locking India out of key markets even after tariffs are rolled back,” Srivastava said.Can India wean itself off Russian oil?India, the world’s third-largest oil consumer and top buyer of Russian seaborne crude, could wean itself off Russian oil over time. But right now it views Russia as an all-weather friend – a vital defence and energy ally amid the trade turmoil that Trump has unleashed. Russia supplies about 40% of India’s oil needs, up from less than 1% before the Ukraine war. Even though discounts on Russian crude have narrowed from $20–$25 below benchmark Brent crude in 2022 to about $2.50 a barrel now, India continues buying because it secures energy reliably and relatively cheaply.A sudden reduction could also leave India vulnerable to global price swings. It will continue buying oil from wherever it gets the best deal and take measures to protect its national interest from US tariffs, India’s ambassador to Russia, Vinay Kumar, told TASS at the weekend. He also said India was able to pay for Russian oil in rupees, which meant it didn’t have to use its US currency reserves. “Now, we have a working system of trade settlement in national currencies. There is no problem now in payment for oil imports,” he said.Indian firms are calculated to have saved $17bn by buying cheaper Russian oil since the start of the war in Ukraine, but that could be dwarfed by the impact of tariffs on exporters, which could cut India’s US exports by nearly $37bn this financial year, said Srivastava.What is India doing to mitigate the impact?Narendra Modi’s government has urged Indians to buy domestically made goods. “I appeal to the citizens of our country to prioritise purchasing goods that are made in India,” the prime minister said this week. The government also plans to shake up the nationwide goods and services tax, cutting most rates to 5% or 18% to boost spending.Essentials such as food, textiles and cement will become cheaper, while luxury goods remain pricey. The government is reportedly assembling a multibillion-dollar package to free up cash for exporters.India has been seeking to diversify its markets and recently signed a free trade deal with the UK. But exporters say much more is needed. The Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) has called for a state-supported one-year moratorium on repaying the principal and interest on loans to free up cash for diversifying markets. “We are staring at a crisis which will force shutdowns and cause unemployment,” said the FIEO’s president, SC Ralha. The AEPC has appealed for interest relief to counter high borrowing costs of between 8% and 12%, compared with 3% in China and Malaysia.India is also cautiously warming up to Chinese investment as part of a strategic pivot in response to escalating US tariffs. Modi is making his first visit to China since relations went into a deep freeze following a brutal clash along their disputed border in 2020 to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit.He said this week the world was living through an era of “economic selfishness” in which countries pursue their own interests first. “No matter how high the pressure, India will continue to build its strength to withstand it,” he added. “India is ready to pay a very heavy price to protect its interests.”Explore more on these topicsIndiaTrump tariffsRussiaUS economyInternational tradeTariffsSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

This covers those who may possibly save money on purchases under £500,000 and concern those buying over this level as well.”It said a third of homes for sale were priced at more than £500,000, with London and the south-east of England in line to be most affected by a change.The website’s latest monthly snapshot of the property market showed the number of sales agreed was up by 5% year on year in July and that average prices had risen by 1.3%.One in 10 homes listed had been reduced in price, above the five-year average of 6% of homes. Homes that have been reduced are typically on the market for almost two and a half times longer than those that are priced well when they go on the market, Zoopla said.Richard Donnell, an executive director at Zoopla, said: “Sellers need to understand local market conditions when considering how to market their home, setting the right price and how quickly they would like to sell. The risk of being too ambitious on price is your home taking more than twice as long to find a buyer, or not selling at all.”Jeremy Leaf, an estate agent and former chair of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, said: “The market inevitably lost a little steam over the summer period with so many decision makers away and listings continuing to pile up.”He said agreed sales were going ahead but added: “Unfortunately, perhaps the government do not appreciate that even rumours of a new property tax can have a detrimental impact on housing market confidence and activity, which we certainly witnessed on the ground since the story broke last week.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Spending on Send provision has sky-rocketed and risks the financial sustainability of local government.“Rather than assuming that more money or more of the same is the answer, we need to ask more fundamental questions. Is a cash transfer – or a label that means young people are treated and come to see themselves as different – the right way to help them?”He added: “Across the political spectrum, and amongst a growing range of practitioners, it is now recognised that there is a level of ‘overdiagnosis’ [in] our system. We need to cut through the complexity to better understand the drivers of demand we are seeing.”Supporting kids with Send is expensive. But the cost of not doing so is far greater | Carrie GrantRead moreHunt, who is Conservative MP for Godalming and Ash, and has also served as chancellor and foreign secretary under the Conservatives, said: “As a society, we seem to have lost sight of the fundamental reality that child development is a messy and uneven process.“Our laudable desire to ensure young people are happy and well-supported is at times manifesting in excessive impulses to medicalise and diagnose the routine in a manner that can undercut grit and resilience.”The government is expected to publish a white paper later this year detailing how it plans to reform the Send system. Parents are concerned that education, health and care plans (EHCPs) – legally enforceable documents that detail a child or young person’s needs, and the support they require – will be targeted.In January this year the number of EHCPs in place rose to 638,745 – up 10.8% on the same point last year. The Policy Exchange report, Out of Control, says EHCPs should be limited to students in special schools and that school mental health support should be targeted at those “that most need it, rather than blanket offers”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is most certainly not widely accepted that there is an overdiagnosis – this is something put out by people like him to deflect from these failings.”The Department for Education was approached for comment.

I can’t do these kind of things,” Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu, an asylum seeker housed at the Bell hotel in Epping, told his trial at Colchester magistrates court on Wednesday.Speaking through an interpreter, he added: “This is anti-Christian – these are just children, innocent children.”Kebatu, who told the court he was a sports teacher in Ethiopia, denies three counts of sexual assault against two 14-year-old girls and a woman in Epping town centre on 7 and 8 July this year. He also denies one count of inciting a girl to engage in sexual activity and one count of harassment without violence.He told the court he only said “hello” to the schoolgirl and her friends in Epping town centre and nothing more because he was “worried” about his asylum case.Earlier on Wednesday, Kebatu’s adult accuser told the court via video link that she was shocked and angry after being touched on the thigh by Kebatu and witnessing him touch one of the girls on 8 July.Kebatu claimed she was drunk and had threatened to call the police if he failed to come to her house, the court heard.Questioned about why he could be seen in CCTV footage on his knees saying sorry to the woman, the defendant said: “At that time she was drunk, she was very agitated and I just wanted to calm her.”He added: “I was going to the Bell hotel at that time and I was worried about the ramifications on the other immigrants.”The woman, who exercised her right to remain anonymous, said she was “shocked” and “uncomfortable” after Kebatu touched her when she had offered to help him with his CV. She said she also saw him touching one of the girls.Molly Dyas, defending Kebatu, asked the woman if she had made up the allegations because she was angry that Kebatu was an asylum seeker.The woman replied: “I didn’t make up any allegation. I know exactly what I saw. I’ve no issue with asylum seekers … I was angry that he had touched a 14-year-old girl.”She said the defendant was “begging, pleading and apologising” when she confronted him about an alleged sexual assault on the girl.Cross-examining Kebatu, the prosecutor Stuart Cowen said: “You are a sexual predator who tried to assault one girl and one woman in exactly the same way. That is the truth, isn’t it?”Kebatu responded: “I am not such a person. I can’t do these kind of things.”The defendant said he had been living in the hotel for about a week before his arrest, after travelling through Sudan, Libya, Italy and France in order to get to the UK. He told the court he paid about €1,800 (£1,550) to board a small boat and cross the Channel.Cowen acknowledged that Kebatu’s case had “attracted quite a lot of publicity because of the defendant’s personal circumstances”.Kebatu’s arrest last month sparked weeks of violent demonstrations outside the Bell hotel. Epping Forest council has since won a court injunction to stop the hotel being used to house asylum seekers.The district judge Christopher Williams adjourned the trial until 4 September.Explore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

His non-executive role is one of a number that are understood to have been introduced to bring in expertise from outside government to help civil servants gain a strategic perspective on policy decisions.Jackson is expected to use his three-year term on the Cabinet Office board to push the government to modernise. The tech founder, who set up Octopus in 2015, has won respect in Westminster after building the energy supplier’s global reach to secure a valuation of £9bn for the company in less than a decade.He has maintained strong links in the government after previously serving as head of the pressure groupLabourList.

That is thought unlikely, given he has so far not assisted detectives with a statement and made clear he did not want to attend court to give evidence.The CPS said: “We received a file of evidence from British Transport Police in relation to an allegation of assault at St Pancras Railway station on 28 July.“Following a careful review of the evidence provided, we have concluded that our legal test for prosecution has not been met. We have informed all parties involved of the decision.”Hours after the incident at St Pancras, Robinson took a flight out of Britain, landing firstin Tenerife, Spain.Once abroad, he went from Tenerife to Faro in Portugal, flying back to the UK on 4 August, where police were waiting for him.The injured man was taken to hospital where he spent two days. Police said he was admitted “with serious injuries which are not thought to be life-threatening”.Robinson is a former leader of the extreme-right English Defence League. The far-right monitoring group Hope Not Hate describes him as the “best-known far-right extremist in Britain”.Explore more on these topicsTommy RobinsonLondonFar rightEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Brazil is also grappling with 50% tariffs on its exports to the US.Trump threatens tariffs on countries that ‘discriminate’ against US techRead moreMinisters in India argue the country has been unjustly singled out for its trade relationship withRussiaand officials caution the country will likely work more closely with Moscow and Beijing – and drift further from Washington – as a result.Most Indian exports to the US (worth $87.3bn to the US last year, according to the US trade representative) now face steep duties, although some key products including smartphones are set to be spared, for now.The action, confirmed in a notice by the US Department of Homeland Security earlier this week, prompted some economists to predict a precipitous fall in trade between the two countries.“I don’t care what India does with Russia,” Trump claimed on Truth Social, his social network, last month. “They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care.”In India,the mood has been defiant. The country’s government has refused to halt purchases of Russian oil, andNarendra Modiurged Indians to buy local.“All of us should follow the mantra of buying only ‘made in India’ goods,” the prime minister said on Tuesday, encouraging shopkeepers to display big signs promoting domestic products. “Pressure on us may increase [from the tariffs], but we will bear it,” he added.Goldman Sachs’s chief India economist, Santanu Sengupta, warned that sustained 50% levies could push gross domestic product (GDP) growth below 6%, from a forecast level of around 6.5%. Rival exporters from Turkey to Thailand, facing lower US tariffs, are already scooping up American buyers with offers of cheaper goods.About 30% of India’s exports to the US – including pharmaceuticals, electronics, raw drug materials and refined fuels – worth $27.6bn, remain duty-free. But sectors like textiles, gems and jewellery, and seafood, long reliant on the American market, face shrinking order books. “At a 50% tariff, it is very difficult to export,” Sengupta said.The effects are already visible. The Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) reported textile and apparel manufacturers in Tirupur, Delhi and Surat had already halted production due to “worsening cost competitiveness”.“Indian goods have been rendered uncompetitive compared to competitors from China, Vietnam, Cambodia, the Philippines and other south-east and south Asian countries,” said FIEO president SC Ralhan.Indian shares tumbled before the tariffs, with the benchmark BSE Sensex dropping 1%, or 849 points, to 80,876 in Mumbai on Tuesday.The US, India’s largest export market, accounts for nearly a third of shipments in key sectors such as gems and jewellery and textiles, highlighting the potential economic impact.Even if the tariff row eases,trust in future relations with Washingtonis probably the biggest casualty.“Trump has blown it. The hard work between the two countries, which inherently did not trust each other but still managed to build a solid strategic relationship, is now at risk,” said a senior Indian trade official, who requested anonymity. “It is going to take a long time to reboot, and it probably won’t happen until Trump is out.”“At a working level, the countries must cooperate, but politically, neither can afford to appear weak,” the official added.S Jaishankar, the external affairs minister, called Washington’s demand that New Delhi stop buying Russian crude “unjustified and unreasonable” and accused the west of hypocrisy, noting that Europe trades far more with Russia. To avoid the extra US tariff, India would have to replace about 42% of its oil imports.While Trump has accused India of indirectly funding Russia’s war against Ukraine through its purchases of Kremlin crude, he has not taken similar action against China, another major purchaser.He has also sought to diffuse tensions with Moscow,inviting Vladimir Putin to Alaskafor a summit earlier this month andeven mooting a trilateral meetingwith Volodymyr Zelenskyy as part of efforts to end Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.Despite tensions, Jaishankar said, US-India trade talks continue. “We are two big countries, we need to have conversations … the lines are not cut,” he said.Earlier hopes for a trade deal capping tariffs at 15% were dashed after India refused to open its agriculture market to US farm goods for fear of harming the country’s poor farmers.India has pivoted toward Russia, which it calls an “all-weather friend”, and Jaishankar travelled to Moscow recently to meet the Russian president, who is expected to visit New Delhi later this year. Modi will also make his first trip to China in seven years to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit, aiming to stabilise relations after a deadly 2020 Himalayan clash put ties into a deep freeze.“India will tiptoe toward China, but not in a full embrace. There is a trust factor from the past with China, and much history to reconcile, but the reality is that India must do business with China,” said another senior Indian official, who also asked not to be named.“The current [Trump] administration may set a record for the highest number of own goals with a top bilateral partner over such a short period of time,” said veteran South Asia analyst Michael Kugelman.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsUS economyIndiaTariffsRussianewsShareReuse this content"

The sources declined to be named as they were not authorised to discuss the information with media.ByteDance did not immediately respond to a request for comment.In the first quarter, ByteDance’s revenue rose to more than $43bn, making it the world’s No 1 social media company by sales, topping Facebook and Instagram owner Meta’s $42.3bn in that period.Both firms maintained sales growth above 20% in the second quarter, helped by robust advertising demand.ByteDance’s biannual buybacks allow employees of the privately held company to cash out some holdings and reflect a balance sheet strengthened by its expanding domestic and international businesses.It is increasingly common for late-stage private companies to conduct regular buybacks to retain and provide liquidity to employees without an exit such as an initial public offering.Many, including SpaceX and OpenAI, use external investor capital to fund these programmes. ByteDance has been an outlier, steadily using its own balance sheet in a signal of financial flexibility and healthy margins. ByteDance is also widely regarded as one of China’s artificial intelligence leaders, having invested billions of dollars in buying Nvidia chips, building AI-related infrastructure and developing its models.TikTok saleDespite outpacing Meta on revenue this year, ByteDance’s valuation remains less than a fifth of Meta’s roughly $1.9tn market capitalisation – a gap analysts attribute largely to political and regulatory risks in the US.ByteDance faces intense pressure in Washington, where lawmakers have raised national security concerns over its Chinese ownership.Congress last year passed a law requiring ByteDance to divest TikTok’s US assets by 19 January 2025 or face a nationwide ban of the app, which has 170 million US users. Donald Trump has granted TikTok multiple reprieves and last week extended the deadline for the company to divest its US assets to 17 September. He said US buyers were lined up for TikTok and the deadline could be pushed back again.Some lawmakers have criticised the delay, arguing his administration is flouting the law and ignoring national security concerns related to Chinese control over TikTok. ByteDance is profitable as a company, but TikTok’s US business has been loss-making so far, said two of the people. TikTok did not respond to a request for comment from Reuters.If the sale of TikTok’s US business is finalised, it is expected to be owned by a joint venture formed by an American investor consortium and ByteDance, which will maintain a minority stake.The consortium, which has emerged as the frontrunner, includes ByteDance’s current shareholders Susquehanna International Group, General Atlantic and KKR as well as Andreessen Horowitz, Reuters previously reported. Blackstone recently dropped out of the consortium after several delays in the deal’s timeline. The new ByteDance buyback could help bolster morale among its US-based staff, some of whom are concerned about TikTok’s uncertain future. TikTok has also been working on preparing a potential standalone app for US users, sources told Reuters earlier, though it remains unclear if any contingency plan will be finalised amid Trump’s ongoing trade talks with Beijing.Explore more on these topicsTikTokChinanewsShareReuse this content"

We said we would listen, and we have. Our new logo is going away and our ‘Old Timer’ will remain,” the companyposted on social media, referring to the picture of the overall-clad man – known as “Uncle Herschel” – leaning against a barrel that had been its calling card for decades.“At Cracker Barrel, it’s always been – and always will be – about serving up delicious food, warm welcomes, and the kind of country hospitality that feels like family. As a proud American institution, our 70,000 hardworking employees look forward to welcoming you to our table soon.”The president applauded the about-face on Tuesday evening. “Congratulations Cracker Barrel on changing your logo back to what it was. All of your fans very much appreciate it. Good luck into the future. Make lots of money and, most importantly, make your customers happy again!” Donald Trumpposted on social media.“President Trump has unmatched business instincts, and an uncanny ability to understand what the American people want. Cracker Barrel is a great American company, and they made a great decision to trust in Trump!” said press secretary Karoline Leavitt in a statement.Earlier on Tuesday, the company hadapologizedto fans who were angered with the new logo but had stood firm in its decision to make a change.“If the last few days have shown us anything, it’s how deeply people care about Cracker Barrel. We’re truly grateful for your heartfelt voices,” the company said on Monday in a statement on its website. “You’ve also shown us that we could have done a better job sharing who we are and who we’ll always be.”Cracker Barrelhad taken heat in recent dayswhen it announced a simplified logo featuring only the chain’s name. Gone was the picture of an older man in overalls leaning against a barrel. The words “Old Country Store” were also removed.The change was part of a wider rebrand, which has seen Cracker Barrel update its cluttered, antique-filled restaurants with lighter paint and modern furniture.Many on social media, including Trump and the president’s sonDonald Trump Jr, criticized the new logo, with some threatening to boycott the restaurant chain unless it was changed back.“Cracker Barrel should go back to the old logo, admit a mistake based on customer response (the ultimate Poll), and manage the company better than ever before,” Trump wrote on Tuesday on social media. “They got a Billion Dollars worth of free publicity if they play their cards right. Very tricky to do, but a great opportunity. Have a major News Conference today. Make Cracker Barrel a WINNER again.”Sensing an opening, the rival chain Steak n’ Shake called the new logo “a cheap effort to gain the approval of trend seekers”.“Heritage is what got Cracker Barrel this far, and now the CEO wants to just scrape it all away,” Steak n’ Shake said in a statement on X.Cracker Barrel shares have dropped more than 10% since the new logo was introduced on 18 August.On Monday, the Lebanon, Tennessee-based company emphasized that many things about Cracker Barrel won’t change, including the rocking chairs on its front porches as well as the vintage Americana and antiques scattered throughout its restaurants.View image in fullscreenThe old (and, now, future) Cracker Barrel Old Country Store logo.Photograph: Gregory Walton/AFP/Getty ImagesBut Cracker Barrel said it also wanted to make sure that the business stays fresh and attracted a new generation of customers.“That means showing up on new platforms and in new ways, but always with our heritage at the heart,” the company said in a statement.The company said it will also keep testing, learning and listening to its employees and customers.The chain’s brief change in logo is the most recent in a series of dustups in which an unexpected response to corporate decisions has blindsided retail chains.Anheuser-Busch’s Bud Light sales slumped after it sent a can of the beer to a transgender influencer in 2023, and this summer, an American Eagle Outfitters ad campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeneysparked backlashfor the ad’s use of the phrase “good jeans” as a play on genetics.Cracker Barrel’s shares slumped after the backlash last week, wiping out year-to-date gains, but were up 7% in extended trading on Tuesday after the company, with a market value of $1.29bn, scrapped the new logo.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

No ifs, no buts.”The foundation has reported that more than 420 companies, which employ more than 12,000 workers, haveadopted a four-day week since the pandemic, while South Cambridgeshire district council became thefirst UK council to permanently adoptthe working pattern in July.The Scottish government said it would use the findings to inform its wider public service reform programme to “support more efficient and innovative working practices”. For the time being, however, it has stopped short of rolling out a four-day week more widely.Explore more on these topicsFour-day weekScotlandWork-life balanceWork & careersnewsShareReuse this content"

I want our ground handling people to be catching people who are scamming the system.”View image in fullscreenMichael O’Leary talks to the press on 27 August 2025.Photograph: Thierry Monasse/GettyAll passengers are allowed to bring on a small bag for free, that fits under the seat, at a maximum dimension of 40x30x20cm. A second cabin bag, typically a small wheelie suitcase, of up to 55x40x20cm, can be brought on board for a fee, normally lower than the price paid to put baggage in the hold.It was reported this year that Swissport staff handling easyJet flights werepaid bonuses of £1.20 a bagto enforce similar rules at the boarding gate.O’Leary said anxiety over punitive charges for small infractions was exaggerated: “I go regularly and do boardings in Dublin, and we don’t have an issue with the small bag, this kind of mythical, oh, only the zip was outside – if the zip was the only thing that was outside the sizer, it gets on, there’s no issue.”But, he said: “I am still mystified by the number of people with rucksacks who still think they’re going to get through the fucking gate, and we won’t notice the rucksack. We will. And you will be paying for the rucksack. You’re not getting on if it doesn’t fit.”O’Leary said the number of people paying fees was going down as more brought on compliant cases. “We’re not trying to catch people out here. Most people, 99.9% of our passengers, comply with the rules. The amount of people who pay a gate bag fee is less than 0.1% of our passengers, and that’s still 200,000 passengers a year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After a quasi-farcical display that somehow pulled them back to 2-2 and penalties, Ruben Amorim’s rabble lost a fevered shootout 12-11.When Bryan Mbeumo’s kick smacked Christy Pym’s barGrimsbyentered the nirvana of a cup shock for the ages, delirious home fans invaded, and their song of “Oh when the Town go steaming in” sweetly summed up what had been administered to United.Amorim ‘sorry’ for Manchester United fans and questions players’ desireRead moreThe visitors were two down by the interval when Charles Vernam and Tyrell Warren strikes had the 20‑time English champions staring at a humiliating oblivion.However, a 75th-minute Mbeumo finish handed United a lifeline before Harry Maguire’s stooping header squeezed in at the near post took the tie to the penalty lottery.Amorim’s men lost it – so the inquest begins. The head coach and his side hobble next to the visit of Burnley on Saturday. It does not need a vivid imagination to picture United losing that one too and extending their winless run to the opening four outings of an already stricken campaign.Amorim may survive a defeat at Old Trafford – he has just overseen a £200m-plus summer spend, after all – but the bottom line is this: nine months into the job the head coach continues to put out a team that lack verve, flair, solidity and anything approaching a discernible pattern of play.After the farrago of his side’s performance Amorim stood pitchside and was regaled with jubilant verses of “you’re getting sacked in the morning”: this cruel wit sharply crystallises the state United are in – and their coach is culpable.Quick GuideCarabao Cup third-round drawShowGrimsby'sreward for toppling Manchester United in the Carabao Cup is a third-round trip to crisis clubSheffield Wednesday.Liverpoolwill hostSouthamptonand there is also a home tie for defending championsNewcastleas they welcome League OneBradford.Arsenal,Chelsea,TottenhamandManchester Citywill all also face third-tier opposition.The Gunners visitPort Vale, Enzo Maresca's side head toLincoln, Spurs hostDoncaster, while City begin their quest to win the League Cup for the first time since 2021 with a trip along the M62 to faceHuddersfield.There are all-Premier League clashes asBrentfordhostAston Villa, who met at the weekend in the league, andWolvesentertainEverton.Nottingham Forestvisit Championship sideSwanseawhileCrystal PalacehostMillwallin a repeat of last season's fiercely-contested FA Cup tie, when Jean-Philippe Mateta suffer a serious head injury.BurnleyhostCardiff,Brightontravel to League OneBarnsley,FulhamhostCambridge,WrexhamwelcomeReadingandWiganplayWycombe.Ties will be played in the weeks commencing September 15 and 22.

Of these Kobbie Mainoo, Benjamin Sesko, André Onana, Harry Maguire and Manuel Ugarte were the headline acts given first starts and who failed to quieten a rambunctious crowd all night.United began and ended under the pump. A Vernam corner from the left threatened to arrow over the hapless Onana before the goalkeeper scurried back and tipped over. Dave Artell drilled his unit to tap the ball about then up tempo and stampede at United. Or rush to a man in red livery to squeeze them – precisely how they took the lead.Under pressure Amad Diallo miscontrolled, tried to retrieve the ball, he and Ugarte bumped into each other, pratfalled, and Grimsby took over. A quick right-left Darragh Burns diagonal put Vernam in, and he beat Onana at his near post: the Cameroonian should have saved so here was the latest howler from a United man between the sticks.Now, the Mariners’ second. A short Vernam corner on the left was returned and the No 30 sliced in a delivery. Onana rose above a thicket of players and, farcically, missed a clearing punch, the ball dropped to Warren, who rolled home against the club he left in 2019.Cue a Grimsby support in party mode, their taunts a cutting “can we play you every week”, and “Premier League/you’re having a laugh”. They had a point. Grimsby were in cruise control, toying with their shellshocked guest. When Sesko managed a header you were reminded that United were allowed to attack – too.View image in fullscreenCharles Vernam shows his delight after giving Grimsby the lead.Photograph: Chris Radburn/ReutersAt the interval Amorim hooked Tyler Fredericson, Patrick Dorgu and Ugarte for Matthijs De Ligt, Mbuemo and Bruno Fernandes. Calling for the cavalry showed how dire United were.In bucketing rain Grimsby poured forward and a Burns effort went for a corner as, again, United’s noses were bloodied. The downpour, becoming biblical, made the surface greasy – perfect for a side on a mission to pen themselves into football immortality.United were in a catch-22 of needing to press to pull a goal back while not daring to leave space for Artell’s ruthless unit to prosper again. Example: Grimsby moved along their right, swapped passes, and lifted a high-ball in – the omnipotent Vernam leaped and bounced a header into the ground which Onana clutched.Quick GuideBrighton and Fulham march onShowStefanos Tzimas claimed a debut double as Brighton cruised into the third round if the Carabao Cup with a crushing 6-0 victory at Oxford.The Greece Under-21 striker, who cost £20.8m from the German club Nurnberg, struck twice in seven second-half minutes before fellow newcomer Tommy Watson sealed the Seagulls' first win of the season.First-half finishes from Olivier Boscagli – another debutant – and the midfielder Brajan Gruda set Albion on course for a resounding victory at the Kassam Stadium before Diego Gomez increased the advantage on the hour.Raul Jimenez ensuredFulhamavoided a shock as they dispatched the Championship sideBristol City2-0.The Mexico striker Jimenez pressured George Tanner into scoring an early own goal and then grabbed the second as the Cottagers cruised through.Marco Silva, the Fulham manager, had been stung by City in the competition before, when they knocked his top-flight Watford side out with a 3-2 result at the same stage eight years ago, but Jimenez ensured there would be no repeat.PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Amorim’s substitutions had failed to engineer any dominance and when Diallo was flagged offside his manager dipped his head in anguish – a regular sensation for him.Amorim, despairing, sent for a favourite player, Mason Mount, who replaced Ayden Heaven. Yet when Mbeumo struck United still seemed a universe away from levelling. But they do possess spirit, as personified by Maguire whose intervention took them to penalties and the heartbreak of defeat this way.Amorim was not spotted on the touchline witnessing the kicks – as odd as the decision to have his new £70m leader of the attack, Sesko, as taker No 10.

The advantage has swung between them, at times from one race to the next, in the first part of the season, often with little to choose between the two. Neither driver has been able to definitively claim the upper hand entering the championship run-in. It looks set to remain a nip-and-tuck fight to the wire.Piastri came out on top in the early phases, his consistency and calm control edging out Norris, who made errors as he pushed a car that is not quite to his liking.McLarenhave been admirably determined to give both drivers an equal shot, insisting they will not employ team orders, a policy which can be expected to continue until (and if) one of their drivers claims an unassailable advantage.Unusually for teammates in a title fight, Piastri’s and Norris’s relationship has remained friendly, with some hard but fair racing andonly one coming together in Canada, for which Norris held up his hands. However, as the stakes rise, it should be an enthralling affair.View image in fullscreenLando Norris and Oscar Piastri share the podium in Hungary.Photograph: Guido De Bortoli/LAT ImagesOnwards and upwards: Hamilton and FerrariBefore the summer break, Lewis Hamilton cut an unusually disconsolate figure as the struggle of his debut season at Ferrari was writ large. The seven-time champion, perhaps like no other driver, needed a holiday. He qualified in 12th in Budapest, describing theperformance as “absolutely useless”and stating that Ferrari should perhaps find another driver. He was similarly unimpressed with taking 12th in the race, after which he even cast doubt on his future in the sport.“There is a lot going on in the background that is not great,” he said. When asked if he would return after the break, he gave a strangely equivocal response. “Hopefully I will be back, yeah.”Clearly it has been a long slog for Hamilton as he adjusts to his new team: a run of 16 races without a podium, including his last two for Mercedes, represents the longest streak of his career. That stat will not matter a jot to the British driver who is focused on the big picture atFerrari. Realistically, there was no doubt Hamilton would be back: he is a fighter, and not one to throw in the towel with a whimper. He posted “no days off” on social media during the break, which suggests he is energised once more.The key for him and Ferrari over the final 10 races is to build confidence, bond better with his engineers, find a groove with the team and, crucially, cultivate a sense they are moving forward with everyone in sync. The car will not radically improve now with all focus on the 2026 model but Hamilton and Ferrari can at least build a rhythm and momentum that will be vital if they are to compete next season.View image in fullscreenLewis Hamilton finished 12th at the Hungarian Grand Prix, a demoralising blow for the seven-time champion.Photograph: Rudy Carezzevoli/Getty ImagesNew-look Red Bull must convince VerstappenMax Verstappen finally committedto staying with Red Bulljust before the summer break in Hungary, ending a season-long debate about his future. It came shortly after the team had sacked their team principal Christian Horner after the British Grand Prix. That was the end of an almost two-year power struggle at Red Bull, in favour of the Verstappen camp.Nonetheless, while the defending world champion will surely lose his title, the remaining races are still important. Stability and performance have been the Dutchman’s demands all season, especially given the turmoil atRed Bulland a car that has been hard to handle. He will expect improvements under his new boss Laurent Mekies looking ahead to the regulations of 2026, which will be key given that his role in 2027 remains undecided.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Red Bull need to demonstrate that the new era will be a success and how Mekies helms his period in charge will be crucial.How Verstappen handles it will be fascinating, the team having taken a bold gamble in sacking Horner, not least given the same figures who ensured his removal might be a tad nervous given the images of Verstappen aboard the Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff’s yacht during the summer break.View image in fullscreenMax Verstappen focuses ahead of the race at Imola.Photograph: Mark Thompson/Getty ImagesEvery point counts in fight to finaleMcLaren have a car which is the class of the field this season and will not be caught, with 11 wins from 14 meetings, but behind them the convergence in form has led to a fine competition.Ferrari, whose recent upgrades were a good step, and Mercedes are in a tight battle for second place. With theScuderiajust 24 points ahead, and after Charles Leclerc’s pole in Hungary, they believe they might yet grab a win, while George Russell already has one for Mercedes. Both teams can expect to battle it out to the end, while behind them Red Bull, 42 points down on Mercedes, will seek another victory in Verstappen’s hands, with two already this year.However, the midfield represents an even more fascinating prospect. Williams are fifth-placed as the best of the rest, a testament to the remarkable turnaround under their team principal James Vowles. They have not finished fifth since 2017 and to see off the likes of Aston Martin and Alpine, who have far greater resources, would be a coup.Every place in the championship comes with more prize money, so every race is vital. Just 35 points cover Williams to Haas in ninth place, a relatively small margin that could turn over several meetings. The contest will be every bit as fiercely fought and unforgiving as the race for the title.Explore more on these topicsFormula One 2025Formula OneMotor sportOscar PiastriLando NorrisMax VerstappenLewis HamiltonanalysisShareReuse this content"

The 39-year-old is the No 11‑ranked golfer in the world and eighth among Americans, but ultimately he decided it would be either unreasonable or unnecessary to ­perform two jobs at once.“If I felt I needed to play in this team to help the team win, I would have,” Bradley said. “The decision was made a while ago that I wasn’t playing. The last 48 hours we had the team set. We weren’t scrambling at all.“This was a really tough decision. I would say there was a point this year where I was playing, a while ago, and all these guys stepped up in a major way and played their way on to this team. That’s something that I’m really proud of and something that I really wanted.“I grew up wanting to play Ryder Cups. I grew up wanting to fight alongside these guys. It broke my heart not to play. It really did. You work for ever to make these teams but ultimately I was chosen to do a job. I was chosen to be the captain of this team.“My ultimate goal to start this thing was to be the best captain that I could be. I really want to leave this process knowing I did everything I could as a captain and I was ­worried if I played, I might not be able to do that.”It is ­understood that Bradley had turned to one of his assistants, Jim Furyk, to produce a comprehensive ­dossier on all that Ryder Cup captaincy involved.

He denied that ­comments from European players past or present influenced his thought process. Rory McIlroy had decreed publicly that it is not possible to be a playing captain, with the Northern Irishman’s sentiment ­delivered even more strongly by Sam Torrance, Nick Faldo and Ian Woosnam.“I just am not worried at all about what they do or say,” Bradley said. “I care about our team. I’m not quite sure how he [McIlroy] would know if it’s not possible. No one has ever done it really. I said through this process I wish I could call Arnold Palmer and get his advice. The simple fact is the Ryder Cup is a completely different animal than it was in the 60s.“They can make comments on what I can and cannot do. No one would have known. I was confident that if I did need to play, I had incre­dible vice-captains that I could lean on, an incredible team I could lean on. But I’ve said through this process over and over and over, I was going to do what I thought was best for the team, and this was the decision that I thought was best.”Donald Trump, who is expected to attend the Ryder Cup, had called for Bradley to play. “That was really surreal,” Bradley said. “When you see stuff like that, you start to wonder how you get to this point in your life but I was deeply, deeply honoured to hear him say that.”View image in fullscreenCameron Young, who has been picked as a wildcard, finished behind Keegan Bradley in the US points list.Photograph: Andrew J Clark/ISI Photos/Getty ImagesBradley admitted Maverick McNealy, who finished 10th in the US points standings, was entitled to feel sore at not being selected. “Please be angry with me and make the next team,” he said to McNealy.Bradley would not reveal how many players he contacted to inform them they would not play at ­Bethpage. Jordan Spieth and Brooks Koepka are the most high-profile absentees from the US team but due to poor form there was never any viable concept of either being picked.Luke Donald, Europe’s captain, will name his wildcards on Monday.

Until you think about it ...David LengelRob Manfred is taking aim at the old league structure, renewing the battle between the National Pastime’s traditional and reform factionsWed 27 Aug 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 27 Aug 2025 11.32 EDTShareIt’s been more than a week since MLB commissioner Rob Manfred dropped his latest bomb. Manfred, as we’ve learned, enjoys throwing ideas out into the universe to get his sport some easy pop while seeing how the masses will react. Just a few months back, he scrambled the brains of baseball fans with his idea of a “golden at bat”, which would allow a chosen player to come to the plate, once a game, when it wasn’t their turn to hit. Oh, he got his publicity alright:many of us took the bait. Was it a genuine, bona fide idea? Probably not. When MLB is serious about a rule change we tend to see it played out in the minor leagues, and last I heard, baseball lineups were still linear down on the farms.Now Manfred, who has brought unprecedented change to on-field rules – the pitch clock, the shift ban, three batter reliever minimums, the ghost runner, just to name just a few – is back playing with the heads of the public, this time, floating plans to realign baseball’s 30 teams, who will be upped to 32 if the sport adds two more franchises through expansion, which the circuit is widely expected to do. Nashville, Salt Lake City, Raleigh and Portlandare seen to be front runners, with Montreal looming as an outside shot. This could effectively end the league structure which has governed baseball since 1903, back when the upstart American Leaguemade peace with the senior National Leagueand agreed to settle scores in a World Series rather than trying to run each other out of business.Manfred’s latest idea led to a flurry of freak outs on the internet, and when everyone caught their breath,a wave of realignment ideas, some of which blew up the leagues entirely and some of which kept them mostly intact, flooded the zone. As a 50-year old baseball fan, my knee-jerk reaction was to side with Howie Rose, the cherished radio voice of the New York Mets.“This is what I’ve been telling you is inevitable for quite a while now,” said Rose on X. “The American League (1901) and the National League (1876) will cease to exist as we know them. The last move before total destruction of the traditions that made baseball great.”Over the week I took a breath, began to break it all down and began to change my tune. I asked myself, “how is it that these leagues, which came together as a result of brutal, turn of the 19th century commerce, can be responsible for the traditions that made baseball great?”The more I thought about Rose’s claim, and the complaints of other fans citing “tradition” the more suspect it felt. Surely it’s the players, teams, games, drama, the physical on-field feats, the records, the stadiums, the hot dogs, peanuts and the Cracker Jacks rather than what team plays in what league that made us fall for baseball. We have some semi-recent evidence to support this. TheMilwaukee Brewersonce played in the AL West, the AL East and the AL Central before shifting to the NL Central for the 1998 season. The Houston Astros once played in the NL West and the NL Central before moving to the play in the AL West in 2013. Did those fanbases fall apart when these changes arrived? Hardly.So upon such reflection,I’m going full Adam Curtis:those against dramatic realignment – and I am probably speaking mostly about fans over 35 here – are perhaps subconsciously, protecting the memories and stories of their childhood. That was when their love of baseball was formed, and there were significant differences between the AL and NL – from strike zone, to league presidents that actually had a say in the governing of the game – and All-Star games where folks really cared which league won. The further baseball gets away from that version of the sport, the more out of sorts and confused these older fans feel about the world they live in now. And they seem like the loudest online when it comes to this subject.That’s probably a bit much for a baseball column, but really, that’s exactly why nostalgia is so powerful, because it ushers folks back into the comfortable world they know best. And really, such involuntary spasms are unwarranted, meaning the hours I spent panicking about the DH coming to the NL were actually a total waste: the universal DH is here and it’s fine!This is in stark contrast to younger fans, who got into baseball right around the time the umpires and strike zones were all folded together, inter-league play was up and running, the central divisions and wildcard spots were introduced, league offices were history and winning the All-Star Game began to decline in importance to fans and players alike. Those fans are generally more open to change, with significantly less of an emotional attachment to the structures of an American and National League.So, to the older traditionalists, and reactionary younger fans, if we say goodbye to the American and National Leagues, don’t fret. Welcome the potential of four, eight team divisions. A super division of the Red Sox, Phillies, Mets and the Yankees. That Seattle could finally have a semi-local team like Portland close by. That a rivalry such as Minnesota and Milwaukee rivalry could be revitalized. That cats and dogs can indeed live together! No, that’s not anything close to the baseball set up of my childhood, and no, this acceptance does not in any way serve as an endorsement of Manfred, who’s job is to try andscratch out as many pennies as he can for owners.But major changes to baseball’s structure are inevitable, and whatever they throw at us, as long as the game on the field is recognizable, and they keep that golden at-bat as far away from MLB as possible, I’m in.Explore more on these topicsMLBUS sportsBaseballNew York MetsNew York YankeesBoston Red SoxMilwaukee BrewerscommentShareReuse this content"

The Kansas City Current were hosting the Orlando Pride on 16 August, last year’s champions and Shield winners visiting this year’s best team by a distance. The presence of two of the league’s best strikers, Orlando’s Barbra Banda and Kansas City’s Temwa Chawinga, created the expectation of goals. And it would have a rare national TV audience, with kickoff set for 3pm local time on CBS.It turned into one of the most controversial moments in recent NWSL history. Due to extreme heat in Kansas City, kickoff was repeatedly delayed, eventually taking place nearly three and a half hours later than scheduled. The game itself, still played amid high temperatures, fizzled to a 0-0 draw. Banda exited due to an injury that was later revealed to be arare traumathat will end her season. PerThe Kansas City Star, at least 16 people were treated for heat-related injuries at CPKC Stadium and one person was transported to a hospital.Afterward, Orlando head coach Seb Hines said things should have been handled differently, with both teams made to repeatedly come out into the heat and warm up before kickoff was delayed once again.NWSL says it has ‘no duty of care’ for women suing San Diego Wave over assault claimsRead more“It’s brutal,” Hines said. “A lot of confusion, and lack of communication as well, of what the next steps were. It was extremely hot. It was too hot to play. We would have liked that decision to have been made earlier on, before warm-up, so they can probably prep a little bit better.”In the aftermath of that game, The Athletic reported that commissioner Jessica Berman denied a morning request from both clubs to delay the match given the high temperatures – the National Weather Service had issued a heat advisory for the area a couple days prior – concerned that delaying the game would mean losing the planned national broadcast slot on CBS. The report also stated the commissioner threatened Kansas City with a fine for the club’s handling of the delay once it happened.The Guardian has found what may be one reason for the confusion Hines describes, and which might explain Berman’s threat to Kansas City. The NWSL quietly updated its publicly available 2025 Competition Rules and Regulations sometime after the game in Kansas City, in ways that might have directly affected the handling of the match.The most significant change is the deletion of a clause saying what should happen if the temperature on the pitch was one degree below 92.3 degrees fahrenheit, the threshold which automatically triggers a match delay. In that event, the policy used to read, “it will be the fourth official in conjunction with the home club’s team physician with feedback from visiting team medical personnel, operations, officials and both technical staffs, to make the ultimate decision if and when play is allowed to resume.”There currently is no such clause in the policy document as it is linked on the league’srules and policies page.When the temperature was read about 45 minutes after the scheduled start time in Kansas City, it read 91.8 degrees – just 0.5 degrees below the threshold. If the aforementioned clause in the then-publicly available policy meant that any temperature one degree or less below 92.3 degrees fahrenheit – and not just exactly one degree below the threshold – gave discretion to onsite officials, this reading was within that range. The Athletic reported, “sources at the stadium thought the drop in temperature was likely the result of a cloud passing overhead. They were confident that the temperature would rise again after the cloud passed.” Kansas City medical staff brought this concern to NWSL chief medical officer Dr Cindy Chang, who was involved throughout the delay and agreed that a second reading should be taken. After a second reading indeed showed a temperature of 95.6 degrees, which triggered another delay, Berman contacted the Kansas City owners and threatened to fine the club for breaking protocol.Washington Spirit seize the moment as DC United stumble in city of unrestRead moreA league spokesperson told the Guardian, “In reviewing the document linked on the league’s website, it was noted that previous changes made in 2023 to the official policy utilized by clubs in day-to-day operations were not reflected in the publicly available version.”The league did not respond to an inquiry about when the discrepancies were noted and corrected.Meghann Burke, the executive director of the NWSL Players Association, told the Guardian that the organization was not aware that the language had been removed, and did not agree to its removal.In the older document, all but one of the temperature thresholds were 92.3 degrees, which is consistent with the level negotiated by the Players Association in the 2022 and 2024 collective bargaining agreements. The other temperature threshold mentioned in the old policy is 95 degrees. In the new policy, all of the temperatures mentioned as a threshold temperature are 92.3 degrees.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The older policy said thatthe wet bulb globe temperature(WBGT) should be taken every 30 minutes after the start of the delay, while the new policy halves that interval to 15 minutes. The league used the latter interval in Kansas City.The only official media statement about the delay from the league was, “The league aims to play matches as scheduled whenever safely possible. While forecasts guide planning, we primarily rely on real-time, on-site weather data to make informed decisions in accordance with our inclement weather policies and protocols. Based on those inputs, the league made the decision to delay Saturday’s match.”Neither the Kansas City Current or Orlando Pride responded to a request for comment regarding the edited policy.The league has already been criticized for their handling of matters relevant to player health this year, most notably inSavy King’s collapseon the pitch in an Angel City v Utah Royals game on 9 May. In that incident, medical staff resuscitated her and brought her to a hospital, where she began what is expected to be a full recovery. The league did not end or postpone the match, with the Players Association soon condemning the decision to continue the game.The week prior to the game in Kansas City, the Seattle Reign played at Providence Park in Portland, where managerLaura Harveysaid multiple players got burns on their feet from the hot turf.This article was amended on 27 August 2025 to reflect that in the 2022 CBA, the threshold temperature was 92.3 degrees fahrenheit, not 95 degrees as was previously stated.Explore more on these topicsNWSLWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

If Celtic have deep regrets over misfires in Kazakhstan,Rangersendured a night of historic shame in Belgium, utterly incapable of recovering from their very poor first‑leg performance. Though by contrast to his horror show, that night of blunder was a positively creditable showing.Russell Martin’s stewardship is in grave danger after 10 games in charge. “It’s probably the toughest night I’ve had as a head coach, it doesn’t change the fact that I think we will progress, move forward and grow,” he said.Grimsby v Manchester United, Club Brugge v Rangers, and more: Champions League and Carabao Cup – liveRead moreThe response of the club’s new ownership, for whom Martin is the first managerial appointment, is keenly awaited though he said afterwards that a quiet word with Kevin Thelwell and Patrick Stewart had assured him of their continued faith. The depth Rangers plunged down in the first half made a mockery of Martin’s continued self-belief.“Madness, really,” he offered in explanation. “We apologise to the fans that travelled and the fans back home. There’s not enough harmony or care for each other quite yet. We knew that coming in. We have to build that. That harmony has been disrupted for sure.”His starting team selection, including eight summer signings, had been short on European experience. Looking ahead to a derby where both Glasgow’s giants’ managers enter under dark clouds, Martin said: “The only thing we can do tonight is accept the pain, accept the humiliation, accept the hurt and then use it as fuel.”View image in fullscreenRangers’ misery piles up as Hans Vanaken scores.Photograph: Soccrates Images/Getty ImagesBrugge sought to finish the tie quickly. Too easy. In the fifth minute, Nicolo Tresoldi nodded in. To compound early disaster, high farce as the Rangers defender Max Aarons found himself out of position. His solution? Hauling back Christos Tzoli for an indisputable straight red. Martin sent on the benched club captain James Tavernier, attempting to stop the bloodletting with the patient already long dead. “It’s not the standards I want to uphold:” said Tavernier afterwards. “We didn’t represent the club in any good form at all.”The screw had been ruthlessly turned, Tzolis stuck the woodwork via Jack Butland’s fingertips, Rangers’ goalkeeper was left unprotected throughout. Next, the veteran Hans Vanaken nodded in Tzolis’s corner, before striking the angle with a volley. The left-back Joaquin Seys made it three, then four, twice unmarked at the back post. Aleksandar Stanković’s free header made it five.Quick GuideBenfica edges past Mourinho's FenerbahceShowJosé Mourinho and Fenerbahce fell short of returning to the Champions League on Wednesday, losing 1-0 at Benfica in the qualifying playoffs.Benfica — the first club Mourinho coached — had two goals disallowed on video review in the first half before their Turkish forward Kerem Aktürkoğlu scored with a rising shot in the 35th minute for the only goal over the two legs.CopenhagenandQarabagof Azerbaijan also advanced to complete the 36-team lineup for the league phase, with the draw being made Thursday.Mourinho is a two-time Champions League winner but has not coached in the main stage of the marquee competition for six seasons. Fenerbahce’s absence now stretches to 17 seasons.Qarabag are back in the Champions League eight years after their debut campaign, winning 5-4 on aggregate against Ferencvaros despite a 3-2 defeat in Baku on Wednesday.Copenhagen won 2-0 at home against Basel to advance 3-1 on aggregate.The 36 sides who have qualified for the Champions League group stage this season are: Tottenham, Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester City, Chelsea, Newcastle, Napoli, Inter, Atalanta, Juventus, Barcelona, Real Madrid, Atlético Madrid, Athletic Club, Villarreal, Bayern Munich, Bayer Leverkusen, Eintracht Frankfurt, Borussia Dortmund, Paris Saint-Germain, Marseille, Monaco, PSV Eindhoven, Ajax, Sporting, Union Saint-Gilloise, Galatasaray, Slavia Prague, Olympiakos, Pafos, Bodo/Glimt, Kairat, Qarabag, Benfica, Club Brugge, Copenhagen.Associated PressWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.For all the sheer dreadfulness of Rangers, Brugge augmented the growing reputation of Belgian club football’s resurgence, echoing their decent showing last season in the group stage and knockouts. After the break, Tzolis, understandably coveted across Europe, swiftly scored the sixth, seizing on Tresoldi’s showboat backheel. Just as in the first half, Rangers were a goal down within five minutes of the whistle.Infamy loomed. Rangers’ previous club‑record European defeats were 6-0 against Real Madrid in 1960, 7-1 against Liverpool in 2022. Any relief from being the worst of all European nights lay only in Brugge stepping off the pace rather than any Rangers revival. “I don’t think we’ll be beat 6-0 again,” Martin said, severely tempting fate with Sunday calling.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueClub BruggeRangersEuropean club footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Everton’s cutting edge remains a work in progress but an awkward tie againstMansfieldwas negotiated in straightforward fashion. Eventually.Nigel Clough’s resolute League One team restricted their Premier League hosts for 51 minutes only for Alcaraz to ease Everton anxieties with an accomplished finish from 20 yards.

We’ve got a couple of options for Harrison so we’ll decide in the next few days what to do.”The combined appeal of a new ground and a sensible ticket­pricing policy ensured the first cup tie at Hill Dickinson Stadium was a sell‑out. Mansfield, also benefiting from reduced prices of £15 for adults, £10 for over 65s and £5 for under-18s, brought more than 6,000 fans to the banks of the River Mersey to contribute towards ­Everton’s ­biggest home attendance for a League Cup tie since 1987.Unfortunately, many had problems gaining entry and kick-off was delayed by 15 minutes to “ensure all supporters have safe access” into the stadium in time, according to an Everton statement. The delay can be filed under teething troubles, but it had been predicted by Evertonians when highlighting on social media before the game numerous issues with the club’s new digital ­tickets.On top of complaints over how the Club View section of the East Stand operated against Brighton on Sunday, complaints that Everton have acknowledged, there is work to be done on improving the matchgoing experience at Hill Dickinson Stadium.Clough said: “The 15-minute delay, at a very late stage, was not ideal.

The noise from a raucous away section when the half-time whistle went confirmed who was the happier with a goalless first 45 minutes.Moyes selected a strong side with Jack Grealish on the left and gave required game-time to the fit‑again Vitalii Mykolenko, who missed the first two Premier League games of the season with a groin injury, Dwight McNeil and Séamus Coleman. ­Everton were bright in patches, but only in patches.The Mansfield goalkeeper Liam Roberts made an impressive early save from Alcaraz and stopped another effort from Armstrong. Other­wise, Everton struggled to break down a disciplined League One defence. McNeil sliced over when found unmarked inside the visiting penalty area by Grealish, while the England international also skied a decent chance from Garner’s pass.The break came at a bad time for the visiting side, who had grown ­increasingly confident as the first half wore on. Everton came out for the second half with greater intensity and a willingness to commit more bodies forward. Mansfield came under sustained pressure, with Grealish forcing Roberts into another important save, before it finally told.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For most teams the answer would be “with great difficulty”, but Chelsea are a different beast.Terrifyingly, despite their domestic dominance, the Blues left room for improvement last season. As Sonia Bompastor told the club’s website: “We did well in terms of trophies and results last season but we were not always happy with the performances and didn’t show as much consistency as I would like. We’re working on giving even more clarity to the players for them to execute what we want them to achieve on the pitch.”Women’s Super League 2025-26 previews No 3: BrightonRead moreThe difference going into the new campaign is they have a more settled squad and a more settled manager. There have been incomings,Ellie Carpenter the highlight, but this has been a summer of consolidation and of building towards the performances they want to see week in, week out. “I wouldn’t say there will be a big difference from last season,” said Bompastor. “This season, we will go further and in more detail on what we were trying to achieve last season.“Last season was about getting to know each other on the pitch. Now, we are in a better position to go into the details of how we want to work together.”The challenge of maintaining their stranglehold on the league title is getting harder each year. This season Arsenal are buoyed bytheir Champions League winand Manchester City are helmed by a new manager and welcoming back their injured cohort. Both clubs are desperate to unseat Chelsea, who face a stern test in the season opener when they welcome City to Stamford Bridge. It will be a chance for the champions to make a statement.Chelsea are still searching for their missing piece, too, their tough exit from the Champions League at the hands of Barcelona only made worse by Arsenal’s eventual triumph. With Barcelona’s financial struggles well documented and Arsenal’s underdog victory a surprise, the European door is open for whichever team push hardest at it.How they finished in the past five seasonsThe managerBompastor’s first season was phenomenal. Improving on the success of the preceding season while adapting to a new country and culture with your family is remarkable and has resulted in a well-deserved place on the shortlist for the Ballon d’Or women’s coach of the year award. Known for being a ruthless competitor, Bompastor has proven herself a worthy successor to Emma Hayes. The Champions League frustrations aired by Bompastor and her team after they had secured a domestic treble speak to the drive and ambition of the manager and her players.Off-field pictureChelsea have never been afraid to spend big to get the players they want, withNaomi Girma’s signing in Januaryshowing that is not about to change. The women’s side of the club was controversially split from the men’s and sold to Blueco, Chelsea’s parent company, for £200m in April. The valuation was justified in May when the Reddit co-founder, and husband of Serena Williams,Alexis Ohanian bought a 10% stakein the club for £20m. Ohanian has spoken publicly about the big ambitions he has for Chelsea and the deal prompted a lot of teams to turn green with envy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The arrival of the Australia defender Carpenter from Bompastor’s former side Lyon is the highlight, though. Carpenter has twice won the Champions League with Lyon and has played in two World Cups and three Olympics with the Matildas. “Everyone has been so welcoming, the staff and the players,” she said. “I’m enjoying the sessions; it’s a great environment to work in, and it will bring the best out of me.

Aggie Beever-Jones and Hannah Hampton arguably had their “stepping up” campaigns last term. This season it’s Wieke Kaptein’s turn. The midfielder has shown flashes of brilliance when she has come into the side. “She just brings to the team a lot of quality out of possession,” said Bompastor when Kaptein played during the unusual four back-to-back games against Manchester City last season. “She’s a young player but she is really confident on the ball but also works so hard off the ball.”It was a good summer for …As with Arsenal, it would be unfair to not mention all of Chelsea’s Euro 2025 winners. Niamh Charles scored her penalty in the final shortly after coming on, Lauren James scored twice against the Netherlands despite injury struggles during the tournament, Beever-Jones shone in her cameos and scored against Wales, Keira Walsh is the metronome of England’s midfield, battling Lucy Bronze was sensational in so many ways andHampton shrugged off Mary Earps’s shadowand then some with two heroic performances in penalty shootouts to add to a breakthrough tournament.View image in fullscreenHannah Hampton saves from Aitana Bonmatí during the penalty shootout as England defeated Spain in the Euro 2025 final.Photograph: Michael Probst/APMain initiative to attract more fansChelsea announced way ahead of the season details of the four WSL games they will play at Stamford Bridge, in an attempt to get fans committed to showing up en masse.

It was all smiles on Wednesday as Oliver Glasner and his squad boarded a private plane for their flight to Norway at Biggin Hill – the same airport that a Palace team managed by Terry Venables used for their trip to face the Turkish side Samsunspor in the Intertoto Cup.That adventure, in a long-forgotten competition when Palace were the only English representatives to apply after being relegated two months earlier, proved fleeting. After a 2-0 defeat in the first leg at Selhurst Park in mid-July, only 27 Palace supporters attended another 2-0 loss on the south coast of the Black Sea six days later in conditions that had forced Venables to abandon a planned training session in the local park. “Terry got us in the shade and just went: ‘There’s no way we can do anything in this heat,’” the former defender Dean Austin said.Transfer latest: West Ham land Magassa, Palace agree fee for Pino and eye AkanjiRead moreAlmost 30 years later, Palace were denied a potential rematch with Samsunspor, who face Panathinaikos in a Europa League playoff on Thursday, after their demotion by Uefa for breaking its regulations on multiclub ownership. More than 1,700 supporters have made the pilgrimage this time, with another protest march against Uefa scheduled before the second leg of theirConference Leagueplayoff against Fredrikstad, another coastal town, 90 kilometres from Oslo.Chelsea are believed to have earned £15m by winning the competition last season so Glasner will know how important it is to finish the job aftera 1-0 victory in the first legand he made sure his players were able to train on the artificial surface on which the game will be played.“It makes no sense complaining about it,” he said. “We never thought this would happen, and now it happened. So we should enjoy this beautiful country, a nice game, and hopefully going away with a win.”Having joked after the first leg that he might need to bring his boots to Norway should Marc Guéhi follow Eberechi Eze out of the door before then, he will be relieved that the England defender is poised to captain the side in what could be his last appearance for Palace.It has been another exhausting start to the season for Glasner, who was spotted enjoying a round of crazy golf in Battersea Park with his family on Tuesday before preparing to face a Fredrikstad team who were given the weekend off in their domestic league. The Austrian has made no secret of his dissatisfaction that, with his players facing the challenge of competing in four competitions, Palace have repeated the same mistakes as last summer in the transfer market.Uncertainty over which European competition they were playing in may partly excuse the fact they have spent less than any other club in Europe’s top four leagues. Yet Glasner was clearly expecting more early additions after signing four players on deadline day last August. He is believed to have indicated he is not willing to resume discussions over extending his contract – which, like Guéhi’s, expires next year – until at least after the window has closed.View image in fullscreenJean-Philippe Mateta scored the only goal of the first leg.Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images/ReutersPalace negotiated a fee that could reach £67.5m from Arsenal for Eze, and Glasner will not be satisfied by only the arrival of Yeremy Pino from Villarreal after a deal worth up to £26m was agreed for the 22-year-old Spain forward. There is also interest in Arsenal’s Reiss Nelson and in bringing Conor Gallagher back after his successful loan under Patrick Vieira in 2021-22, although Atlético Madrid would prefer a sale.Glasner said after the Forest game that without the 14 goals and 12 assists that Eze contributed last season, Palace may struggle. “It’s pretty clear you need to replace him with a starter,” he said. “This is what we are looking for. I’m pretty sure we will find the right one. Or we will get the right one done, let’s say it more like this. Because we already found the right one.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The question is how far the Palace chair, Steve Parish, and the club’s new biggest shareholder, Woody Johnson, back the manager who led Palace to their first major trophy. Johnson, the American billionaire who owns the New York Jets, was at Selhurst Park on Sunday for the first time since buying John Textor’s 44.9% stake for £190m but he is not expected to inject extra capital at this stage.The former Wolves sporting director Matt Hobbs is waiting to be confirmed in a similar role to replace Dougie Freedman and is understood to have started working on Palace’s recruitment plans, along with Freedman’s former assistant Ben Stevens and the consultant Iain Moody. They face a scramble for last-minute deals, while Parish waits to see whether Liverpool match their £40m valuation for Guéhi and desperately hopes Real Madrid do not follow up their growing interest in the midfielder Adam Wharton with an offer.For now Parish and Glasner are focused on navigating a way past Fredrikstad, but the following days could prove crucial to Palace’s prospects of holding on to a manager who is coveted elsewhere.Explore more on these topicsCrystal PalaceTransfer windowConference LeagueEuropean club footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The malaise has nothing to do with the player who scored the winnerin the Conference League final two years ago. Quite frankly, West Ham are lucky Bowen is not pushing to leave. Nobody could blame the captain were he to decide enough is enough after years of atrocious recruitment and poor appointments from the people at the top.This slump has been a long time coming. Some fans are fuming but a lot have grown apathetic. Mass walkouts feel very particular to the London Stadium. There was another one last Friday, much of the crowd following West Ham’s lead by giving up earlyas Chelsea rained in the goals. Humiliations have become so commonplace in E20 that many supporters wonder whether there are better things to do than watch their bungling team get pummelled at a soulless imitation of a football ground.Transfer latest: West Ham land Magassa, Palace agree fee for Pino and eye AkanjiRead moreBowen deserves better. West Ham are broken and there is no easy fix. The rot is deep and relegation is on the cards unless something drastic happens before the transfer window shuts on Monday. Even then, it would be hard to disagree with the view that substantial change will remain elusive untilDavid Sullivan, the club’s most dominant figure over the past 15 years, sells his shares.A big stadium means nothing when the wider infrastructure remains so dysfunctional. West Ham are being left behind by Bournemouth, Brentford and Brighton. They look stale and outdated. Their recruitment is chaotic, with too many voices competing for attention. Multiple sources say that certain agents continue to have Sullivan’s ear, trying to influence his judgment on signings and managers.None of this absolves Graham Potter and his trusted head of recruitment, Kyle Macaulay, of blame.Potter has lost 12 of his 22 gamessince replacing Julen Lopetegui as head coach in January. His 3-4-2-1 has left a ponderous midfield even more exposed. West Ham have conceded 11 goals in their first three games and have no resilience. It was obvious Wolves were going to win once they made it 2-2.In Potter’s defence he inherited a poor squad from Lopetegui, who inherited an ageing squad from David Moyes, who inherited an unbalanced squad from Manuel Pellegrini. Underinvestment is not the issue. West Ham are working with a limited budget this summer but they have spent in recent years. It shows that one of Sullivan’s biggest failings is who he chooses to empower.View image in fullscreenLucas Paquetá apologises to the travelling fans after West Ham’s 3-2 defeat at Wolves in the Carabao Cup on Tuesday evening.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PAParting company with Moyes in 2024 was not the mistake; it was not having a proper succession plan. Lopetegui was an awful choice, just as Tim Steidten was a dismal pick as technical director a year earlier. Moyes spent badly on expensive signings in 2022. Steidten did not live up to his reputation. The German’s biggest contribution was his role in blowingthe £105m received for Declan Rice.For some people, putting Steidten in charge was the worst mistake Sullivan has made. The former Bayer Leverkusen man’s work includes spending £27.5m on the underwhelming striker Niclas Füllkrug and bestowing upon West Ham the snail-paced midfield of Guido Rodríguez and Edson Álvarez.He also turned down an opportunity to sign Dean Huijsen before the centre-back joined Bournemouth, who sold him to Real Madrid for a huge profit a year later. There are plenty of stories like that. Jørgen Strand Larsen and Marc Cucurella also got away. There was interest in Mateus Fernandes before the midfielder’s £12m move to Southampton, who are now telling West Ham they can have him – for £60m.The damage was done by the time Steidten made way for Macaulay. The flaws in West Ham’s recruitment are evident in no one wanting to buy their players. The sale of Mohammed Kudus to Tottenham for £54.5m this summer came from a position of weakness. West Ham had to sell to buy but the only useful offers came for Kudus. This is a squad cobbled together by an assortment of people. West Ham are stuck with expensive, underperforming centre‑backs. They had to accept a loan for Álvarez and are yet to sell the 31-year-old Rodríguez.This was never a one-window fix, but Potter and Macaulay have made the situation worse this summer. The place is undisciplined. It is staggering to hear that a current player has criticised the club to potential targets. Potter focused on banishing the toxicity in the dressing room during pre-season but the problems have not gone away. Lucas Paquetá, who is of interest to Tottenham, is open to leaving.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

West Ham instead spent much of their budget on the Senegal left‑back El Hadji Malick Diouf and the Denmark goalkeeper Mads Hermansen, who has struggled since joining from Leicester for £15m.These are buys that should have been made only after the vast hole in midfield was filled. Now West Ham are panicking. Multiple sources say Sullivan started the summer determined to let Potter and Macaulay do what they wanted. Callum Wilson was not a Potter pick but he could have blocked the 33-year-old striker’s arrival on a free transfer. The narrative about interference from above is disputed.View image in fullscreenMads Hermansen covers his face in despair after conceding against Sunderland on his West Ham debut.Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt/AMA/Getty ImagesIt is felt that Potter and Macaulay set their sights too high. They are accused of naivety, of misjudging West Ham’s appeal to talents such as Jacob Ramsey and Harvey Elliott. Time has been wasted. Chelsea thought it was a joke when West Ham bid for Andrey Santos last week. West Ham were advised not to go in for Barcelona’s Marc Casadó before bidding for the midfielder. It is not clear why a powerful striker has not been targeted, while a new winger would help given that Crysencio Summerville has been out since January. Kudus has not been replaced. His departure has left West Ham dependent on Paquetá and Bowen for creativity.Potter can argue that his shift to a controlled possession style will work once he has the players to fit his system. He needs time, but the clock is ticking. Macaulay is said to be under pressure to prove himself to Sullivan. The 76‑year‑old has resisted the temptation to impose players on Potter and Macaulay so far – he relented when it came to Hermansen, signing him instead of the Botafogo goalkeeper John Victor, whom West Ham are now trying to bring in on loan – but some expect Sullivan to become more dominant. Macaulay and Potter will hope thatbuying the Monaco midfielder Soungoutou Magassashifts the mood. They are also trying to sign a fast striker.A swift turnaround in results is needed. A few more defeats will likely lead to Potter’s sacking. But what would another managerial change achieve? Sullivan will still be making the appointments. He has never shown an inclination to pay compensation for an in‑demand manager. It is always someone unemployed. It will be more of the same.Explore more on these topicsWest Ham UnitedDavid SullivancommentShareReuse this content"

Six Premier League sides will get to test themselves against the best over the coming months and there are a few new faces in the competition and some intriguing passport stamps to collect. Who wouldn’t want to travel to the Cypriot city of Paphos in September to watch their beloved club play David Luiz’s Pafos FC? The temperature reaches 29C and there is no chance of rain. There are miles and miles of beaches to enjoy with aKeoin hand. If anything, the prospect of a 90-minute match is a bit of a distraction. The even better news is there are flights from London, Manchester and Newcastle.Obviously, travelling to Paphos is the ideal scenario for any supporter but equal weight should be given to some of the other Bigger Cup new boys. Bodø/Glimt’s Aspmyra Stadion is also very close to a body of water but swimming in the Norwegian Sea is not advised in winter when the temperature drops to a rather chilly 3C. A trip in December would make it unlikely that the thermometer would get above freezing. Trying to find a direct flight is a nightmare, so changing in Oslo is about as good as it gets but when the team plane does eventually land it is less than a quarter of an hour walk from the airport, making it very convenient. On the upside, even with a stop in Norway’s capital, it can be reached in five hours from Manchester.Almaty, on the other hand, is almost in China and that is a ruddy trek. It will therefore come as no surprise that is is a right faff getting there. The most straightforward route would involve a stopover in Istanbul and flying to Kazakhstan from there, which would set you back around 12 hours but is certainly worthwhile. As Celtic fans will tell you, it is a long way to go for disappointment, although Football Daily is sure the blow was softened by seeing the Tian Shan mountains and a trip to the The Museum of Folk Musical Instruments. No one can really complain about a Daizen Maeda missed penalty when there is the prospect of seeing azhelbuaz– a Kazakhstani bagpipe. Football is not the be-all and end-all in life, enriching oneself with culture is more important and Bigger Cup gives people the chance to visit places they would never have considered on your average package holiday.Qarabag are 3-1 up from their opening leg against Ferencvaros, meaning Azerbaijan will be another destination on this voyage. Surely the idea of going somewhere new rather than your Barcelonas, your Madrids and your ,erm, Parises is a far more enticing prospect for the average fan. The Camp Nou has been done to death, it’s not even cool to go there, even with its revamp. Celtic and – almost certainly – Rangers fans should not be upset about missing out on Bigger Cup for the matches, but for the places they will never see. Bigger Vase has gone mainstream, with teams from Salzburg, Zagreb and Rotterdam, which EyeWitness and Lonely Planet have covered to the extreme. Bigger Cup is finally for the real hipsters, wanting to catch a glimpse of football destinations as they should be, and it should be embraced.LIVE ON BIG WEBSITEJoin Simon Burnton at 8pm for goal updates on the Bigger Cup and Worthington’s Cup action.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Their aim, however, is to join Arsenal and Chelsea in the Champions League and, on Wednesday’s evidence, they have a strong chance of doing so.New Spurs coach Ho hums right notes to boost WSL side’s confidenceRead moreUnited will face Hammarby of Sweden on Saturday in a 6pm BST kick-off in the final of their mini-competition in this second round of qualifying. All four sides in this mini-group are playing this week’s ties in Stockholm, at the 3Arena, with Hammarby the hosts. If United win on Saturday they would face a two-leg knockout tie in September for a place in the expanded league phase of the Champions League.Thankfully for United fans, their victory over PSV was significantly more straightforward than trying to follow the rather complex qualifying procedure. The Women’s Super League side took total control very early, giving PSV’s players scarcely any time on the ball with a well-orchestrated high press, and their tactics led to the opening goal.The United midfielder Lisa Naalsund, pressing the PSV defence, capitalised on a loose pass, intercepted the ball and slotted an easy pass across to Terland, who had space and time to tuck a good finish into the bottom-right corner with less than seven minutes played.Quick GuideFormer United captain Zelem signs for London CityShowThe former Manchester United captain Katie Zelem has signed for the promoted Women's Super League club London City Lionesses for an undisclosed fee from the NWSL club Angel City, for whom she played for one year.Zelem's Angel City teammate Alanna Kennedy, the Australia centre-back, has also signed for London City for an undisclosed fee as the English club – owned by Michele Kang - continue their busy summer transfer business before their first season in the top tier.Zelem spent six years at  United and won the FA Cup with her childhood club in 2024. London City's first home league fixture  is at home to United on 14 September.Tom GarryWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Zigiotti Olme, one of the stronger performers for Sweden at Euro 2025 and part of their side that faced England in a dramatic quarter-final, is one of two United summer signings so far, arriving from Bayern Munich for an undisclosed fee, and she struck the post early on with a left-footed effort. It was a clear chance spurned but the midfielder has every reason to be pleased with her energetic and purposeful performance. She looked composed and confident on the ball, helped drive the team forward and was exemplary with her work rate as Skinner’s team dominated in midfield.View image in fullscreenCelin Bizet (right) expresses delight after pouncing on the ball palmed out following Ella Toone’s effort to make it 2-0 to Manchester United.Photograph: TT News Agency/ReutersIt was not long before it was 2-0, when Anna Sandberg’s left-wing cross led to a shot for Ella Toone, whose effort was saved but palmed only as far as Bizet, who lifted the rebound into the roof of the net. Eight minutes after half-time, Terland got her second after a pass from Toone set her up, and the striker had her hat-trick in the 63rd minute when she raced through the middle and fired home with another good finish.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I didn’t ever imagine when I was a child that I would get to this height. I had this peace inside my heart and I’m still discovering what’s possible for me.”The 28-year-old outduelled world record holder, Ukraine’s Olympic champion Yaroslava Mahuchikh, who equalled her season’s best with a 2.02m leap but still succumbed to Olyslagers for the fourth time in this campaign.Olyslagers became only the third Australian woman – after hurdler Sally Pearson (2017) and pole vaulter Nina Kennedy (2022, 2024) – and seventh Australian athlete to take a Diamond League title, and it came after a brilliant season in which she had already won in Stockholm, Paris and Lausanne.View image in fullscreenOlyslagers clears at Sechselaeutenplatz in Zurich.Photograph: Michael Buholzer/EPALike Kennedy last year, she found her best form in Zurich’s main Sechselautenplatz square in the shadow of the city’s Opera House, on the first of two days of competition before the track action moves to the Letzigrund Stadium on Thursday.She seemed inspired from the start, clearing six heights without a failure, topped by her 2.04m leap, which bettered her previous best of 2.03, which she first set in Eugene in September 2023.Mahuchikh had a chance to snatch victory after Olyslagers failed three times at 2.06m, but the Ukrainian couldn’t get over either, even as her sporting Australian rival clapped and cheered for her on her final attempt.“It was so nice having Yaroslava jump with me the whole way,” said Olyslagers. “Jumping with her is one of my favourite things in the world, so having her and me really go for it was wonderful.“I think I have some notes of what I need to change in order to go higher,” she added, after scribbling in her famous notebook at the side of the apron. “The 2.04m was 10 out of 10 – but I still need to work on my run in the last three steps.”Olyslagers’ Australian teammate Eleanor Patterson finished last of the six finalists, clearing 1.91m.Later, world indoor medallist Liam Adcock leapt to third place in the long jump, with a last-round best of 8.24 metres.The 29-year-old Brisbane jumper finished just 8cm behind local hero Simon Ehammer, who delighted the crowd with his third-round 8.32m winner, which just pipped Italian Mattia Furlani’s 8.30m.Nicola Olyslagers’ one-jump gamble pays off in rain-sodden Diamond League winRead moreArmand Duplantis, who took the pole vault crown as usual, was still smiling even though way off his best form. ‘Mondo’ prevailed on countback after clearing 6.00m, the same height as Greek Emmanouil Karalis.When told it was his 118th clearance at 6m and above, Duplantis beamed: “118? Oh, that is really special. I shouldn’t take it for granted.“Today? Well, I’m a human being I don’t break world records every day. There are days when I feel decent and days when I feel bad.

The panicked visitors forced penalties via Bryan Mbeumo’s 75th-minute strike and Harry Maguire’s header 60 seconds from the end. But when Mbeumo missed his second kick and 26th of the tie‑breaker United had lost against fourth-tier opposition for the first time in the competition, 12‑11 on penalties.Glorious Grimsby humiliate Manchester United with shootout victoryRead moreAmorim was clear the defeat has to be the nadir. “I think this is a little bit the limit,” he said. “Something has to change. In this moment, we need to focus on the weekend and then we have time to think.“Everything [was wrong]. The way we started the game, we were not even here. When everything is so important in our club, everything that happened – it’s a problem in our club. We should do so much better. I just have to say sorry to our fans. I felt my players spoke really loud today about what they want.”Amorim was asked to expand on the last comment. “I think it’s easy for you [to know],” the head coach said. “Let’s focus on the next game and then we have the stop for the international games. We will think things through. I think football was really fair today. The best team won.”Amorim was asked if he could believe what had been witnessed. “No, but I’m the manager,” the Portuguese said. “It should be my job to understand what happened. Again, I’m really sorry for our fans. Let’s focus on the next game.”Last season United finished in a record Premier League low 15th. Amorim admitted that his side has not improved. “That is more than a result. That is the biggest problem in the team. I think it was really clear today. I would like to say very smart things and very important things but I have nothing to say.“This is the biggest problem also – to see the same mistakes. I’m really sorry for our fans. It’s too much sometimes. You cannot change so much – you cannot change everything in one summer. You need to win games. You need to not show this kind of performance.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Garnacho has no future under Ruben Amorim but Chelsea regard the Argentinian as a top talent and believe they can get his career back on track.Mainoo wants to leave Manchester United after being sidelined by AmorimRead moreIt is understood Chelsea are confident they will not have to wait for the proposed sales of Christopher Nkunku and Nicolas Jackson to go through before completing a move for Garnacho. Chelsea need to meet the terms of a Uefa settlement agreement stipulating they must have a “positive transfer balance” to register new players for the Champions League. The club are relaxed about the situation, however, with sources at Stamford Bridge stressing that suggestions they are under pressure to raise funds have been exaggerated.The desire to bring in another winger means Garnacho is viewed as a bigger priority than the RB Leipzig midfielder Xavi Simons, who has emerged as a target for Tottenham. Enzo Maresca, the Chelsea head coach, uses a system that depends heavily on players staying wide and stretching the play. Chelsea want four wingers and see Garnacho competing with Jamie Gittens for a spot on the left.Garnacho fell out of favour last season and has faced questions over his attitude. Yet his talent is not in doubt – he played a crucial role in United beating Manchester City in the FA Cup final in 2024 – and Chelsea have done extensive background checks on his character. Chelsea believe that Garnacho will thrive in a different environment.Maresca wants plenty of depth in attack and has signed Liam Delap, João Pedro, Gittens and Estêvão Willian. Chelsea hold an interest in Fermín López but Barcelona do not want to sell the attacking midfielder. López could be an alternative to Simons.Chelsea are confident they will sell Nkunku and Jackson. Nkunku has interest from leading European sides, as does Jackson, a target for Aston Villa, Bayern Munich, Newcastle, Juventus and Napoli. Bayern are interested in a loan for Jackson, something Chelsea will only agree to if there is an obligation to buy.Roma, Leizpig and teams in England are interested in the 19-year-old winger Tyrique George. Chelsea are still waiting for firm interest to materialise in Raheem Sterling. Fulham are a possible destination for Sterling.Explore more on these topicsChelseaManchester UnitedTransfer windownewsShareReuse this content"

After retiring from the game in 2017, Christie reportedly suffered from headaches, memory lapses, speech problems, depression and mood swings consistent with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).World Rugby’s brain health service finds 25% of ex-players ‘at risk’ of problemsRead moreChristie, who also played for Otago Highlanders, Canterbury Crusaders and the All Blacks sevens team, was found dead at his home in Nelson on Wednesday morning after police were called to the address. “The death will be referred to the coroner and we have no further information or comment we can provide,” said police.New Zealand Rugby said Christie was deeply passionate about the sport and would be “remembered always”. “Any time the rugby community loses a member it is felt deeply,” New Zealand Rugby said. “Shane’s passion for the game will be remembered always. Our thoughts are with Shane’swhānau[family], friends, former teammates, and community at this incredibly difficult time.”Christie reportedly wanted to donate his brain to the New Zealand sports human brain bank for its studies into CTE, a degenerative disease caused by repetitive head trauma that cannot be detected in living people. “Without brain donations we’re not going to be able to identify how long it takes to get this disease. It’s important to help the research in New Zealand,” Christie had said.Christie helped set up the Billy Guyton Foundation with the aim of further understanding the effects of concussion on players after the death of his teammate in 2023. Guyton was the first New Zealand rugby player to be diagnosed with CTE.Explore more on these topicsConcussion in sportRugby unionNew ZealandnewsShareReuse this content"

Franchises will not be obliged to spend up to the cap, but a so‑called salary collar will be introduced to guarantee a minimum level of investment in the hope of ensuring the Hundred remains competitive.It is understood that about 12 players in each squad will be allocated via an open auction with franchises able to bid as much as they want, as long as they stay within the overall cap. Beyond that franchises will have the flexibility to negotiate directly with up to three players and offer them longer-term contracts for the first time.View image in fullscreenAustralia’s Glenn Maxwell could switch his summer commitments to the Hundred under new recruitment plans.Photograph: Darren England/AAPWhile not a completely free market, it is anticipated that the new model will lead to the biggest amount of movement between franchises since the start of the Hundred, as well as giving the players more freedom.Increasing the salary cap should help firmly establish the Hundred as the second-biggest short-form competition in the world after the IPL. and attract some of the overseas players who have previously preferred to spend the summer playing in Major League Cricket in the United States, such as Steve Smith, Glenn Maxwell and Quinton de Kock.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The top men’s salary of £200,000 falls into the AUS$360,000-$420,000 range for platinum BBL picks, while the top women’s salary of £65,000 is slightly more than the AUS$110,000 on offer in the WBBL.As previously reported, a change of playing conditionsto a Twenty20 competitionis on the cards, and will be discussed at next week’s board meeting. The Hundred board is comprised of four representatives from the ECB and one each from the eight host venues and new investors, giving the franchises the balance of power.In a potentially intriguing development, Ravichandran Ashwin’s announcement that he is retiring from the IPL on Wednesday has raised the prospect of the first Indian player being recruited by a Hundred franchise next year.The Board of Control for Cricket in India bars current Indian players from appearing in foreign franchise leagues, but this restriction no longer affects Ashwin, who the Daily Telegraph reports is eager to explore playing in the Hundred and other global competitions.Dinesh Karthik became the first Indian player to feature in the South African SA20 competition this year, so there is a precedent for Ashwin to follow after his domestic retirement.Explore more on these topicsThe HundredCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

However, as he edged close to winning, his nerves increasingly came to the surface.Fritz, Pegula and Navarro lead American charge into US Open third roundRead moreAfter establishing a 4-1 lead with a double break in the final set and then serving for the match at 5-4, Norrie found himself down set point at 5-6. As Comesaña lasered a backhand down the line, Norrie thought he had been forced to a fifth set and he began walking to his chair but the umpire confirmed the shot had landed out.Having been given a second chance, Norrie held serve to force a tie-break and then he closed out the match with courageous play. Norrie had toiled for nearly every point throughout the match, but as the match hung in the balance he closed out the match with two unreturned first serves.Djokovic said he is hopeful that his form will improve with more matches at the US Open after he struggled early on against an inexperienced American challenger before recovering to reach the third round in New York with a 6-7 (5), 6-3, 6-3, 6-1 win against Zachary Svajda.Three days after Djokovic’s difficult opening match, where he had numerous physical problems in an attritional tussle with Learner Tien, Djokovic was still searching for his form as he trailed by a set against Svajda. Although the Serb gradually found his way, he was also aided by the 22-year-old’s physical difficulties as he struggled with a left leg problem in the second half of the match.Despite facing the greatest player of all time in the biggest stadium in the sport, Svajda performed with courage early on, outplaying Djokovic from the baseline before closing out a tense opening set with a searing down-the-line backhand. But Djokovic gradually worked his way back into the match with efficient serving and key forays to the net.Svajda began to struggle with his left leg, frequently grabbing at it as his movement deteriorated. Despite his difficulties he led by a break at 3-1 in the third set following a poor service game from Djokovic – but the Serb quickly recovered, rolling through 11 of the next 13 games to take the match.View image in fullscreenNovak Djokovic plays his ‘violin’ celebration after beating Zachary SvajdaPhotograph: Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty ImagesAfterwards, Djokovic spoke frankly about his problems on the court: “I didn’t feel that great to be honest. I wasn’t happy with my tennis for the first part of the match, but also credit to Zach for playing some really high-quality tennis.“It was unfortunate that he struggled with injury towards the end of the second set, but kudos to him for staying on the court. It was obvious he couldn’t serve as well as he did for a set and a half. I wished him all the best at the net because I think he’s playing really well.”The US Open marks Djokovic’s first appearance in any competition since Wimbledon owing to the 38-year-old opting to prioritise his family life over competing in the lengthy two-week Masters 1000 events in Toronto and Cincinnati. Djokovic said he is hoping his level will gradually improve with more matches, victories and time on court at the tournament.“That was the case for most of my grand slam career. The deeper I go in the tournament, the better I feel about my game,” he said. “It’s obviously a little different in the past couple of years for me bodywise, I get wear and tear quicker than I ever used to so I have to deal with that; a lot of recovery stuff to try to make myself able to perform at the highest level.”Djokovic was followed at Arthur Ashe Stadium by Jessica Pegula, the fourth seed and last year’s finalist, who eased into the third round with a clinical 6-1, 6-3 victory over Anna Blinkova.Explore more on these topicsUS Open Tennis 2025Novak DjokovicUS Open tennisTennisUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

The fourth seed, runner-up here last year, was forced to navigate a tricky test against the big-serving Harris, who has been rebuilding his career after injuries saw his ranking plummet outside the world’s top 300.Fritz dropped serve early and ceded the first set as Harris’s forehand found its range. But the American steadied behind his own delivery, pounding 17 aces in all, and dominated the second-set tiebreak to level the match. From there he played with the authority expected of a top-five seed, breaking twice in the third set and riding the crowd’s energy in Louis Armstrong Stadium to finish off the win in just under three hours.“It’s always difficult when a guy like Lloyd comes out swinging freely,” Fritz said. “He was serving great and putting a lot of pressure on me early. I just had to hang tough, get through the breaker, and then I felt like I found my rhythm.”If Fritz was made to sweat, Pegula’s passage was more straightforward. The world No 4, who reached her first grand slam final here a year ago, eased past Russia’s Anna Blinkova 6-1, 6-3 on the Grandstand court. Showing the patience and precision that have become her calling card, Pegula broke serve six times and struck 30 winners to close out the match in a scant 64 minutes.The 31-year-old is now the first American woman since Madison Keys to reach the third round in New York for six years running, underlining her reliability at the majors. She will next face two-time major champion Victoria Azarenka, who advanced with a win over Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova.“I knew if Anna got into a groove she could be really dangerous,” Pegula said afterwards. “I just wanted to take control right away, not let her dictate. I’m pleased with how I kept my foot on the gas.”View image in fullscreenJessica Pegula returns a shot to Anna Blinkova during Wednesday’s match.Photograph: Brian Hirschfeld/EPAPegula, who has already collected tour-high 20 wins on US soil this season, admitted that the challenge of solving problems on court is what keeps her motivated deep into her career. “You’ve got to be fearless to play this sport, because one of you is going to lose out there in front of everyone. But when you work your way through and win, that feeling is pretty unmatched.”The surge of homegrown players was further bolstered by Navarro, the 23-year-old who backed up her semi-final run here last year with a commanding 6-2, 6-1 dismissal of Caty McNally. Navarro, who strugged in Sunday’s first-round win over Wang Yafan, was ruthless in exploiting McNally’s inconsistency, converting seven of eight break points and sealing the victory in just over an hour.“It was definitely quicker than I expected, but not easy,” Navarro said. “I feel like there’s something special about being here: the energy, the crowd, it really pushes me.”Navarro’s next assignment is a daunting one: two-time major champion Barbora Krejcikova, a player she beat earlier this summer at Wimbledon. Should she advance again, a potential fourth-round clash with 17-year-old Mirra Andreeva looms, while a quarter-final date with close friend Pegula remains a possibility.The victories for Fritz, Pegula and Navarro ensured a buoyant day for American tennis, offsetting the disappointment No 30 seed Brandon Nakashima’s 4-6, 7-6 (2), 7-5, 3-6, 7-6 (10) defeat to Switzerland’s Jerome Kym on Court 12.For now, the focus remained on the trio of US contenders who underlined their title credentials. “It’s a long road,” Fritz said, “but days like this, with the support and the atmosphere, it really feels like home.”Explore more on these topicsUS Open Tennis 2025TennisUS Open tennisUS sportsShareReuse this content"

I tried my very best to be here and give myself every chance to play but the discomfort in my arm has become too much and I have to do what is right and look after myself. Thank you for all the support it means so much to me. Until next year NYC.”After withdrawing from the pre‑US Open tournaments in Toronto and Cincinnati, Draper did not return to competition in any form until the US Open mixed doubles last week, reaching the semi-finals alongside Jessica Pegula. Draper then returned to singles competition on Monday with adifficult four-set winagainst Federico Agustín Gómez and he had been due to face Zizou Bergs on Thursday.The past few weeks have marked a significant moment in Draper’s career for other reasons as he launched a lucrative partnership with Vuori in New York, becoming the new face of the American clothing brand after wearing Nike for more than a decade.In the second half of his first-round singles match, Draper’s serve speeds fell significantly and he was clearly not comfortable fully attacking his forehand, which raised concerns about the condition of his arm. Draper also vomited multiple times during the match.During his post-match press conference, however, Draper responded to questions about his arm by asserting repeatedly that he felt positive about its progress and he believed it would continue to improve throughout the tournament.Despite feeling some residual pain, Draper said recent scans had made it clear that he was not compromised. “I think I have two days now again till Thursday,” Draper said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Left unmanaged and in the wrong hands, the AI revolution could entrench rampant inequality as jobs are degraded or displaced, and shareholders get richer.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingEconomicsUnemploymentTUCUK unemployment and employment statisticsnewsShareReuse this content"

The success of this 10th flight proved the spacecraft had overcome its past failures key to the Mars rocket’s reusable design.The stainless steel behemoth, 403ft (123 meters) tall,lifted offfrom the company’s Starbase in southern Texas at 6.30pm local time (2330 GMT), to loud cheers from engineering teams, a webcast showed. This mission was to be a test of the ship’s new heat shield tiles and satellite deployment abilities, among hundreds of other upgrades from past iterations.The rocket’s upper half separated as planned from its Super Heavy booster, the 232-ft-tall first stage that normally returns to land in its launch tower’s giant catch-arms, but on Tuesday targeted the Gulf of Mexico waters to demonstrate an alternate landing engine configuration.Shortly after reaching space, Starship’s “Pez”-like satellite deployment system dispensed mock Starlink satellites for the first time, a milestone SpaceX either cancelled or failed to reach during past tests.Starship made asuccessful splashdownin the Indian Ocean after enduring intense heat through its atmospheric reentry – a crucial phase of the test that has shredded the rocket on past flights.The 10th test flight comes after a string of explosive failures that raised doubts about whether the world’s most powerful launch vehicle can fulfill founderElon Musk’s vision of colonizing Mars or helping Nasa return astronauts to the moon.SpaceX will not attempt to catch the booster from Tuesday’s flight because the component would instead be used for in-flight experiments “to gather real-world performance data on future flight profiles and off-nominal scenarios”.Monday’slaunch scrubwas blamed on weather as thick clouds, hanging overhead for much of the day, forced a delay with a mere 40 seconds left on the countdown clock. ASunday attemptwas scrubbed due to a liquid oxygen leak at the Starship launchpad, billionaire Musk wrote on X overnight.Much is riding on the mission, after the last three flights ended with the upper stage exploding: twice over the Caribbean and once after reaching space. In June, an upper stage blew up during a ground test.“We’ve had so many tests and it hasn’t proven itself reliable,” Dallas Kasaboski, a space analyst for consulting firm Analysys Mason, told AFP. “The successes have not exceeded the failures.”The goal is to send the upper stage ship – eventually intended to carry crew and cargo – halfway across the globe before splashing down off north-western Australia.Outfitted with prototype heat-shield materials, it will deploy dummy Starlink satellites while flying a trajectory meant to stress-test its rear flaps.The booster, known as Super Heavy, will splash down in the Gulf of Mexico. While SpaceX previously wowed observers by catching the booster in the launch tower’s “chopstick arms”, this flight will instead focus on data collection under less-than-ideal flight profiles.This year, two Starship tests have failed early in flight, with another failure in space on its ninth flight, and a “catastrophic explosion” of test stand in June that destroyed a Starship and sent debris flying into nearby Mexican territory have tested SpaceX’s capital-intensive test-to-failure development approach, in which new iterations of rocket prototypes are flown to their technical limits.That ethos is markedly different from SpaceX’s rivals such as Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin, whose New Glenn rocket made an operational debut in January following years of on-the-ground development and testing. The new Vulcan rocket from United Launch Alliance, co-owned by Boeing and Lockheed Martin, had a similar upbringing before its 2024 debut.Despite recent setbacks, Starship is not seen as being at a crisis point. SpaceX’s “fail fast, learn fast” philosophy has already given it a commanding lead in launches with its Falcon rockets, while Dragon capsules ferry astronauts to theInternational Space Stationand Starlink has become a geopolitical asset.Still, Starship presents new challenges. Musk has identified developing a fully reusable orbital heat shield as the toughest task, noting it took nine months to refurnish the space shuttle’s heat shield between flights.“What we’re trying to achieve here with Starship is to have a heat shield that can be flown immediately,” he said on a webcast Monday.SpaceX’s Starlink satellite internet business, a major source of company revenue, is also tied to Starship’s success. Musk aims to use Starship to launch larger batches of Starlink satellites, which have so far been deployed by SpaceX’s workhorse Falcon 9 rocket into space.Musk, for his part, remained bullish. “In about 6 or 7 years, there will be days where Starship launches more than 24 times in 24 hours,” the entrepreneur said on Sunday, replying to a user on X.Another hurdle is proving Starship can be refueled in orbit with super-cooled propellant – an essential but untested step for the vehicle to carry out deep-space missions.Time is running short to ready a modified version for Nasa’s lunar lander for 2027, and for Musk to make good on his vow to send an uncrewed Starship to Mars next year.Explore more on these topicsUS newsSpaceXSpaceElon MusknewsShareReuse this content"

But my loathing runs deeper than thatWed 27 Aug 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 27 Aug 2025 15.25 EDTShareIt’s one of those topics that comes up over drinks or dinner at the moment: whether or not you think AI is going to steal your job. So far, I’ve felt relatively confident that while AI could no doubt have a fair crack at writing a newspaper opinion column, there is something I do as part of my work that AI cannot: reporting.Except now, it seems, AI is claiming to be doing that as well. Last week, it was revealed thatat least six reputable publicationshave had to take down published articles because it turned out that they were probably pieces of fiction written by AI and then passed off by somebody as works of journalism under the name of Margaux Blanchard. One of these was a piece for Wired titled They Fell in Love Playing Minecraft. Then the Game Became Their Wedding Venue, which quoted a “digital celebrant” called Jessica Hu, who does not seem to actually exist. Another publication, called Dispatch, received a pitch from “Blanchard” about an ex-mining town called Gravemont that had been repurposed as a training ground for death investigation. Gravemont doesn’t exist either.When I get into social conversations on subjects like ChatGPT, I try to fight the red mist that descends on me. I hate ChatGPT. And I call it hatred because it provokes a physical reaction in me of something just below real anger. I don’t find it scary, or annoying, or confusing. I hate it.So I’ve been trying to get to the bottom of what it is exactly that I hate. There are decent reasons to rejoice at the advent of the AI age. It seems likely that it will have the capacity to revolutionise, for instance, scientific endeavour: a scientist friend of mine described how AI would speed up the process of coming up with and testing hypotheses in his field. Mundane work tasks will also take less time with the help of AI.But there are also plenty of reasons to chafe against it. There’s the well-documented environmental impact of using ChatGPT. But with respect to Earth, this isn’t the element that has me wringing my hands the most. It’s not even that people are actively buying into a piece of technology that is likely to make many of their own jobs obsolete, or the way that the AI overviews on, say, a Google search often blithely give you straight-up wrong information. Nor the fact that the people at the forefront of the AI revolution have the crashingly terrible vibes of your classic tech bro loser.Here’s the part I suspect may be too tragically reactionary of me: I am worried that a reliance on ChatGPT will erode people’s ability to use their brains. I do believe that the creative imagination in particular is a muscle, and one that is rewarding to exercise. Recently I was helping a seven-year-old work on her creative writing for school. She had to describe a forest, so I asked her to close her eyes and picture one, and tell me what she could see. Oh, we didn’t need to do that, she told me. We could just ask AI to make one.I heard secondhand about an editor asking ChatGPT for help restructuring an article. And again, call me a luddite, but I just thought: no! Some things are supposed to be difficult! It is good for the brain to have to rise to a task! I read about someone using ChatGPT to order from a restaurant menu. It is one of the small joys of life to select what food you want to eat at a restaurant. Why cede that to a machine when you don’t have to?But that’s not even the worst of it, in my view. The worst of it is the way ChatGPT seems to be creeping into people’s personal lives. Using ChatGPT to design a workout plan, to fix a problem in some coding or to summarise a dense document, fine, fine, fine. If you like. But when I hear about people using it to write a birthday card, a best man’s speech or a breakup text, a tiny part of my soul dies. And I don’t think this is the high and mighty position of someone who’s a writer by trade. None of these pieces of writing need to be perfectly expressed or grammatically flawless. They need to come from the heart and be real.At the root of my hatred of ChatGPT is that people’s willingness to use it in this way implies they are happy to turn meaningful interactions like these into something transactional: a task to be completed efficiently and moved on from. So much of the value of, say, receiving a letter, whether emailed or in the post, comes from knowing that somebody sat down and thought about what to say. A human being spent some of their precious time and mental effort on communicating with you.I am well aware that in 15 years’ time I may be wrapping up my seamlessly AI-optimised work day, turning to my AI-powered AutoSpouse and laughing at this article. How naive I was, worried about nothing! I love you, machine programmed to mimic love! I realise, too, that my hatred of ChatGPT might one day relegate me to the scrap heap in terms of future employment opportunities, for not knowing how to wrangle AI into doing things for me. Fine. I’ll go and live in the woods and be miserable. But I will be miserable in an analogue manner, and with my ability to think intact.Imogen West-Knights is a writer and journalistExplore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

When there’s more joy to be had in pootling around enjoying the viewKeza MacDonaldWed 27 Aug 2025 10.01 EDTShareHere’s an admission: I am 37 years old and have never learned to drive. I tried once, in the summer of 2021, and during my second lesson my instructor asked me if I played a lot of video games. When I answered yes, he said, “I thought so,” in a tone that was very clearlynotcomplimentary. Regrettably, it turns out that hundreds of hours spent mercilessly beating my friends and family at Mario Kart and causing vehicular chaos in Grand Theft Auto do not translate instantly to real-life driving skills and judgment. I love racing games precisely because they are unrealistic.Because I still don’t have my licence, I ride my bike everywhere. It’s a giant orange monster of a thing, big enough for my two children to ride on the back, and it looks ridiculous. It makesmelook ridiculous, next to the Lycra-clad middle-aged men on their carbon-fibre frames who zoom past me on the regular. It’s not something I could ever take out into the countryside or down some mountain trail. For that, once again, I must turn to video games.There are surprisingly few games about cycling, but rather like my abiding love for virtual golf, I have developed a longstanding mini obsession with them nonetheless. One of my all-time favourite games isLonely Mountains: Downhill, a mountain-biking game that has you performing extremely precise adjustments to your trajectory down increasingly treacherous mountains, soundtracked by minimalist nature sounds and the sound of your rider smacking into boulders.Knights and Bikesis another lovable cycling-based adventure with the vibe of a 1980s summer holiday, starring a couple of kids exploring an island on two wheels.View image in fullscreenPedal (not) to the metal … Wheel World.Photograph: Messhof/SteamLately I’ve been playing Wheel World, from California developer Messhof (who also made the one-on-one fencing classic Nidhogg). You ride around a sizeable island on an easy-to-handle racing bike, keeping an eye out for hidden paths and ramps and bike parts and taking on local riders in races when you feel like it. It’s a low-octane, cartoon-coloured Forza Horizon on a bike; a game that captures both the freedom and peace of cycling. You don’t feel like you’re controlling a vehicle; you can’t control gravity and wind and the contours of the road. Instead, you just ride.I’ve been recovering from an inconvenient, painful injury for most of this year (hence my periods of absence from the newsletter), so relatively undemanding, feelgood games are just what the doctor ordered. Wheel World is a racing game that calms the nervous system, a rare thing indeed. You are chosen at the start by an ancient bike spirit, and must challenge the island’s speediest champions to reclaim supernatural bike parts. Unlike in Lonely Mountains, none of this is particularly difficult – I was winning races effortlessly most of the time – but it feels really good to ride around, winding up hills and then freewheeling down towards the city at the centre of the island, heading out to the Provence-reminiscent farmland where you share the road with tractors. You don’t even have to worry too much about sticking to the tarmac.I’ve played a few racing games that are structured like Wheel World, but none thatfeellike it. It made me feel entirely at ease. It’s a whole game-world constructed entirely around bike worship, with no complications and no distractions. Tooling your ride is half the fun, as every new part slightly changes how it feels to pedal around (and they come in fun colours). The soundtrack is exactly energetic enough during races and exactly absent enough when you’re riding around enjoying the vibe and looking for something to do. After five hours or so I was clearly overqualified to take on the final race, but I didn’t want it to end, so I spent another evening exploring everywhere I hadn’t been yet instead. Everywhere I went was explicitly designed for two-wheeled pleasure.Sometimes in a period of physical or emotional recovery, you are in need of a huge game to get lost in; sometimes you just need something short and sweet with the power to lift your mood. Wheel World has helped me miss riding my real bike a little bit less.What to playView image in fullscreenTop Gear … Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater.Photograph: KonamiLongtime readers will know that I have bounced off every Hideo Kojima game I’ve ever played, but our critic Tom Regan was delighted to return to Metal Gear Solid 3, which is being rereleased later this week asMetal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater. “Snake Eater is a leaner, meaner Metal Gear, a cold war caper owing just as much to James Bond as it does Apocalypse Now,”he writes. “Kojima makes no secret of his love of Hollywood, yet where his works often balloon into unwieldy epics, this game is still his most filmic achievement to date. It’s silly, self-contained and enjoyably campy, veering from the sublime to the ridiculous with admirable swagger.

The setting is weird: an iridescent, far-future imagining of New England where organic and non-organic matter mingle in strange, alchemical ways. And the characters are undeniably quirky: one is a bird called Twig whose beak is made from driftwood. Strangest of all: you play as a lighthouse that has inexplicably become animate, sprouting tiny, spindly little legs to carry its wibbling, wobbling body.In the sea of action-hero young men and, to a lesser degree, women, the lighthouse stands out as an unlikely star. Creative lead Lee Petty is a little fuzzy on the details of how it came to be. Rather, he talks about the creation of the protagonist as he does the broader action-adventure experience: as if it rose out of his subconscious. Despite the ostensible absurdity, Petty believes there is a certain intuition about it. “You have a light, and light has a very strong connection with life,” he says. “You can imagine the verbs for the player, and the actions, puzzles, mechanics that fall out of that.”View image in fullscreen‘Life has continued to evolve in completely unexpected ways’ … Keeper.Photograph: Double FineThe lighthouse’s illuminated beacon is the primary way you interact with the game’s teeming island setting. In “unfocused” mode, you direct the beam about a fantastical environment, causing foliage and small creatures to grow, change and morph. In “focused” mode, the light’s power is concentrated: larger objects undergo transformation while some materials are repelled or attracted; this is the basis of the game’s more involved puzzles.Keeper’s world is one of gauzy, psychedelic purples and deep, verdant greens. We see bioluminescent rock formations, tree-sized tendrils protruding from their gigantic flower heads, and a gorgeous, whale-like creature floating through the sky, vegetation growing unexpectedly on its back. This ecological extravaganza is partly inspired by 1980s fantasy movies such as The Dark Crystal and The NeverEnding Story, “weird” and “imperfect” works, admits Petty, yet “so earnest in their desire to create a world that you haven’t seen before”.View image in fullscreenGauzy, psychedelic purples … Keeper.Photograph: Double FineReal life proved just as inspiring for the creative lead. During Covid lockdowns, he walked alone in the pretty foothills south of his San Francisco home. Petty gazed at the abundant vegetation while meditating on what the planet might look like should humanity cease to exist. He was also reading books and watching movies about mycelium networks, thinking deeply about the interconnectedness and interdependence of ecosystems.This deluge of feelings, real-world circumstances and reference material coalesced as a fever dream, says Petty. He envisioned a “a weird island, a sort of surreal, post-human thing, where life has continued to evolve in completely unexpected ways”.The game’s genesis arrived shortly after Petty’s award-winning employer Double Fine, maker of trippy platformerPsychonauts 2,Stackingand many other idiosyncratic titles, was acquired by Microsoft. The new management was receptive to his experimental idea: he was given the time and resources to explore the concept before locking down its form. Keeper seems to have embodied the laid-back approach of its making: the vibe is languorously dreamy with many opportunities to slow down and smell the enchanting and totally bizarre roses.“You’re not rushed along, you’re not given mission objectives. There are no pop-ups on the screen with meta-rewards,” says Petty. “You’re kind of left to dwell in the space.”And yet there is a grim irony that may yet sour this sweet, whimsical experience: Keeper’s vivid celebration of life is being funded by Microsoft at a time when the company’s cloud-based storage platformAzure has been usedto facilitate the preparation of deadly airstrikes and military operations in Gaza and the West Bank. The the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement has called for the boycott of Microsoft and Xbox products. Recently, unionised workers at French studio Arkane, also owned by Microsoft, issued an open letter stating that its parent company “has no place being accomplice of a genocide”. Microsoft has sinceclaimed to be investigatingthe use of its platform in this manner, which is, it claims, a breach of the terms of service.Petty, of course, is far removed from the decisions made by his bosses at Microsoft, and he stresses as much. He says this is the “downside” of being owned by a much larger organisation, one whose purview extends far beyond entertainment. “I’m not in control. Double Fine is not necessarily tacitly endorsing anything of our parent company,” he says. “We’re just trying to make great games.”Keeper is due for release on PC andXboxin OctoberExplore more on these topicsPCSummer games previewsGamesXboxXbox series S/XfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They are less equipped to withstand the normalization of exceptional measures: the use of federal agents to quell domestic protest, the staging of police raids on the homes of leaders’ political opponents, the pretextual invocations of emergency powers. Each of these steps may seem temporary and targeted; they may even enjoy a thin patina of legality. But over time, a democratic order turns into what Ernst Fraenkel, a German-Jewish lawyer whose book The Dual State stands as one of the first and most perceptive examinations of Hitler’s regime, called a “prerogative state” – a government in which the executive “is released from all legal restraints and depends solely on the discretion of the persons wielding political power”.Trump is wrong about crime – but right about the fear of it | Austin SaratRead moreSo let us be clear: Trump’s commandeering of control of the Washington DC police department was simply an opening salvo. While Americans were greeted with images of soldiers in combat gear, toting rifles and establishing roadblocks and checkpoints near the National Mall, Trump was alreadytasking his defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, with creating “specialized units” of the national guard to be “specifically trained and equipped to deal with public order issues”.What are the politics behind this militarization of domestic policing? Trump says he alone has the will and resources to pacify the “killing field” of Chicago, but clearly his “crime fighting” justification is no more than a ruse. Statistics – that is, reality – tell us that the crime rate in Washington DC was at a 30-year low when Trump sent in the troops. Which is not to deny the rhetorical power of ruses. Installing soldiers in Democratic strongholds allows Trump to present himself as the protector of law and order, especially to Maga supporters who have been trained by rightwing news outlets to view the nation’s largest and most multiethnic metropolitan areas as dens of iniquity and vice. Never mind that this is the president who pardoned members of the lawless mob that stormed the Capitol, fired career justice department prosecutors who worked to hold insurrectionists to account, and has installed in the department the likes of Jared Lane Wise, an insurgent who wascharged with urginghis fellow rioters to kill members of the police.The specter of city streets patrolled by soldiers trained to fight enemy combatants, not US citizens, may well serve not to quell violence but to invite itMilitarizing the police also serves Trump’s politics of intimidation. Here we can connect the deployment of troops on the National Mall to the FBI’s raid on John Bolton’s residences. Both are disturbing displays of the kind of force more familiar to a police state than to a constitutional democracy. The fact that both acts were formally legal – two federal magistrates signed off on the Bolton warrants, while several statutes specific to the District of Columbia authorized the president’s use of the national guard – makes them textbook examples of the kind of dictatorial creep that Fraenkel diagnosed.Deploying troops to policeChicagowould, of course, represent a far more alarming and legally dubious exercise of executive power. The Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, a post-Reconstruction law, essentially bars presidents from using troops as domestic police. But we would be naive to conclude that federal law provides an adequate safeguard against the consolidation of the prerogative state. The Insurrection Act carves out disturbing exceptions to the Posse Comitatus Act, allowing the president, in cases of “rebellion”, to deploy the military to enforce federal law. Would a supreme court that has held that a president enjoys broad immunity from future prosecution for all “official acts”, no matter how nefarious, question a president’s determination of what constitutes a “rebellion”?Trump’s DC takeover is a move of staggering hypocrisy | Rebecca SolnitRead moreWhile the appearance of troops on the streets of Chicago or New York may frighten marginalized communities from exercising their basic rights of free movement, it may also trigger an equally dangerous and predictable response. The specter of city streets patrolled by soldiers trained to fight enemy combatants, not US citizens, may well serve not to quell violence but to invite it. The prospect of protests turning ugly and violent is all too real. The deployment of troops, under the pretext of responding to an emergency, then works to create the very emergency that justifies an ever-greater deployment. The danger is this is precisely what the president wants.Why? Trump has already aggressively inserted himself in the battle over the 2026 midterms, pushing Texas tofurther gerrymanderits already gerrymandered districts;jesting that warmay supply a justification for delaying elections; and pledging toissue an executive orderending mail-in ballots – while clearly lacking the authority to do so. What if he were to deploy troops to polling places on election day?In principle, a strong edifice of law explicitly bars such a deployment on election day, but imagine if the president, in the wake of a series of violent protests, invokes the Insurrection Act to “safeguard” polling stations from domestic unrest. Now we have armed soldiers at polling stations, handling ballots and “monitoring” the chain of custody – all done in the name of protecting democracy. Legally, such a deployment would stretch the Insurrection Act beyond recognition, but courts deliberate slowly; elections are decided in days.As Fraenkel noted, authoritarianism does not operate outside law; it manipulates law until legality and illegality are indistinguishable.Lawrence Douglas is a professor of law at Amherst College in MassachusettsExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionTrump administrationChicagoWashington DCUS policingUS Capitol attackUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Last week, when he was making his bogus boasts about ending six wars, Trump said Ukraine is “the only one left” – showing he doesn’t even see what’s happening in Gaza as a war he wants to stop.In three weeks’ time, Trump will touch down in the UK for his second state visit, which willinclude a state banquetat Windsor Castle hosted by King Charles.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump with the late Queen during his state visit to the UK in June 2019.Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PAOne of the great privileges of being the leader of my party is that my wife, Emily, and I are invited to attend state banquets. Receiving an invitation from the king is an enormous honour, and I take very seriously my duty to our sovereign. As a member of parliament, I have proudly sworn by almighty God that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to His Majesty King Charles, his heirs and successors. To refuse an invitation like this goes against all of my instincts.But having thought and prayed long and hard about it with Emily, I have come to the conclusion that on this occasion I must refuse.This is not about the many other issues on which I profoundly disagree with President Trump. I think Keir Starmer is right to engage with him, although I do wish he were tougher with Trump on everything from tariffs to Vladimir Putin. Indeed, I argued last January that we should use the offer of a state visit – something Trump so desperately craves – as leverage to persuade him to do the right thing. I believe the US is an important ally, no matter who is in the White House, and I strongly believe in sitting down and negotiating with the president, no matter our disagreements.So what it comes down to now is this: I fear we could have a situation where Trump comes to our country, is honoured with a lavish dinner at one of our finest palaces, and nobody reminds him that he has the power to stop the horrifying starvation, death and captivities in Gaza. And no one uses this moment to demand that the US president pick up that phone to Netanyahu and the Qataris and do the right thing.I feel a responsibility to do whatever I can to ensure the people in Gaza are not forgotten during the pomp and ceremony, and to ensure the UK makes Trump’s personal responsibility for securing peace inIsraeland Palestine an issue.Boycotting the state banquet is not something I ever wanted to do, but I believe it is the only way I can send a message to both Trump and Starmer that they cannot close their eyes and wish this away.

On 21 August, just nine days later, the White House published a list of said offending fixtures – the majority of which include exhibits, programming and artwork that highlight the Black, Latino and LGBTQ+ perspectives on the American project. Included in his bill of particulars was an exhibit that rightly depicts Benjamin Franklin as an enslaver, an art installation that acknowledges race as a social construct and a display that highlights racist voter suppression measures, among others.The assault on the Smithsonian comes wrapped, as it were, as part of a broader attack on democracy, scenes of which we see playing out every day. The federal occupation ofWashington DC, the crackdown on free speech on campus, the targeting of Trump’s political opponents, the gerrymandering of democracy – these are interwoven elements of the same structural assault. So with many fires burning across the nation, concerned citizens who are answering the call to fight the destruction of democracy may regard his attack on history and memory as a mere skirmish, a distraction from the herculean struggle against fascism unfolding in the US. But this is a mistake. Trump’s attack on American museums, education and memory, along with his weaponization of racialized resentment to package his authoritarian sympathies as mere patriotism, is a critical dimension of his fascist aims. The fight for democracy cannot avoid it, nor its racial conditions of possibility.Trump’s attacks on the ‘Blacksonian’ have a history in a century-old myth | Saida GrundyRead moreFascism always has a central cultural component, because it relies on the construction of amythic past. The mythic past is central to fascism because it enables and empowers a sense of grievance by a dominant racial or ethnic group whose consent is crucial to the sustainability of the project. In Maga world, the mythic past was pure, innocent and unsullied by women or Black leaders. In this kind of politics, the nation was once great, a byproduct of the great achievements of the men in the dominant racial group. In short, the assault on the Smithsonian and, more broadly, against truthful history and critical reflection is part of the broader fascist attack on democracy.From this vantage point, racial equality is a threat to the story of the nation’s greatness because only the men of the dominant group can be great. To represent the nation’s founding figures as flawed, as any accurate history would do, is perceived, in this politics, as a kind of treason.The success of the fascist dismantling of democracy is predicated on the widespread systematic failure to see the larger picture. The anti-woke assault that is a key pillar of Trumpism is part of that failure, partly due to the racial blinders and enduring ambivalence of too many in positions of leadership in the media and elsewhere. Those who sign on to the attack on “wokeness” but regard themselves as opponents of the other elements of the fascist assault are under the mistaken assumption that these projects can be disaggregated. In fact, the dismantling of democracy and of racial justice are symbiotically entangled. To support one is to give cover for the others.It is no coincidence that this ‘proper’ ideology Trump exposes is constitutive of a more well-known strand of fascism – nazismIt is clear that the Trump administration understands this relationship and fully weaponizes racist appeals as a foundational piece of its fascist agenda. And if this was once the quiet part, it is now pronounced out loud in official government documents. In an executive order issued on 27 March 2025 titled “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History”, Trump reveals that his mandate to ban “improper ideologies” targets core commitments repudiating a scientific racism that historically naturalized racial hierarchy thereby neutralizing resistance. According to Trump, the problem with the Smithsonian American Art Museum’s exhibit The Shape of Power: Stories ofRaceand American Sculpture was that it promoted the idea that “race is a human invention”.The understanding that race is a social construct as opposed to a biological fact is perhaps the most fundamental advance in repudiating enslavement, genocide and segregation. Rejecting the idea that racial inequality is natural or pre-ordained – a claim that grounded enslavement and dispossession in America – forms the cornerstone of the modern commitment to a fully inclusive democracy. Trump’s declaration that this cornerstone is “improper” is an effort to turn the clock back, upending the entire American postwar project. It is no coincidence that this “proper” ideology Trump exposes is constitutive of a more well-known strand of fascism – nazism. How else can we understand why Maya Angelou was purged from the Naval Academy library while Adolf Hitler remains?The fight against fascism in the US must be as robust in its embrace of racial equality as Trump’s embrace of outdated ideas about race and racism. The defense of memory, of truthful history, of telling the whole American story rather than ascribing agency in history to the deeds of “great men” is vital to the American democratic project. A pro-democratic education fosters the agency of its citizens by teaching about social movements that overturned entrenched hierarchies which blocked democratic equality and imposed racial tyranny. The story of how ordinary Americans lived and struggled and remade America is essential knowledge in developing and sustaining a multiracial democracy. The Smithsonian has been a vital institution in making this knowledge accessible to the masses. The National Museum of the American Latino and the National Museum of the American Indian, for example, provide artifacts and perspectives about the nation’s westward expansion that challenge the myth of unoccupied territory and manifest destiny. The National Museum of African American History and Culture brings forward the global scale of enslavement as well as its infusion across national institutions, culture and politics.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Fascist erasures like Trump’s hide behind the claim that truthful encounters with the past inflame and divide. This instinct is the opposite of the truth. A functioning democracy does not restrict perspectives to those of the dominant group, much less make it illegal to teach alternative ones.A people who cannot remember their past are a people who cannot resist a fascist future. Knowing our history can give us the weapons and wherewithal to battle Trump’s efforts to catapult us back to a time when the majority of Americans lacked both the civic and economic power that we have now. The fight for our museums and for our memory is a critical bulwark against the unraveling of American democracy.

The trend is so widespread that it’s even got a name:Mar-a-Lago face. Among women the look is characterised by huge lips that look as if they could suck up a small child whole, frozen facial expressions, and cheeks so bulbous you could hide a gerbil underneath them. Men also have the slickfrozen faces, but instead of bigger lips they’re pairing them with bigger jaws. In recent years,surgeons have reporteda large increase of male clients demanding stronger jawlines.I wouldn’t normally be snarky about someone’s looks but let’s be clear: nobody is born with Mar-a-Lago face. These are not human faces, they are luxury meat-masks meant to signal wealth and in-group belonging. People such as Laura Loomer, Kristi Noem, and Matt Gaetz can afford excellent surgeons and subtle cosmetic work but, unless they’ve all had botched procedures, it seems they deliberately chose to look like AI-generated caricatures. One can only surmise that they live in such weird little bubbles, where everyone is addicted to filler, that this sort of conspicuous consumption of cosmetic surgery has become desirable.Having the right look is certainly desirable to optics-obsessed Donald Trump, whose chief concern for his underlings appears to be how they perform on TV. In 2017, an Axios report claimed that Trump wanted his female staff to “dress like women” and demanded that his male employees have a “certain look.” Over the years it seems the “certain look” has only become more extreme.An obsession with traditional gender norms also seems to factor into today’s exaggerated aesthetics. Earlier this year a New York-based dermatologisttold Politicothat fashion often shifts to more traditional gender expression in culturally conservative times. “It’s ironic … that they’re so against trans-ness and gender-affirming care for trans people,” the dermatologist said of Trump’s inner orbit. “Because, you know, they’re all doing their own gender-affirming care.” The Zambian bum-stick chimps seem positively sophisticated in comparison.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Until you think about it ...David LengelRob Manfred is taking aim at the old league structure, renewing the battle between the National Pastime’s traditional and reform factionsWed 27 Aug 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 27 Aug 2025 11.32 EDTShareIt’s been more than a week since MLB commissioner Rob Manfred dropped his latest bomb. Manfred, as we’ve learned, enjoys throwing ideas out into the universe to get his sport some easy pop while seeing how the masses will react. Just a few months back, he scrambled the brains of baseball fans with his idea of a “golden at bat”, which would allow a chosen player to come to the plate, once a game, when it wasn’t their turn to hit. Oh, he got his publicity alright:many of us took the bait. Was it a genuine, bona fide idea? Probably not. When MLB is serious about a rule change we tend to see it played out in the minor leagues, and last I heard, baseball lineups were still linear down on the farms.Now Manfred, who has brought unprecedented change to on-field rules – the pitch clock, the shift ban, three batter reliever minimums, the ghost runner, just to name just a few – is back playing with the heads of the public, this time, floating plans to realign baseball’s 30 teams, who will be upped to 32 if the sport adds two more franchises through expansion, which the circuit is widely expected to do. Nashville, Salt Lake City, Raleigh and Portlandare seen to be front runners, with Montreal looming as an outside shot. This could effectively end the league structure which has governed baseball since 1903, back when the upstart American Leaguemade peace with the senior National Leagueand agreed to settle scores in a World Series rather than trying to run each other out of business.Manfred’s latest idea led to a flurry of freak outs on the internet, and when everyone caught their breath,a wave of realignment ideas, some of which blew up the leagues entirely and some of which kept them mostly intact, flooded the zone. As a 50-year old baseball fan, my knee-jerk reaction was to side with Howie Rose, the cherished radio voice of the New York Mets.“This is what I’ve been telling you is inevitable for quite a while now,” said Rose on X. “The American League (1901) and the National League (1876) will cease to exist as we know them. The last move before total destruction of the traditions that made baseball great.”Over the week I took a breath, began to break it all down and began to change my tune. I asked myself, “how is it that these leagues, which came together as a result of brutal, turn of the 19th century commerce, can be responsible for the traditions that made baseball great?”The more I thought about Rose’s claim, and the complaints of other fans citing “tradition” the more suspect it felt. Surely it’s the players, teams, games, drama, the physical on-field feats, the records, the stadiums, the hot dogs, peanuts and the Cracker Jacks rather than what team plays in what league that made us fall for baseball. We have some semi-recent evidence to support this. TheMilwaukee Brewersonce played in the AL West, the AL East and the AL Central before shifting to the NL Central for the 1998 season. The Houston Astros once played in the NL West and the NL Central before moving to the play in the AL West in 2013. Did those fanbases fall apart when these changes arrived? Hardly.So upon such reflection,I’m going full Adam Curtis:those against dramatic realignment – and I am probably speaking mostly about fans over 35 here – are perhaps subconsciously, protecting the memories and stories of their childhood. That was when their love of baseball was formed, and there were significant differences between the AL and NL – from strike zone, to league presidents that actually had a say in the governing of the game – and All-Star games where folks really cared which league won. The further baseball gets away from that version of the sport, the more out of sorts and confused these older fans feel about the world they live in now. And they seem like the loudest online when it comes to this subject.That’s probably a bit much for a baseball column, but really, that’s exactly why nostalgia is so powerful, because it ushers folks back into the comfortable world they know best. And really, such involuntary spasms are unwarranted, meaning the hours I spent panicking about the DH coming to the NL were actually a total waste: the universal DH is here and it’s fine!This is in stark contrast to younger fans, who got into baseball right around the time the umpires and strike zones were all folded together, inter-league play was up and running, the central divisions and wildcard spots were introduced, league offices were history and winning the All-Star Game began to decline in importance to fans and players alike. Those fans are generally more open to change, with significantly less of an emotional attachment to the structures of an American and National League.So, to the older traditionalists, and reactionary younger fans, if we say goodbye to the American and National Leagues, don’t fret. Welcome the potential of four, eight team divisions. A super division of the Red Sox, Phillies, Mets and the Yankees. That Seattle could finally have a semi-local team like Portland close by. That a rivalry such as Minnesota and Milwaukee rivalry could be revitalized. That cats and dogs can indeed live together! No, that’s not anything close to the baseball set up of my childhood, and no, this acceptance does not in any way serve as an endorsement of Manfred, who’s job is to try andscratch out as many pennies as he can for owners.But major changes to baseball’s structure are inevitable, and whatever they throw at us, as long as the game on the field is recognizable, and they keep that golden at-bat as far away from MLB as possible, I’m in.Explore more on these topicsMLBUS sportsBaseballNew York MetsNew York YankeesBoston Red SoxMilwaukee BrewerscommentShareReuse this content"

Past examples are not encouragingWed 27 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 27 Aug 2025 10.09 EDTShareAfter an unusual August of geopolitical summitry, the reality is sinking in that Europe is on its own in defending Ukraine’s sovereignty and hence its own security against Russian aggression and cannot count on much support from the United States.The sense of strategic loneliness in an increasingly brutal global power contest follows a summer of submission in which the EU accepted amanifestly unbalanced trade dealimposed by Donald Trump and pledged improbably large investments in the US while European Nato members promised to boost their defence spending to an aspirational 5% of gross domestic product – all to appease Trump in hopes of keeping the US engaged in European security.To be sure, it could have been worse.By accompanyingthe Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, to the White House last week, the leaders of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Finland and the European Commission displayed their unity in rejecting Vladimir Putin’s demands for territorial concessions to end the war, which Trump had come close to echoing. They managed to mitigate some of the political damage caused by Trump’s red-carpet welcome for the Russian president in Alaska and secured a vague pledge from Trump that the US would provide some support to a European-led security force for Ukraine in case of a ceasefire agreement.However, Trump once again ruled out Nato membership for Kyiv and dropped the demand that Russia accept an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine without securing any reciprocal concession from Putin, and he let another self-declared deadline for tougher sanctions against Moscow slip by without any action. Nor did he give any assurance that Europe would have a seat in any future peace negotiations. Moreover, his Treasury secretary said theUS would charge a 10% mark-upon all European purchases of American weaponry for Ukraine – in effect a war tax on its own allies.The White House made clear any US support for a reassurance force being mustered by the UK and France for Ukraine would not involve “boots on the ground”. Trump hinted Washington might provide air power but the Pentagon’s policy chief told European military chiefs that US assistance would be very limited. It’s not clear how far the Europeans will be able to rely on crucial US intelligence sharing, let alone US backup if European forces were to come under attack in Ukraine. Washington isreported to have stopped sharing intelligenceabout its Ukraine-Russia negotiations even with its closest Five Eyes allies – the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand – on the orders of Trump’s intelligence coordinator, Tulsi Gabbard.That means European governments weighing up whether to commit ground troops, air forces, anti-missile defences, naval units or trainers to support postwar Ukraine cannot be sure that the US may not suddenly blind them, withholding vital intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance ifRussiawere to begin another military buildup or resume hostilities.Europe’s de facto leadership group also faces political and economic challenges at home as it struggles to boost military and financial support to Kyiv and put together a credible plan for postwar security “guarantees”.Impressive as it was, the White House show of European unity and resolve is already fraying. The Italian deputy prime minister,Matteo Salvini, has deridedPresident Emmanuel Macron’s call to put European forces in Ukraine. The German chancellor,Friedrich Merz, is under firewithin his own coalition for suggesting that Berlin would contribute troops to the reassurance force being put together by the “coalition of the willing”.There were also questions about the absence of Poland, a resolute supporter and neighbour of Ukraine and the strongest central European state, from the Oval Office summit,apparently due to a standoffbetween the pro-EU prime minister, Donald Tusk, and the new pro-Trump president, Karol Nawrocki. Warsaw has said it won’t contribute troops to a European force because it needs them to defend its own borders with Russia and Belarus. Meanwhile, awkward choices loom over Turkey’s participation in any European-led security force. Ankara, which controls access to the Black Sea, is likely to seek political concessions from the EU, including access to EU-funded rearmament projects as a trade-off for committing its forces.This all raises the fundamental question of whether a European-led coalition of states can really provide credible security guarantees for Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire. What would be the defined mission and the rules of engagement for a reassurance force, with what US orNatobackup in case it came under Russian attack? Do the key European states with uncertain US backing have the political will and staying power to deter Putin, whose aim is precisely to push the US out of European security and divide the Europeans among themselves?Memories of European peacekeeping failures in Bosnia in the 1990s and of the pusillanimous European response to Russia’s 2014 seizure of Crimea from Ukraine are not encouraging.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Strengthening Ukraine with arms, trade benefits and financial support is by far the most useful contribution the Europeans can make.With Putin showing no sign of ending the war or engaging in serious peace negotiations, and Trump reluctant to exert any real pressure on Russia, the Europeans’ ability to secure any ceasefire seems unlikely to be put to the test.That’s just as well, since we are still far from having a credible political and military capability to deter Russia without dependable US support.Paul Taylor is a senior visiting fellow at the European Policy CentreExplore more on these topicsUkraineOpinionEuropean UnionEuropeNatoUS foreign policyDonald TrumpRussiacommentShareReuse this content"

No. Do I need to know what’s huge on your screechy TikTok? No, no. What’s all the rage in Bollywood? No, no, no. A whiny clip from a soap opera? No and no, thrice no. Whether your relative in Kraków or Kingston, Jamaica or Manilla or Washington state passed his or her exams? Hell no! Good luck to them. Good luck to you – but put some headphones on.​We all have rights and in the noisy, vibrant cities of this country, there’s room for free expression, but here’s the thing: we also have a duty of care. Your decision – and yes, it is a specific decision – to share your experience with me, without any consideration of me or anyone else, was always prohibited under the bylaws ofTfL. Now they will erect signs reminding you of that and asking that you be considerate.True, signs only get you so far; they don’t act as a muffler or an off button. But in this case they set a benchmark and highlight rules that the travelling public, seeking respite, aware that many an overground railway train already has “quiet carriages”, can reasonably ask to be enforced on the buses and the capital’s tube lines.So perhaps this is the end of “headphone dodging”, as they call it. Perhaps it is just the beginning of the end. I don’t know how an overstretched transport authority – already struggling to catch fare dodgers – can possibly have the resources to police it. But I am hoping it won’t really have to.There are rules, often unspoken, about what seems legitimate practice in shared space. You might not like a particular busker, but many have the imprimatur of being licensed by public authority, which means your personal like or dislike takes a back seat to the view of others. As for the ones that aren’t licensed, if they are too annoying to too many people, they are silenced by society’s indifference and pointed refusal to part with any money.The TikTok sharers, the Bollywood blarers, the football highlights transmitters, the open mic’d menaces: they break the rules both unspoken and official. Let the “headphones on” signs go up – and let the people be the cavalry.Hugh Muir is executive editor, OpinionExplore more on these topicsTfLOpinionTransportLondonPublic transportRail transportcommentShareReuse this content"

Social media thrives on mimicry – but this was a step too farEsme HewittAt its best, the internet can be a space where people share stories and ideas. But the line between inspiration and theft can easily become blurredWed 27 Aug 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 27 Aug 2025 10.32 EDTShareLast month, I wrote an article aboutbeing adopted by a British couple during the era of China’sone-child policy. Three days after the story ran in anational newspaper, my phone buzzed with a flurry of messages from a friend who had sent me a TikTok post by an influencer telling her life story to camera. Twenty seconds into her video, my jaw plummeted. She had recited entire sections of my article, word for word, to her 20,000 followers. She didn’t even have the courtesy to give me a credit.When I wrote that piece, the idea of exposing personal details of my life to scrutiny or criticism was terrifying. Even so, it felt right to share this story in the hope that others might find comfort if they too had had similar experiences. What I wasn’t expecting was for someone to take my words and claim them as their own.The influencer spoke of her adoption but she took sections of the article in which I discussed my intimate thoughts and feelings, and passed these off as her own. She recited how “in my early twenties, I measured my self-worth in how many matches I got on Tinder or how many boys I was texting”, and having “imagined a childhood in China and being raised by my biological parents”. Taking the exact phrases I had written, she reposted them to her followers, and then thanked users in the comments when they complimented her. I understand that imitation is the highest form of flattery but this was blatant stealing.View image in fullscreenEsme Hewitt’s article about her life that appeared in the Times, and was plagiarised on TikTok.I commented on the video: “Have you heard of plagiarism?” Soon afterwards, her husband appeared in my DMs on Instagram.He told me I wasn’t “the only Asian in the world adopted in that time frame”, dismissed me as “not that special” and even claimed I had copied his wife’s original videos. I called them both crazy and immediately blocked him.After this, I felt I had to set the record straight. So the next morning I made a video arguing that the influencer was plagiarising my work and included clips of her video alongside my article as proof. In response to myTikTok, she and her husband posted a video, insisting: “Her story and experience is also my story and experience … I did not steal her story.” Hours later she posted another video, apologising for using my words and saying she was sorry for any hurt feelings, and that her intent was not “malicious”. She also messaged me privately to apologise.Plagiarism– passing off someone else’s words or ideas as your own without sourcing or credit – is a career-ending offence in most industries. At university, it was drilled into me that you could be expelled if your essay included too much text that borrowed from existing work without giving it credit. The message was explicit: you do not plagiarise.View image in fullscreenEsme HewittYet on social media the message is far more ambiguous. While TikTok explains that copyright protects “original works of authorship” and bans users from posting content that infringes anyone else’s intellectual property, it also states that copyright does not extend to underlying ideas: “For example, a person may own the copyright to a film, but not the underlying plot or themes that are expressed in the film.” With Instagram, the platform encourages creators to post original content, but in practice plagiarism and infringement often go unnoticed unless a creator spots and reports it themselves. YouTube, at least, has built-in systems that can scan videos and let rights holders set the rules, but there is little to protect smaller creators whose ideas are stolen, or when work is lifted from across the internet.Platforms thrive on mimicry. Originality is rare. So much so that when someone creates something new, it’s often copied by thousands of others in a matter of hours, with little or no credit given to the original creator.The media critic and gaming YouTuber Harry Brewis, also known asHbomberguy, made a video on plagiarism in 2023 which became a surprise hit (it has clocked up some 38m views to date). He gave 17 examples where YouTube creators had stolen words, content and ideas from smaller creators or online forums, observing that “plagiarists seem to have this belief that they are better than their targets…: ‘Your ideas are wasted on you. They’d be much better served in my videos.’”Aspiring creators need content to help them gain followers, and established creators reliant on advertising revenue need to churn out content at pace. Any work, be it a piece of writing or a video, requires time and effort, but the incentive is to make a lot of work, quickly. In theory, audiences prize originality and fresh, exciting content – but for creators who post every day, publishing new content so often is unrealistic, leading some to copy and imitate others.The line between inspiration and theft can easily become blurred. An original idea trends when people are able to take a concept and make it their own, allowing memes and in-jokes to develop. Once enough people replicate an idea, it transforms into a trend and the source often disappears entirely. Take, for example, theNothing beats a Jet2 holidaytrend, which has inspired some 2.9m videos. Creators have taken the sound from the Jet2holidays advert and overlaid it on clips of things going spectacularly wrong – a tent catching fire, someone flying off a boat – turning the original ad into something entirely new.The flip side of this is that once an idea exists online, it’s regarded as fair game to copy without credit. My video went viral, with thousands of users in the comments supporting me and debating online plagiarism. My story then gained another life. Other creators posted “drama” and explainer videos of the situation I had already outlined in my video. I was delighted to see the situation sparking a wider debate, but I couldn’t help but be sceptical of their motivations. Were the people now weighing in on the story doing so to shed light on plagiarism or to chase views?At its best the internet can be a space where people share stories and ideas, and where creativity inspires more creativity. Giving credit is non negotiable. It creates a positive cycle where new ideas build on old ones, and where the time and effort someone has put into their work is recognised. In giving credit where it’s due, creators may feel incentivised to create rather than race to produce quick shareable content in the fear that their work might be stolen. Originality deserves celebration – and not to be reduced to simply content mined for virality.Esme Hewitt is a freelance journalistExplore more on these topicsPlagiarismOpinionTikTokChina's one-child policyDigital mediaSocial mediacommentShareReuse this content"

But my loathing runs deeper than thatWed 27 Aug 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 27 Aug 2025 15.25 EDTShareIt’s one of those topics that comes up over drinks or dinner at the moment: whether or not you think AI is going to steal your job. So far, I’ve felt relatively confident that while AI could no doubt have a fair crack at writing a newspaper opinion column, there is something I do as part of my work that AI cannot: reporting.Except now, it seems, AI is claiming to be doing that as well. Last week, it was revealed thatat least six reputable publicationshave had to take down published articles because it turned out that they were probably pieces of fiction written by AI and then passed off by somebody as works of journalism under the name of Margaux Blanchard. One of these was a piece for Wired titled They Fell in Love Playing Minecraft. Then the Game Became Their Wedding Venue, which quoted a “digital celebrant” called Jessica Hu, who does not seem to actually exist. Another publication, called Dispatch, received a pitch from “Blanchard” about an ex-mining town called Gravemont that had been repurposed as a training ground for death investigation. Gravemont doesn’t exist either.When I get into social conversations on subjects like ChatGPT, I try to fight the red mist that descends on me. I hate ChatGPT. And I call it hatred because it provokes a physical reaction in me of something just below real anger. I don’t find it scary, or annoying, or confusing. I hate it.So I’ve been trying to get to the bottom of what it is exactly that I hate. There are decent reasons to rejoice at the advent of the AI age. It seems likely that it will have the capacity to revolutionise, for instance, scientific endeavour: a scientist friend of mine described how AI would speed up the process of coming up with and testing hypotheses in his field. Mundane work tasks will also take less time with the help of AI.But there are also plenty of reasons to chafe against it. There’s the well-documented environmental impact of using ChatGPT. But with respect to Earth, this isn’t the element that has me wringing my hands the most. It’s not even that people are actively buying into a piece of technology that is likely to make many of their own jobs obsolete, or the way that the AI overviews on, say, a Google search often blithely give you straight-up wrong information. Nor the fact that the people at the forefront of the AI revolution have the crashingly terrible vibes of your classic tech bro loser.Here’s the part I suspect may be too tragically reactionary of me: I am worried that a reliance on ChatGPT will erode people’s ability to use their brains. I do believe that the creative imagination in particular is a muscle, and one that is rewarding to exercise. Recently I was helping a seven-year-old work on her creative writing for school. She had to describe a forest, so I asked her to close her eyes and picture one, and tell me what she could see. Oh, we didn’t need to do that, she told me. We could just ask AI to make one.I heard secondhand about an editor asking ChatGPT for help restructuring an article. And again, call me a luddite, but I just thought: no! Some things are supposed to be difficult! It is good for the brain to have to rise to a task! I read about someone using ChatGPT to order from a restaurant menu. It is one of the small joys of life to select what food you want to eat at a restaurant. Why cede that to a machine when you don’t have to?But that’s not even the worst of it, in my view. The worst of it is the way ChatGPT seems to be creeping into people’s personal lives. Using ChatGPT to design a workout plan, to fix a problem in some coding or to summarise a dense document, fine, fine, fine. If you like. But when I hear about people using it to write a birthday card, a best man’s speech or a breakup text, a tiny part of my soul dies. And I don’t think this is the high and mighty position of someone who’s a writer by trade. None of these pieces of writing need to be perfectly expressed or grammatically flawless. They need to come from the heart and be real.At the root of my hatred of ChatGPT is that people’s willingness to use it in this way implies they are happy to turn meaningful interactions like these into something transactional: a task to be completed efficiently and moved on from. So much of the value of, say, receiving a letter, whether emailed or in the post, comes from knowing that somebody sat down and thought about what to say. A human being spent some of their precious time and mental effort on communicating with you.I am well aware that in 15 years’ time I may be wrapping up my seamlessly AI-optimised work day, turning to my AI-powered AutoSpouse and laughing at this article. How naive I was, worried about nothing! I love you, machine programmed to mimic love! I realise, too, that my hatred of ChatGPT might one day relegate me to the scrap heap in terms of future employment opportunities, for not knowing how to wrangle AI into doing things for me. Fine. I’ll go and live in the woods and be miserable. But I will be miserable in an analogue manner, and with my ability to think intact.Imogen West-Knights is a writer and journalistExplore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

Both died.The Kanes were part of asprawling ecosystem– often dubbed “sovereign citizens” – of gurus, anti-government Facebook groups and seminars where Americans are taught that most of the country’s laws do not apply to them. Kane travelled the country sharing these ideas before he and his son shot the officers and were later killed in a shoot-out with police.While this type of violence has been rarer here, Australia has its own long and complicated history of “pseudolaw” belief.How a Victoria police search warrant at a rural Porepunkah property ended in a day of tragedyRead moreTheonline footprint of Desmond Filby, also known as Dezi Freeman, the man authorities say is suspected of killing two police officers and wounding another in Porepunkah on Tuesday, suggests an affiliation with some strains of these ideas.Videos show him being detained by police at a 2021 protest outside Myrtleford court house, held in response to a private prosecution brought against the then Victorian premier Daniel Andrews accusing him of treason during Covid. Thecase was dismissed.Freeman has appeared on a podcast that shares pseudolaw arguments, detailing his so-called arrest of a magistrate in 2019, and court records show Freeman has previously described police as “frigging Nazis”, “Gestapo” and “terrorist thugs”.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailPseudolaw is not strictly a group or movement; it has no topdown structure or membership. Adherents arrive at its core ideas – that laws are illegitimate and the government is corrupted – through a variety of possible avenues.The arguments are often dressed up in legal language that has no basis in fact. As Canadian academic Donald Netolitzkyhas written, they are “a collection of legal-sounding but false rules that purport to be law”.Nevertheless, as Cam Wilson and I found when reporting our book Conspiracy Nation, there are plenty of “gurus” out there who purport to teach desperate people how to get out of problems with their mortgage or traffic fines for a fee. And the Covid-19 pandemic seems to have had a hothouse effect.Across Australia, workers at the coalface of local courts and councils are likely to have encountered these arguments – from litigants who refuse to answer their name in court to the filing of voluminous amounts of paperwork.In the family court,as I detailedlast year, the spread of these ideas is causing immense disruption and pain and, in the worst instances, the unlawful removal of children.Of course, not all who subscribe to these ideas take extreme action. There’s a spectrum, from those who turn to them in a moment of personal crisis and others who are “true believers”.Harry Hobbs is a legal academic at UNSW who has studied pseudolaw in Australia for many years and has been travelling the country speaking with judicial officers about their encounters with people wielding pseudolaw arguments.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s time to try the truthWed 27 Aug 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 27 Aug 2025 04.39 EDTShareSo begins another chapter in the liberation struggle. Released from bondage to the EU, Britain finds itself subjugated to a more insidious foe. The border that should have been sealed is wide open. The foreign hordes are still coming, but their passage is no longer directed by bureaucrats from Brussels. This time, national emancipation depends on breaking the tyranny of human rights lawyers.That is the plot to Nigel Farage’s Brexit sequel, previewed on Tuesday in an airport hangar in Oxfordshire. The Reform UK leaderlaid out plansfor “mass deportation” of migrants – all who arrive without permission, plus those who are here already and came by illicit channels.Tens of thousands will be targeted. There would be cash incentives for anyone volunteering to leave. Refusers would be rounded up, detained in camps and flown to their countries of origin or, if those places won’t have them, some other place. A remote island, maybe. The exchequer would remunerate receptive governments.If deportees face the likely prospect of torture or death on arrival, well, that would be unfortunate but not sufficient grounds to stop the flights.There would be no legal recourse to sanctuary because the UK would withdraw from international treaties and conventions that grant protection to refugees. TheEuropean court of human rightswould have no say. The universal principles it upholds would be expunged from domestic statute, to be replaced by custom-made British rights. And in that category, there is only one entitlement Farage holds sacred – the freedom of the settled British population to live unmolested by the phantom multitude offoreign criminals posing as refugees.By calling his plan Operation Restoring Justice, Farage is hinting at future redress for the grievance, much aired in radical rightwing circles online, that police and courts operate “two-tier” policies with a systemic bias in favour of immigrants. The inference is that courts might be used as instruments of nationalist restitution, dismantling liberal multiculturalism, putting native-born Britons first.This is not an original programme. The last Conservative government passed several laws on the premise that the illegal traffic in boats across the Channel would be deterred bythreats of detention and deportation. When it didn’t work, blame fell on European convention rights that prohibit sending people to unsafe places. Ministers legislated again, creating a statutory power for ministers todeclare a country safe: Rwanda, specifically, regardless of evidence to the contrary.A bill to assert the primacy of British rights over European ones has been rattling around Tory policy cupboards for longer still.David Cameron pledged oneahead of the 2010 general election, and again in 2015. A version of it resurfaced under Boris Johnson, and even made it as far as a first reading in parliament in 2022, but no further. The problem each time has been the same. A bill that repudiated international treaties would signal Britain’s withdrawal from the community of reliable democracies, sabotaging diplomatic relations and burning alliances. No responsible prime minister would consider it. Even irresponsible ones have shied at the cost.That is no impediment to theReform UKleader. He welcomes objections to his plans on the basis of what a law-abiding government should do because his offer to the electorate is wilful transgression and denial of consequence. When politicians whose methods are deemed to have failed say a plan is reckless, Farage’s audience hears a recommendation. Recklessness sounds like a virtue if it means the status quo is in jeopardy.The Reform plan doesn’t entirely ignore the logistics of implementation. There is a cost estimate of £10bn over five years, including £2.5bn for the construction of detention centres in as yet undetermined locations. The numbers are fictions, big enough to sound serious but small enough to be easily covered by some bogus revenue source in a future manifesto.Diplomatic obligations to honour treaties are swept aside with an invocation of national emergency. Public order is imperilled by uncontrolled migration, Farage says. Then he executes a rhetorical pivot from the undesirable character of those arriving by boat – “suspected of being involved in some form of terrorism” – to the prospect of unrest in communities where there is “rising anger” and “despair” at the influx of these marauding interlopers. His warnings are threats. His forebodingfans the flames.The call to arms is amplified by what used to be called the Tory press, but now treats Farage with deference as prime minister-in-waiting. There is a lot of presumption in that posture when the next general election doesn’t have to be held before summer 2029. Reform UK currently have four MPs, 316 seats short of a working majority.But not much about Farage’s candidacy fits the conventional template of party politics. By any measure of success except parliamentary representation and ministerial offices held, he is the most significant leader of his generation. No policy action of the 21st century matchesBrexitin terms of consequence for Britain, nor even comes close. Boris Johnson can take credit for cajoling a majority to vote leave in 2016. David Cameron earns a place on the podium of shame for blundering into a referendum in the first place. But Farage’s agitation was the key. He set the goal, branded it “independence” and connected it to the high-voltage rail of anti-immigrant feeling.Whatever else leaving the EU was meant to achieve – autonomy in tariff rates, regulatory sovereignty, bendier bananas – border control was baked in as the test of a proper Brexit. Free movement had to end. That is whyTheresa May ruled out single market membershipbefore negotiations in Brussels had even started, and why Keir Starmerkeeps it off the table.That taboo prevents the prime minister properly describing the economic cost of Brexit. It mutes any recognition of all the other dimensions of national self-harm involved in withdrawal from a continental trading bloc at what history will judge to be the worst possible moment to go chasing delusions of free-trading global grandeur.Starmer is stranded in a strategic cul-de-sac, managing a stagnant economy. He struggles to address the frustration and dismay of a demoralised electorate, while the principal author of their predicament rehearses the remake.There was a tactical case to avoid making the last general election a relitigation of Brexit. There are reasons still to choose words carefully when commenting on an issue that stirred strong emotions, not to belittle the hopes and expectations of leave voters or conflate their sincerity with the venal cynicism of campaigns that lied about what was on offer.But are we really going to spend the next four years watching Farage leaf casually through the familiar playbook, running the same campaign to the fawning applause of the same courtier commentariat? Is it too much to expect aLabourgovernment to raise, by way of rebuttal, the Reform leader’s proven failure as an arbiter of the national interest? We tried listening to him. His probity and judgment were sold as the product called Brexit. It turned out to be a piece of shit. Enough people already know this is the truth, but it would be liberating to hear it from the prime minister.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Rather than falling into crude regulatory binaries, the trick might be in devolving power down to those most affected; communities, workplaces and industries that bear the brunt of change.Retirees ‘deserve’ super tax breaks, treasurer says, as government considers how to give younger Australians ‘fair go’Read moreIf there were green shoots to emerge from last week’s discussions, it’s the agreement between the tech industry and the ACTU to work to address the illegal exploitation of creative content that is underpinning AI’s large language models.A final question in this week’s report shows this very specific piece of regulation has even higher levels of support than generic regulation of AI.Which is closer to your view on whether copyright law should be changed to give tech companies free access to creative content?The tables show a shift in attitudes to the role of government regulation; in the abstract cutting red tape makes perfect sense; drilled down to specific sectors it becomes gnarlier; at the human level the case for intervention is compelling.For every act or omission a government chooses to take, there are consequences that build on themselves until they take on a form of their own.The generous takeout from the roundtable is that the government and its chosen inner circle have taken it on themselves to untangle some of the blockages that they believe are holding the nation back. But in doing so they will also be accountable for the gaps they create.Fun fact: the first Coachella was held when Pearl Jam decided to stage its own event off-grid to evade the tentacles of the corporate predator Ticketmaster. In culture as in politics, transformation comes in imagining new realities rather than submitting to the inevitability of business as usual.Whether “abundance” is just a one hit wonder or a new model for progressive politics will be determined in its adaptation.Explore more on these topicsEssential pollOpinionAustralian politicsAustralian economyJim ChalmersLabor partycommentShareReuse this content"

Then she changed her mind – and scooped comedy’s biggest prizeWed 27 Aug 2025 10.53 EDTLast modified on Wed 27 Aug 2025 15.25 EDTShareThere’s efficiency, then there’s the process that led to Sam Nicoresti winning the most prestigious award in live comedy. “A year ago my girlfriend asked me to marry her,” says Nicoresti onaccepting the £10,000 prize last weekend. “[When] we were talking about how to pay for the wedding, I joked and said, ‘It’s easy, I’ll just win the Edinburgh comedy award’.” Can it be true? Is Nicoresti not only the first transgender winner of the so-called Oscars of comedy, but the first ever to manifest victory by force of strategic will?“It’s amazing what you can do,” she grins, three days after her triumph, “if you set your mind to something.” And that’s what Nicoresti has done in the last 12 months, turning around a niche career in alt-comedy, pointing it towards stardom, and pressing her pedal to the metal.Her winning show Baby Doomerwas palpably the set of a comic zeroing in on a mass audience – notwithstanding the hot-potato status of her subject, life as a trans woman, nor her background in leftfield humour with a collective called Weirdos. Nicoresti’s previous biggest hit was a satirical multimedia show with the memorable title Cancel Anti Wokeflake Snow Culture.The comic, originally from Birmingham, is quitting Edinburgh in a state of exhaustion – and probably still some shock – when we speak. Of the moment when her name was announced and her place confirmed in the ex-Perrier award pantheon (former winners: Steve Coogan, The League of Gentlemen, Bridget Christie and many more), Nicoresti says only that “it was very surreal. You get swept off the stage instantly into the press junket. They won’t let you go back to your friends. It felt like the president had been assassinated and I was being ferried away to be sworn in.”In case the awards organisers are listening, she suggests an improvement. “They should decide who the winner is at the start of the fringe. It’s weird to leave it to the very end when you’re tired and haggard and ill. Everyone wants to ask you questions, and all you want to do is sleep.”View image in fullscreen‘They should decide who the winner is at the start of the fringe’ … picking up her Edinburgh Comedy award.Photograph: Roberto Ricciuti/Getty ImagesThere’ll be time for sleep soon enough – although not that soon, as the London run of Baby Doomer is imminent and has just been extended. Audiences can expect a high joke-count show built around one big-hitting anecdote, which recounts a humiliating experience in a changing room. The comic works up that story – of being misgendered; of trying on an ill-fitting dress – into something fantastically farcical, without soft-soaping what it implies about life as a trans woman today. That’s characteristic: the show addresses its creator’s difficulty fitting in as a woman, but its chosen analogy for Nicoresti’s transition, proffered with great nerdy enthusiasm, is the metamorphosis of the hobbit Sméagol in Lord of the Rings into the monster Gollum. Elsewhere, it alludes to the comic’s recent breakdown, and her visit to a PTSD support group – all with lightness of touch, conviviality, and more joyful self-deprecation than self-pity.How conscious was Nicoresti that she was, for the first time, making a non-niche, crowd-pleasing standup show? “This year we came in strong,” she admits, “with a dream and a goal in mind. In previous years, I’ve focused on the art and just wanted to make something silly. But the fringe is so expensive now that it doesn’t make sense to bring up work that isn’t ready.” She was also scarred by her experience with2022’s Wokeflake, whose title and concept attracted critical attention, but at a level that the show, then only a work-in-progress, wasn’t quite ready for. Says Nicoresti: “I wasn’t prepared to make that mistake again.”This is a concept show, but the concept is that I am doing ‘a standup hour’For Baby Doomer, she assembled a creative team that included first-time director (and longtime comedy promoter) David Hardcastle, and performed the show almost 30 times prior to the fringe. “I usually approach each show with a concept, whether it’s about dreams, aliens, or whatever. And I saw this one as a concept show too, but the concept was that I was doing ‘a standup hour’” – as opposed to the sketch, character or multimedia work she’d majored in previously. All of Baby Doomer’s routines went through rigorous testing, as five- or 10-minute sets in comedy clubs, before making it into the show.That’s an exacting standard to set yourself, particularly if you’re making a show on a topic that’s both personally and politically sensitive. Nicoresti had intended, she tells me,notto address gender at all in Baby Doomer. She first came out as transgender as part of the process of making Wokeflake – and, across the months and years of its stage life, that show documented the early, uncertain stages of her transition. “So when I moved on to the next show, the rule I set myself was: I’m not going to mention it at all. I failed! Actually this whole show is a monumental failure!”View image in fullscreen‘The joke is king’ … Nicoresti performing Baby Doomer.Photograph: PRIt wasthe supreme court ruling in April, that the legal definition of a woman did not include transgender women, that prompted a rethink. “I hadn’t wanted to get pigeonholed. I didn’t want to seem as if I was ‘going on about it’. But then the ruling happened and I thought, ‘Oh no, it probablyisgood that we talk about this.’” But the “talking about it” was subject to a strict directive. “As a private citizen, I’m angry, I’m upset and scared. But as a comedian, the joke is paramount. You don’t want to make people feel like they’re being preached to. The joke is king.”She feels similarly about headlines this weekend greeting the first transgender comedian to win Edinburgh’s comedy award. “Obviously, it’s cool,” says the comic (who cites “seeing more queer and trans people coming to my gigs” as her main ambition post-award triumph). “But you can see there’s a framing happening that you’re not in control of. With these two shows, I’ve tried to express something about how a queer experience can actually be universal. And because of that, I got some acclaim. But part of the acclaim is ‘trans this, trans that’. So it’s a little ironic.”On balance, Nicoresti might prefer to be seen simply as another great comic to win the award. Ask what inspired her career in comedy, and she’ll regale you with personal icons (Vic and Bob,Bill Hicks,Maria Bamford), and with tales of transcribing comedy acts in her teens, breaking them down into their component parts (“that’s a rule of three, that’s a callback”). While studying at the University of Sheffield, she found her tribe among the alt-comics, circling acts such asJohn KearnsandThe Delightful Sausage. “I fell in with people making weird stuff and I realised I like making weird stuff,” she says. “Alternative comedy is fully in my bones. It’s more adjacent to theatre and film, in trying to express something that maybe you don’t feel you can put into words.”It’s really hard to be a standup if you don’t know what you’re about, the audience will smell it on youFor Nicoresti, that something was her gender identity. And it wasn’t until she came out as trans that she felt able to give solo standup a good go. “It’s really hard to be a standup on stage if you don’t know what you’re about,” she realises now. “Because the audience will smell it on you, that there’s something you’re hiding or not expressing. The more open I’ve got with myself, the more I’m able to dig down and find those experiences that are funny on a deeper-rooted level.”Not that self-knowledge has made life easy. As Baby Doomer suggests, being transgender may be, for Nicoresti at least, as much a journey as a destination – and not one without its bumps in the road. Happy to report, after the quasi-spiritual experience described in the show, when she passed nine times throughthe Mên-an-Tol stones in Cornwall, famed for their healing properties, “I’ve felt fine since. Absolutely fine! I mean, life is hard at the moment, but it’s hard for everyone. I take the RD Laing approach of, it’s perfectly rational for us to feel insane.” But generally, she says, “I’m feeling good right now.”And ready, after triumphing at the comedy awards, to take the entertainment world by storm? Well, one thing at a time. There’s a wedding to organise first. And as for the comedy, “the cycle is always the same,” says Nicoresti. “In January and February I get depressed and decide that I am the worst comedian in the world. Then in March I have a kernel of an idea, and we go again. Maybe that process might take longer now, because after the award I’ll get to tour this show. But apart from that – well, I’ve never won it before, so I don’t know what happens next.”Sam Nicoresti: Baby Doomer is at Soho theatre, London, 2-13 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsStageComedy (Culture)Comedy (Stage)Edinburgh festivalFestivalsEdinburgh festival 2025Awards and prizesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The bride was Elaine Sherman, mother of my friend Rhonda, who I’d known since seventh grade. Mrs Sherman was getting married for the second time and the dancing man was the husband’s son-in-law, though I don’t remember his name or what he was dancing to.As the title says, it’s a circle dance, where people get into the middle and do their thing. And this guy sure did – he was marvellous. I saw him and just grabbed my camera – boom! I was using a pretty wide-angle lens and a head-on flash: I like to have people all lit up, like stage lighting. All the way to the left of the picture is a woman with just part of her face showing – that’s my mom, Sunny, who was friendly with Elaine. I wonder now how I came to be looking down at the guy, because I’m only 5ft 1in. Was I standing on a stool or a chair? I doubt I’d have done that. I must have been holding the camera at some elevation.Usually I ask permission to take a picture, but people knew I was photographing. And Elaine was aware that I’d grown up taking pictures of my Jewish family and friends in Long Island, and was working on a series focusing on that community. I included this picture when I successfully applied for an artist grant to become a photographer documenting Jewish New York – which I did between 1978 and 1979.I was told about a club called the Coyote Hookers’ Masquerade ball. I went and was hookedThe year after I took this picture, I registered for a class taught by the Magnum photographerBob Adelman. He told me about a Valentine’s Day party at New York’s Copacabana nightclub: the Coyote Hookers’ Masquerade Ball. Coyote was an acronym for Cast Off Your Old Tired Ethics, and I went dressed as a girl scout and talked my way in with my camera. Since moving to New York in my early 20s in 1975, I’d spent a lot of time exploring and photographing the club scene, but that one really got me hooked – the costumes, the dance, the decor, the amazing sound system. Soon after I met an adventurous, fun-loving woman called Judi Jupiter on a bus back from Mardi Gras and we started hitting the clubs together:Studio 54, Paradise Garage and so many others. I’d often take my camera.Salons, strippers and sexy beach kisses: American street life – in picturesRead moreSo this photograph is a cross between my suburban home pictures and the club ones – it captures the excitement of nightlife. I think I do nightlife with a street photographer’s eye, in that I like to capture unexpected action. I don’t usually go places to take photographs, I photograph where I’m going.I had to cut right back on clubbing when I started teaching in Brooklyn in 1981. The photographs I took there over the years were the basis for my first monograph, which I didn’t publish until 2014. People commented on how full of life the people in those pictures appeared, even though the neighbourhood was so burnt out and destitute, but the people I’m always attracted to photographing are those who project confidence and joy. There’s so much misery and unfairness in the world and so many hard lives. Personally, I want to capture the reasons people want to go on – I’m drawn to the dandelion coming through the concrete.I do have a vintage print of this picture, which means at the time I found it interesting enough to print, which was quite unusual back then. It did eventually appear in my book Purgatory and Paradise: Sassy ’70s Suburbia and The City. It feels like a transitional photograph that combines my interests – family and friends, a celebration of life, dance and joy, unexpected talent. I can imagine this man standing around at the wedding, looking like a mild-mannered guy, and then, wow! What a dancer.Meryl Meisler’s photography is included in She Sells Seashells atAlice Austen House, New York, from 6 September to 21 FebruaryMeryl Meisler’s CVView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Dean GoldbergBorn: South Bronx, New York City, 1951Trained:“With Cavalliere Ketchum at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, then withLisette Modelin New York (and many workshops over the years).”Influences:“Diane Arbus,Jacques Henri Lartigue, my dad Jack and my grandfather Murray Meisler. Also Brassaï, Helen Levitt and Cartier-Bresson.”High point: “I’ve had many. Group and solo exhibits in the US and abroad, gallery representation, grants, fellowships, books and positive press are each a joyful new high to me. I take nothing for granted and am grateful for each opportunity. I believe that the best is yet to come for my career.”Low point:“I was one of three finalists for a central permanent installation at a subway station with the Metropolitan Transit Authority. During lunch while working as a teacher, I received the rejection email. Luckily no one was in my classroom at the time because I broke down in tears, sobbing on the floor.”Top tips: “I am not a commercial photographer – I am answering this from the viewpoint of a photographer who made the bulk of their living as an educator and now frequently exhibits in galleries, museums and sells limited edition prints.First and foremost, never give up! The fact that you love taking and making photographs is enough reason to keep doing it.Feeling stuck? Take a class or workshop.Find role models and a supportive community of artists who encourage one another in a competitive, often cut-throat world.You don’t want to be remembered as an ‘Unknown Artist’. Print, sign, date and store your best work using archival methods. Before you know it, you have vintage prints.Health and wellbeing come first.”Explore more on these topicsPhotographyMy best shotWeddingsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Macedonian writer-director Teona Strugar Mitevska ticks down the days from seven to one and wrings a performance of flayed, hard-bitten intensity from Noomi Rapace, who marches down the corridors with a face full of fury. Rapace is a long way from her breakout role in The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo; tonally, though, not so much. If Mother Teresa never goes so far as to set about the sisters with an axe, the sense that she might injects Mitevska’s film with a pleasing dose of danger.It is 1948, we’re in the broiling heart of Kolkata and Sister Teresa has tired of her teaching role at the Loreto Entally convent. “I’m a woman in a system run by men,” she complains to sympathetic Father Friedrich (Nikola Ristanovski), although she has also heard a call from the big man upstairs.Teresa applies to the Vatican for permission to set up her own mission, but the response takes an age, her patience wears thin and she has a more immediate problem. When her heir apparent, Sister Agnieszka (Sylvia Hoeks), admits that she is pregnant, Teresa is duly scandalised. She loves Sister Agnieszka but is repulsed by her, too. “I would never jeopardise my mission for earthly pleasures,” she declares in one of many examples of overly on-the-nose dialogue.Ahead of the film’s premiere, Rapace billed the film as a “punk-rock” reframing of the 20th-century saint, although the handling is arguably more Euro-metal than punk. There’s plenty of reverb guitar on the soundtrack, culminating in an extended headbanging session as the brides of Christ dance on the convent landing at night. It’s an approach that finally generates more heat than light and leaves Teresa exposed but not necessarily examined.Watch a clip from MotherTeresa, it’s clear, is desperate to strike her own path and tend to the poor and the needy. But are these motives purely altruistic?In the opinion of the writer Christopher Hitchens, this white saviour was not a friend of the poor but of poverty itself, and viewed the slums of Kolkata as a happy hunting ground for impressionable Catholic converts. Mother does little to disabuse us of that view, although its frequent God’s-eye shots of the action leave open the possibility that a higher power is guiding her hand and testing her faith. Teresa treats Agnieszka’s pregnancy as an infuriating distraction, another mess to be cleaned up before she can make her escape. It may, though, be the great moral challenge by which her mission is judged.Time is running short and Teresa craves an answer. So now she picks up the pace, steamrolling through the convent like a heaven-sent Nurse Ratched. She’s wiping the blood off the sisters’ wimples. She’s plucking maggots out of the body of a wounded beggar, who giggles and masturbates throughout the procedure. Her eyes are glittering; her skin looks as taut as a drum.Teresa is torn and the film is, too. As the clock ticks down to judgment day, Mother veers on and off the path of righteousness, constantly summoned back to its duties of presenting a faithful, fact-based account of its subject. But it’s at its best and most fun when it plays like a giallo horror movie: the lurid tale of a fanatical nun who’s confused God with Satan and herds her excitable flock right into the flames.Mother screened at the Venice film festival.Explore more on these topicsVenice film festivalBiopicsDrama filmsMother TeresaIndiaFestivalsReligionreviewsShareReuse this content"

Toews’s family descended from Russian Mennonites and spoke Plautdietsch, an unwritten language. They grew up in a world with little privacy, many unofficial rules and the threat of excommunication. Toews and a boyfriend had planned a bike trip across Europe, one in which they would sit on the grave of John Keats and smoke too many cigarettes.Before she left, her older sister Marj asked a favor: would Toews write letters to her while she was away? Marj, then 24, had recently moved back home and was in a period of deep depression. She had stopped talking, but she would still write. “She was so sick,” says Toews, sitting across from me at a picnic table in Toronto’s Trinity Bellwoods park.Toews began writing to her sister, partly because she loved talking to her and partly because she hoped it would save her life. “Which, of course, is a ridiculous idea,” says Toews. “That me writing letters would keep her alive. But I really took it seriously.”Anyone with a formidable older sister knows their unrivaled power. They are a portal to the wider world, brave in their primacy. Marj Toews was one such older sister. She was six years older than Miriam, who worshipped her from day one. “She was so much the subject of my investigation into this world,” Toews tells me. “I needed her. Who she was to me was something so necessary.”Marj has never stopped being a subject of investigation for Miriam Toews: both her remarkable life, and her death by suicide at the age of 52. Since that European excursion with her ex-boyfriend, Toews has authored 10 books, one of which, Women Talking, was adapted into an Oscar-winning film starring Frances McDormand and Rooney Mara. Her latest, A Truce That Is Not Peace, was released on Tuesday and is her first memoir written from her perspective. (Her first work of nonfiction, Swing Low, was written in the voice of her father).View image in fullscreenFrances McDormand as Scarface Janz in director Sarah Polley’s adaptation of Toews’s 2018 novel, Women Talking.Photograph: Michael GibsonToews is also an enthusiastic grandmother of four. She lives near downtown Toronto, with her 90-year old mother, Elvira; her partner; and her daughter Georgia’s family, including their two young sons.When Toews and I first encounter each other, a snaking line of hand-holding toddlers in fluorescent safety vests are weaving their way into the park. A smiling Toews stands vigil as they pass, trying to spot her grandson in the mix. It’s a muggy morning, and we, like the children, are in search of shade.At 61, Toews is older now than her older sister ever was, and around the same age her father was when he too died of suicide. Melvin Toews was a beloved schoolteacher in their home town of Steinbach in the Manitoba province of central Canada. He was a deeply devout man, a proud champion of his daughters and his wife, and somebody who experienced bipolar disorder his entire life. “My dad sort of had to be mentally ill in secret in that community,” says Toews. There was the danger of it being misinterpreted as a lack of faith. “If your faith was stronger, if you were a better Mennonite, you wouldn’t be depressed,” she says. His illness sometimes brought him into sustained periods of silence. The whole first year after Toews was born, he did not speak.It makes sense that though we are ostensibly here to talk about A Truce That Is Not Peace, our conversation stays mostly with both of them: the complexity of their deaths and the totality of how much they are missed. No matter how much time has passed, their absence is still raw. Becoming a grandmother has only intensified this feeling: Toews cannot help but think about how much Marj would have enjoyed this next stage of caregiving.Toews’s work is often centered on the question of why her father and her sister both chose to end their lives, and in A Truce That Is Not Peace, she acknowledges that she will never find the answer. It is that very paradox that keeps her on the page, turning it over again to try to understand them as they wished to be understood, and to stay close to them now that they are gone.Why do I still need to write? Why do I still need to make this thing in order to connect with other human beings so I don’t feel so alone and weird? It’s so embarrassingWhen she wrote the book, Toews had just turned 60. She was tending to both her young grandchildren and her elderly mother, whom she has previously called the love of her life. (Elvira Toews, a Lamborghini-loving, Toronto Blue Jays fan who bucked tradition to go to graduate school and become a social worker, leaps off the page in so many of Toews’s books. She is the kind of woman who eats a daily bowl of vanilla ice-cream with chocolate syrup, banana slices and walnuts, and when it’s over says: “How ’bout another one?”)Miriam Toews was already one of Canada’s bestselling authors, but the success of Women Talking launched her into a new level of international recognition, winning all of Canada’s top literary prizes and plaudits from everyone fromMargaret AtwoodtoBrad Pitt, who was a co-producer on the film adaptation. Yet, she could not shake the feeling that her need to continue to write was somehow newly shameful.“I was grappling with the urgency of it,” says Toews in regards to her writing, “And on the other hand the mortification. Why do I still need to write? Why do I still need to make this thing in order to connect with other human beings so I don’t feel so alone and weird? It’s so embarrassing.” She asked herself: hadn’t she said it all? What was left in her life to mine? Her nine previous books had already reflected back on many of her own experiences. Maybe it was time to finally heed the message she had received all those early years from her Mennonite forefathers: keep quiet.That would be dignified, Toews insisted. “I just wish I could be like a calm, serene, bemused grandmotherly person with wisdom,” says Toews. “But it seems as though – it seems like I haven’t really achieved that. And I have to understand that I never will.”At some point, we had to stop to laugh: it seemed too wonderfullyToewsianthat while she was talking about the indignity of an older female writer still expressing herself, we were surrounded by individuals who were contorting themselves into strange, acrobatic shapes. One was a shirtless man bending over a park bench like a stretchy rainbow, the other dangling frog-legged and upside down from a fabric sling strung up in a tree. “God,” says Toews. “It’s so perfect.”This time around, Toews is changing the way she tells these stories. Most of her previous books contain autobiographical information told through the prism of fiction. A Truce That Is Not Peace takes an inverse approach. The central conceit is a fictional prompt from a fictional conference in Mexico City, a send-up of the highfalutin literary circles Toews now finds herself in. The idea is something like this: organizers of this “Conversación” want her to provide an answer for why she writes. She sends them many attempts: associative, rangy, exasperated, rueful, funny ruminations on the futility of writing. Eventually, the committee uninvites her.The book is in many ways about the inherent failures of language. Marj Toews, like her father Melv before her, would fall into long periods of silence in her suffering. A Truce That Is Not Peace is constantly weighing Toews’s own urgent need to write against her sister’s and her father’s choice to periodically forsake words altogether. “Silence. Suicide. Writing. Within all of these, we are holding,” writes Toews. “Does her silence hold the perfect expression of her suffering? Is her silence a communications success, my writing a failure?”Silence, suicide and writing: these are sisters of sorts in Toews’s questioning mind: “Are writing and suicide related?” she asks. “The same thing? Or estranged relatives, at least? Angry siblings whose origins are the same. An attempt – a fragment of an attempt – to save life, preserve life, to freeze it in a moment, to end what is real, to survive by ending. To preserve, in silence, what is authentic.”Yet Toews is not cynical about the project of writing. It is nothing short of a choice to keep on living, long after we have buried our beloved dead. “Why must I draw a comparison between writing and suicide?” asks Toews. “To stay with her. To stay with them. Yes, you can imagine my suffering. Yeah, you fucking can. Try! Stay with me.”Despite their serious subject matter, Toews’s books have a rallying spirit to them, an angry jolt of energy that comes from a perpetual spirit of adolescent rebellion. In A Truce That Is Not Peace, that looseness feels more radical in nature, entirely liberated from plot. Toews has a deep distrust of narrative’s more controlling impulses.Perhaps it is because Toews has always been sensitive to modes of control, from the strict traditional Mennonite orthodoxy she grew up under. Or maybe it is because of the way some people in her religious community rushed to come up with neat and inaccurate explanations for why her father had died by suicide, which hurt Toews more than it provided comfort.Or maybe it was the new experience of having her novel about survivors of gas-facilitated sexual assault be made into a feature film and fully absorbed into the alienating awards cycle machine. “The reality is that [director] Sarah Polley did an amazing job,” says Toews. “We talked about it throughout, she was so sensitive to the whole thing, and it was an amazing experience.” The irony was not lost on Toews that going to Hollywood meant losing her authorial voice on a novel that was literally just women talking to one another. A Truce That Is Not Peace’s nonlinear structure makes it immune to such dangers. “I was thinking, OK, there’s no way this is going to be adapted,” laughs Toews. “Like, adapt this, motherfuckers. Just try.”With my mother, with my aunts, with my female cousins, there was a subversive humor that we could all rally. It was always against our oppressorsThere is of course a complicated answer to why write, and then there’s a simple one. “Why do I write?” writes Toews matter-of-factly towards the end of A Truce That Is Not Peace. “Because she asked me to.” Marj and Mel Toews introduced her to the world of books, a world that Toews thinks saved her life. “I love them and I miss them so much,” says Toews. “My sister, my God. It’s a visceral pain and it never goes away. It lessens, it lightens, it ebbs and flows.”It’s hard to overstate the patriarchal conditions Marj and Miriam Toews’s family were all subject to. Many of the women they grew up with lived hard lives. Their grandmother – their mother’s mother – buried six of her 13 children in infancy. Their father’s mother often cried out in her sleep, speaking the name of a group of men she grew up with in a little girl’s voice. She stole and drank bottles of vanilla extract during the day, lining her purse with a tea towel so that the glass would not make a sound. When Marj was 10, she was abducted off the street by a group of teenage boys in a car who dropped her off in front of her house hours later “doused with a vile brown liquid”. “Don’t be alarmed if I scream in my sleep,” Toews’s own mother cheerfully sometimes tells her family.But the women they grew up with also had a deep communion with one another that was borne out of the intense gender separation they experienced. They sang together. They raised their families alongside one another. And they laughed – a lot. “With my mother, with my aunts, with my female cousins, there was a subversive humor that we could all rally around and share. It was always against our oppressors, the rules that were put on us,” says Toews.Nobody made her laugh harder than Marj. “She was so funny,” says Toews. And what was it that made them laugh so hard? “That shared thing,” says Toews smiling, in the sly knowing language of sisters, “whatever that shared thing is.”A shared sense of humor is an underwater cable that connects so many siblings and so many of Toews’s books. It’s the language of subterfuge. What better way is there to chip away at an unreasonably sanctimonious authority than to laugh at it? Toews tells me that when she gave A Truce That Is Not Peace to her mother to read, her mother laughed and laughed, telling Toews: “It’s all true!”I ask Toews whether she dreams about Marj. “I do,” she tells me. “The details are often the same. She’s always telling me she’s OK. And she’s always looking good and happy. I would like to have that dream every night. Every night. It’s always a little bit hard waking up. But it’s always good to have the dream.”Miriam Toews: ‘I needed to write about these women. I could have been one of them’Read moreA Truce That Is Not Peace is dedicated to Marj. It contains some of those old letters between the two of them, back when Miriam was 18 and left for her overseas biking trip. Only one is written by Marj. It ends with her saying: “I very much miss being able to call you anytime or just come over + hang out. A sister’s place is in many ways even better than a friend’s – you’re always welcome, don’t have to make arrangements etc. etc. Can stay long or short, clean out the fridge, read the paper etc In short, not be on one’s best behaviour.”Toews’s writing is a way of building a suspended sister’s place where the correspondence is ongoing. It’s a place to go to not be on one’s best behavior. It’s both the dream and the waking up. “She taught me how to stay alive,” writes Toews. “Silence and words: both are good, both are failures, both are efforts, and in that effort is where life lies – notlies, but maybe it does – but where it exists. And the fragments in between are the spaces where she and I meet.”In the US, you can call or text the988 Suicide & Crisis Lifelineat 988 or chat at988lifeline.org.

The non-batting runner, having only made it a certain way around the field, gets tagged out by a fielder trying to “steal”, or sneak up, on a base from the one behind. As far as the non-metaphorical meaning goes, no one in this movie is actually apprehended in the act of theft. But in a world where home runs are unavailable to most, the idea of cheekily trying for covert advantage and survival through quick wits is clear.Charlie Huston’s violent crime novel of the same name from 2004 has been adapted for the screen by the author, and Darren Aronofsky directs with gleeful energy, flair and a dark humour that straddles the mischief/malice borderline. Incredible to think that his last film was the solemn and inertly sententiousbody-image drama The Whale. This has more of the confrontational extravagance and energy of his earlier work; it’s not as purely deranged as Aronofsky’smeltdown film Mother!, although, speaking of mothers, there is no doubt who the hero of this film considers to be his best friend.Austin Butler plays Hank, a former baseball star and booze-addicted bartender in New York whose disastrous exit from the sport – and from his own bright future – is progressively disclosed in nightmare flashbacks. The only good thing in his life is his smart, beautiful girlfriend Yvonne, played by Zoë Kravitz, a paramedic whose professional skills come in useful. When Hank good-naturedly agrees to look after a cat belonging to his dodgy British friend Russ (a very broad, mohawk-sporting performance from Matt Smith), poor Hank winds up getting savagely beaten by some scary Russians to whom Russ owes a great deal of money.The assault has serious consequences, not least Hank’s encounter with two other villains: a pair of Hassidic guys (played by Vincent D’Onofrio and Liev Schreiber). Their kindly mother Bubbe, played by Carol Kane, sagely tells Hank not to show his teeth if he isn’t going to bite.Most importantly, Hank comes into contact with a coolly self-possessed New York police officer, played byRegina King, who is airily insensitive about what Hank is going through, but perceptive about him in ways that no other character really is. When talking to (or interrogating) Hank, she asks if he played baseball; Hank coldly admits to playing only at high school level, and this cop instantly senses the lie, the symptom of self-harming pride and grief on which he is challenged by no one else in his life, but can’t work out if it means something more.‘The 90s were remarkable – we weren’t all living in existential terror!’ Darren Aronofsky on Caught Stealing, his love letter to New YorkRead moreThe late-90s setting is signalled bySmash Mouth’s Walkin’ on the Sunon the jukebox, Jerry Springer on the TV, a landline answering machine and characters resentfully lending people their flip-top mobile phones and telling them not to “use up my minutes”. In fact, the story itself perhaps comes from an era ofElmore Leonard, Ed Bunker and Quentin Tarantino; the shocks and twists and jolts are nasty and unexpected, and the stunts and car crashes are dished up in a chaotic swirl.I was disconcerted, however, when Butler’s character, a sweet-natured guy for whom we’re supposed to be rooting, seems to get over one particular horror with relative ease: I couldn’t quite decide if this was a drawback in his performance or something diluting the black comedy. Either way, Caught Stealing is a very enjoyable spectacle. At one stage, Hank hits a few balls and instantly a crowd of people gather round, awed – and an old-timer tells him he has “one hell of a swing”. The film has it too.Caught Stealing is out on 28 August in Australia, and on 29 August in the US and UK.Explore more on these topicsFilmCrime filmsThrillersComedy filmsDarren AronofskyFilm adaptationsAustin ButlerreviewsShareReuse this content"

The brothers discuss their working methods, who inspires them, and what they disagree aboutWed 27 Aug 2025 03.00 EDTShareEarlier this year, the Cannes film festival saw a triumphant new appearance from European cinema’s kings of social realism and social conscience. The Dardenne brothers, Jean-Pierre and Luc, now 74 and 71, presented a movie that is one of their very best:Jeunes Mères or Young Mothers, a deeply compassionate, intelligent drama about a home for teen mothers or mothers-to-be in the directors’ home town of Liège in Belgium. These young women are faced with the existential question: is it sensible to give their infants up for adoption, or a fundamental loss of moral courage?Young Mothers review – outstanding return to form for the Dardenne brothersRead moreThe Dardennes have become known for intensely naturalist performances and handheld camerawork, radical simplicity and clarity. They have won the Cannes Palme d’Or twice, firstly for their dramaRosettain 1999, about a young woman who must look after her troubled mother in a trailer park – starring the then nonprofessional teenager Émilie Dequenne – and secondly the terrifying, faintly Greeneian dramaL’Enfant or The Child, from 2005, with Jérémie Renier as a petty criminal who gives his own baby away to a “private adoption” broker and then desperately tries to get it back.A string of other awards followed and with the imminent UK release of Young Mothers, which has incidentally earned them yet another prize at Cannes for their bulging silverware cabinet – for best screenplay – I logged on for a Zoom chat with the legendary brothers who, despite their films’ seriousness, are always infectiously genial, like cheerful academics.So how did Young Mothers come about, I ask? Luc replies: “We went in to research a maternity home with the idea of one character. Then we saw the life there, the five or six young mothers. And this was new for us, to envisage a whole group. We were attracted by it. We didn’t want to do a choral ensemble piece. We wanted each to have their story. And we decided that there would be light at the end of each tunnel. Sometimes a fragile, feeble light. But we didn’t want failure.”And the directing? I pointed out to them Martin Scorsese’s memory of seeing for the first time a movie by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger and wondering which of them shouts “Action!” and “Cut!” The thought makes both brothers giggle. “Sometimes it is my brother who says ‘Cut!’,” says Luc, laughing, “… and sometimes it is I!”“The most difficult word to say is ‘Cut!’,” interjects Jean-Pierre, laughing as well, and Luc adds: “Sometimes it can be our assistant who says it.” Having rehearsed extensively and intimately with the actors, the Dardennes are often positioned away from the camera, watching on the monitor and the responsibility for the cut will be devolved to this assistant.As for the actors: often, the Dardennes have worked with nonprofessionals, such as Dequenne and Renier, who then developed professional careers; and sometimes they worked with established A-listers such as Marion Cotillard, who got a best actress Oscar nomination for her performance in the Dardennes’ workplace dramaTwo Days, One Night. Are the big names directed differently to the amateurs?View image in fullscreen‘We wanted each to have their story’ … a scene from Young Mothers.Photograph: Christine Plenus“In terms of this rehearsal, it’s the same for all,” says Luc. “It’s then that we find a movement for the camera and start adding detail. Where it differs is how we talk to each actor. A professional will have their technique and they will know how to use it. They will naturally use their technique. They have to learn, to some extent, to forget it. You will have a situation where you tell an actor: OK, you light up a cigarette, you drink a coffee and read the newspaper. A professional will do it quite sleekly, but those little actions might completely overwhelm a nonprofessional.”Jean-Pierre says that improvisation is not what they do: “We rehearse a lot, we rehearse four to five weeks, but we leave some sort of leeway because the actors don’t have marks on the floors. No scene is ever exactly the same. The key is imprecision.” He adds, grinning: “What is the Italian word?Sfumatura! Hazy nuance and shade.”This approach is most important in working with children and teens who are so important to the Dardennes’ films, such the radicalised schoolkid inYoung Ahmedfrom 2019, and the exploited refugees inTori and Lokitafrom 2022. Luc says: “There is something of themselves that is always there. And we want that. If they just want to look down, they will look down and they are resisting the camera. Our model isAbbas Kiarostami. It’s how he directs. He lets them be.”View image in fullscreen‘All too short a life’ … Émilie Dequenne in Rosetta.Photograph: RONALD GRANTI raise the sad and painful subject of Dequenne, an iconic actor for the Dardennes who gave a luminous performance at the age of 17 in Rosetta anddied of cancer in March at the age of 43. Jean-Pierre says soberly: “It is very hard for us to talk about Émilie. Our very first memory that we will always cherish is when we first shot with her with the whole crew. On the very first day, we felt that the crew was drawn to her. Émilie bound us together and even she wasn’t aware of it. And then she went on to have a very varied and accomplished career and … all too short a life.”The political and social dimensions of the Dardennes’ films are often discussed, but less so their fierce, almost eerily spiritual elements; they are gritty parables of good and evil, with an almost Catholic emphasis on mother and child. Luc approaches the subject warily: “I would call it spiritual realism. We work from a social situation. But we don’t push it forward. It’s as if God is disappearing and it’s art’s responsibility to show, to lead, to guide. But never making a sermon.”Then there is the question of who guided the brothers themselves to work together in film? In school, says Jean-Pierre, there was a teacher who introduced them to cinema; he does not dwell on fact that the teacher was a priest: “He had a cine club and showed us many films: Bresson, Godard, Truffaut, Bergman, Bertolucci, Ken Loach. This triggered something. But at 17, we still didn’t think, oh one day we will make films together.” The vital moment came as they were working as assistants to the French theatre and cinema director Armand Gatti, who one day simply left these twentysomethings in charge while he went off to Germany to direct a play. The Dardennes picked up the clunky, but serviceable Sony Portapak cameras and made rough-and-ready documentaries in wobbly black and white.But it is at the end of our conversation that Jean-Pierre and Luc reveal their most compelling influence: their formidable mother, Marie-Josée. Luc says: “Our mother was a singer in the village. An operetta singer, singing in the Walloon dialect. And that she did for 20 years. She liked to sing for us. She sat us all down in front of her on the couch. She did a performance – I like to say she was our first actress!”View image in fullscreenMarion Cotillard in Two Days, One Night.Photograph: AllstarThe Dardennes also have two sisters: Marie-Claire, a theatrical props maker, and Bernadette, a nurse. During their childhood, the Dardenne brothers’ great passion, like so many other teen boys of that era, was for their tape recorder. Luc used it to record radio commentaries on the local football team he loved, Standard Liège, and the cheeky brothers sneakily recorded family conversations by hiding the device under the dinner table and playing it back afterwards – an early example of documentary realism. And their father, Lucien, was he influential? Luc replies: “He was very severe. He was in the resistance during the war and afterwards an industrial designer in steelworks. He painted a little in his youth.”Finally, I ask if they may ever make films separately, as the Coen brothers do? The question makes Luc laugh: “No! But our only disagreement – and you have to have one – is that I have an idea for a film but he doesn’t like it. He doesn’t want it. He’s scared because it’s a historical thing. It’s about the Spanish Inquisition. But …” Luc shrugs and Jean-Pierre shrugs as well, amiably. I point out that Robert Bresson made historical work. “When Bresson does a historical film it’s not his best …” says Jean-Pierre quickly. “But his Trial of Joan of Arc is very powerful,” replies Luc.Perhaps the Dardennes’ film about the Spanish Inquisition will never get made. Their togetherness is of paramount importance. As Luc puts it: “It’s good to be together to resist criticism – to face the critics together.”Young Mothers is in UK cinemas from 29 AugustExplore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsBelgiumEuropeinterviewsShareReuse this content"

The cartoon series was becoming quite popular so they thought: “Maybe the cartoon characters could come into a live-action film?” I thought: “No. This has to be real and in the sewers where it’s moody.” I didn’t get anything cinematic from the cartoon. I did from the comic book.Josh Pais (Raphael):They flew us to London to get body casted. I was in the back room of Jim Henson’s Creature Shop with my arms out to the side suspended by ropes. They started covering my body in plaster and did the back of my body first. Then they started my front, neck and my face. They put straws in my nose so I could breathe. The plaster gets warm as it sets and everything was heating up. I couldn’t hear and things started accelerating so I went inward. Later, they said they kept me in longer than they needed to see if I’d freak out.Leif Tilden (Donatello):I had no idea what it took to create these creatures. It was like the Nasa of puppetry. Falkor’s head from The NeverEnding Story was lying in the corner. Characters from The Dark Crystal and Labyrinth were hanging from the ceiling. I was down the rabbit hole.View image in fullscreen‘They put straws in my nose so I could breathe’ … a full body cast at Jim Henson’s Creature Shop.Photograph: Steve BarronDavid Forman (Leonardo):I did a lot of animal work. If you wanted a bear or gorilla, you’d come to me. A talking character was a challenge. Design-wise, we had creases and stretch in our joints. It was designed so we could kick, punch and have full dexterity. The costumes were built in stages. There was a chest piece, leg, feet and hand pieces. We married them together with elbow and knee props.SB:Jim [Henson] was worried about the weapons and fighting. It took a bit of persuasion but after a while he trusted me. I said: “I’m going to keep the spirit warm and tender and the tone will be something you’ll be proud of.” Luckily, he went for it. I don’t think it could have been done without him.Michelan Sisti (Michelangelo):I happened to be at the Creature Shop when Dave did his first test in the full suit. I remember him rolling around and doing all this stuff. After about 30 minutes, I asked him: “What’s it like?” He said: “Not good,” and he was in fantastic shape. He knew about the pain to come.It felt like your blood was boiling. One of us would lose it and shout: ‘Take the head off! Take the head off!’DF:I was used to working in heavy suits. Sweating, working blind, knowing my 360 degree markers. I did struggle with the weight of the costume because we had so many batteries in the shell to work the servos in the head. There was a lot of weight on our hips and lower backs. We were literally on all fours most of the time, looking like turtles, but in pain.LT:The suits were sculpted to our physical shape precisely so even the subtlest movement would move them. Also, you had to develop ways of living in a different temperature.SB:They knew these suits were going to be heavy and hot but they didn’t know how hot or heavy, until we were in North Carolina shooting. The heat was intense. Poor Josh was the only actor of the four who hadn’t done performance costumes before and he found it difficult. It brought on a bit of claustrophobia.JP:It felt like your blood was boiling. One of us would lose it and shout: “Take the head off! Take the head off!” Our heads were a separate piece and glued on so it wasn’t a simple process. They had to undo the glue. Sometimes, if one of us had that freak out, others would too. It was like a fever. The producers weren’t happy because it slowed everything down.DF:There’s very little oxygen in the head so between takes, we had blowers pointed at our open mouths to get some more air into us.MS:I was the experimental turtle. Everybody was overheating so they tried cooling vests designed for astronauts. I had one that circulated liquid. They put it on and asked me to work up a sweat. They turned on the pump and I immediately got an entire body cramp and fell over. The pump said, “Do not put ice in” and somebody put ice in it. The temperature change to my overheated core nearly killed me.JP:They created a room with plastic sheathing around it with air conditioners in. It had benches we would sit at with our arms up and heads down.View image in fullscreen‘It would have been easier if there were just two’ … Steve Barron, centre, with David Forman (Leonardo),left, and Leif Tilden (Donatello).Photograph: Steve BarronSB:We built a wooden horse for them to sit on that they could drape their arms over. There was a fan in the middle that’d blow air through the mouth. Looking at all four of them on that was like a Damien Hirst sculpture.LT:The first time the four of us were together for the opening “Cowabunga” sewer scene was a jungle of challenges. The art director created a sewer that was so realistic. It was moist and very slippery.JP:We were dying. There was water running under our feet. We were all having vision problems. If one of us stopped, we’d smash into each other. It was a relatively simple 45 second sequence but it took at least 12 hours. Everything kept going wrong.MS:The sewers were treacherous. Every time we jumped around the corner, one of us would slip and fall. Eventually, somebody suggested taking the bottoms off our legs and wearing sneakers. If you slow down the video when Dave comes into frame, you can see his legs as he jumps down.SB:It would’ve been a lot easier if there were only two turtles, that’s for sure.View image in fullscreen‘The temperature change nearly killed me’ … Michelan Sisti as Michelangelo.Photograph: Steve BarronSB:The turtle faces were radio controlled by nearby puppeteers. In North Carolina, sometimes a plane would land a mile away right in the middle of a take and suddenly, the turtles’ faces would twitch and start going crazy.SB:The campfire scene where they connect with Splinter is a big one. Michelangelo is crying and it’s clear how much they care for their father. There were a few underlying themes but the strongest was family.LT:We were stoned out of our minds. I smoked half a joint before we did it.JP: Leif pulled out a blunt and we were like: “Yeah. Come on!” We’d all been through so much. It gives me chills thinking about it. It was a spiritual experience and the buzz took it deeper.DF:That was a wonderful sequence. Connecting with our father, Splinter, and the whole ambience of that scene.DF:The fans are so grateful we kept in touch. They constantly thank us for being there for them in the 1990s. Grown adults say: “You were my childhood hero.” It’s helped all sorts of people for different reasons.JP:People come up to me with tears in their eyes saying: “You helped me through my childhood.” A lot had anger issues like Raphael and say watching the movie over and over made them see they weren’t alone. It’s an adult film for kids. It doesn’t talk down to them. It challenges them to step up within themselves.SB:Many more people have stayed connected to it than I expected. Youngsters have carried it into their 40s. Lots of people come forward saying this was the best adaptation. You take it with a pinch of salt – but it’s nice to hear.Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Movie is in US cinemas from Thursday 28 August.

Other objects included a pocket TV, a snowflake hologram and a photo of Diana.View image in fullscreenA CD of Kylie Minogue’s Rhythm of Love album.Photograph: Great Ormond Street hospitalThe time capsule was intended to be unearthed in “hundreds of years” but was dug up to make way for the construction of a children’s cancer centre.Diana became president of the children’s hospital in 1989 and visited it several times before her death in 1997. She helped the two children select the items to be placed in the time capsule. A CD of Kylie Minogue’s Rhythm of Love album was chosen by David Watson, then aged 11, from Paignton, Devon. He also selected a sheet of recycled paper and a passport.Sylvia Foulkes, then nine, from Norwich, chose a collection of British coins, a container with five tree seeds, and the snowflake hologram.View image in fullscreenItems from the time capsule, including a pocket TV and a copy of the Times.Photograph: Great Ormond Street hospitalThe box also included a copy of the Times from the date of the capsule’s burial. Headlines on its front page include: “Cooked meats bring out Soviet voters in droves”, alongside a photo of the former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, and “US rejects Iraqi warplanes plea as rebels close in”.Images released by archivists show some damage to the objects, but they are largely intact.The burial of the time capsule was similar to a ceremony in 1872 during which the then Princess of Wales, Alexandra, laid a foundation stone at the hospital, also sealing a time capsule. That time capsule, which contained a photo of Queen Victoria, has not been found.Staff who were either born in 1991 or were working at the hospital in 1991 helped to remove the capsule before the construction of the children’s cancer centre. The centre will be a “national resource of the treatment of childhood cancers” and will help clinical teams develop “kinder, more effective treatments” for children staying at the hospital, a statement said.Six things that happened in 1991John Majorwas inaugurated British prime minister on 29 November 1990, after winning a contest to replace Margaret Thatcher, who had resigned after a challenge to her leadership. He presided over a period of economic recession in 1991, with high interest rates, falling housing prices and rising unemployment. Major resigned as Conservative party leader in 1995 after several high-profile “sleaze” scandals, however won that year’s leadership contest, and remained in post until 1997. The US president was the Republican George HW Bush.View image in fullscreenJohn Major with Margaret Thatcher in October 1991 on her arrival at the Conservative party conference in Blackpool.Photograph: Croft/PAThe cold warended with the breakup of the Soviet Union over the course of 1991, putting an end to decades of geopolitical rivalry between the US and the Soviet Union and their respective capitalist and communist allies.The first Gulf war, an armed conflict between Saddam Hussein-governed Iraq and a 42-country coalition led by the US, began with Operation Desert Storm, which launched an aerial bombing campaign against Iraq on 17 January 1991 and ended with the American-led liberation of Kuwait on 28 February.The British scientist Tim Berners-Leeintroduced WorldWideWeb, the first web browser, while working at the European nuclear research agency Cern in Geneva.

An earlier version referred to John Major’s time as prime minister, saying he stayed in post until 1995 when he resigned as party leader. To clarify: in 1995, Major resigned as Conservative party leader but not prime minister. He won the party’s leadership contest that year, and remained in post as both prime minister and party leader until 1997.Explore more on these topicsDiana, Princess of WalesHospitalsChildrenLondonHeritageKylie MinoguenewsShareReuse this content"

Bruce is in really great health overall, you know,” Heming Willis told Diane Sawyer in an ABC special on Tuesday. “It’s just his brain that is failing him. The language is going. We’ve learned to adapt and we have a way of communicating with him, which is just a different way.”In 2022, Willis’s family announced that the Die Hard and Sixth Sense movie star would be retiring from actingafter being diagnosed with aphasia– a brain disorder that leads to difficulty with language or speech.Soft, gentle and always battle-ready: Bruce Willis is an action star to stir the heartRead more“For someone who was very talkative and very engaged, he was just a little more quiet and, when the family would get together, he would just melt a little bit,” Heming Willis told ABC of her husband’s early symptoms.“He felt a little removed, a little cold, not like Bruce who was very warm and very affectionate. To go the complete opposite of that was alarming and scary.”A year after his aphasia diagnosis,Willis received another diagnosis for frontotemporal dementia. “While this is painful, it is a relief to finally have a clear diagnosis,” Willis’s family said at the time in a joint statement including his daughters, his wife, and his ex-wife, Demi Moore.When Heming Willis first learned of the diagnosis, “I was so panicked and I just remembering hearing it and not hearing anything else,” she said. “It was like I was freefalling.”Heming Willis said there are still times where her husband – now 70 – reveals a “spark” of his buoyant personality.“We still get those days,” she told Sawyer. “Notdays, but moments. It’s his laugh. He has such a hearty laugh. And sometimes you’ll get that twinkle in his eye or that spark. And I just get transported. It’s just hard to see because as quickly as those moments appear, then it goes.”Heming Willis and Willis married in 2009 and have two daughters together.Her bookabout caring for Willis – titled Unexpected Journey: Finding Strength, Hope and Yourself on the Caregiving Path – will be published on 9 September.Explore more on these topicsBruce WillisDementianewsShareReuse this content"

Asked the same question ahead of a literary conference in Mexico City, Miriam Toews mentions the teenage letters she sent from Europe to her sister Marjorie (Marj or M as she calls her) as the reason she became a writer. Sorry, that won’t do for an answer, she’s told. Try again.In a frenetic household set-up in Toronto, keeping an eye on her mother one moment, entertaining her grandchildren the next and warding off angry neighbours in between, she struggles to get her act together and makes a to-do list: “Wind Museum. Deranged skunk. North-west quadrant with ex. Conversación in Mexico City.” The skunk has distemper and keeps getting trapped in the window well. The Wind Museum is the collection she’d love to create, commemorating winds from all over the world (Harmattan, Calima, Mistral, Sirocco etc), if she can find a way to exhibit them. The ex is the father of her second child, who despite years of separation is still taking the royalties on her work – it’s time to meet him and end that arrangement.Most pressing, though, is the Mexico City business. Since early childhood she has been “afflicted” with a need to write things down: “the fingers in my mind would begin typing”, and she’d carry on all day, touch-typing in her head, “as though that were the only way of proving to myself that I was alive, that what I was experiencing was real”. That could be an answer of sorts. Too late, though: she’s disinvited from the conference; the word CANCELLED appears across her photo in the programme.A hopeless failure, then. But this book is a triumph – a meditation on writing, suicide, guilt and silence; a fragmented account of her life so far; and an illustration of why she’s one of Canada’s most admired writers (there’s nowa plaqueoutside her former home in Steinbach, Manitoba, where she grew up as part of a Mennonite community). Though the Mexico City organiser missed the point, those letters to her sister were indeed her prime reason for writing. “Why do I write? Because she asked me to.” That was the deal they made. “You live. And I’ll write.”Marj suffered from depression and in 2010 she killed herself, 12 years after their father Melvin had done the same. Toews wrote about Melvin, in his voice, in her book Swing Low (2000) and her relationship with Marj formed the basis for her novel All My Puny Sorrows (2014). Most of her work until now has been loosely autofictional. This time there are no disguises. She tells it as it is.“You people (meaning, my family) don’t talk about your pain,” Toews’s partner tells her, “you just kill yourselves.” Toews herself came close to doing so one day while walking by the river Assiniboine, in Winnipeg, but rather than throwing herself in the water she threw her mobile phone instead. “A parable of perfect silence,” she calls it, but it’s her sister’s silence that preoccupies her – all those years before she died when she didn’t speak. “Was my sister’s silence an attempt to translate something that couldn’t be said? Something that would cause too much pain if it were to be said?’ The questions keep coming, with Toews disinclined to present writing (“this strange non-thing”) as any more creative or worthwhile than her sister’s wordlessness: “If silence says more, why write?”Since early childhood she has been 'afflicted' with a need to write things downAs a hymn to their intimacy, maybe the writingdidhelp keep her sister alive. The letters she sent from Europe, which come in a brilliant run of 30 pages late on in the book, date back to 1982, when Toews was travelling with her boyfriend Wolfie. The two of them are hard up and she’s increasingly disenchanted with him, not least when he busks with a penny whistle in Covent Garden (no, she won’t hold out a beret for coins) or queues to get a book signed by John Fowles when they haven’t the money for food. In Oxford she lies on the grass, unaware there’s a cricket match going on. In Paris they’re chased out of a park by guards with whistles. In Rouen their bikes are stolen. In Corfu they’re pelted with pomegranates by a gang of children. They fall out, make up by having outdoor sex (“I still have tiny pieces of rock ground heroically into my back and ass”), fall out again. It’s hilarious. And she’s only 18. “Do you think I’ll soon be enjoying liquid lunches at theAlgonquin Round Table, hahahaha.”The hahahaha principle defines Toews. “Between you and me, I want to be a clown. I think Iama clown,” she tells Marj. It’s an inherited trait perhaps. Despite the sadness and depression, there’s a lot of laughter in the family, including an episode when they take a boat out to an uninhabited island, disembark for a picnic and return to find the boat has disappeared – rather than wail they all begin to laugh (later, miraculously, the boat drifts back to shore). Toews’s mother, a Scrabble genius, remains indomitably cheerful despite her losses, and is arguably the heroine of the book.“Narrative as something dirty, to be avoided – Iunderstandthis,” Toews writes, and she does avoid it, up to a point, bobbing about in time and place, riffing on the Wind Museum, recounting how she refused to marry the father of her son and broke up with the father of her daughter. The awful and the laughable overlap. Her sister is attacked by a carful of young men and drenched in rancid brown liquid. Their mother is kidnapped and robbed. Their father doesn’t speak for a year. It might sink a less buoyant spirit but Toews makes comedy out of the chaos.She does the same when she talks about her writing career. On a cruise with her mother, the pages of her manuscript are blown from the floor of her cabin into the sea. Her very first reading in another city is cancelled when the poet in charge runs off with her lover – Toews is left to sleep for three nights on a blow-up mattress in a garden shed.Her very existenceis farcical: she was conceived on the night of her grandfather’s funeral, in a marital effort to ward off morbidity.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

She’s wired, anxious, on an adrenalin high and prone to panic attacks, “crazy with grief, guilt and dread”. Having to write dismays her. She’d love to stop obsessing about word order and become “a benign but wise grandmother, with a soft lap”. Then again, from what we see of her with her grandchildren, she is that anyway. Meanwhile, writing absorbs her sorrow and rage.“Are you OK? I mean, you know,OK? I miss you so much,” Toews writes to her sister. “I wish I could take your sadness away.” She’s still trying, all these years later, closing with a 2023 letter to Marj (“You’ll like this”) about a stranger arriving at a Christmas Eve family gathering and being made welcome, though it turns out he has not been invited. There’s Toews for you. Her work’s so intimate you worry you’re intruding, but it’s fine, she welcomes you in.A Truce That Is Not Peace by Miriam Toews is published by 4th Estate (£16.99).

In this heartwarming feature debut, Stéphane Ly-Cuong turns to the magic of the musical comedy to portray not only the dreams and the struggles of Vietnamese-French artists, but also a side of Paris seldom seen on screen.A hopeful performer and singer, Yvonne Nguyen (Clotilde Chevalier) can’t help but dream in songs. Her candy-coloured reveries unfold like a Jacques Demy fantasy, bursting with tunes and light. In reality, however, she is stuck belting out jingles for spring rolls to indifferent supermarket customers. Without much luck getting cast in acting roles, Yvonne moves back in with her mother (Anh Tran-Nghia), who runs a restaurant in the outskirts of Paris. Generational clashes soon follow, but so does a too-good-to-be-true opportunity to star in a big-budget musical. While Yvonne’s mother scolds her for not being Vietnamese enough, the role she is offered – Lotus Flower, an exotic Asian mistress – ironically demands that Nguyen play up cliche stereotypes.This push-and-pull lays bare the barriers faced in an industry where Asian characters are often seen as interchangeable. Ly-Cuong approaches these issues with a winking humour and playfulness; the song sequences are a delight, but the beautiful chemistry between Chevalier and Tran-Nghia shines even more brightly. Here, music does not exist solely on stage, or in the rehearsal room; as Yvonne and her mother bond over cooking in a moving ritual of cultural inheritance, the sounds of clanking utensils and sizzling woks harmonise into a pleasing symphony. Against the cacophony of self-doubt and societal prejudices, it is this music of love and care that allows Yvonne to eventually dance to the beat of her own drum.In the Nguyen Kitchen is in UK cinemas from 29 AugustExplore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsMusicalsComedy filmsFranceVietnamAsia PacificreviewsShareReuse this content"

But the well-directed (though somewhat artless) performances and competent assembly make it palatable enough to pass the time, especially if you have a particular interest in stories about living with a disability.The protagonist is surly war veteran and wheelchair-user Patrick (Tobias Forrest, who uses a wheelchair in real life). When he’s not drunk, in a strip club or both, he’s down at the social security office bickering with the staff. (The fact that there’s still an office he can wheel into betrays the fact this was made well before the Trump administration and Doge started gutting the agency.) One day, a pair of social workers show up and inform Patrick that he’s the father of a four-year-old girl, Camilla (Victoria Scott, adorable), who he never knew existed. Her mother has just died from cancer, and Camilla’s options are limited to either staying with Patrick (her upkeep will be paid for by a life insurance policy that kicks out $4k a month), moving in with her grandparents on the other side of the country, or going into foster care.Patrick agrees to take in his daughter, but of course he has a learning curve as steep and smooth as a shard of glass. As luck would have it, comely children’s furniture store assistant Anna (Abigail Hawk) is keen to offer some pointers, although her attraction to Patrick seems a little unfeasible given how grumpy and bad at sexting he is. Eventually, he also gets help from his equally grumpy nextdoor neighbour Robert (John W Lawson), who, like Patrick, is living with a disability.When Patrick decides he’s not responsible enough to raise Camilla, Robert is the only person with a car whom he can persuade to drive him and the kid across country to the aforementioned grandparents. This affords the film a chance to indulge in all the indie road movie cliches, and forge some new ones of its own, which fills out the feature length until it’s time for hugs, apologies and last act reconciliations, wrapped up with still shots over the credits showing everything worked out hunky dory.Daruma is on digital platforms from 1 September.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsComedy filmsDisabilityParents and parentingComedyFamilyreviewsShareReuse this content"

It begins as a blended-family satire with eco-arguments and generational clash bolted on. But with each act the ground on its earthy set turns, developing into what might be a state-of-the-nation play and entering into similar ground to Bartlett’s brilliantAlbionin its portrait of middle-class urbanites who have upped sticks for an alternative, “better” rural existence through sustainable farming.It grows into something bigger and more universal still, to become a play about how to live responsibly in the midst of toxic capitalism. Are the characters who seek freedom in fact in retreat? Is localism just a yearning for a purer past and can we rewild our way to a new pastoral idyll? Important questions are asked through the prism of a family headed up by Ruth (Hattie Morahan), her shaggy, laconic partner, Lip (Sam Troughton) and Ruth’s former stepdaughter, Milly (Nadia Parkes).Lip is ecowarrior and would-be guru in the mould ofJez Butterworth’s Rooster, although more privileged – his farm is a family inheritance – and not nearly as charismatic. Ruth shares his dream of getting back to a kinder, more elemental way of living – up to a point.View image in fullscreenExcellent performances … Nadia Parkes and Terique Jarrett in Juniper Blood.Photograph: Marc BrennerUnder the direction of James Macdonald, the lights do not dip. This draws our eye to the vivid daylight on Lip’s fields, and maybe also the idea that this story about ethical ways of living is of our world, and we are part of it.The set designed by Ultz (who also designed that of Jerusalem) is a grassy bank. It is a living, breathing thing, it seems, with birdsong, tufts of grass that occasionally tumble down and – less welcome – a small, strange insect found in this critic’s bra.The cast give excellent performances and the action is intriguing, the arguments holding us, but the story in itself seems contrived around the play’s ideas. Sometimes these announce themselves in the mouths of characters, especially Milly’s friend, Femi (Terique Jarrett). He is doing an MSc in contemporary rural economy at Oxford, we are told. He certainly sounds as if he is by the third act when he lectures Lip (and us?) on everything from Gen X legacies from Thatcher’s Britain to the economics of global capitalism.Lip, too, seems like an anti-Enlightenment construct – a luddite who puts his principles above life-saving modern medicine.There is plenty that captures current-day anxieties too around technology, globalisation and the disenchantment ofpreppersandsurvivalists. Vitally, it is thoroughly amusing, alongside the serious stuff. Milly is full of beady-eyed Gen Z attitude without becoming a caricature. Tony (Jonathan Slinger), the farmer next door who is trying to rejuvenate himself in his mid-life (crisis?) is simultaneously satirised and heartfelt.Despite its lecturing and trowel-load of ideas, it is compelling and ambitious, Chekhovian in glimmers. Bartlett masterfully weds levity through social satire with complexity and depth of subject matter.And there is something courageous in its biting off more than it can chew. It is not so much a state-of-the-nation play as a state-of-the-world drama, grappling with the very real and prevailing despair over how to live, fix the climate crisis, and find collective hope. Invigorating and welcome, except, of course, for the rogue insect.At Donmar Warehouse, London, until 4 OctoberExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreDonmar WarehouseMike BartlettreviewsShareReuse this content"

The Estonian composer, whocelebrates his 90th birthday this year, had only just discovered the purity of Britten’s music when the latter died. Pärt’s six-minute tribute pits undulating string scales against the sombre toll of a single bell.It was a fitting opening to a wide-ranging concert in which the venerable Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra was put through its paces by Pärt’s Baltic state compatriot, Latvian conductor Andris Nelsons. Emerging from the most poignant of pianissimos, crisscrossing lines rose and fell before the conductor’s clenched hands wrang the final drop of pathos out of the final chord.Isabelle Faust was the late replacement for Hilary Hahn in Dvořák’s Violin Concerto, and although she kept one eye on the music to be on the safe side, this was an impressively organic reading of this amiable intermingling of 19th-century Romanticism and tangy folk idioms. Sleek and silvery at the top, and with a fine line in fluid phrasing, she highlighted the music’s shadier woodland tones while bringing a lightness and lift to the sunnier episodes that pepper the rhapsodic opening movement.View image in fullscreenPut through its paces … Faust and the  Leipzig Gewandhaus play Dvořák’s Violin ConcertoPhotograph: Chris Christodoulou/BBCFaust is disinclined to showboat. Instead, she discovered a poetic delicacy in the concerto’s flashier corners, with Nelsons and his Gewandhaus players her willing and sensitive partners. The central adagio was warmly spun, while in the finale – a spirited Czech furiant – her filigree fingerwork flickered like mercury over the orchestra’s earthier stomp.Nelsons was generally a surefooted guide to Sibelius’s Second Symphony, though occasionally the music betrayed its fragmentary nature. Well-paced, if a little too loud too soon, he teased out plenty of internal dramatics, ratcheting up the tension in the opening movement. In the ensuing andante, baleful bassoons over a darkly determined pizzicato tread powered the tempest-tossed music towards its implacable conclusion. The whirling scherzo was tense, bracing even, while the conductor’s deftly broadened tempi imbued the long-breathed finale with the necessary weight and nobility.Listen again on BBC Soundsuntil 12 October.

When there’s more joy to be had in pootling around enjoying the viewKeza MacDonaldWed 27 Aug 2025 10.01 EDTShareHere’s an admission: I am 37 years old and have never learned to drive. I tried once, in the summer of 2021, and during my second lesson my instructor asked me if I played a lot of video games. When I answered yes, he said, “I thought so,” in a tone that was very clearlynotcomplimentary. Regrettably, it turns out that hundreds of hours spent mercilessly beating my friends and family at Mario Kart and causing vehicular chaos in Grand Theft Auto do not translate instantly to real-life driving skills and judgment. I love racing games precisely because they are unrealistic.Because I still don’t have my licence, I ride my bike everywhere. It’s a giant orange monster of a thing, big enough for my two children to ride on the back, and it looks ridiculous. It makesmelook ridiculous, next to the Lycra-clad middle-aged men on their carbon-fibre frames who zoom past me on the regular. It’s not something I could ever take out into the countryside or down some mountain trail. For that, once again, I must turn to video games.There are surprisingly few games about cycling, but rather like my abiding love for virtual golf, I have developed a longstanding mini obsession with them nonetheless. One of my all-time favourite games isLonely Mountains: Downhill, a mountain-biking game that has you performing extremely precise adjustments to your trajectory down increasingly treacherous mountains, soundtracked by minimalist nature sounds and the sound of your rider smacking into boulders.Knights and Bikesis another lovable cycling-based adventure with the vibe of a 1980s summer holiday, starring a couple of kids exploring an island on two wheels.View image in fullscreenPedal (not) to the metal … Wheel World.Photograph: Messhof/SteamLately I’ve been playing Wheel World, from California developer Messhof (who also made the one-on-one fencing classic Nidhogg). You ride around a sizeable island on an easy-to-handle racing bike, keeping an eye out for hidden paths and ramps and bike parts and taking on local riders in races when you feel like it. It’s a low-octane, cartoon-coloured Forza Horizon on a bike; a game that captures both the freedom and peace of cycling. You don’t feel like you’re controlling a vehicle; you can’t control gravity and wind and the contours of the road. Instead, you just ride.I’ve been recovering from an inconvenient, painful injury for most of this year (hence my periods of absence from the newsletter), so relatively undemanding, feelgood games are just what the doctor ordered. Wheel World is a racing game that calms the nervous system, a rare thing indeed. You are chosen at the start by an ancient bike spirit, and must challenge the island’s speediest champions to reclaim supernatural bike parts. Unlike in Lonely Mountains, none of this is particularly difficult – I was winning races effortlessly most of the time – but it feels really good to ride around, winding up hills and then freewheeling down towards the city at the centre of the island, heading out to the Provence-reminiscent farmland where you share the road with tractors. You don’t even have to worry too much about sticking to the tarmac.I’ve played a few racing games that are structured like Wheel World, but none thatfeellike it. It made me feel entirely at ease. It’s a whole game-world constructed entirely around bike worship, with no complications and no distractions. Tooling your ride is half the fun, as every new part slightly changes how it feels to pedal around (and they come in fun colours). The soundtrack is exactly energetic enough during races and exactly absent enough when you’re riding around enjoying the vibe and looking for something to do. After five hours or so I was clearly overqualified to take on the final race, but I didn’t want it to end, so I spent another evening exploring everywhere I hadn’t been yet instead. Everywhere I went was explicitly designed for two-wheeled pleasure.Sometimes in a period of physical or emotional recovery, you are in need of a huge game to get lost in; sometimes you just need something short and sweet with the power to lift your mood. Wheel World has helped me miss riding my real bike a little bit less.What to playView image in fullscreenTop Gear … Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater.Photograph: KonamiLongtime readers will know that I have bounced off every Hideo Kojima game I’ve ever played, but our critic Tom Regan was delighted to return to Metal Gear Solid 3, which is being rereleased later this week asMetal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater. “Snake Eater is a leaner, meaner Metal Gear, a cold war caper owing just as much to James Bond as it does Apocalypse Now,”he writes. “Kojima makes no secret of his love of Hollywood, yet where his works often balloon into unwieldy epics, this game is still his most filmic achievement to date. It’s silly, self-contained and enjoyably campy, veering from the sublime to the ridiculous with admirable swagger.

The setting is weird: an iridescent, far-future imagining of New England where organic and non-organic matter mingle in strange, alchemical ways. And the characters are undeniably quirky: one is a bird called Twig whose beak is made from driftwood. Strangest of all: you play as a lighthouse that has inexplicably become animate, sprouting tiny, spindly little legs to carry its wibbling, wobbling body.In the sea of action-hero young men and, to a lesser degree, women, the lighthouse stands out as an unlikely star. Creative lead Lee Petty is a little fuzzy on the details of how it came to be. Rather, he talks about the creation of the protagonist as he does the broader action-adventure experience: as if it rose out of his subconscious. Despite the ostensible absurdity, Petty believes there is a certain intuition about it. “You have a light, and light has a very strong connection with life,” he says. “You can imagine the verbs for the player, and the actions, puzzles, mechanics that fall out of that.”View image in fullscreen‘Life has continued to evolve in completely unexpected ways’ … Keeper.Photograph: Double FineThe lighthouse’s illuminated beacon is the primary way you interact with the game’s teeming island setting. In “unfocused” mode, you direct the beam about a fantastical environment, causing foliage and small creatures to grow, change and morph. In “focused” mode, the light’s power is concentrated: larger objects undergo transformation while some materials are repelled or attracted; this is the basis of the game’s more involved puzzles.Keeper’s world is one of gauzy, psychedelic purples and deep, verdant greens. We see bioluminescent rock formations, tree-sized tendrils protruding from their gigantic flower heads, and a gorgeous, whale-like creature floating through the sky, vegetation growing unexpectedly on its back. This ecological extravaganza is partly inspired by 1980s fantasy movies such as The Dark Crystal and The NeverEnding Story, “weird” and “imperfect” works, admits Petty, yet “so earnest in their desire to create a world that you haven’t seen before”.View image in fullscreenGauzy, psychedelic purples … Keeper.Photograph: Double FineReal life proved just as inspiring for the creative lead. During Covid lockdowns, he walked alone in the pretty foothills south of his San Francisco home. Petty gazed at the abundant vegetation while meditating on what the planet might look like should humanity cease to exist. He was also reading books and watching movies about mycelium networks, thinking deeply about the interconnectedness and interdependence of ecosystems.This deluge of feelings, real-world circumstances and reference material coalesced as a fever dream, says Petty. He envisioned a “a weird island, a sort of surreal, post-human thing, where life has continued to evolve in completely unexpected ways”.The game’s genesis arrived shortly after Petty’s award-winning employer Double Fine, maker of trippy platformerPsychonauts 2,Stackingand many other idiosyncratic titles, was acquired by Microsoft. The new management was receptive to his experimental idea: he was given the time and resources to explore the concept before locking down its form. Keeper seems to have embodied the laid-back approach of its making: the vibe is languorously dreamy with many opportunities to slow down and smell the enchanting and totally bizarre roses.“You’re not rushed along, you’re not given mission objectives. There are no pop-ups on the screen with meta-rewards,” says Petty. “You’re kind of left to dwell in the space.”And yet there is a grim irony that may yet sour this sweet, whimsical experience: Keeper’s vivid celebration of life is being funded by Microsoft at a time when the company’s cloud-based storage platformAzure has been usedto facilitate the preparation of deadly airstrikes and military operations in Gaza and the West Bank. The the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement has called for the boycott of Microsoft and Xbox products. Recently, unionised workers at French studio Arkane, also owned by Microsoft, issued an open letter stating that its parent company “has no place being accomplice of a genocide”. Microsoft has sinceclaimed to be investigatingthe use of its platform in this manner, which is, it claims, a breach of the terms of service.Petty, of course, is far removed from the decisions made by his bosses at Microsoft, and he stresses as much. He says this is the “downside” of being owned by a much larger organisation, one whose purview extends far beyond entertainment. “I’m not in control. Double Fine is not necessarily tacitly endorsing anything of our parent company,” he says. “We’re just trying to make great games.”Keeper is due for release on PC andXboxin OctoberExplore more on these topicsPCSummer games previewsGamesXboxXbox series S/XfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Within the iridescent marvel that is Croatia’s Blue Cave, four boats holding about a dozen people each have an allotted 10 minutes before we motor back out again so that the next batch of visitors can float in. About 1,500 people a day visit this beautiful grotto on the island of Biševo, the biggest attraction within the Vis archipelago, two hours and 20 minutes south of Split by ferry. After paying the €24 entrance fee, I’m left underwhelmed by this maritime conveyor belt. At least the 45-minute foot ferry from Komiža, on the archipelago’s main island of Vis, to Biševo’s Mezoporat Bay, the launch point for boats to the Blue Cave, is only €4.Croatia map for VisMany of the other cave visitors are on one of the countless speedboat tours departing from all over Dalmatia and crowding into Mezoporat Bay before whizzing off elsewhere. I’m staying on Vis itself to take a longer, slower, more satisfying look at the island, where I spent a night three years ago and which I’ve been hankering to revisit ever since. Despite the overwhelming popularity of the nearby Blue Cave and its speedboat tours, plus the boost in tourism on Vis after much of Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again was filmed here in 2017, I know there’s a quieter, mellower side to the island, and it doesn’t take long to find it.‘Actively relaxing’ I find is a fitting description for this breakIn sleepy Rukavac on Vis’s south-eastern coast, British couple Xania and Craig Wear welcome me into one of their four guest rooms in the large stone house they renovated after moving here 20 years ago. The former PE teachers run WearActive, offering yoga, kayaking, paddleboarding and cycling in Rukavac. On their seven-day, “relaxingly active” holidays you can do as much or as little as you like. “Actively relaxing”, I find, is just as fitting a description.View image in fullscreenKayaking just off Stiniva beach, Vis.Photograph: Mary NovakovichXania serves delicious plant-based food on the large shaded terrace, which has views of the sea. But before breakfast we walk to the flat rocks of Bili Bok beach, where Craig puts me through my yoga paces. Clean, salty air fills my lungs as I lunge and stretch by the Adriatic. I follow this with a swim at nearby Srebrna beach. Late afternoons are spent lazing on the pebbles at Tepluš beach, 10 minutes’ walk from the house. I could get used to this.The next morning, my hosts suggest kayaking 6 miles (10km) from Rukavac to Stiniva Bay, Vis’s most famous beach and a place of peerless beauty. Two giant limestone cliffs curve round the pebbly beach, nearly meeting in the middle. From the top of the hill behind the cliffs there’s a steep, rocky footpath to the beach, but it’s infinitely more enjoyable to paddle on to the beach, where only kayaks, paddleboards and small rubber dinghies are allowed. Craig is on a paddleboard, while Xania and I share a kayak, and my husband has a single kayak. At 8.30am there are only about four people here, and we have a blissful, peaceful swim.View image in fullscreenThe Blue Cave of Biševo is beautiful but can be very busy with visitors.Photograph: Mary NovakovichCraig knows I’ve always wanted to learn how to paddleboard, so on the way back to Rukavac we stop in tranquil Ruda bay. After some expert instruction, I’m on the board and paddling away, initial jitters soothed by the hypnotic motion of gliding on the water. Now I see what all the fuss is about.Vis town comes alive at night, the restaurant terraces along the Venetian harbour buzzing in the summer warmthAway from the water, my husband and I get to know Vis more intimately, crisscrossing its vineyard-covered interior and heading up and down its winding mountain roads. Its capital, Vis town, dozes during the day, most restaurants closing while the sailing crowd cruises. It comes alive at night, the restaurant terraces along the Venetian harbour buzzing in the summertime warmth.Smaller Komiža is the place for lunch, with everything from cheap pizzerias to smart restaurants. Near Gusarica beach we find Konoba Jastožera, a restaurant built on stilts over the water, where lobster pots hold the restaurant’s speciality.It’s only when I hear the soundtrack to the Mamma Mia! films that I realise we’ve stumbled on one of the sequel’s filming locations, and instantly expect high prices and low quality. Wrong on both counts. As long as we don’t order lobster, it’s one of the most affordable restaurants we’ve seen so far, with two courses for €25. It’s not all money, money, money here.View image in fullscreenMary Novakovich in Konoba Jastožera.Photograph: Adam BatterbeeFor an island that was off limits to foreigners until 1989, when the Yugoslav army base here closed down, Vis seems to be taking its time in developing its tourism (Biševo’sBlue Cave aside). I spot a few military tours about, taking people to the huge network of tunnels and bunkers left behind by the army. I get a fascinating glimpse into 1944 Vis when I hike up to the collection of caves at the foot of Mount Hum, where future Yugoslav president Tito and his fellow partisans hid from the Nazis.Then there’s the growth of active holiday companies bringing more people to the island, which Xania sees as a positive thing, even if it means more competition. “Vis would then become an island that’s known for its adventure holidays,” she says. “And then you have more people coming to do that kind of tourism.” I nod in agreement. The island’s natural rhythm – slow, unhurried – is one to be savoured, not raced through.The trip was provided byWearActive, whichoffers seven-night active holidays from€1,590pp,including breakfast, four lunches, three dinners with wine, five days of activities, transfers to restaurants on four evenings and from Vistown ferry terminalExplore more on these topicsCroatia holidaysEurope holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I’ve simplified the original by making it entirely from pea pods and parmesan rind, not least to show just how much flavour and colour they hold.Pea pod risottoFlavourful pea pods are blanched, then shocked in iced water to stop them cooking further and so preserve their chlorophyll (to save on ice to make the iced water, simply put a bowl of water in the freezer for an hour). They are then blended into a vivid, emerald-green puree.Both pea pods and parmesan rinds are naturally rich in glutamates, which provide the deep umami flavours that make this risotto so satisfying and complex despite using what would typically be discarded. Use a jug blender, if you have one, but a Vitamix, Thermomix or a Nutribullet-style blender will also work brilliantly to create a very fine puree. In fact, you may not even need to pass the puree through a sieve, though it’s still important to check for any fibres and sieve if need be.Most risotto recipes call for the rice to be stirred frequently to create a creamy consistency. Here, however, I’ve adopted Blanc’s efficient method by just leaving it to tick over on a very low heat before stirring vigorously at the end to break down the starch and create that creamy consistency we know and love.Serves4350g empty pea pods, ideally organic (save the peas for another recipe)100g parsley stalks, or spinach2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra to serve1 small white onion, peeled and finely diced1 garlic clove, peeled200g risotto rice(carnaroli or arborio)125ml white wine, or 1 tbsp white-wine vinegar40g parmesan rindJuice and finely grated zest of 1/4 organic unwaxed lemon25g butter20g parmesan shavings, to serveSea salt andblack pepperBlanch the pea pods and parsley stalks in a large pan of boiling water for just a minute, until they turn a vivid green. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a bowl filled with 350ml iced water and stir so the greens cool rapidly. Blend in a high-speed blender for a minute, until very smooth, then pass through a sieve if need be.Put the oil in a saucepan set over a low-medium heat, then add the diced onion and saute, stirring, for a couple of minutes. Add the whole garlic clove and rice, and cook, stirring, for two minutes, until the rice turns translucent. Pour in the wine and bring to a boil so it reduces. Stir in the parmesan rind and 500ml of the pureed pea pod liquid, bring up to a very gentle simmer, then turn down the heat to very low and cover with a lid. Leave to simmer gently for 20 minutes, checking every now and then to make sure the risotto isn’t boiling.Take off the heat, stir vigorously for five minutes to help break down the starch and create a creamy consistency, then stir in another 200ml of the pureed pea pod liquid, the lemon zest and juice and the butter, and season to taste.Serve in shallow bowls topped with parmesan shavings and a drizzle of olive oil.Explore more on these topicsRiceWaste notFoodFood wasteItalian food and drinkCheeseVegetablesSummer food and drinkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Their sheer versatility often helps bring a dish together, while their natural acidity balances spices beautifully. Firm ripe tomatoes are essential in cooking, because they hold their texture better, release only just enough juice without turning mushy, and also provide that crucial balance between sweet and sour. Today’s two dishes are prime examples of Indian home cooking and comfort food at its best.Tamatar rice (rice cooked in tomatoes and spices; pictured top)Serve this with any dal or meat curry, though if you ask me it’s best eaten by itself with yoghurt or a tomato raita – to make the latter, mix a small chopped, deseeded tomato into 150g yoghurt, then stir in 25ml milk, a small handful of chopped fresh coriander, a teaspoon of toasted crushed cumin seeds and season to taste.Prep10 minSoak15 minCook30 minServes4250g basmati rice250g firm ripe tomatoes(about 2 large ones), roughly chopped6 tsp melted ghee20g cashew nuts1 tsp black mustard seeds1 tsp cumin seeds10-12 fresh curry leaves2 banana shallots, peeled and thinly sliced1tsp saltJuice of ½ lemonYoghurt, to serveSoak the rice in cold water for 15 minutes, then drain and rinse thoroughly under the cold tap.Put the chopped tomatoes in a blender and blitz smooth. Once pureed, strain through a sieve into a bowl, reserving the liquid for later.Put two teaspoons of melted ghee in a wide pan or wok for which you have a lid, put it on a low heat, then lightly toast the cashew nuts – lift them out as soon as they start to change colour. Add the remaining four teaspoons of melted ghee to the same pan, tip in the mustard and cumin seeds and, as soon as they start to pop, stir in the curry leaves and thinly sliced shallots. Turn up the heat to high and cook, stirring, for three minutes.Pour in the reserved tomato liquid, cook over a medium heat for four minutes, then add the salt and rice, and stir to combine. Pour in 450ml just-boiled water, bring everything to a boil, then turn down the heat and stir in the toasted cashew nuts and lemon juice. Cover the pan with a lid and leave to cook for eight minutes – the idea is to let the rice absorb all the liquid, so don’t touch it.After eight minutes, take the pan off the heat and leave to rest for at least five minutes before serving.Tamatar ki sabzi(tomato curry)View image in fullscreenPrep10 minCook35 minServes3-430ml rapeseed oil1 tsp cumin seeds1 tsp black mustard seeds10-12 fresh curry leaves1 medium onion, peeled and thinly sliced20g piece fresh ginger, peeled and cut into julienne strips3 green finger chillies, slit open lengthways475g firm ripe tomatoes, cut into quarters1 tsp sea salt1 tsp ground turmeric1 tsp sambar powder1 tsp brown sugar15g chopped fresh coriander leaves, to garnishRice or bread, to servePut the oil in a deep, wide saucepan on a medium heat, and add the cumin and mustard seeds.

Here is how to make your own, from strawberries and cream to apple pie paniniTim DowlingWed 27 Aug 2025 10.28 EDTLast modified on Wed 27 Aug 2025 10.45 EDTShareTesco’s recently introducedbirthday cake sandwich– an unholy assemblage of jam, soft cheese, frosting and sprinkles, stuffed between two slices of brioche – may well be the world’s most depressing foodstuff, a cake designed to be eaten in one go, possibly on your birthday, probably alone.The birthday cake sandwich follows hard on the heels of M&S’s strawberries and cream sandwich – a UK version of the fruit sandwiches, or furutsu sandos, sold in convenience stores in Japan. The M&S sandwich received a certain amount of criticism, along withsome surprisingly good reviews. But both sandwiches were controversial, not least from a nutritional standpoint (the Tesco sandwich contains 31.5g of sugar, over a third of the recommended maximum daily intake for an adult), but also because they upset our notion of what a sandwich is. Aren’t they supposed to be savoury? Aren’t they supposed to be lunch, rather than dessert?View image in fullscreenMarks & Spencer’s strawberry and cream sandwich, which is filled with fruit and light whipped cream cheese on fluffy sweetened bread.Photograph: M&S/PABur sweet sandwiches are not uncommon – anything with jam in it counts – and the sandwich itself is not a rules-based enterprise: it’s more of a continuous trial-and-error process – even as you eat a sandwich you’ve just made, you’re thinking about how it could be better next time. When it comes to sweet fillings, you’ve got to try at least a few before you reject them out of hand. Here are 12 ideas to get you started.View image in fullscreenA Japanese sweet fruit sandwich with strawberry, pineapple and kiwi.Photograph: Dariia Chernenko/AlamyA note: most sweet sandwiches do not require a recipe, and are subject to endless modification. Feel free to experiment with different breads, flavours and proportions – you may as well have it the way you want it.‘The Earl of Sandwich is rolling in his grave’: Tesco’s birthday cake sandwich divides opinionRead moreFirst up, a deep-fried peanut butter and jelly (clear jam) sandwich, from food blogger Davie Leite at the website Leite’s Culinaria. Arguably, the classic PB&J is already a sweet sandwich – but the addition of a sugary deep-fried batter turns this humble childhood treat into the kind of snack that helped kill Elvis.The recipeoffers two extra options I immediately rejected: sliced banana (no thank you) and a white chocolate ganache for dipping (are you kidding?).View image in fullscreenTim’s deep-fried peanut butter and jelly sandwich.Photograph: Tim Dowling/The GuardianA sturdy sourdough bread is recommended. I might have sliced it a little too thick – of no consequence taste wise, but it makes it harder to fry. Be careful not to go overboard with the fillings. Slap it together as you normally would, dip the whole thing into the batter, and deep fry it in hot oil, flipping once.If you’re looking for rare examples of foodstuffs that are not improved by deep-frying, you can start here. You could tinker with proportions all day and still not make something palatable out of this heavy, greasy, sticky mess. In case it was just me, I forced some on my oldest son, who simply shook, went quiet, then said, no.View image in fullscreenA sweet fried sandwich with chocolate and banana.Photograph: Reji Ittiachan/AlamyOther sweet fried sandwiches includethe grilled Nutella banana sandwich, agrilled Nutella and marshmallow sandwichand thebanana french toast sandwich. The classicMonte Christo sandwich, while technically savoury (it’s ham and cheese on french toast), is traditionally served in the US dredged in icing sugar, with jam. As an American, I apologise.The Japanese strawberry and cream sandwich – or ichigo sando – on which M&S based its version, is easy enough to recreate at home. Justwatch recipe developer Marc Matsumoto. I substituted brioche slices for the authentic Japanese milk bread: it’s easier to find.First, carefully wash, top and dry your strawberries – five per sandwich. Whip a generous quantity of double cream, sweeten to taste and set aside.The final key component in this recipe is strawberry jam – spread a thin layer on both bread slices and heap the whipped cream on top in shallow pyramids. On one half push your largest strawberry into the centre of the cream and then position four more round it, pointy ends facing the corners of the bread.View image in fullscreenUse five strawberries per sandwich and a generous quantity of cream.Photograph: Tim Dowling/The GuardianPlace the other slice on top and gently push down at the corners and edges until the top is sort of domed and the edges of both slices are nearly touching. Now wrap the whole thing snugly in cling film and leave in the fridge until it firms up – about half an hour. Then remove, unwrap and slice crossways. If you’ve been careful, you should end up cutting right through the middle of three strawberries – presentation counts.This is delicious, and why shouldn’t it be? Ultimately, what’s not to like? Jam, strawberries, cream, brioche – it’s basically a Victoria sponge.View image in fullscreen‘What’s not to like’ … Tim’s strawberries and cream sandwich.Photograph: Tim Dowling/The GuardianIf you’re after a more decorative fruit sando, you can make these rathersophisticated flower versions using grapes, kiwi, tangerines and strawberries.The ice-cream sandwich was invented in New York City at the turn of the last century, as an improvement on small slabs of ice-cream served between sheets of paper by street vendors. The idea caught on. “There are ham sandwiches and salmon sandwiches and cheese sandwiches and several other kinds of sandwiches,”announced the New York Mail and Express in 1899, “but the latest is the ice-cream sandwich.” They cost a penny, and quickly became a fad.It’s hard to be precise about what went on the outside of those first ice-cream sandwiches. A reporter sent out to investigate by the New York Sun in 1901 described it as “a thin, delicate, freshly baked and altogether agreeable sweet cracker”.The ones I remember from childhood were chocolate, rectangular and pleasingly bland.This recipe is a decent approximation, without getting too complicated – flour, sugar, cocoa powder, butter, bicarbonate of soda, a pinch of salt, milk and a few drops of vanilla, whisked to a smooth consistency, dropped in uniform spoonfuls on to a lined baking tray and baked for about 10 minutes, but keep an eye on them.Once they’re cool, they need to be frozen for an hour before they’re stiff enough to squish a scoop of ice-cream between. Refreeze until needed. This recipe contains an important advisory: the ice-cream must be of the worst sort – soft and airy – for this to work. The ice-cream sandwich isn’t everybody’s idea of a good time – a lot of people don’t like biting into ice-cream – but I would eat these for breakfast.View image in fullscreen‘I would eat these for breakfast’ … an ice-cream sandwich.Photograph: Tim Dowling/The GuardianOther variations includethe chocolate chip cookie ice-cream sandwichand the Italianbrioche con gelato, which is literally some ice-cream in a bun (apparently Siciliansdoeat these for breakfast).The apple pie panini sounds plausible enough: take the basic constituents of an apple pie, jam them between two slices of bread and toast.This recipe, from justataste.com, combines thinly sliced apple, mascarpone whipped with honey, and bread (they use raisin bread, but I couldn’t find any, so I returned to my brioche loaf).View image in fullscreenThe apple pie panini.Photograph: Tim Dowling/The GuardianMy version, alas, was not an unalloyed success: the mascarpone melted and leaked out everywhere, while the apples remained uncooked, and the brioche went gluey in the heat of the sandwich press. It could work with different bread and different filling, but that, I think, would be a different sandwich.Finally, if you are so minded, you can reproduce your own birthday cake sandwich at home, such asthis one from Love in My Oven. A cake sandwich is, after all, just a cake with the icing on the inside – the “bread” here is just a sheet of sponge. This recipe is loosely based on sandwich cakes currently available from vending machines in US shopping malls. But if you’re going to produce a single slice of cake for your birthday, it seems somehow fitting that you should have to make it yourself. Many happy returns.Explore more on these topicsSandwichesFoodDessertCakeBreadFruitfeaturesShareReuse this content"
