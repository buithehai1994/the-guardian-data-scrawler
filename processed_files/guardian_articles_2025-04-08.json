The Ministry of Justice hopes the project will help boost public safety but campaigners have called it “chilling and dystopian”.The existence of the project was discovered by the pressure group Statewatch, and some of its workings uncovered through documents obtained byFreedom of Information requests.Statewatch says data from people not convicted of any criminal offence will be used as part of the project, including personal information about self-harm and details relating to domestic abuse. Officials strongly deny this, insisting only data about people with at least one criminal conviction has been used.The government says the project is at this stage for research only, but campaigners claim the data used would build bias into the predictions against minority-ethnic and poor people.The MoJ says the scheme will “review offender characteristics that increase the risk of committing homicide” and “explore alternative and innovative data science techniques to risk assessment of homicide”.The project would “provide evidence towards improving risk assessment of serious crime, and ultimately contribute to protecting the public via better analysis”, a spokesperson added.The project, which was commissioned by the prime minister’s office when Rishi Sunak was in power, is using data about crime from various official sources including the Probation Service and data from Greater Manchester police before 2015.The types of information processed includes names, dates of birth, gender and ethnicity, and a number that identifies people on the police national computer.Statewatch’s claim that data from innocent people and those who have gone to the police for help will be used is based on a part of the data-sharing agreement between the MoJ and GMP.A section marked: “type of personal data to be shared” by police with the government includes various types of criminal convictions, but also listed is the age a person first appeared as a victim, including for domestic violence, and the age a person was when they first had contact with police.Also to be shared – and listed under “special categories of personal data” - are “health markers which are expected to have significant predictive power”, such as data relating to mental health, addiction, suicide and vulnerability, and self-harm, as well as disability.Sofia Lyall, a researcher for Statewatch, said: “The Ministry of Justice’s attempt to build this murder prediction system is the latest chilling and dystopian example of the government’s intent to develop so-called crime ‘prediction’ systems.“Time and again, research shows that algorithmic systems for ‘predicting’ crime are inherently flawed.“This latest model, which uses data from our institutionally racist police and Home Office, will reinforce and magnify the structural discrimination underpinning the criminal legal system.“Like other systems of its kind, it will code in bias towards racialised and low-income communities. Building an automated tool to profile people as violent criminals is deeply wrong, and using such sensitive data on mental health, addiction and disability is highly intrusive and alarming.”A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said:“This project is being conducted for research purposes only. It has been designed using existing data held by HM Prison and Probation Service and police forces on convicted offenders to help us better understand the risk of people on probation going on to commit serious violence. A report will be published in due course.”Officials say the prison and probation service already use risk assessment tools, and this project will see if adding in new data sources, from police and custody data, would improve risk assessment.Explore more on these topicsCrimeUK criminal justicePrisons and probationPolicenewsShareReuse this content"

Announcing the deal on Wednesday, the prime minister, Keir Starmer, was eager to claim credit for any potential benefits.“This is our plan for change in action,” Starmer said, “combining local and national growth with creating around 28,000 new jobs across sectors such as construction, AI, and tourism.View image in fullscreenThe proposed location – a 192-hectare site that was formerly a brickworks.Photograph: Universal Destinations & Experiences/PA“It is not just about numbers; it’s about securing real opportunities for people in our country. Together, we are building a brighter future for the UK, getting people into work and ensuring our economy remains strong and competitive.”The project, the government says, will bring a £50bn boost to Britain’s economy and create 20,000 jobs in construction, with a further 8,000 operational roles once it is up and running, forecast for 2031.The enormous project does not yet have planning permission and will be a test of the government’spromise to speed up major construction projectsby reducing the scope for legal challenges. It has been strongly backed by local government leaders, however.Questioned by Bedford MP Mohammad Yasinlast month, Starmer agreed that it was “vital that we do unleash the potential of … Bedford, by generating growth, jobs, and opportunities”.As part of the announcement the government said it will make “a major investment in infrastructure around the site” to ensure it is easily accessible.The rollercoaster king: the man behind the UK’s fastest thrill-ride – podcastRead moreEarly discussion of the project – which has been under negotiation formore than a year– made much of Bedford’s relative proximity to London.Earlier this week, the transport secretary approved plans for a major expansion of nearby Luton airport –overruling planning inspectorswho had recommended blocking the scheme on environmental grounds – which will see annual passenger numbers almost double to 32 million by 2043.As well as Universal Studios Hollywood in Los Angeles, its flagship theme park in Orlando, Florida, and its 2021 venture in Beijing, Universal also runs resorts in Japan and Singapore.The company, rebranded Universal Destinations and Experiences in 2023, is owned by the US telecoms groupComcast, which is also the parent company of Sky.Mike Cavanagh, president of Comcast Corporation, said he “could not be more excited to take this very important step in our plan to create and deliver an incredible Universal theme park and resort in the heart of the United Kingdom, which complements our growing US-based parks business by expanding our global footprint to Europe”.Rachel Reeves, the chancellor said: “At a time of global change, this investment is a vote of confidence in Britain as a place to do business.“Universal’s investment will bring billions to the economy and create thousands of jobs to the UK, putting more money in people’s pockets.”Explore more on these topicsTheme parksComcastUniversal PicturesnewsShareReuse this content"

Last year’s eventwas also plagued by anxieties about sewage in the river, and, after Cambridge had won, the Oxford team revealed thatsome of their numberhad been ill in the lead-up.Other river-based sporting events have also been affected; in May a Thames swimming race which has been held for more than120 years was cancelledover sickness fears.Oxford confirm illnesses before Boat Race but stop short of blaming pollutionRead moreSir Steve Redgrave, the Olympic gold medallist, said rowers needed to be protected from polluted water. “It’s a real worry that in 2025, unsafe water quality in the Thames is still a concern. Rowers, river users, and the public deserve better.”The testing, carried out every weekday between 10 March and 7 April at the beginning, middle and end of the race route between Putney and Mortlake, revealed that 29.5% of samples exceeded safe limits for entering the water,and were almost three times the threshold for bathing waters rated “poor”.It was also a particularly dry spell of weather. Raw sewage discharges from storm overflows are only supposed to take place during exceptional weather, like extreme rainfall or intense storms. Spills of raw sewage during dry weather could be illegal.The route does not have bathing water status but campaigners for River Action, who carried out the testing, used the threshold as a benchmark to indicate the threat to public health.River Action said the monitor on a sewage outflow at Kew – upstream of the race’s finishing post – went offline in January, and remained out of operation during the entire testing window.As well as raw sewage,Thames Watertreatment plants discharge treated sewage into the river on a daily basis.River Action believes the pollution from sewage treatment plants – which have no legal limits imposed on them for E coli – are a major but overlooked factor in the unsafe water quality.Erica Popplewell, River Action’s head of communities, said the victorious Boat Race crew should think twice about throwing their cox in the water after the race, as is the custom.She said systematic reform of the water industry and its regulators was needed.“The public demands Thames Water and regulators act now to improve sewage treatment infrastructure,” she said.“Thames Water has profited from pollution for years whilst the government has failed to enforce the law. It’s time to refinance the company without burdening bill payers and end pollution-for-profit.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

It said the promotion breached the advertising code and should not appear again.The script of the advert was based on Viagogo’s internal calculation that 53% of concert listings on the site included at least one ticket listed at below face value. The ASA said fans would have understood the claim to mean more than one lower-priced ticket was available for those events.It said: “One ticket per event was not a significant proportion of tickets and, as such, did not represent a reasonable chance for consumers to purchase tickets below face value … we considered that the claim, as it would be understood by consumers, had not been substantiated and was therefore misleading.”It also took issue with the definition of face value that Viagogo applied, which included the application of 20% extra for fees, which it said differed from the one widely understood by consumers and also the definition the company used on its own website.The music industry group FanFair Alliance, which campaigns against for-profit resale and touting, submitted the initial complaint to the ASA. It said Viagogo’s claim was “laughable”.A FanFair spokesperson said: “According to a report by the CMA, 80-100% of the tickets sold through Viagogo in 2019 were priced at more than 20% above face value. It is a website dependent upon large-scale ticket touts.”A Viagogo spokesperson said: “The advertisement in question is from last year, has been discontinued and has not aired since then.” They added that Viagogo was “fully compliant in the UK”.The podcasting firm Acast is responsible for adverts on the Political Currency show hosted by Osborne and Balls, according to Persephonica, which makes the programme.The Guardian has approached Acast for comment.Explore more on these topicsViagogoTicket pricesEd BallsGeorge OsborneCompetition and Markets AuthorityRegulatorsConsumer affairsnewsShareReuse this content"

The facility makes the steel for almost all UK rail tracks.Whitehall sources said Starmer and Reeves were aligned in considering steel to be of “huge strategic importance” and that “all options are on the table, including nationalisation”. The chancellor spoke to union leaders involved in talks over the weekend and made clear her support for the steel industry.Starmer promised a hearing of parliament’s liaison committee on Tuesday that he would do everything he could to keep a functioning steel industry in the UK. “We are doing our everything we can to ensure there’s a bright future for Scunthorpe,” the prime minister said.Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, is to have further meetings withBritish Steelbosses on Wednesday.Meanwhile,Nigel Farage, the leader of Reform UK, repeated his call for the government to nationalise the Scunthorpe plant within the next three days or risk the closure of its two blast furnaces.Farage said three days would allow time for orders to be placed for iron ore pellets and coking coal, which keep the furnaces running.It forms part of Reform UK’s three-point plan to save British steel, which includes the government taking over two electric arc furnaces at Liberty Steel’s plant in Rotherham, and hiring global steel experts.Speaking from the Scunthorpe plant, Farage criticised the government for having “dithered and delayed”, given “the UK’s steel industry is broken”.The steel industry has been affected by Donald Trump’s tariffs: a 10% tariff on US imports of British goods has been imposed, along with a 25% tariff on cars and separate import taxes for steel and aluminium.Starmer has said he does not believe Trump’s tariffs are a “temporary passing phase”, telling MPs that he would be pushing for mitigation but was prepared to retaliate if necessary.The prime minister set out his latest stance on the tariffs that have caused chaos in global stock markets, saying the UK would not “jump in with both feet” to retaliate.In a hearing of MPs, he said: “Obviously, we have to keep our options on the table and do the preparatory work for retaliation if necessary. But I think that trying to negotiate an arrangement which mitigates the tariffs is better.”The UK is seeking to negotiate with the US over the tariffs, with Starmer confirming there could be “questions” about objections by the US to the digital services tax on big tech companies and new online safety laws that affect them.However, he emphasised that he would not “trade away” the NHS with any concessions to the US in trade talks about access to the UK’s health market.The Liberal Democrats called on Starmer to commit to giving parliament a say over any future US trade deal, saying: “It would be immoral for Trump’s tech bro backers to be given tax breaks while children’s safety online is thrown under the bus.”Polling fromMore in Commonhas found that two-thirds of Britons are worried about the tariffs and are nearly twice as likely to support as to oppose retaliation, with 51% of people saying the UK should respond with tariffs of its own.AfterReeves sought to reassure the financial marketson Tuesday that there was no systemic instability, Starmer said his goal was to ensure the UK economy was “resilient and thriving”.Asked if the government could intervene to prevent recession, similar to steps taken during the Covid pandemic, the prime minister said the support was “more in the nature of breaking down barriers that are in the way”, rather than spending cash. He said changes to the zero-emissions vehicle mandate and clinical trials announced on Monday were aimed at paving the way for this, along with changes to the planning system.During the hearing, Starmer was also questioned by the chairs of select committees, including the Labour MPs Debbie Abrahams and Sarah Owen, on the impact ofwelfare changeson disabled people. In the two-hour hearing, Starmer:Defended the welfare cuts as being based on “dignity” and criticised the Office for Budget Responsibility for not taking into account possible behavioural changes of people affected by the cuts when assessing the consequences of the policy.Said threats from foreign powers targeting people in the UK were “growing” and the issue was constantly being raised in international talks. He added: “I think we generally underestimate that threat, and it’s very important we’re alive to it.”Stepped up his criticism of regulators, telling MPs he was “astonished” by how many there were and saying he was “frustrated” by the barriers they put up.Called for an inquiry into thekilling of 15 aid workers in Gazaand said international law “underpins everything we do bilaterally and multilaterally” when questioned about the conflict in the Middle East.Said he would speak to the intelligence agencies and the Kyiv government after Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukraine president, saidtwo Chinese citizens had been captured fightingas part of the Russian army.Said changes to the social care system could come as soon as next year amid a review led by Lady Louise Casey.Explore more on these topicsBritish SteelKeir StarmerTrump tariffsDonald TrumpTariffsRachel ReevesNigel FaragenewsShareReuse this content"

As well as Saunderson’s drug dealing, it revealed his relationship with Pegg.The trial at Preston crown court heard Pegg had signed off on temporary release for Saunderson while she was a governor at HMP Kirkham inLancashire. The court heard that Pegg, who had driven a Honda Jazz before Saunderson gave her the Mercedes, was seen as a “rising star” within the Prison Service, climbing the career ladder from graduate entrant to prison governor in just six years.View image in fullscreenPegg had been driving a Honda Jazz before being given the £12,000 Mercedes C-Class car (pictured).Photograph: Crown Prosecution Services (CPS)/PAPegg joined as governor of HMP Kirkham, a category D men’s open prison, in 2018. Saunderson had been moved to the prison in June 2017 after receiving a 10-year sentence in 2014 for drugs conspiracy and money laundering.“Despite her success, she didn’t play by the rules that everybody else had to follow,” the prosecutor Barbara Webster told the court at the opening of the trial. “Her downfall was twofold – the first, despite having a good income, she lived beyond her means.“She spent all her income and more, incurring debts, and she had county court judgments made against her. As a consequence, she became vulnerable and open to exploitation.”During the trial, it emerged Saunderson had developed and delivered a programme titled BADD (Beating Alcohol and Drug Dependency) for inmates at several jails – while at the time being a major drug dealer running an amphetamines factory.Pegg claimed her contact with Saunderson was owing to his involvement in the BADD programme, but the court heard that even members of his own gang had complained that their boss was spending too much time with Pegg and away from his wife and “work”.Detectives found Saunderson’s DNA on a pair of flip-flops and a toothbrush after a raid at Pegg’s home in Orrell, a suburb of Wigan, the court heard.A police investigation also found that despite Pegg’s £3,000 a month income, she had significant debts, and had not declared three county court judgments to her employers. This amounted to misconduct, as debts make officials vulnerable to corruption.Detectives found designer clothes, handbags and jewellery, and that Pegg had been living beyond her means, buying Jimmy Choo shoes and Chanel necklaces. Her four credit cards were “maxed out” and she had 6p in her savings account, the court heard.“I didn’t think I was doing anything wrong, but when I look back now, I was incredibly stupid,” Pegg told the court, giving evidence in her defence. She was convicted of two counts of misconduct in a public office and one count of possession of criminal property, after the jury deliberated for two hours and 43 minutes following a three-week trial.Pegg did not react as the guilty verdicts were delivered. Judge Knowles told her a prison term was “inevitable”, but bailed Pegg to the court building while the sentencing date was arranged.Outside court, Tarryn McCaffrey, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said: “Kerri Pegg’s conduct fell far short of what might be expected from any professional within the Prison Service, let alone one of such a senior grade as prison governor.“She was clearly involved in an inappropriate relationship with Saunderson after he was released and the evidence points to this going back further, to a time when he was in jail.“This relationship, and the fact that Pegg failed to disclose her debts to her employers, amount to a gross breach of trust and are therefore extremely damaging to public confidence.”Explore more on these topicsPrisons and probationUK criminal justiceLancashireLiverpoolnewsShareReuse this content"

Critics of the name associated it with colonialism and the transatlantic slave trade.The Labour MP Marsha de Cordova had previously called on the nearby housing development Plantation Wharf to also change its name, describing it as offensive.The developers launched a consultation to research and review the names associated with the housing complex, which is still ongoing.Uber Boat by Thames Clippers announced that the renaming of the pier had gone into effect on Monday after talks with house and boat residents. The pier’s signage has been updated to reflect the change.“The updated pier name will appear in our new Uber Boat by Thames Clippers timetable and route map, which comes into effect on the same day as the official name change,” the company said in a statement.View image in fullscreenThe pier before it was renamed.Photograph: Benjamin John/AlamyVanessa Brady, the chair of the board of directors of Plantation Wharf Management Ltd, said that while the housing estate was interested in following suit, the route was more complicated.“For the estate, this is not an unwillingness to negotiate but as a private estate it means any changes must be funded by the residents,” she said. “It is not a simple process, but we will continue to consult with residents to see if they agree to pay for the costs incurred in changing the name and indeed if they want to change their name.“We can only consult and then act on the wishes of the leaseholders. Another idea would be to receive a fund from the mayor’s office to pay for it.”De Cordova welcomed the decision to change the name of the pier as an important step forward. “The term ‘plantation’ carries highly offensive connotations, does not serve the wonderful diversity of Battersea’s residents and makes a mockery of the violent history of chattel enslavement,” she said.“Having campaigned for Thames Clippers to change the pier’s name, I am pleased this has been achieved. It marks an important step forward in how we structure our public spaces.”She called on the developers who own Plantation Wharf to follow suit, describing it as disappointing that they had yet to make a similar announcement.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In 2021, after dining at an Ivy restaurant that served Plantation rum, Ferron walked past the housing complex and pier and was struck by what she described as a shocking pattern of normalised references to slavery.She later wrote anopinion piece in the Guardian, calling on the restaurant group and the developers of Plantation Wharf to change the names.After Ferron’s complaint, Ivy removed all Plantation rum products from its restaurants, bars and menus, and Maison Ferrand last yearrenamed the drink. Uber Boat by Thames Clippers has now followed suit by taking action on the pier name.Ferron welcomed the pier’s renaming as a positive step forward. “While advocating for Plantation Rum to rebrand in 2022, I was taken aback to learn about Plantation Wharf on the world-renowned River Thames, which stood as a shameful signpost to slavery. Uber Boat by Thames Clippers inherited the name from a neighbouring development, which continues to brand its bricks with references to the transatlantic slave trade,” she said.“I am pleased that Uber Boat by Thames Clippers listened and led the way by renaming its pier to St Mary’s Wandsworth, which is much more appropriate for our times and diverse city. I sincerely hope this encourages Plantation Wharf Management Ltd to follow suit.”Explore more on these topicsLondonColonialismRaceSlaveryEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

At the scene, firefighters removed blocks of broken concrete and sawed planks of wood, using them to lift heavy debris as the noise of drills filled the air.Méndez said rescue crews were prioritising three areas in the club: “We’re hearing some sounds.”Nelsy Cruz, the governor of the north-western province of Montecristi and sister of seven-time Major League Baseball All-Star Nelson Cruz, was among the victims.She had called President Luis Abinader at 12.49am saying she was trapped and that the roof had collapsed, first lady Raquel Arbaje told reporters. Officials said Cruz died later at the hospital.“This is too great a tragedy,” Arbaje said in a broken voice.The Professional Baseball League of theDominican Republicposted on X that MLB pitcher Octavio Dotel died. Officials had earlier rescued Dotel from the debris and taken him to a hospital.Meanwhile, the injured included legislator Bray Vargas and merengue singer Rubby Pérez, who was performing when the roof collapsed, officials said.His manager, Enrique Paulino, whose shirt was spattered with blood, told reporters at the scene that the concert began shortly before midnight, with the roof collapsing almost an hour later, killing the group’s saxophonist.“It happened so quickly. I managed to throw myself into a corner,” he said, adding that he initially thought it was an earthquake.It wasn’t immediately clear what caused the roof to collapse.Jet Set issued a statement saying it was cooperating with authorities. “The loss of human life leaves us in a state of deep pain and dismay,” it said.Manuel Olivo Ortiz, whose son attended the concert but did not return home, was among those anxiously waiting outside the club, which is known for its traditional parties where renowned national and international artists perform. “We’re holding on only to God,” Olivo said.Also awaiting word was Massiel Cuevas, godmother of 22-year-old Darlenys Batista. “I’m waiting for her. She’s in there, I know she’s in there,” Cuevas said, firm in her belief that Batista would be pulled out alive.President Abinader wrote on X that all rescue agencies are “working tirelessly” to help those affected.“We deeply regret the tragedy that occurred at the Jet Set nightclub. We have been following the incident minute by minute since it occurred,” he wrote.Abinader arrived at the scene and hugged those looking for friends and family, some with tears streaming down their faces.“We have faith in God that we will rescue even more people alive,” he told reporters.An official with a megaphone stood outside the club imploring the large crowd that had gathered to search for friends and relatives to give ambulances space.“You have to cooperate with authorities, please,” he said. “We are removing people.”View image in fullscreenRescuers work at the site of the collapsed Jet Set nightclub.Photograph: Erika Santelices/ReutersAt one hospital where the injured were taken, an official stood outside reading aloud the names of survivors as a crowd gathered around her and yelled out the names of their loved ones.Meanwhile, dozens of people gathered at the National Institute of Forensic Pathology, which projected pictures of the victims so their loved ones could identify them.Explore more on these topicsDominican RepublicAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

But the president ultimately disregarded the representations and doubled down on his policy on Monday bythreatening to impose an additional 50% tariffon China after it responded to the original trade levy by announcing a 34% tariff on US imports.At the same time as Musk was pleading with Trump, he was appearing online at a rightwing conference in Italycalling for zero tariffsbetween the US and the European Union. “That has certainly been my advice to the president,” he told attenders of the far-right League party conference in Florence.On Monday, Musk escalated an insult-heavy social media feud with Peter Navarro, a key Trump ally and White House trade adviser said to be a guiding force behind the tariffs strategy.China vows to ‘fight to the end’ against latest Trump tariff threatRead moreOver the weekend, in response to a video Navarro posted about the administration’s rationale for the tariff strategy, Muskattacked Navarro’s master’s degreein economics from Harvard University. Musk did the same in a reply to a commentator who praised the Navarro video, writing: “He ain’t built shit.”More name-calling followed on Monday, after Navarro called Musk a “car assembler” rather than a manufacturer because many Tesla electric vehicle (EV) parts come from overseas.“Navarro truly is a moron. What he says here is demonstrably false,” Musksaid in one post. In another, he wrote a derogatory term for somebody with a learning disability andadded: “Tesla has the most American-made cars. Navarro is dumber than a sack of bricks.”Neither theTrump administrationnor Musk responded to requests for comment.The Post said Musk’s opposition to what has become Trump’s signature economic policy “marks the highest-profile disagreement between the president and one of his key advisers”. It follows reports that the billionairewill soon be leaving governmentto return to running his businesses.Experts, however, expect the split to be amicable, with Musk set to retain close ties and influence with the president as well as onUS politicsgenerally.“Elon is fantastic,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One on his way to Florida on Thursday, saying he wished Musk could stay in government but wanted to return to his various companies.Tesla, in particular, has seen asharp drop in salesof EVs in the US and Europe since Musk began his work for Doge. A backlash to Musk’s politics materialized in the form of protests and vandalism at his vehicle dealerships.The FBI announced in March that it was forming a taskforce to target violence at Tesla sales points and charging stations, which included the discovery of incendiary devices at a dealership in Austin, Texas, and the arrest of a man in West Palm Beach, Florida, who allegedly tried to use an SUV to strike a group of protesters.Wall Street traders on Trump tariffs: ‘Without doubt, we’re hitting a recession’Read moreShares in Tesla were trading at $233.29 at market close on Monday, Reuters reported, down more than 42% since the beginning of the year.More trouble for Musk could be looming in Washington DC over potential conflicts of interest involving SpaceX, a key Nasa contractor.The Democratic congressmen Gerald Connolly and Maxwell Frost havewritten to Nasa’s chief legal officerseeking information about $38bn in government contracts awarded to SpaceX at a time when Musk’s Doge is gutting federal spending and slashing jobs at numerous federal institutions, including the US government’s space agency.“At Nasa, where Mr Musk has both benefited from significant contracts and has the potential to receive vast amounts of new business, his defiance of recusal laws and control of operations directly benefit his businesses,” the Democrats wrote.“The known conflicts of interest presented by this arrangement are illegal and must be addressed immediately.”Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsElon MuskDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

TheWall Street Crashof 1929 came after a frenzy of speculative share-buying, creating a bubble in the market, with the subsequent collapse triggering the Great Depression of the 1930s and the economic climate that led to the second world war.The Dow Jones industrial average fell by 11% on “Black Thursday,” 24 October, which was followed by a 13% fall on the Monday and an 11% tumble a day later. The downward spiral wouldtake until June 1932 to bottom out, by which point the companies on the New York stock exchange had lost 90% of their value.1987 ‘Black Monday’The first big global financial crash of the modern era, brought about, again, by a speculative bubble in the boom and bust 1980s. The Dow Jones recorded its biggest-ever daily fall, with a 22% rout on 19 October.The London market also came crashing down; in a collapse made worse by the closure of the stock exchange on the Friday amid the travel chaos caused by theGreat Storm of 1987– infamously glossed over the previous evening by the BBC weather forecaster Michael Fish.With City traders struggling to return to their desks, and with computer-automated trading adding to the rout, theFTSE100 fell by 10.8% on the Monday, with a further 12.2% plunge the following day.Here’s one key thing you should know about Trump’s shock to the world economy: it could work | James MeadwayRead more2000 dotcom crash and 9/11The hysteria of the1990s boom in stock market listingsby fast-growth internet companies drove the FTSE 100 to a peak of 6,930.2 on 30 December 1999 – a record that would stand for the next 15 years.Early in the new millennium, the dotcom bubble burst in March 2000, and the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001 crashed the index back down to a trough of 3,287 by the time coalition forces were gathering to prepare for the invasion of Iraq in 2003.Investors have drawn parallels with the market exuberance at the end of the last century by highlighting themeteoric rise of the so-called “magnificent seven”group of US tech stocks, and subsequent crash in valuations over recent weeks.2008 financial crisisLehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy on 15 September 2008, in the watershed moment of the worst financial crisis of the postwar age. Global markets had been in deep trouble for some time as the credit crunch raged; with its roots in theUS sub-prime home loan market.On the day of Lehman’s collapse, the FTSE 100 fell by a relatively limited 4%, but would go on to lose almost a third of its value in 2008 as a result of the global financial crisis.The bank runs, company failures and fears of the international recession it would trigger led to some of the steepest daily losses in trading history, with an almost 9% rout on 10 October marking the height of the chaos.FTSE graphic2016 Brexit voteBritain’s shock vote to leave the EU sent the pound tumbling to a 31-year low anderased more than $2tn (£1.57tn) of valuefrom global financial markets, with the heaviest losses on the FTSE 100 and European trading hubs.The FTSE 100 collapsed by 8% within the first minutes of opening; but recovered some ground afterMark Carney, the then governor of the Bank of England, promisedit would not hesitate to take action to stabilise markets and the economy. The FTSE 100 ended the day down 3.2%.2020 Covid pandemicThe forced shutdown of the global economy during the health emergency of the Covid pandemic triggered panic in financial markets and the deepest recession since at least the 1930s Great Depression.Major landmarks in the global markets toppled in a matter of hours and days, including more than eight years of gains on the FTSE 100 being wiped out in barely a month, while global stocks had their best and worst sessions in a decade on consecutive days.The FTSE 100 recorded its biggest daily fall since Black Monday, of almost 11%, while the Dow fell by about 13% on 16 March. However, rapid intervention from central banks and governments helped instil a dramatic turnaround.Explore more on these topicsMarket turmoilStock marketsFTSELehman BrothersCredit crunchFinancial crisisBankinganalysisShareReuse this content"

The list of potential targets facing mostly 25% retaliatory tariffs now ranges from almonds to yachts, via diamonds and dental floss, soya beans and steel parts. But bourbon and wine have been dropped.France, Italy and Ireland protested against their inclusion after Trump threatened a counter-punch on learning of the threat to bourbon last month. On social media on 13 March,he warned of“a 200% Tariff on all WINES, CHAMPAGNES, & ALCOHOLIC PRODUCTS COMING OUT OF FRANCE AND OTHER E.U. REPRESENTED COUNTRIES”.Ireland’s foreign minister, Simon Harris, said on Monday he had “questioned the strategic relevance” of targeting bourbon, while the French prime minister, François Bayrou, described the proposal as “a misstep”.The French government, which has been calling fora tough response to US tariffs, feared damage to its drinks industry, as one champagne maker warned it would be “game over” for the US market if 200% tariffs came to pass.French cognac and brandy makers have since last October been grappling with Chinese tariffs, levied by Beijing in retaliation over the EU’s decisionto impose anti-dumping duties on Chinese electric vehicles.Bourbon became a possible target as it wasalready in the EU’s playbook. When Trump imposed steel and aluminium tariffs in his first term, the EU responded by targeting emblematic US goods such as Harley-Davidson motorbikes, blue jeans and bourbon. “We can also do stupid,” was how the then European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, described the counter-measures, as he said the bloc had no choice.The targeting of alcoholic drinks in trade wars has alarmed and baffled the industry. In the two decades following the removal of nearly all tariffs on spirits between the US and EU in 1997, transatlantic trade grew by 450%, reaching €6.7bn in 2018 before the start of tariffs, according to the pan-European trade body, spiritsEurope.In the US, Irish whiskey, Cognac and Polish vodka have protected status, while similarly, in the EU only US products can be bourbon or Tennessee whiskey.Ireland had also feared that Trump’s retribution would snare its sizeable whiskey industry, with Irish whiskey exports to the US in 2024 valued at between €420m and €450m by the national food and drink board Bia.The sector is dominated by brands such as Jameson. An explosion in the number of craft distilleries has led to around 40 whiskey and gin makers being established, often in rural areas, and another 10 north of the border, with 5.7m cases sent to the US in 2023 from the republic alone. These range in price from $30 a bottle to almost $5,000 for a bottle of Midleton Very Rare Foret de Troncais vintage whiskey.A tit-for-tat war could have hit production costs, too, as bourbon oak casks are used to colour and age whiskey in Ireland and elsewhere in the EU before sale back to the US.Under US rules, bourbon is aged in virgin oak, which is discarded after one or two years, but the barrels are sold on to the UK at £300 a unit, generating a whole new side business for the US drink trade.“It is not good for Europe, not good for Ireland. It’s not good for anybody,” said Paul Nash, the founder of Wild Atlantic Whiskey in county Tyrone, who is concerned about the 10% and 20% tariffs still facing UK and EU exports.The US applied a universal tariff of 10% on UK goods from 5 April, while the 20% rate on EU goods comes into force on 9 April.Northern Ireland whiskey is also hampered by the EU trade tariffs, partly because of Brexit rules tying it to the EU trade rules but mostly because whiskey makers source their barley in the republic.A European Commission spokesperson declined to comment on bourbon, as the list had not been made public. “We are taking every step to ensure that the measures we come forward with achieve their intended purpose, which is to allow for the minimum amount of damage here in the EU while providing us with the maximum amount of leverage in our negotiations,” the spokesperson said. “We don’t want tariffs. We want to avoid them.”Explore more on these topicsTariffsTrump tariffsWhiskyEuropean UnionFood & drink industryEuropeIrelandnewsShareReuse this content"

And the answer is, fundamentally, it’s based on two principles – incurring a huge amount of debt to buy things that other countries make for us.“To make it a little more crystal clear, we borrow money from Chinese peasants to buy the things those Chinese peasants manufacture.”He added: “That is not a recipe for economic prosperity, it is not a recipe for low prices, and it’s not a recipe for good jobs in the United States of America.”Lin Jian, the spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry, was asked about the comments on Tuesday and said: “It’s both astonishing and lamentable to hear this vice-president make such ignorant and disrespectful remarks.”The foreign ministry said: “Pressure, threats and blackmail are not the right way to deal withChina.”Vance’s comments led to a backlash among Chinese internet users.“We may be peasants, but we have the world’s best high-speed rail system, the most powerful logistics capabilities, and leading AI, autonomous driving, and drone technologies. Aren’t such peasants quite impressive?” a Weibo user posted,according to CNN.China has said it will“fight to the end”if the US continues to escalate its trade war, after Trump threatened to add additional 50% tariffs on Chinese imports if Beijing did not reverse its 34% reciprocal tariff on US goods.0:40China prepared to 'fight to the end' over US tariffs – videoThe exchange came after Trump’s announcement last week ofa 34% tariff on imports from China– in addition to a previous 20% levy.“If China does not withdraw its 34% increase above their already long term trading abuses by tomorrow, April 8th, 2025, the United States will impose additional tariffs on China of 50%, effective April 9th,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.Trump’s tariffs on China are the latest among a multitude of tariffs aimed at US trading partners across the globe. The tariffs have caused serious losses on stock markets around the world.Explore more on these topicsChinaJD VanceAsia PacificGlobal economyEconomicsDonald TrumpShareReuse this content"

After almost seven days on the run, the chase ended when he took his own life.His last days are enacted as a posthumous courtroom drama in writer-director Robert Icke’s staging, looking back on the events leading up to Moat’s death but simultaneously travelling towards it.Fresh out of prison and intent on hurting his ex-girlfriend because she had found a new partner, Moat murdered her boyfriend, left her in a critical condition and blinded a police officer, before hiding out in a corner of north-east England with a sawn-off shotgun.Samuel Edward-Cook, as Moat, often speaks in direct address to the audience, while short scenes are enacted. All the while, a barrister stalks the stage to cross-examine, interrogate and undermine his account.This story seems like a leftfield choice for Icke, who excels at rewriting stage classics for modern times: last year’s sensationalOedipusis a case in point.And as boldly high-wire as Icke undoubtedly is, this production is strangely plodding, a rather too expositional synthesis of events, despite the theatrical flourishes. It is neither revelatory nor emotional enough.Edward-Cook, as Moat, is a striking physical presence, muscle-bound, sweat-slicked and ready to burst, but his ex-girlfriend Samantha Stobbart (Sally Messham) and her boyfriend Chris Brown (Leo James) are little more than triggers for his anger.Every other character – from his mentally-fragile mother to a childhood version of himself – are brief and unrounded.As promisingly as it begins – with Moat pacing behind a screen while aerial CCTV footage of him is projected on to the screen to suggest a sense of bifurcation and surveillance – the play as a whole is made up of dramatised summaries of Moat’s life.He remains angry, distressed and disfranchised, but rather unknown beyond that – to himself and to us, it seems. He makes strained proclamations, variously calling himself a hunter-gather, a hulk, King Kong atop the tower, and Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver. If the point here is that he defines himself as the monster other people see him to be, it is crudely made, and feels clichéd.Questions around toxic masculinity and crisis – especially in relation to class – are immensely timely, with the continuing online presence of Andrew Tate and the high suicide rates among men under 50.Stephen Graham and Jack Thorne’s recent drama, Adolescence, recently laid the ground for discussion on how young boys and men move towards violence, misogyny and murder. But this play never quite delivers in its dramatic power or its psychological insights.The production lacks pace too. Icke, usually so adept at suggesting the inexorable march of fate and time, uses screens to flash the date for each passing day as Moat heads toward his end, but this does not bring the charge it should.Hildegard Bechtler’s non-realist set does clever work with the screens but even this does not bring the intensity it should.There is one scene – in which the police officer, PC David Rathband, who is blinded, speaks of his experience in a dark auditorium – which is original and innovative. There are more such moments that come and go before the tone returns to flatness.James Graham’s play, Punch, currently showing in the West End, shows the fallout of a crime and its intersections with masculine crisis. That story of restorative justice lends itself to resolution and forgiveness.This story hangs in the air, unsure of – or opaque in – its intentions. Is this an anatomy of a breakdown? An investigation into the ways Moat was failed? Or a portrait of white, northern, working-class masculinity in extreme crisis? It seems like a bit of all, but not enough of one.This is not the first attempt at dramatisation:ITV screened The Hunt for Raoul Moatin 2023 even as locals of Rothbury – where Moat shot himself – complained it was all too raw to be turned into television.

We stopped having sex about 13 years ago, due to a combination of getting a dog (who sleeps with us) and her going through the menopause. I had a bit of a lull in my own libido when I went through menopause aboutnine years ago, butit came roaring back. She is not interested in sex at alland is also resentful that I have a hoarding problem, even though I’min therapy for it. I think she may be using that as an excuse to withhold affection(when asked, she doesn’t confirm or deny it).Do you thinkthere is any hope that we can resolve our “lesbian bed death”? We’re in couples therapy, but I don’t think itis helping much.The stance of “withholding affection” can be a fully conscious act or it can be unconscious. In other words, a person might be fully committed to her partner and (in principle) wish to be intimate, yet deeply held resentment arrests that desire. I’m glad you are in couples therapy, as, over time, that could break the impasse between you and heal various issues that may have arisen in the past. Try to avoid labelling your lack of intimacy as “lesbian bed death”, since that catch-all phrase can support a helpless attitude. Your partnership is far from a cliche.During your many years together – for all kinds of understandable reasons – you have mutually made unspoken agreements to allow dogs, menopause and life in general to interrupt your erotic connection without your finding the way back. The fact that your libido has come “roaring back” is a wonderful thing for you, but your partner is clearly not ready. Be gentle, patient, understanding, open, attentive … and do the work.Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns toprivate.lives@theguardian.com(please don’t send attachments).

But there’s not a musician in sight.If you look closely there is a small fragment of a performer. Albeit one without a pulse.In the centre of the room, visitors hover around a raised plinth, craning to glimpse the brains behind the operation. Under a magnifying lens sit two white blobs, like a tiny pair of jellyfish. Together, they form the lab-grown “mini-brain” of the late US musicianAlvin Lucier– composing a posthumous score in real time.View image in fullscreen‘You’re peering down into the abyss’: the central plinth of Revivification, which houses the lab-grown ‘mini-brain’ of Lucier.Photograph: Rift PhotographyLucier was a pioneer of experimental music who died in 2021. But here in theArtGallery of Western Australia he has been resurrected with cutting-edge neuroscience.“When you look down into that central plinth, you’re crossing a threshold,” says Nathan Thompson, an artist and a creator of the project, titled Revivification. “You’re peering down into the abyss and you’re looking at something that’s alive – just not in the same way as you.”View image in fullscreenThe ‘four-headed monster’ who created Revivification: Guy Ben-Ary, Matt Gingold, Nathan Thompson and Stuart Hodgetts.Photograph: Rift PhotographyRevivification is the work of a self-described “four-headed monster”, a tight-knit team of scientists and artists who have spent decades pushing the boundaries of biological art – namely Thompson and his fellow artists Guy Ben-Ary and Matt Gingold, alongside a neuroscientist, Stuart Hodgetts.Alvin Lucier, American avant-garde composer, dies aged 90Read moreLucier was the perfect collaborator. In 1965 the composer became the first artist to use brainwaves to generate live sound in his seminal work Music for Solo Performer. Longtime fans of his work, the Revivification team started brainstorming ideas with him back in 2018. But it wasn’t until 2020, then aged 89 and suffering from Parkinson’s disease, that the composer agreed to donate his blood to Revivification.First, his white blood cells were reprogrammed into stem cells. Then, led by Hodgetts, the team transformed the cells into cerebral organoids – clusters of neurons that mimic the human brain.During the pandemic, the team met with Lucier over Zoom every fortnight until he died in 2021. As his health declined, he spoke in whispered fragments, often relayed by his assistant, but he remained a guiding force.“We were like art students learning from the professor,” Thompson says. “He had this ability to cut through anything superfluous and get to the core of what he envisioned.”Ben-Ary adds: “But it was very much a collaboration. We came with 25 years experience in the biological arts … For [Lucier], it was very science fiction.”In early conversations, Lucier suggested ideas as fantastical as sending sound waves to the moon. But the musician and the team ultimately homed in on a performance that echoes his lifelong fascination with neural signals, acoustics and space.View image in fullscreenLucier’s organoids at 82 days oldView image in fullscreenLucier’s stem cells, which were used to grow an artificial brain: ‘We’re very interested to know whether the organoid is going to change or learn over time’Both sculptural and sonic, the installation features 20 large parabolic brass plates which curve out from the walls like golden satellite dishes. Hidden behind each plate is a transducer (like a speaker) and a mallet, which respond to neural signals from the mini-brain – filling the space with a kind of breathless, disembodied soundtrack.The Revivification team used custom technology to bring the work to life. Lucier’s organoids were grown on to a fine mesh of 64 electrodes, developed with a German bioengineer, allowing neural signals to be captured from multiple layers – much like a developing brain. Gingold then adapted an open-source platform to interpret this activity and generate sound, turning the artificial brain into a live, responsive performer.Importantly, Lucier’s organoids don’t just produce sound – they also receive it. Microphones in the gallery pick up ambient noise, including human voices and the resonant tones of the plates, and that audio data is converted into electrical signals and fed back into the brain. “We’re very interested to know whether the organoid is going to change or learn over time,” Ben-Ary says.View image in fullscreenThe work features 20 brass plates that produce the sound.Photograph: Rift PhotographyThe project raises timely ethical and philosophical questions about biology, artificial intelligence and authorship. But, according to the team, Revivification is art first and science second.“Where does creativity lie?” Thompson ponders. “As cultural workers, we are really interested in these big questions. But this work is not giving the answers. Instead we want to invite conversations … Can creativity exist outside of the human body? And is it even ethical to do so?”The Big Idea: how do our brains know what’s real?Read moreBut the team is hopeful that the extensive neural data they’ve collected might help future scientific inquiry. “When we work with these big artistic questions, we can push the limits of what’s possible,” Gingold says. “Because science hasn’t answered this. They’re not even at the point of asking the question.”Looking ahead, the team hopes Revivification will live on – literally and creatively. Ben-Ary says it’s his dream for Lucier’s surrogate performer to compose “new memories, new stories” indefinitely. There are also whispers of more extreme futures: adapting the system for remote, inhospitable environments such as Antarctica, or even launching it into orbit.For now, Lucier’s genius lingers in that darkened room in Perth, composing in real time through a brain that lives on without him.“When I told Lucier’s daughter Amanda about the project, she laughed,” Ben-Ary says. “She thought, this is so my dad. Just before he died he arranged for himself to play for ever. He just can’t go.

It's a bit muchRachel AroestiTue 8 Apr 2025 09.02 EDTLast modified on Tue 8 Apr 2025 09.47 EDTShareRemember the girl boss? She burst in to the zeitgeist in the 2010s, riding the era’s nebulous wave of female empowerment and proving that women could become incredibly rich by helming capitalist empires – just like men. Branding-wise, she had some issues: beginning with that infantile moniker and peaking with a series oftoxic workplace scandals. This – combined with the fact that celebrating corporate greed took on an even more nauseating hue post-pandemic – means we haven’t heard from her for quite a while.Yet this new podcast from Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, is alive with the spirit of the girl boss. Confessions of a Female Founder with Meghan sees the royal quiz ladies on how they made their fortunes: starting with Whitney Wolfe Herd, the founder and CEO of the dating app Bumble, who was once the world’s youngest self-made female billionaire. Meghan has a vested interest in such success stories – hot on the heels of herNetflix series, With Love, Meghan, the self-styled lifestyle guru is launching a business of her own.As eversells preserves, teas and those dried flowers she sprinkled on a vegetable frittata in the TV show, much to her guest Mindy Kaling’s amusement. But As ever is more than a money-making scheme: it is, as our host puts it on this podcast, “an extension of my essence”.Of course, one cannot extend one’s essence alone: Meghan – who, after that eye-watering “you know I’m Sussex now” retort to Kaling in her TV series, seems to be going fully mononymous – needs advice. She gets it from Wolfe Herd – one of her “closest friends” – who tells her not to sweat the small stuff (Meghan is very concerned about the packaging of her products) and that enormous amounts of money don’t make you happy.More important than advice, however, is flattery – and Confessions of a Female Founder is jam-packed with compliments. As per Wolfe Herd, Meghan’s observations are “beautiful” and she’s “an amazing hostess” whose home is filled with “love and cosiness and yumminess”. Meghan is equally well versed in the art of sycophancy. The day Bumble’s stock hit an all-time low, Wolfe Herd wrote a letter to herself about all the things she was grateful for. “I think it’s a really good reminder to people that you have to take stock of how you measure your happiness,” she concludes. “It’s amazing how evolved you are,” replies Meghan. If the love-in doesn’t turn your stomach, one of the richest women in the world telling us there’s more to life than our net worth may well do.The vibe is predictably fawning but, on a technical level, Meghan is a decent interviewer, especially compared with some celebrity podcasters: she keeps the conversation on track and is conscientious with her follow-up questions. Yet even when her guests do open up – here Wolfe Herd discusses the terrifying press attention that accompanied herdecision to file a lawsuitagainst her former employer Tinder for sexual harassment – Meghan very rarely reciprocates. You can understand why she’s guarded – but the problem is that personal disclosure fuels parasocial relationships, which are podcasting’s primary draw.While Meghan’s previous podcast, 2022’s Archetypes, was part-interview, part-explanatory lecture, there is far less narration here. This is a good thing, because it’s when Meghan starts addressing the listener directly that things get off-puttingly overwrought. Sentences tend to be laden with maximum emphasis. “Launching a business, it can be …sooverwhelming. Even with the best of teams – hoo!” she loudly exhales in mock anxiety. “It will keep you up at night!” Maybe this really is Meghan’s natural speaking style, but it’s one that to British ears soundsjust a taddisingenuous.Sitting in a podcast studio talking to wealthy women who worship her is clearly far more Meghan’s scene than enduring the remorselessly vicious press and strange, alienating traditions of these shores. And who can blame her? Confessions of a Female Founder is far from a gladiatorial grilling and it’s hardly a manual of specific, constructive business advice; it’s simply an effusive chinwag between two like-minded pals that may as well have taken place behind a deluxe set of closed doors.Explore more on these topicsPodcastsMeghan, the Duchess of SussexPodcastingreviewsShareReuse this content"

Kennedy said the US wants food companies to “switch traditional ingredientsfor beef tallow”. Some, like Steak ’n Shake andSweetgreen, have already done so.Beef tallow, also known as “beef drippings”, is made by removing, simmering, then cooling the fatty tissue that surrounds cows’ organs. American fast-food restaurants used it to deep fry foods like potatoesuntil the 1990s, when they switched toseed oils. Today, it can be found in soaps, candles andskin care.Last year, Kennedyposted on Xthat “it’s time to Make Frying Oil Tallow Again,” adding that seed oils “are one of the driving causes of the obesity epidemic”, and that Americans are “being unknowingly poisoned” by them.But is beef tallow truly the healthier option? And is it safe or beneficial for skin? Here’s what experts say.Wonder drug or waste of money? The truth about fish oil supplementsRead moreIs beef tallow healthy?There are no known health benefits to consuming beef tallow, says Christopher Gardner, a nutrition scientist and professor of medicine at Stanford University School of Medicine.Beef tallow is one of themain dietary sources of saturated fat, along with butter, lard, palm oil and coconut oil, according to the American Heart Association (AHA).Saturated fats – commonly found in burgers, tacos, desserts and cheese – are well known to increase LDL cholesterol (the “bad” cholesterol), which over time causes plaque buildup in your arteries that can lead to heart disease.The2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americanssay saturated fat should make up less than 10% of a person’s daily calorie intake. Yet about 70-75% of adults in the US surpass this limit. Thesame recommendationholds in the UK, where about 80% of the population exceed the limit, according to estimates.Is beef tallow healthier than seed oils?No. Several studies show that diets higher in saturated fats like beef tallow and lower in unsaturated fats like seed oils are associated with worse health outcomes, says Alice Lichtenstein, professor of nutrition science and policy at Tufts University.A 2017 review by the AHA concluded that replacing saturated fat with polyunsaturated vegetable oilreduced cardiovascular disease events by 30%, which is similar to the effect of cholesterol-lowering medications. Observational studies have also found this kind of diet is associated with lower rates of other major causes of death.Astudypublished last month found that substituting butter, AKA saturated fat, with plant-based oils helps prevent premature death from cancer and heart disease.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’Incorrect claims about the inflammatory effects of seed oilshave spreadfor years, but Gardner says they are the result of misinterpretation.Seed oils are higher in omega-6 fatty acids and lower in omega-3s, both of which arepolyunsaturated fatsthe body uses to lower bad cholesterol. In lab and animal studies, the former appear to cause more inflammation than the latter, says Lichtenstein. However,studiesin people have not yielded similar findings.“Somewhere along the way, people flipped this and said omega-6 is bad and therefore seed oils are killing us,” says Gardner. “But that’s not the way it works.”Connecting seed oils and rising obesity rates in the US is also misleading, says Gardner. Americans areconsuming more ultra-processed foods, many of which contain added sugars and sodium that contribute to obesity. Many junk foods also contain seed oils, says Gardner, but that doesn’t mean they alone are to blame.“I can almost assure you that people who eat a lot of cookies, cakes, chips and donuts made with beef tallow will not suddenly get healthier,” says Gardner.Is beef tallow safe for your skin?Beef tallow is technically safe for your skin, says Dr Heather Rogers, dermatologist and clinical assistant professor at the University of Washington. Some skin care companies include the ingredient in their deodorants, body butters, and lip and face balms.Still, it isn’t necessarily worth using in skincare, says Rogers. It can smell bad (some say it has aurine-like aroma), and it also goes rancid quickly and stains your clothes, sheets and pillows, she says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If you plan to use beef tallow on your skin, use products from grass-fed or organically raised cows, she says.Is beef tallow good for your face?Beef tallow can prevent water loss when layered on your face, says Rogers, but it’s still not a good moisturizer. “Moisturizer by definition is a combination of oil and water,” she says. “Your skin needs both, but beef tallow is just fat, so you’re not getting any additional benefits.”Beef tallow is also comedogenic, especially for people with oily skin, says Rogers. This means it can clog pores and cause acne – however, this hasn’t been thoroughly studied, she adds.Beef tallow contains small amounts of vitamins D, A, K and E, says Rogers. However, it doesn’t have the vitamins that have been shown to be “most powerful for our skin”, such as vitamin C.That said, beef tallow does have an occlusive, or sealant, effect. Like Vaseline or castor oil, it could help damaged skin from eczema or other skin conditions and injuries heal more quickly, says Rogers: “Your skin has to maintain its water levels to heal itself. When you have an open wound, all that water evaporates, the skin dries out and forms a scab.” Occlusive products can help keep that water in.But beef tallow is “not a miracle treatment”, she says, and dermatologists don’t recommend it. “It’s not going to help with wrinkles or acne,” says Rogers. “It’s not activating any change on your skin.”Do you really need to exfoliate your face?Read moreRogers says shea butter – fat extracted from the seed of the shea tree – is a similar but more effective alternative to beef tallow for skin care. It’s less saturated, non-comedogenic, has anti-inflammatory effects and more antioxidants, which protects skin cells from damage and improves skin texture, she says.“There are so many wonderful options out there, but to me beef tallow is an extreme,” says Rogers.The takeawayA single ingredient in small doses rarely has a large impact on your health, so removing or adding something like beef tallow to your diet won’t make a huge difference, says Lichtenstein. Instead, consider “the whole package”, including what you eat and don’t eat, she says, and aim for a diet that’s well balanced in fruits, vegetables and whole grains.To lower your saturated fat intake,experts recommendeating lean meat and low-fat cheese, for example, or turning to other protein sources like beans. Cook with canola, corn, olive or soybean oils instead of butter, and aim to eat sweet snacks less often.“We’re always looking for the easy answer that’s going to make everything better, like we can have our cake and eat it too. But making your cake with beef tallow isn’t going to improve it,” says Lichtenstein. “The best bulk of the evidence indicates that’s not going to have a positive effect, and for many people, it will have a negative one.”Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyBeefFoodHealthHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She forgave him and a potential collaboration is in the works.Meanwhile Oasis are getting ready to go back out on tour after years oftuber-based jibesbetween the Gallagher brothers, and Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel had an emotional reunionlast yearwith the latter admitting he’d “been a fool” to berate Simon in an interview. So who might be next?Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie NicksThe sparks between theFleetwood Macpair were what ignited their commercial breakthrough – and, eventually, what burned the band down. Their tempestuous romance was laid out in the songs, from Buckingham howling Go Your Own Way to Nicks chiding him with Dreams and Silver Springs – the latter a realisation, Nicks later said, “that Lindsey was going to haunt me for the rest of my life”. Buckingham left the band in 2018, alleging that Nicks was offended by him smirking as she gave an award ceremony acceptance speech, and had him ousted. Nicks later said of that night: “He wasn’t very nice to anybody; he wasn’t very nice to Harry Styles. I could hear my mom saying, ‘Are you really going to spend the next 15 years of your life with this man?’ I could hear my very pragmatic father … saying, ‘It’s time for you guys to get a divorce.’ Between those two, I said, ‘I’m done.’” Mick Fleetwood said last year: “I would love to see a healing between them,” and Buckingham himself said: “It would be very appropriate to close on a more circular note.”50 Cent and Ja Rule“It ain’t over till one of us is gone,”50 Centhas claimed of one of the most long-winded beefs in hip-hop. The pair bestrode millennial rap in vests and voluminous denim, swapping diss tracks back and forth after a 50 Cent associate relieved Ja Rule of some jewellery during a video shoot in 1999. Things seemed to have simmered down when they were placed in the same row on a 2013 flight without incident, though Ja Rule has since accused 50 Cent of being a “rat” on numerous occasions, while 50 bought multiple rows of seats at the front of a Ja Rule concert to ensure there would be no fans in them. Last year 50 crowed at Ja being denied entry to the UK, with the latter telling him to “shut up” (expletives redacted). You can detect a certain amount of fondness creeping into their spat, like a couple of aged tennis rivals slugging it out on the court of an old people’s home.View image in fullscreenMorrissey and Marr in happier times, in 1987.Photograph: Eugene Adebari/Rex FeaturesMorrissey and Johnny MarrRelations between the Smiths pair are at their lowest ever ebb. In the past,Morrisseyhad lamented the end of the group in sad and dignified tones, but grew irritated with Marr mentioning him in the press: “You talk as if you were my personal psychiatrist with consistent and uninterrupted access to my instincts,” he said in 2022. It all came to a head in 2024 when Morrissey laid out negotiations over a Smiths reunion tour and archival releases, claiming Marr had blocked them and applied for sole ownership of the Smiths, which Marr denied, saying: “I didn’t ignore the offer [to tour] – I said no.”Mariah Carey and Jennifer LopezWhile pop’s menfolk lumber around with jibes, swear words and legal threats like pissed-up blokes sparring outside a pub, Carey and Lopez are like a pair of cool contract killers pretending the other doesn’t exist. “She’s a dancer, isn’t she? … I don’t think that as a singer, we’re in the same category as artists,” Carey said of Lopez before immortally claiming “I don’t know her” in a discussion about pop peers a few years later. Lopez used Carey’s words against her, saying on separate occasions that “we don’t know each other” and “we don’t know each other that well”, and during a Carey performance was pictured scrolling through her phone like a bored child. The passive aggression hums along so intensely it could be tapped as a renewable energy source.David Gilmour and Roger WatersThe quarrel between the two Pink Floyd titans is now as long-winded and episodic as Dark Side of the Moon, stretching back to 1985 when Waters left and called the group “a spent force”. Waters sniped at later Floyd albums (A Momentary Lapse of Reason was called “a very facile but quite clever forgery”) and although they reunited for charity gigs in 2005 and 2010, by 2020 Waters was claiming Gilmour “banned” him from Pink Floyd’s website. Gilmour attempted a bit of “I don’t know her”-style dismissal, saying: “He left our pop group when I was in my 30s … I don’t really know his work since,” but relations massively worsened in 2023 when Gilmour tweeted to support his wife Polly Samson’s claims that Waters was “antisemitic to your rotten core. Also a Putin apologist and a lying, thieving, hypocritical, tax-avoiding, lip-synching, misogynistic, sick-with-envy, megalomaniac” – claims that Waters “refutes entirely”, he said, calling them “incendiary and wildly inaccurate”. In 2024, when Gilmour wasasked by a Guardian reader if he would ever play with Waters again, he said: “Absolutely not. I tend to steer clear of people who actively support genocidal and autocratic dictators”.Bob Dylan and Don McLeanFor years many assumed McLean’s American Pie swiped at Dylan with this section: “When the jester sang for the king and queen / in a coat he borrowed from James Dean / And a voice that came from you and me / Oh, and while the king was looking down / The jester stole his thorny crown” – the jester being Dylan and the king being Elvis Presley, and McLean seen as charting the cultural shift from rock’n’roll to singer-songwriting in the mid 20th century. Dylan himself certainly thought so: “Yeah, Don McLean, American Pie, what a song that is,” he sarcastically told an interviewer in 2017. “A jester? Sure, the jester writes songs like Masters of War, A Hard Rain’s a-Gonna Fall, It’s Alright, Ma – some jester. I have to think he’s talking about somebody else. Ask him.” McLean smoothed things over a little by explaining the lyrics in 2022 – “I said James Dean in the song. If I meant Elvis or Bob Dylan I would have said their names” – but Dylan isn’t exactly one for hugging things out.Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockFleetwood Mac50 CentMorrisseyJohnny MarrThe SmithsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The kinetic camera work matches its forthright narrative of state-sponsored violence and the erosion of democracy. The Greek expatriate director’s film is loosely based on the 1963 assassination of the democratic leader Grigoris Lambrakis and although it was released in 1969, when Costa-Gavras reigned as a political storyteller, the film still has something to say today in this “golden age” for the United States.In the flurry ofDonald Trump’s executive orders, I found myself watching Z again as I contemplated how we arrived at this political moment – the polarization, disinformation, corruption and complicity by individuals and institutions that precede and abet the collapse of democracy – and what cinema can reveal at a time of censorship, deportations and protesters vilified as domestic terrorists.Is Hollywood really going to ditch the anti-fascist satire in its Starship Troopers remake?Read moreIt turns out, that’s a lot.There’s a long tradition of turning anti-totalitarian books into films. George Orwell’s 1984, Ray Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451 and Margaret Atwood’sThe Handmaid’s Talehave been revisited multiple times, confirming the staying power of these cautionary tales in a world where freedom is still dispensable. And there’s also a long tradition of films commenting on totalitarianism. Charlie Chaplin’s The Great Dictator, released in 1940, mocked Adolf Hitler while warning about the dangers of the Führer before the US entered the second world war.I’m Still Here, this year’sOscar winnerfor best international feature film, looks at the real-life fallout from Brazil’s dictatorship through the lens of Eunice Paiva’s struggle to discover what happened to her husband Rubens, a former politician who was disappeared by the military in 1971.View image in fullscreenKirk Douglas in Spartacus.Photograph: Cinetext/Allstar Collection/Ui/AllstarCosta-Gavras has said: “Everything is political.” We can see his point in several films across genres that capture how authoritarianism takes root, the importance of resisting unjust systems and the often-protracted fight for human rights and dignity.Stanley Kubrick’sSpartacus, about a slave uprising in the Roman empire, depicts a hero who fought for the principle of self-determination. Kirk Douglas plays the titular character, a reluctant gladiator who leads the uprising. But the politics behind the 1960 film – and the politics the film represented – are as powerful as the story of the slave revolt. In the hands of screenwriters Dalton Trumbo and Howard Fast, who were blacklisted and imprisoned during the red scare, Spartacus is an allegory for the human right to resist oppressive systems. (The film was based on Fast’s book, written in prison and published in 1951.) In universalizing Spartacus’s desire for freedom, the film-makers echoed the themes of the growing civil rights movement and defended dissent against the censorship of McCarthyism. However, the film isn’t content to leave us with a depiction of heroic freedom fighters. Instead, in its final scenes it highlights the steep price of dissent and the sometimes-protracted struggle for social change. When the uprising fails, Spartacus and his followers are crucified, but his son is born free. The rebellion may be short-lived, but it’s not in vain.V for Vendetta, the 2005 dystopian film based on thegraphic novel by Alan Moore, is a less straightforward story of rebellion against an unjust system and more a critique of the role of government and commentary on the power of an idea to incite social change. Set in a future London in the grips of a fascist regime, the film follows V, played by Hugo Weaving, who is determined to destroy the regime and repay its leaders for torturing him. He hides his identity behind a mask of Guy Fawkes, who with a small band of Catholic co-conspirators attempted to blow up parliament and assassinate King James in 1605. The conspirators wanted the Protestant king to be more tolerant toward Catholics. The conspiracy’s failure is commemorated annually. In the final standoff with the regime’s enforcers, V says: “People should not be afraid of their governments, governments should be afraid of their people,” a statement that could be a motto and a rallying cry for our times.French film-makerLadj Lytoldthe Hollywood Reporter: “I’m an artist, and my job is only to denounce the unjust reality as I see it. I have no solutions. I hope what the film will do is expose the humiliating situations that people are dealing with every day and help more people understand the situation – and why so many of us feel this rage.”View image in fullscreenDamien Bonnard, Alexis Manenti and Djebril Zonga in Les Misérables.Photograph: APLy’s acclaimed filmLes Misérables, about an uprising against police violence by young Black and Arab men, is set in the segregated banlieues outside Paris. The Siege, a 1998 American film directed by Edward Zwick and co-written by Lawrence Wright, author of The Looming Tower, mines similar territory. The film is set in contemporary Brooklyn where the US military has seized control of the borough after a string of terrorist attacks. The military detains thousands of men of Arab and Middle Eastern descent while people demonstrate for their release outside the barbed-wire fences surrounding the stadium where they are held. Releasedfive years after the first attempt to blow up the World Trade Center and three years before 9/11, The Siege is perhaps more relevant now than it was when it premiered. The ongoing deaths in Gaza and the threats of deportation against foreign students demonstrating on behalf of Palestinians give the film an urgency.‘Everybody told me not to do it’: can a movie shift a presidential election?Read moreWhile aspects of the film seem improbable – given its history of surveillance, it’s doubtful that the FBI would confront the military over defending the constitutional rights of detainees – The Siege dares to have a debate we need to have: what it means to be a patriot. When FBI agent Denzel Washington walks in on commanding general Bruce Willis as a man is being tortured, Washington asks, exasperated and outraged: “Are you people insane?” The ensuing argument between the men about the relationship between patriotism and the US constitution could be richer, but at least the film knows the issue must be debated.As Ly says, film, like art, can reflect and shape reality. Not surprisingly, Z was a favorite of the Black Panther party, whichscreened an advanced printat a national anti-fascist conference. The Panthers, whose members were surveilled and killed, saw their story in the film. In the climax of Z, everyone involved in exposing the truth about the murder of the populist leader is imprisoned, killed or exiled. And as the military cracks down on free speech, a list of banned words and activities, from freedom of the press to labor unions, continuously scrolls behind the television news anchors announcing the decrees. In its disturbing epilogue, Z reminds us of a universal truth about authoritarians that we can’t afford to ignore: to succeed they must first control information.Explore more on these topicsFilmDonald TrumpUS politicsTrump administrationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now scientists say they have discovered how to make a stronger cup using the same quantity of ground coffee.Dr Arnold Mathijssen, a co-author of the study from the University of Pennsylvania, said pouring the hot water slowly from a goose-neck kettle increases the contact time between the water and the coffee grounds, while pouring from a greater height increases mixing, both of which result in more coffee being extracted.But he added: “If you pour too slowly, or if you go too high, then the jet tends to break up into these smaller droplets, and that’s what you want to avoid as well.”Writing in the journal Physics of Fluids, Mathijssen and colleagues report how they carried out a number of experiments involving transparent silica gel particles – representing ground coffee – that were illuminated with a laser sheet, which were recorded with a high-speed camera.While slow pouring increases contact time, the team found that at low heights the velocity of the water was too low to dig into and disturb the bed of particles. Water poured from greater heights resulted in greater agitation of the particles, but the team found that water must flow in an unbroken jet to dig into the bed of particles and displace those at the bottom of the funnel – a process that results in particles building up on the sides and then falling in, creating an avalanche-like effect that increases mixing.“The increased height compensates for the slow pouring. You only get the avalanche if there is enough energy available,” Mathijssen said.When the team applied their findings to coffee itself, they found pouring from a greater height resulted in stronger brews, provided an unbroken flow of water was used.0:30Experiment shows how height of pour affects strength of coffee – videoThe team add that a good starting point for those at home is to reduce the amount of ground coffee by 10%, say from 20 to 18 grams per cup, then taste the coffee produced by pouring the hot water at different heights – keeping to a limit of about 30cm for safety.Researchers havepreviously revealedthat to make the perfect espresso every time, it is best to use coffee that is ground slightly coarser than normal.Both that study and the new research found that the proposed adjustments meant less coffee was needed to produce a drink of given strength. Experts say this is important given that climate breakdown is already causing problems for cultivation of theCoffea arabicaplant.Prof Jamie Foster, of Portsmouth University, who was not involved with the new research but carried out the study on espresso-making, said it seemed “totally plausible” that the proposed method would lead to a stronger cup of pour-over coffee and a more optimal use of the coffee grounds, and he saw no reason why similar logic could not be applied to cafetiere-style brewing.“Of course, there is a cheat open to those who prefer cafetiere coffee,” he said. “That is, put in a spoon and give the grounds a stir, but perhaps a cleverly chosen pour could save dirtying cutlery.”Explore more on these topicsCoffeenewsShareReuse this content"

As the world financial markets fail to appreciate his genius, tariff-excreting president Donald Trump has explained it all away by stating that “sometimes you have to take medicine”. Why am I reminded of the bit in Covid where he appeared to suggest that disinfectant could helpfullybe injectedinto the lungs? I guess that was just science, same as this tariffs plan is just economics.Even so, can it really still be less than a week since a Wall Street Journal poll found 77% of US Republicans thought tariffs would have a positive impact? Ah well. Famously, the American people have a great tolerance for pain. If only one of their kindly gazillionare firms could come up with some sort of financial opioid epidemic to take the edge off the coming agonies.As discussedhere recently, in China, they call Trump “the nation builder”. And, spoiler alert, the nation they’re talking about is not the United States. Perhaps, then, it is not altogether strange and unpredictable that the Chinese have, thus far, failed to fold in the face of the American president’s tariffs, even as Trumpthreatens to slapan extra 50% tax on Chinese imports as revenge for Xi Jinping’s government having had the temerity to impose a 34% counter-tariff on the US.“If the US insists on going its own way,” a spokesperson for Beijing’s commerce ministry stated on Tuesday, “China will fight it to the end.” Big talk – but what about Xi’s midterm elections? This could really pile political pressure on – oh right, I just remembered. Presumably a future stage of Trump’s masterplan will be to explain that for too long, the rest of the world has been taking advantage of America because it has indulged them by holding regular elections. Well, NO MORE! The United States cannot be made a fool of by democracy any longer.View image in fullscreenBill Ackman publicly endorsed Donald Trump last summer.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesStill, as the world burns, we’ve got to take our cheap thrills where we can – so who’s your favourite embarrassingly disillusioned billionaire Trump backer? My current one is Bill Ackman, hedge-fund supremo, who last July publicly endorsed Trump, grandly declaring: “I assure you that I have made this decision carefully, rationally, and by relying on as much empirical data as possible.” Well, flash forward to Sunday, and – whaddayaknow? – the same Bill Ackmancould be found explainingthat Trump was launching “economic nuclear war on every country in the world”, and that we were “heading for a self-induced, economic nuclear winter”. Mm. I guess the ONE piece of empirical evidence Ackman overlooked about tariffs was all the many, many, many times during the election campaign that Trump clearly stated he was going to impose tariffs. Can’t believe he’s imposed tariffs. I guess strife comes at you fast. According to Bill, “this is not what we voted for”. Oh dear. Always read the big print, Bill!Then again, of all the wanky things Trump’s mega-rich backers say about him, the most masturbatorial of all is surely “take him seriously but not literally”. How many times have we had to sit through this trite little piece of wisdom-effect nonsense? But, gentlemen … he has quite literally done the very serious thing he said he was going to do. How to play this wholly unpredictable state of affairs? Tell you what – if any of your companies or the ones you invest in need goods or parts from overseas, why not simply inform your suppliers that you are taking the presidential tariffs “seriously but not literally”, and see how you get on?The added irony, of course, is that this is happening to members of that special class of Trump big-hitters who think about the Roman empire every day. I wonder which period of it they’ve been thinking of this past week. The good days, definitely! Especially when Trump hit the golf course while the markets were on fire. Take presidential first buddy Elon Musk, who has wimped out of saying anything explicit about tariffs, preferring instead to drag his brainworms on to his own platform again and post a video of Milton Friedman debunking the very notion of trade taxes. Good to see the guy retreating into his clicktivist phase, the period where he – along with everyone else on X – thinks that posting about something is the same as doing anything remotely useful.Speaking of conspicuously absent friends, though, whatever happened to Trump’s local beta, Nigel Farage? He’s gone rather quiet on the cheerleading front. In fact, given the raging shitstorm, it’s no surprise that all this is playing out as one of the great submarine moments of Farage’s career. He always does this when he’s afraid to front up, eventually emerging with some mealy-mouthed bollocks long after backbone and leadership were required. He didn’t surface in theimmediate aftermathof the murder of Jo Cox during the referendum campaign. He had scarcely a soundbite when his much-touted new friend Musksuddenly turned on himand said he didn’t have what it takes as a leader. And now Nigel’s declining to be meaningfully drawn as Donald Trump – a man in whose colon the Clacton MP has spent more time than his constituency – has unleashed destructive turmoil, even though Nigel told everyone he was a very stable genius. Nigel always pulls this trick when the going gets tough, somewhat like the child who imagines that putting his hands over his eyes means no one can see him.We’ve certainly yet to hear him expand on the real-world implications of the tariffs. After all, speaking of “taking medicine”, health secretary Wes Streeting has this morning said that tariffs could affect the UK’smedicine supply. That, I suppose, would be quite literally – and definitely seriously – “taking medicine”, in that it would be taking medicine away from people who urgently need it.Of course, Elon Musk isn’t the only wingnut to own his own platform, so let’s play out with a genuine statement posted to Truth Social by the occupant of the Oval Office. “The United States has a chance to do something that should have been done DECADES AGO. Don’t be Weak! Don’t be Stupid! Don’t be a PANICAN (a new party based on Weak and Stupid people!). Be Strong, Courageous, and Patient, and GREATNESS will be a result”. Righto. Last week, Republican house speaker Mike Johnson declared: “You have to trust the president’s instincts on the economy, OK?” Do you trust in the instinct of the man who wrote the above word salad? Or do you, like rather a lot of people, find yourself slightly panican?Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsTrump tariffsOpinionDonald TrumpTariffsUS economycommentShareReuse this content"

Behind those statistics is a heartbreaking condition for individuals (and their loved ones) as they become confused and disoriented, struggle to recognise family, friends and caregivers, and lose the ability to live independently.Recent studies fromacross the worldhave highlighted that dementia cases are likely to rise dramatically. For instance,an analysisof 15,000 middle-aged US adults in Nature Medicine in January 2025 found that in study participants, the lifetime risk of developing dementia after 55 was 42%. Basically, an estimated 42% of over 55-year-old Americans will eventually develop dementia. This is considerably higher than previous studies had found. The authors say that the number of US adults who will develop dementia annually is expected to double over the next four decades. The numbers are eye-wateringly high, and they align with a growing concern in public health that with more people living longer and elderly people becoming a larger proportion of the population, cases will increase dramatically, with associated health and social care challenges.Lowering bad cholesterol may cut risk of dementia by 26%, study suggestsRead moreHowever, these estimates of a future tsunami of dementia are nowbeing challenged, givendata showingthat age-specific dementia rates declined by about two-thirds among US adults between 1984 and 2024. Similar falling rates were found in Sweden, the Netherlands, the UK and France. To take it out of jargon, yes, the absolute number of people developing dementia is going up because of ageing and the increasing number of elderly people. Yet, at each age – whether it’s 50 or 60, or 70 – it seems that most studies show that the rate of developing dementia at a given age is going down, compared with what we’ve seen in the past. We’re getting better at living longer, with cognitive impairment still occurring but at a later age.There’s no simple answer to explain the decrease in age-specific dementia rates, although there are several hypotheses, such as lower smoking rates, higher education, better treatment of high blood pressure and early detection of cognitive impairment. We know that there are modifiable factors – that is, things that individuals and communities can do to prevent the onset of dementia. The Lancet Commission on dementia preventionestimatesthat about 45% cases of dementia are preventable if 14 modifiable risk factors are addressed. These include education, hypertension, hearing loss, vision loss, smoking, obesity, depression, physical inactivity, diabetes, high LDL cholesterol, excessive alcohol consumption, air pollution and loneliness and traumatic brain injury. The causes of dementia are complex, and include genetic predisposition, but there are also significant actions that we can each do to improve the health of our brain and delay the onset of disease.New blood test checks for Alzheimer’s and assesses progression, study saysRead moreOver the past couple of decades we’ve become better at understanding these risk factors and developing public health policies and education to address them. We’ve also seen massive scientific progress in medical drugs. For instance, the past couple years have seen the development oftwo new treatmentsfor Alzheimer’s (donanemab and lecanemab), which clinical trials indicate slow down the progression of the disease – and which have led to bold claims, by pharmaceutical companies such as Lilley, that this is the “beginning of the end” of Alzheimer’s. Caution is needed, given the high cost of treatment and serious side-effects that these medicines can cause, but it still shows the slow and steady forward movement in dealing with the disease.The decrease in age-specific dementia ratescontrasts with cancer, where incidence is expected to keep going up in young people. Referred to as the “birth cohort effect”, the numbers show that each group of people born at a later time have a higher risk of developing cancer later in life. So someone born in 1990 is at a higher risk of developing cancer younger than someone born in 1980, who has a higher risk than someone born in 1970. For instance, colorectal cancer increased by 70% among those aged 15-39 in G20 countries between 1990 and 2019. We’re doing better in some areas of health like delaying dementia and losing ground in others such as cancer prevention.Yes, we all have to die at some point, and something in our mind or body will eventually break down with time, but the public health goal is to push disease as far as possible into the future. We know that there are things we can do to delay dementia, and we are already seeing progress likely linked to public health policies and medical advances. Behind the headline news of a dementia tsunami, there’s some good news too.Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, and the author ofHow Not to Die (Too Soon)Explore more on these topicsAlzheimer'sOpinionDementiaHealthMental healthcommentShareReuse this content"

But they brought a glimmer of hopeMoira DoneganThe Hands Off event proved Americans with a slew of different priorities can still form a broad left-liberal coalitionTue 8 Apr 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 8 Apr 2025 12.04 EDTShareWhat is the point of street protest? This is the question I asked myself as I rode the bus downtown to San Francisco city hall, where activists were hosting a rally and march for Hands Off, a national day of action meant to collect a broad range of resistance to the Trump regime under one banner.During the firstTrump administration, I’d gone to these a lot. I’d attended the Women’s March in Washington in January of 2017, and felt myself crushed between the bodies of the hundreds of thousands of attenders; I’d held a sign at JFK airport, chanting “Immigrants are welcome here”, a few weeks later, when Trump instituted his travel ban. In 2020, I’d marched in Black Lives Matter protests, trying to avenge the horror I had felt when I’d seen videos of police officers killing Black men, often as they begged for their lives, played over and over again on the tiny screen of my phone. I’d inherited a brutal and ugly world, I felt, and it seemed urgent to say that I rejected it, that I felt the rage and grief of its injustice, and to be among other people who felt the same way.But in time, these demonstrations lost their salutary power, even as I kept going to them. I saw signs that irked me, making jokes that seemed cavalier or claims I found wrongheaded. I heard, and came to absorb, criticisms of protest movements as vain or self-congratulatory. Perhaps none was thought more so than the Women’s March, where I had once felt so hopeful, which became, instead of the blueprint for future activism that it was meant to be, something of a shorthand on the left for the feminine and the cringe, an effort thought to be heavy on self-seriousness and light on justifications for it.But most of all, I think, I stopped believing that protests like the kind I was attending could have a political effect. Policymakers seemed indifferent to the expressions of mass displeasure we were making in the streets; if anything, our actions seemed to be radicalizing them against us further. Those in power were hostile to our worldview and indifferent to our desires: they kept on supporting violence and depravation, no matter how clever our chants were, and no number of bodies in the streets seemed to slow the regression of our rights, or stop the flow of money to wars of aggression abroad, or keep the titans of industry from plundering our institutions, stealing our wages, or gouging their prices. It wasn’t clear that these efforts were accomplishing anything. I remember peeling off from one march, on Manhattan’s Sixth Avenue, and heading for my subway line: I had realized, after more than an hour of walking and chanting, that we had been going in circles.The protests offered a corrective, a sign that the depravity of the Trump agenda has roused a weary cohort from their defeatist malaiseI suspect that I have not been alone in this feeling. And perhaps it has been this sense of protest’s futility – its inadequacy or even foolishness in light of the regime’s indifference to popular will – that has caused the delay in left-liberal opposition to the restored Trump regime, the sense of defeat and the lack of visible opposition even as the Maga right has pursued an especially sadistic and lawless version of their agenda. We had, after all, tried all this before. And where had it gotten us?But the Hands Off protests that spread across the country this weekend offered a corrective, a sign that the depravity of the Trump agenda and the breadth of the injuries it is inflicting have roused a weary cohort of American liberals from their defeatist malaise. What emerged was a broad left-liberal coalition, with a slew of different priorities, united in opposition to what they see as an anti-constitutional assault on basic rights, civil society and human dignity.In San Francisco, I saw an older white couple wearing T-shirts that read Resist or Nasty Woman – clearly leftovers from the first Trump era, dug out from the back of the closet – chatting amiably with a pair of young Black women wearing keffiyehs as hijabs. Palestinian, American and trans flags were in bountiful supply – along with the newly familiar flag of Greenland, the icebound and mineral-rich northern territory that Trump has concocted a bizarre plan to take over. Handmade signs held aloft amid the massive crowd spoke to a dizzying array of grievances against the Trump administration: from “Medicaid saves lives” to “Childhood vaccines cause adulthood” to “Hands off my social security”. A child let me take a photograph of a sign he’d made himself, in his inexpert handwriting, that read, “If you think education is expensive, try ignorance”, and was complete with three drawings of open books. Some signs pointed to federal programs the maker had benefited from – the Veterans Administration, Pell grants, the National Institutes of Health, national parks, Medicare – while speakers cited the local costs of Trump’s cuts and agenda, from pollution in the San Francisco Bay, to layoffs at local employers, to the plight of immigrant communities.But overwhelmingly, the sentiment was pro-democracy and anti-oligarchical. One sign showed the Statue of Liberty covering her face and weeping: “No Fascists”, it said. Another showed Lady Liberty’s torch setting alight a Tesla Cybertruck. Elon Musk, Trump and Mark Zuckerberg appeared on one sign with the words “Down with the Broligarchy” – a popular catchphrase. Another sign read “End Citizens United” – a reference to the 2010 supreme court decision that allowed unlimited money into politics – a warping of the law that made the takeover of the federal government by monied interests inevitable. When a representative of a local nurses’ union spoke through a bullhorn, her most popular line summed up the tenor of the afternoon: “We can have billionaires, or we can have democracy,” she said. “We can’t have both.”Such a large coalition, with such diverse priorities, is bound to contain contradictions and conflict. And it is true that the exact end goal of the protests, which had no single demand and only vague or tenuous plans for further action, remains ambiguous. But the afternoon, with participation across such a broad array of American left-liberal activism, convinced me that it remains possible for Americans to form a popular front: an alliance of people whose politics would not normally put them in alliance, who nevertheless come together against a fascist threat.The future of the anti-Trump American political movement remains uncertain, and its direction is still not decided. But the work of shaping that future will happen on afternoons like this, in the heat or the rain, among people we might not otherwise choose to spend our time with. It will mean denying ourselves the luxury of hopelessness or disappointed fatigue. And it will mean proceeding doggedly along, through displeasure and uncertainty, towards a future we cannot yet see.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionDonald TrumpProtestUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Not just the person taking the GCSEs or A-levels, but the whole lot of you have to start having early nights, gird your loins, and get used to mood swings and anxiety attacks. It’s sort of true, but it also depends quite a lot on the personality of the exam-taker. Some of them want to be tested on the groyne height of a beach in Hastings and practise talking about the climate crisis in French; others want you to butt out completely and leave them to it. Both approaches seem pretty reasonable to me.I’d forgotten one thing – the terrible guilt. Maybe it’s because the Easter holidays weren’t sunny last year, or maybe it’s because the youngest is my favourite (I amjoking), but the guilt is just hideous. It’s like having a little Cinderella in the house, except I’m not the audience – I’m the evil stepmother. Fancy going to the beach, or to a party? What about a lovely lie-in, and then some re-runs of The Office? What about a ball – you know there are some great balls on? Everyone can do exactly as they wish, except Cinders upstairs, who’s trying to memorise the whole of Great Expectations, while the rest of us – even the people who did the same text last year – sit around going: “Is that the one about the orphanage and the porridge?”We can’t even do positive visualisations of the summer, when it’ll all be over, as that just reminds the poor rag-dressed creature of the time period between now and then. Really, the only way to offset this guilt would be to memorise Great Expectations myself. But I don’t want to.

As humanitarian workers, we are drowning in griefAmy NeilsonI write to bear witness to the incredible nature of these men – to their kindness, their gentleness and their goodnessMon 7 Apr 2025 21.46 EDTLast modified on Mon 7 Apr 2025 22.47 EDTShareWhen the initial news of the executions of eight paramedics from the Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) and the disappearance of one more broke on Eid al-Fitr, I stared for a long time at the pictures of the men the Israel Defense Forces had killed. I have stared more every day since.I knew some of these men.I scan photos of my time inGazalast year, looking for these men in my memories. I see them with patients, kneeling by the stretchers that acted as beds, dressing wounds, talking, reassuring. I see them loading patients into ambulances and driving off in the summer dust. I see them laughing, playing soccer on the tennis court.Eight Palestinian paramedics, working under the auspices of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and with the full protection of their emblem, were killed by the Israel Defense Forces, in blatant violation of international humanitarian law, and indeed of the most basic sense of being human. They were killed and buried alongside six first responders from Gaza’s civil defence unit and a United Nations employee.In April 2024 I was part of an emergency medical team delivering medical care in Gaza. At the request of the World Health Organization, our team worked with the PRCS at a trauma stabilisation point. What an honour that was. On a tennis court in Khan Younis, we worked from two tents – one for the PRCS and one for us – collaborating frequently and freely. We saw patients, treating those we could, and stabilising and referring elsewhere those we could not. Paramedics brought patients directly from places of frontline trauma and when stable they loaded them back in the ambulances and took them to where they hoped they could receive the care they needed. The PRCS clinicians I worked with in Khan Younis took far greater risks than any I have faced in a decade of work in conflict to provide life-saving medical care to their compatriots.Gaza paramedics shot in upper body ‘with intent to kill’, Red Crescent saysRead moreReturning home last yearI wrote in the Guardianthat “Israel poses a palpable, unprecedented risk to humanitarian and medical workers in Gaza”. The latest update from theUnited Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairsreports that since October 2023 at least 409 humanitarian workers have been killed in Gaza, and the number keeps rising. Australian aid worker Zomi Frankcom was one of them. The anniversary of her death passed just days ago, and indeed far too quietly.Medical humanitarian work, to me, is about both contributing to access to healthcare for people in areas of great need, as well as bearing witness to their suffering, in whatever is the manner required by the moment. In this moment I write to bear witness but not to the suffering of the Palestinian Red Crescent medical staff, for that you can read about yourself. Indeed, if you have not seen the egregious violence of Israel against healthcare workers and civilians in Gaza and the West Bank, you are not looking. No, I write to bear witness to the incredible nature of these men – to their love, their kindness, their gentleness and their goodness. We stop seeing people’s humanity very quickly in war of any description, and even more so in mass slaughter or indeed genocide. Erasure requires such forgetting.I watched the men of the PRCS work hard and effectively. I sat with them between patients, listening to lyrical conversation and wondering at their upbeat spirts. In more private candid moments they would explain, what choice did they have? They needed to stay positive enough to be upright each day, to continue the work. They were tired, they were scared, but they continued.We ate together. In the middle of a conflict zone with the austerity that resulted from Israel’s systematic blockades of supplies into Gaza, our colleagues in the PRCS fed us each day from their own kitchens. The people of the PRCS seem to give of an inexhaustible supply of goodness of their own selves.Many of us engaged in medical humanitarian work are currently drowning in grief, in anger and in concern for any possibility of work in conflict going forward.Experienced humanitarian workers know that the deaths of our colleagues are not collateral damage from the routine business of war. War might have been foggy in the 19th century, but I can assure you it is not in the 21st. Israel has demonstrated its exceptional capacity for precision targeting. None with any power among us can afford to wait for a belated international criminal court or International Court of Justice process to say what we see with our own eyes. States must acknowledge the violations of the laws of war that Israel continues to perpetrate, and they must act accordingly.A former-ICRC friend wrote on Instagram that “grief has lost its meaning”. We are all at a loss for words. Another wrote to me that “it is a huge challenge to honour their lives properly”. As I struggle to type, pulling words like teeth without anaesthetic, I feel the words of my friends with my soul and sinew. I can’t meet the challenge. Nothing I can say can ever adequately honour the men of the Palestinian Red Crescent Society. Instead, I write in sadness for the record.Amy Neilson is an Australian rural generalist emergency doctor and academic.

It said so on Fox NewsArwa MahdawiLet’s stop all the moaning about stock market crashes and soaring grocery prices. It’s time to focus on the upsides!Tue 8 Apr 2025 07.41 EDTLast modified on Tue 8 Apr 2025 11.48 EDTShareThere’s been a lot of doom-mongering about tariffs recently, hasn’t there? Oh no, my life savings are going to get wiped out and I’m never going to be able to retire! Oh no, grocery prices are going to triple! Oh no, it looks suspiciously as ifDonald Trumphas used ChatGPT to guide his fiscal policy and now we’re going to see another Great Depression! Moan, moan, moan.While it might be true that much of these predictions are coming from highly credentialed economists and people who tend to know what they’re talking about, I’d like to remind you thatthere are two sides to every story– and it’s always worth looking at both of them.You’ve already heard from voices who reckon Trump’s tariffs are misguided and dangerous. Now it’s time to focus on the people who support the president’s assessment that tariffs are a “verybeautiful thing” that will usher in a new golden age.Where do we find such people? Fox News, of course. The place where up is down, left is right, and Oceania has always been at war with Eastasia if King Trump says that’s the case. As the stock market plunges, Fox News has wheeled out a bunch of pundits and anchors to explain how your savings getting obliterated is a good thing, actually.First, there’s Fox News host Jesse Watters, who is known for making thoughtful and nuanced statements such as: “When a man votes for a woman, he actuallytransitions into a woman”; and announcing that men shouldn’t eat soup in public becauseit isn’t “manly”. In a recent segment,Watters saidthat these tariffs – which will make life more expensive – are actually “going to make it easier for people to start families”. He added: “These tariffs are for the children.” I polled my own child, who is three, on this, and she would rather have an Elsa doll than a tariff, but what does she know, eh?While Watters believes the children are our future, and tariffs will help them lead the way, Free Press columnist Batya Ungar-Sargon reckons Trump’s economic policy is going to fix the “crisis of masculinity”. On Sunday, Ungar-Sargon told Fox News that the US had “shipped jobs that gave men who work with their hands for a living, and rely on brawn and physicality, off to other countries … and imported millions and millions of illegals to work in construction, manufacturing, landscaping, janitorial services – jobs that used to give men access to the American dream.”Ah yes, as the old adage goes: if you’ve got nothing intelligent to say, go on Fox News and demonise immigrants. There are in fact plenty of jobs available in the US that rely on “brawn and physicality”; the problem is many of them wreck your body and don’t pay a living wage. You know the workers who cut quartz slabs for kitchen countertops, for example? They’re predominantly young Latino men who are said to besuffering from lung diseasebecause of the silica dust created by cutting said slabs. Meanwhile, construction workers are more likely todie of a drug overdosethan those in any other occupation because the physical nature of the work results in an increased likelihood of injury and the subsequent prescription of addictive opioids. Romanticising these sorts of jobs – particularly when your own job consists of typing on a computer – does absolutely nothing to help men.As I said, it’s always important to look atboth sides,even if one side of an argument appears completely demented. Still, I’m squinting very hard and I’m afraid that, despite Ungar-Sagon and Watters’s very persuasive arguments, I can’t see an upside to tariffs. Let’s say that more manufacturing jobs do open up in the US (a process that would take years). It seems unlikely Trump would fight for them to come with decent wages – he recently rescinded one of Joe Biden’s executive orders thatraised the minimum wagefor federal contractors. I’m not sure doing hard labour for a low salary gives you access to the American dream, unless your dream is going bankrupt from medical bills.But look at me: moan, moan, moan. You know what I’ve just realised my problem is? I think I need to watch more Fox News. And, if you’re feeling down about the state of the world, then you may need to, too. Now that Trump has started posturing over Iran, I can’t wait for Fox pundits to explain how accidentally inviting a nuclear war is going to be great, actually. Nothing like a little bit of radiation poisoning to fix the crisis of masculinity.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsTariffsOpinionTrump administrationTrump tariffsDonald TrumpUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Judiciary officials have advised judges on how to deal with the issue after anecdotal reports of dogs barking, urinating and defecating, jumping up and otherwise disrupting proceedings. Assistance animals, such as guide dogs and medical alert dogs, are highly trained and covered under equality legislation to enter courts. “Emotional support animals” (ESAs), however, arenot regulatedin the UK; they may not necessarily even be trained at all.Though it’s become a punchline, the concept is not devoid of merit. ESAs first came tomainstream attention around 2015following some high-profile examples on US college campuses. The idea is that the presence and companionship of a pet can help to alleviate the symptoms or effects of someone’s disability or mental health condition, and help them to succeed at school. Educatorshave describedanddefendedthe transformative impact of these dogs (as they most often are) on disadvantaged students. Indeed, because they receive no special training, it is only “theimpact of those benefits… that makes an ESA therapeutically appropriate” (to quote froma 2019 editorial in theJournal of the American Veterinary Medical Association, my italics).But what started out rooted in reality, as a compassionate accommodation extended in specific circumstances to a few, is increasingly being taken advantage of. It is hard to believe that anyone would attempt to argue that they can’t function without theiremotional support squirrel.Orpeacock. Orturkey. And yet all those cases have been made, presumably with a straight face.Britain, a nation of dog lovers? Look at all the spoilt or abandoned pups, then tell me what you think | Elle HuntRead morePublic ridicule and disapproval hasn’t slowed emotional support animals’ roll into legitimacy. In 2014, a New Yorker reporter, trying to pinpoint the exact line where the “therapy animal” line crossed into parody, ended uptaking an alpaca on a train. Four years later, after a spate of “pigs, monkeys, turkeys, snakes and oh-so-many dogs” on planes, the New York Timescalled it a fadand even a “scam”. But since the pandemic widely stoked anxiety and unravelled the social fabric, perhaps beyond repair, it’s been harder to put the ESA back into its airline-approved cage. Yes, some will undeniably have therapeutic benefits, but more can only be bald-faced grifts.Last week, a 71-year-old Nevada man called Karl Mitchell, who had been keeping seven tigers at his home without a permit,argued that theywere there on doctor’s orders, to help with his post-traumatic stress disorder. In these post-truth times, it seems, one person’s emotional support animal may be another’s apex predator. Of course, dogs and cats are not the only legitimate pets, and I am more enthusiastic than most about species that are scaly, slimy or scary. But even if we are to take these cases in good faith, it’s not callous to say that one person’s coping mechanism can’t be allowed to take precedence over the experiences of everyone else.Take Wally,the emotional support alligator, who became briefly famous a few years ago. His owner said caring for Wally helped him with his depression, and I believe him. Equally I can see that, for other people, encountering the 5.5ft-long reptile at,say, a baseball gamemight induce anxiety – despite Wally’s owner’s assurance that he “doesn’t bite”.That’s the extreme (AKA American) presentation of the ESA phenomenon. But it’s not dissimilar in principle from the kennel-type chaos reported at British courts. The justice system is dysfunctional enough as it is; one dog may help one person through, but many dogs are likely to just add to the anxiety, delays and disruption. Having not been trained to resist distractions or weather long periods in unfamiliar, busy settings, it may not be much fun for the dogs, either. In recent years,dog ownership has cometo be understood by many as simply having a dog and taking it with you, wherever you go – first to the pub and cinema, now your sentencing. It may be preferable to leaving them cooped up at home alone all day – but it’s far from facilitating their natural behaviours, as is considered the gold-standard for animal husbandry.The rise of ESAs has been taken up in the culture wars, as evidence that somefeeble-minded “babies”are unable to cope with reality. A more compassionate view is that, clearly, people feel in need of support – but leaning on our pets isn’t the answer. That we’d even think to argue otherwise illustrates the heavy burden we expect animals to carry – the roles we expect them to play for us without, necessarily, equivalent regard for their wellbeing. Consider the animals that are claimed to alleviate flying anxiety, for example. Long-haul flights are uncomfortable enough for us – imagine if you had no idea why you were doing it or indeed what a plane was. Tywinn, the nine-year-old miniature schnauzer, certainly didn’t know what was in store.Just before Christmas in 2024, his owner, Alison Lawrence,tried to board a flightwith him from Florida to Bogotá, Colombia. When she was found to not have the correct paperwork, Lawrence allegedly took Tywinn to the airport bathroom and drowned him. She caught her flight; his body was later discovered in the bin.The story of Wally the alligator also seems to haveended unhappily,with Wally’s disappearance or perhaps abduction. He never bit, his owner said – butmaybe he should have. We may benefit from animals’ support, and even feel entitled to it. But can they count on ours?Elle Hunt is a freelance journalistExplore more on these topicsAnimalsOpinionMental healthHealthDogsCatsPetscommentShareReuse this content"

Now he wants to deliver. Thousands of undocumented migrants have been rounded up by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials since he returned to the White House. On Monday, the US supreme court lifted a judge’s ban on deporting alleged gang members to Venezuelaunder an 18th-century law, though it said deportees had a right to judicial review. Even the Trump-backing podcaster Joe Rogan hasdescribed as “horrific”the removal of an asylum seeker –identifiedas a criminal because he had tattoos – under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act.What’s truly new is that the administration is also targeting those who arrived and remained in the US with official approval, such as the Palestinian activist and studentMahmoud Khalil. Normally, green card holders would be stripped of their status if convicted of a crime; he has not even been accused of one. But Mr Trump had pledged to deport international students who participated in pro-Palestinian protests that his administration has deemed antisemitic, and Mr Khalil was a leading figure in the movement at Columbia University. The president crowed that his arrest last month was “the first of many”. Rümeysa Öztürk, a Turkish student at Tufts, wasdetained by masked agentsin the street, reportedly for an opinion piece she co-wrote with other students. Unrelated to the protests, dozens if not hundreds more students havehad visas revoked, often for minor or non-criminal offences.This crackdown is exploiting legislation in ways that were never intended. The Alien Enemies Act was previously invoked only in wartime – but Mr Trump casts mass migration as an “invasion”. Mr Khalil and others are targeted under a rarely used provision of theImmigration and Nationality Act, which allows deportations when the secretary of state determines that a foreign national’s presence “would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States”. And while this campaign is indiscriminate in many regards, Mr Trump’s offer ofasylumto white Afrikaners facing “unjust racial discrimination” in South Africa speaks volumes about who is and is not wanted in his America.The current fear among migrants, with all itssocial costs, is not a byproduct of this drive, but the desired result. The Trump administration istrying to pushundocumented individuals into “self-deporting”, which is cheaper and easier than using agents to hunt people down. It reportedly plans tolevy fines of up to $998 a dayif those under deportation orders do not leave – applying the penalties retroactively for up to five years. Fairness, never mind mercy, is not relevant. The administration admits an “administrative error” led to theexpulsion to El Salvador of Kilmar Abrego Garcia– who is married to a US citizen and was working legally in the US – but fights against righting that wrong.This crackdown should frighten US nationals too, both for what it says about their nation’s character and for what it may mean for their own rights. The Trump administration wants toremove birthright citizenshipand is ramping updenaturalisationefforts. “I love it,”saidMr Trump, when asked about El Salvador’s offer to jail US citizens in its infamous mega-prisons – though at least he conceded that he might have to check the law first. The chilling effect of Mr Khalil’s arrest on dissent is already beingfelt by US nationals too: the first amendment’s protection of free speech is not exclusive to citizens.“The friendless alien has indeed been selected as the safest subject of a first experiment; but the citizen will soon follow,” Thomas Jeffersonwrotewhen the alien and sedition laws were passed.

Now frontline personnel need the health secretary’s attentionTue 8 Apr 2025 13.37 EDTLast modified on Tue 8 Apr 2025 13.51 EDTShareResponding to the firstNHS long-term workforce plan, in 2023, the King’s Fund thinktank described staff shortages and gaps in England as amounting to a “deeply entrenched crisis”. That document was meant to be the start of something. Under the Conservatives, parliament rejected the idea that NHS England’s jobs strategy should be subject to independent scrutiny. But given the initial estimate of a 260,000 shortfall in England’s health workforce (including doctors and nurses), there was a promise to review the position in two years.That date is fast approaching. Fixing the workforce should be among the big themes of Labour’s 10-year plan for the health service, when it is published in June. Attention in recent weeks has focused on the centre, following the announcement that NHS England would be scrapped and its functions, along with around half of its 15,000 staff, brought back inhouse to the Department of Health and Social Care. Manoeuvring at the highest level continues, with Sir Chris Whitty filling the role of permanent secretary on an interim basis. But what of the changes on the frontline that will be needed if the government is to succeed?The deployment ofcommunity health and wellbeing workersto 13 more areas, following a successful pilot, is one clue to what lies ahead. While not clinically trained, like health visitors, these workers are responsible for checks on households in a given area that are known to need support, and can help with housing or other practical issues as well as health. Early results are promising. This kind of holistic outreach looks consistent with the government’s aim of pivoting towards prevention in the community, and reducing the proportion of health budgets spent in hospitals.But developing new roles and projects like these while simultaneously slashing budgets and jobs will be challenging, to say the least. Instructions to NHS trusts to cut by 50% the cost of their corporate functions, such as HR and communications, could lead to theloss of 100,000 postsin total – and a huge redundancy bill. Integrated care boards are also under instructions to slim down and focus on commissioning.At the health select committee on Tuesday, Wes Streeting depicted himself as a warrior against bureaucratic bloat. Far from a power grab, he told MPs, the merger withNHSEngland is intended to push decision-making down the line to neighbourhoods. On the reduction of centralised targets, he stuck to his guns. Ministers want more “doers” and fewer “checkers”.Will community and primary care services be able to deliver what is asked of them? However the 10-year plan is framed, this looks like being a key question over the next few years. How to reconcile a commitment to local innovation with demands for fairness is another. On waiting lists, and GP numbers, there is modest progress to report. The risk is thatcuts and reorganisationcause more problems than they solve. Talking up the importance of “doers” is one thing. But staff morale andpatientsatisfaction are both at worryingly low levels, with further strikes a strong possibility. The entrenched crisis in the NHS workforce is ongoing.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It is the role of the Probation Service to provide judges with pre-sentence reports … These reports … may be particularly important for shedding light on individuals from backgrounds unfamiliar to the judge.”As theSentencing Council rightly points out: “The judge will be better equipped to do that if they have as much information as possible about the offender. The cohort of ethnic, cultural and faith minority groups may be a cohort about which judges and magistrates are less well informed.”Today, only 11% of judges are from a declared ethnic minority. Of those, only 1% are Black. The latter statistic has not improved in 15 years. Nothing has changed since the Lammy review. There will be no reduction in disparity unless there is a will, divorced from politics, to address racial disparities and negative bias wherever they may occur, consciously or otherwise.For Black and ethnic minority populations, two-tier policing and sentencing has always existed, just not in the direction that the justice minister and the opposition appear to believe.Cordella Bart-StewartCo-founder and director,Black Solicitors NetworkI am a criminal defence solicitor representing a young mother, and the government’s latest move could have catastrophic consequences for my client and her baby (Labour’s populist pantomime over sentencing rules plays into the hands of the right, 1 April). The new sentencing guideline took account of current medical, legal and psychological consensus on the dangers of prison for pregnant women and its disproportionate impact on their dependent children.Following the hard work of campaigners and practitioners, we at last saw a move in the right direction – to prioritise the rehabilitation of offenders without inflicting unnecessary, long-lasting harm on children or unborn babies.It is extremely troubling thatShabana Mahmoodwould choose to spend her time as justice secretary seizing the one positive change in the criminal justice system as the battleground for her culture war. Meanwhile, the prison overpopulation crisis continues to deepen, along with the crown court case backlog.Before waging war against the Sentencing Council, Mahmood should have at least understood the purpose of pre-sentence reports. They don’t lead to lower sentences, they simply provide additional information to judges before they can choose the appropriate sentence. In practice, this often leads to a harsher punishment.I represent a young woman due to be sentenced next month after pleading guilty to supplying drugs. She spent the majority of her pregnancy in prison and was released on bail just before giving birth. Since then, she has turned her life around, she is working and is raising a healthy, happy baby. The new sentencing guideline, which took into account the devastating impact of mother-infant separation, would have directed courts to prioritise a community-based sentence for her. In the absence of this, she may well go to prison. The justice secretary’s political point-scoring has devastating consequences.Francesca CocianiLondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

In the first leg of aChampions Leaguequarter-final. And not just once, either. On a red-letter occasion for Arsenal, probably the finest since the Emirates Stadium opened in 2006, their key midfielder brought the house down; Real Madrid to their knees, as well.It is never wise to write off the Champions League holders, the 15‑time winners – the club that have the patent on astonishing comebacks. Surely not this time.‘Nice bit of history’: Rice delight after Arsenal’s famous win against MadridRead moreRice had never scored from a direct free-kick in his nine-season professional career. That took in 338 previous games forArsenaland West Ham; 64 for England, too. That he did it twice inside 12 second-half minutes had grown men and women rubbing their eyes and contending with extraordinary levels of delirium.Rice’s conversions were marked by precision, a total mastery of the flight of the ball, vicious levels of whip and for Arsenal, there would be even more. The outstanding Myles Lewis-Skelly had carried the fight to Real throughout; they could not cope with his inverted runs into midfield, his shoulder drops and bursts, his searching low passes.When he went square at the end of yet another Arsenal incision, Mikel Merino swept home for 3-0 and Arsenal could start to dream of the semi-finals and beyond. It was the latest dividend from Merino’s switch to centre forward. To think that he had never played in the position until mid‑February; from it, he now has six goals for Arsenal.Real had lost at home against Valencia in La Liga on Saturday, conceding a 95th‑minute winner, which is not the kind of thing that is supposed to happen to them. It is normally them driving the last-gasp turnarounds. They now trail Barcelona by four points and the muttering about just how good this team is has been a soundtrack of the season.The Champions League is the competition that tends to lift their numerous A-listers into Best Actor nomination territory, but not here. Save for a spell of 20 minutes or so in the middle of the first half, they were second best, outrun and outplayed, their misery complete when Eduardo Camavinga was sent off for kicking the ball away at the very end; a second bookable offence.Rice transcended the night, one of the images of it coming after he had picked out the far, top corner for his second. He jumped on to the top of an advertising board, arms outstretched, literally 10 feet tall. Was that the better goal? It was hard to say because the first was also a beauty.Rice started the ball a yard or so outside Thibaut Courtois’s left-hand post and he was able to bring it back inside at the very last – halfway up the net. There was a reason why the TV cameras picked out the former RealgalacticoRoberto Carlos in the crowd and it is worth making the point that the beaten goalkeeper, Courtois, just might be the best in Europe.It was an extraordinary occasion for Arsenal, the club’s biggest game since 2009-10 when they faced Barcelona in the quarter-final of this competition and lost. The ensuing years have not been kind to the Gunners in terms of the Champions League, their only quarter-final appearance since then and before this coming last season when they fell against Bayern Munich.View image in fullscreenReal Madrid’s goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois looks dejected as Mikel Merino (centre) wheels away in celebration after scoring Arsenal’s third goal.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianHow they have craved a night of this type of glamour and it was one when the goosebumps rose on arms around the stadium from the first whistle, the tempo so high.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But Mikel Arteta’s players seemed intent on answering the call on a pre-match tifo from their fans. “Make it happen,” went the wording.Arsenal almost got one of their trademark inswinging corners to work in the early going, Courtois losing his bearings and happy to see the ball hit William Saliba, who was almost on the line in front of goal. Thomas Partey would also work Courtois.Real defended in a 4-4-2 formation, Jude Bellingham dropping to the left of the midfield but they menaced on the transitions in the first half. Their big chance came when Bellingham robbed Jurriën Timber and played a pass in behind for Mbappé, who turned on the jets. David Raya stood tall to block.Back came Arsenal before the interval and it was Bukayo Saka to the fore. He tricked and teased, getting around the outside but nobody in red could read his crosses. Rice would pop up on to one from Timber on 45 minutes only for Courtois to repel his header and block the follow-up shot from Gabriel Martinelli.It was Saka who won the free-kicks for Rice’s goals and, in between times, Courtois saved from Martinelli and after Merino’s follow-up was cleared off the line by David Alaba, the goalkeeper turned over when Merino shot again. Bellingham also cleared a Rice shot off the line. It was simply a scintillating Arsenal performance.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueArsenalReal MadridEuropean club footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The script seemed clear enough from there: three days after the announcement that a 25-year marriage is almost over, Muller would bring Bayern closer to a blissful reunion with the trophy they cherish most.Declan Rice’s double rocket sinks Real Madrid to put Arsenal in dreamlandRead moreThat was until Inter put it in the shredder. Simone Inzaghi’s side spend periods looking indifferent but can produce moments of thrilling incision and are emphatic in front of goal. They were on the ropes after Müller’s equaliser but did as so many Italian sides have, mastering the situation and finding a way. When the tireless Carlos Augusto mustered one last lung-busting up run up the left flank, the substitute Davide Frattesi was placed to crash in his delivery and send Inter’s contingent streaming towards the corner flag.Frattesi ripped off his shirt but Bayern, guilty of leaving the door unlocked when searching for a winner, were the ones exposed. A cobbled-together team, visibly diminished by the long-term injuries to Alphonso Davies and Jamal Musiala, may regret not opting to lock the result down. Perhaps the absence of Dayot Upamecano, one of several others in the treatment room, played into their ragged defensive shape when Inter picked them apart decisively.If you cannot win it, at least do not lose it? “It wouldn’t be the right thing to feel that this 2-1 was a reflection of us not being able to win the game,” Vincent Kompany demurred, preferring to point out the flawless execution of an Inter counterattack masterminded by the exceptional Nicolo Barella. “The result is for Inter at half-time, well done to them, but we still have full belief we can win.”Their confidence might be burgeoning were it not for a moment that may yet give Harry Kane nightmares. The horror on his face was palpable when, after 26 minutes in which Bayern peppered Yann Sommer’s goal, he was found eight yards out by an unselfish Michael Olise. Even at a slight angle, only one outcome seemed possible when Kane wrapped his right foot round the ball. Instead his shot clipped the far post; nobody has scored moreChampions Leaguegoals than Kane since his move to Bayern but it is hard not to wonder whether his pursuit of glory is cursed.By then Bayern should have already been in front, if only due to the volume of half-chances created. Olise, trying to summon the big-game impetus Musiala has honed, saw an early shot deflected inches wide and forced two saves from Sommer. The former Bayern keeper also denied Raphaël Guerreiro, who was pressed into an attacking role due to Bayern’s selection issues, and caught a header from Kane. It all added up to the time-honoured impression punishment would follow and Inter inflicted it stunningly.View image in fullscreenHarry Kane strikes the post during the first half.Photograph: Marco Mantovani/Getty ImagesAugusto had fired a warning shot into the side-netting and Lautaro Martínez, threaded through deliciously by Barella, had stumbled when well placed before they contrived a beautiful goal. Martínez began a move on halfway that ended with Augusto centring low for MarcusThuram, who showed extraordinary presence of mind to detect the Argentinian behind him. He wrong-footed the Bayern rearguard by flicking backwards towards his colleague and the finish, taken first-time with the outside of Martínez’s foot, was resounding.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Kompany’s players came to look laboured, nobody proving capable of emulating Musiala’s bursts beyond Kane and a lack of left-sided thrust painfully evident without Davies.There was little to enthuse the home crowd until Müller’s introduction, which raised the volume and brought fleeting reward when he bundled Konrad Laimer’s cross in from close range. “A fantastic moment for Thomas,” Kompany said. Bayern will need another when they seek inspiration in Lombardy.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueBayern MunichInternazionaleEuropean club footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Having seemed to be back to their entertaining best whenemphatically beating Belgiumon home soil on Friday, an injury-hit England side produced a wholly contrasting first‑half display in Leuven and could have no complaints about the scoreline.Belgium 3-2 England: Women’s Nations League group stage – live reactionRead more“It’s April now. I’m not concerned,” Wiegman said. “Although this doesn’t feel good, it’s a huge learning for us. They [Belgium] actually played as we expected. We know it was going to be totally different [to Friday].“There are a lot of different circumstances. Friday was all good and we were 5-0 up. We just stay neutral. There are things in your journey that go well and things that don’t go well. Tonight was a disappointment but there were a lot of learnings.”One thing she will have learnt is that they have a magical talent on their hands. Brought on as a substitute for the final 10 minutes with England trailing 3-1, with her first two touches of senior international football the 19-year-old Agyemang controlled the ball with her thigh and volleyed home an outstanding, instinctive finish that gave the visitors hope of a late comeback, but they were unable to add to that magical moment and were left to rue their poor first-half performance.With this result England drop to second in their Women’s Nations League group with a total of seven points from four games, behind a Spain side who moved top courtesy of their 7-1 victory against Portugal. More pertinently, with just under three months before the start of the European Championship in Switzerland, the first 45 minutes of this game was another reminder that England must improve significantly and become more consistent if they are to retain their title.The first goal, scored inside four minutes, was alarmingly simple from an England point of view. A routine ball over the top of the Chelsea left-back Niamh Charles was latched on to by the fit-again Belgium captain, Tessa Wullaert, and she proved too quick for the England backline, having plenty of time to pick her spot and place the ball low into the far corner past Hannah Hampton. It was the hosts’ first attack and the European champions proved powerless to stop their break upfield.View image in fullscreenMichelle Agyemang resists pressure from Janice Cayman and Feli Delacauw to score England’s second goal.Photograph: Harriet Lander/The FA/Getty ImagesFor England’s coaching staff, the second Belgium goal will also have been worryingly easy, with the tallest player on the pitch heading in from a set piece. The Everton midfielder Justine Vanhaevermaet beat Leah Williamson in the air and looped her header into the corner from the Inter striker Wullaert’s well-placed free-kick delivery.When the third Belgium goal went in before the half hour, England were in truly uncharted territory in the Wiegman era and facing something of a humiliation. This time it was a well‑worked Belgium move that dragged the England back four across to the right and Wullaert beat Millie Bright to meet the low cross played in from the left by Davina Philtjens. The travelling England fans behind that goal could scarcely believe their eyes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On that night they were beaten 3-2 after being unable to contend with the pace of Wullaert on the counterattack. Admittedly, England had been depleted by injuries since the resounding win at Ashton Gate on Friday, with the Arsenal striker Alessia Russo and the Chelsea forward Lauren James – who both looked in excellent form in Bristol – returning to their clubs for treatment, with Chloe Kelly and Lauren Hemp also among the injured forwards.Quick GuideNations League roundupShowScotlandtook a deserved lead into half-time againstGermanyin Wolfsburg – only to concede six goals in 25 minutes. The Scots were much improved in the first period after losing 4-0 against the same opponents at Tannadice on Friday and Caroline Weir capped an impressive showing with the opening goal five minutes before the break. However, Scotland capitulated after the interval as they suffered a 6-1 defeat, Selina Cerci scoring a hat-trick, to remain without a point after four games.Kirsty Hanson and Claire Emslie were among four players drafted in after the defeat in Dundee and both had an impact as Scotland caused problems.Emslie and Lauren Davidson forced saves and Scotland defended well while showing composure and confidence on the ball. They took the lead after winning the ball back just inside the German half – Hanson's shot was spilled and Weir showed skill and composure to finish from close range.Germany made changes and the second half was a different ball game.  The hosts hit the post shortly before Cerci headed the equaliser from a 51st-minute corner. The same player scored from close range five minutes later after a second German header hit the bar.A slick passing move and a clever finish from Giovanna Hoffmann made it 3-1 in the 63rd minute and the forward scored again almost from the restart after she was left unmarked. Laura Freigang made it three goals in four minutes with a  back-heel finish but she was allowed too much space from the Scotland defence.Hanson should have had a penalty but the referee waved play on and Cerci completed her hat-trick with a brilliant strike.Hannah Cain struck in the second half to earnWalesa 1-1 draw in their match againstSwedenin Gothenburg. Only four minutes after coming on as a substitute, Cain collected a 68th-minute pass from Rachel Rowe and rounded goalkeeper Jennifer Falk before finishing via a post.Sweden had taken the lead through Magdalena Eriksson on the hour and while the Group A4 pacesetters dominated the closing stages, they were unable to find a winner.  It is the second time they have drawn 1-1 with Sweden having held the group favourites to the same scoreline in Wrexham in February. Wales remain bottom of the group on two points.Republic of Irelandmaintained the pressure on leaders Slovenia with a 2-1 win againstGreecein Dublin. The gap remains at three points after Carla Ward's side responded to Slovenia's victory over Turkey earlier in the day to stay in touch in Group B2.Ireland had not lost to Greece in any of their eight previous meetings and Amber Barrett's ninth-minute penalty – her eighth international goal – after Leanne Kiernan was brought down, set them on their way to extend that run.Five minutes after half-time, Anna Patten headed home Megan Campbell's corner to give them a cushion, which was needed as Veatriki Sarri pulled one back in the 72nd minute.Northern Irelandslashed Poland's lead at the top of Group B1 of the Women's Nations League to three points with a 1-0 victory overRomaniaat Windsor Park.Kascie Weir fired the hosts ahead in the eighth minute following a slick passing move that began close to the halfway line, with Keri Halliday providing the killer ball.But they could not produce a second despite controlling the game against the group's bottom placed side, who threatened to grab an equaliser late on.Northern Ireland are now three points behind Poland after their rivals were held to a 1-1 draw by Bosnia-Herzegovina.PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.After Beth Mead pulled a goal back from the visitors with a crisply converted penalty shortly before the break, Wiegman made changes in the second half and England went close when a long‑range Williamson strike was tipped over the crossbar and Lucy Bronze headed wide from a Mead cross, before the Brighton youngster Agyemang – who is on loan with the Sussex club from Arsenal – introduced herself to the national team in style.Wiegman praised the debutant’s strike, saying: “She came in and did really well. She scored an incredible goal, the composure she has and the calmness. I think we do have to celebrate that a little for her. We haven’t done now because overall we are disappointed, but that was really good.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's Nations LeagueEngland women's football teamBelgium women's football teamWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Meteorologists at the National Hurricane Center had been watching it building for a week, as it moved away from Nicaragua, up past Grand Cayman, Cancún, and Cuba, and the governor of Georgia, Brian Kemp, had declared a state of emergency on the Tuesday afternoon.“The current forecast for Hurricane Helene suggests this storm will impact every part of our state,” Kemp said, but in Augusta, over in the east of the state, people felt safe, they had not had a hurricane here in almost 100 years, and this one was forecast to pass it by.McIlroy claims accepting ‘heartbreak’ at Masters can aid Augusta pursuitRead moreUntil it took a turn north‑northeast, and started to accelerate. It hit the city at a hundred miles an hour, the anemometers at Augusta airport stopped working at 82mph, right around the time the power went down. “Augusta ended up sitting under the absolute worst part of the storm,” reported the National Weather Service. It was not just the wind – more than 12 inches of rain, an entire winter’s worth, fell in the space of a few hours. People talk about how the pop-and-flash of the power lines going down lit up the sky.When it was over, more than 30 people had died in the city and the surrounding counties, 11 people were killed by falling trees, which crushed cars, trailers, and houses, and many more of cardiac and respiratory failure during the power outage that followed, often because their medical equipment could not function, 362 homes were destroyed, more than 3,000 suffered what was described as “major damage”.Six months on,the city is still recovering. The authorities have had to clear almost 3m cubic yards of debris from the city streets, and the work is still going on in the suburbs, especially out by Tobacco Road. In the streets around Augusta National, the fences are gap-toothed, the panels cracked and scattered, and giant rootballs, ripped out of the ground, squat on front lawns like Brobdingnagian dust balls, plenty of houses are still under tarpaulins, the entire process has been slowed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s decision to cut off relief funding in February.View image in fullscreenA tree on top of a building in Augusta in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.Photograph: Joe Raedle/Getty ImagesIn years gone by, Augusta has often seemed ambivalent about the National golf club, which sits up on the hill just outside the centre. But it was glad to have it now. In the days immediately after the Hurricane, the club pumped money into the city, culminating in a $5m donation to local relief aid. The chair, Fred Ridley, has done a good job of improving relations with the local community. His big announcement this year was about the redevelopment of the municipal golf course, The Patch, and the establishment of a new community education centre, both in partnership with Tiger Woods.“I’m most proud of how our organisation pitched in with the Augusta community and really helped out because there were many, many people, many of our people were out of their homes for a number of weeks,” Ridley said. “No electricity, no water for a while.”People remember who was there when the city needed help, which local restaurants were the ones to start handing out free hot meals and which stores were the ones to put up the prices of badly needed essentials. Ridley made sure that Augusta National played its part, and it has been rewarded for it with renewed goodwill this spring, when most locals are happy to have it back.There is a stark contrast with the club’s reaction after the ice storm that hit the city in 2014, when the biggest worry was how the 17th was going to play after the Eisenhower Tree fell down.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Stand outside the clubhouse now and you can see all the way through to the 15th green, and from the 11th tee-box, you can even see right over into the Augusta Country Club next door. Even Gary Player, who has been coming here for the best part of 70 years, can’t recall the last time that was possible. Their guess is that at least a few hundred fallen trees had to be removed from the property. They have put in plenty of new ones, but they’re still growing.It means the course will play a little differently this year.“There are a couple of tee shots that are maybe a little less visually intimidating now,” Rory McIlroy said. On the 10th, for instance, players tend to shoot for the camera tower down at the bottom of the hill. “You used to not be able to see it, but now you can see that pretty clearly, which means visually it looks like you don’t have to turn the ball as much as you used to.” On the 3rd, there is more room up the right side, “where a couple of the overhanging trees aren’t there any more.” It may even open up a couple of shots. “I have heard a few things. Somebody did tell me you can hit a high cut over the cabins on 10,” said Jon Rahm. “I don’t believe it.”You notice it on the 1st most of all, the opening shot passes by a line of eight new trees in between three or four that made it through the storm. They’re snaggled and toothpick skinny, their upper reaches sheared clean by the wind, a lasting reminder that there are some things beyond even Augusta National’s control.Explore more on these topicsThe MastersPGA TourGolfUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

If they were difficult decisions I could live with this coincidence … but when its three or four yards [onside].“I wouldn’t say they are the most difficult so why send him to Leeds games. I don’t think he intends it but he needs protection. Promotion to the Premier League is such a big reward, we are playing for so many millions of pounds.”Middlesbrough hope to secure such riches via the playoffs but securing a place seems touch and go for a side that slipped to sixth after Leeds swiftly undid Michael Carrick’s high defensive line.If Junior Firpo’s initial through pass was good, Manor Solomon’s expert dodging of Anfernee Dijksteel bewildered the rest of Boro’s backline. The resultant confusion left a stretching James to evade his supposed marker, Samuel Iling-Junior and flick the resultant low, hard, cross beyond Mark Travers.View image in fullscreenDan James (centre right) shows his delight after scoring Leeds’ winner.Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PAThe Tees glistened in glorious April sunshine when Leeds arrived at the Riverside and the travelling fans waiting to greet them muttered nervously about a demoralising run of one win in the previous six games.By now though darkness had descended and, menacing almost every time he touched the ball, visiting nerves were soothed as James sensed real opportunity. With the Wales winger repeatedly unwinding his sprinter’s legs Travers did well to prevent him scoring a second.Boro had registered five wins in their previous seven games but, despite enjoying plenty of possession Leeds allowed them to have the ball in areas where, initially at least, they could do minimal damage.Admittedly Tommy Conway did turn the ball beyond Karl Darlow, once again preferred to Illan Meslier in goal, from close range after meeting the fall out from a miscued corner but that effort was correctly disallowed for offside.In marked contrast, Tanaka had cause to feel wronged after directing Solomon cross’s past Travers only to see his celebrations ended abruptly by a faulty offside call.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Hackney’s ability to pass quickly with pace and urgency began threatening the Leeds defence as he brought the best out in Delano Burgzorg and Finn Azaz, creating chances for both forwards.Farke responded by turning to his bench and, with his first touch, Bamford slide the ball into the back of the net at the end of a fine counter-attack involving fellow substitutes Isaac Schmidt and Wilfried Gnonto.If Bamford thought that scoring against a former clubs would mark the end of almost 12 injury blighted months he was wrong as that assured finish was ruled out for offside. Once again replays showed it was the wrong decision.The good news is that he appeared fit and sharp. Farke believes that the loss of his No 9 to a knee injury at the Riverside almost exactly a year ago cost his team promotion. Maybe, just maybe, Bamford has returned at the right moment to help Leeds over the line this time.Explore more on these topicsChampionshipMiddlesbroughLeeds Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

To the Premier League and beyond is the mission, no longer being the second city’s second wheel.Chris Davies, a rookie manager – though someone football insiders will point to as a significant power behind the thrones of Brendan Rodgers and Ange Postecoglou – could celebrate promotion at first time of asking.“This club has suffered a lot,” he said. “It’s about creating memories, bringing fans joy and making them proud of their club.”Birmingham’s aptitude for the task of returning to the Championship has been apparent since early season and spending £25m on 17 new players. A record League One points total remains possible, too. Now for Wembley, the Vertu Trophy final on Sunday, again againstPeterborough, the chance to complete a lower league double. After that, controls are set for the heart of the sun.“We signed good characters,” Davies said. “I think for too long this club had players that weren’t the right character. Whether we win, lose or draw, you’ll always see this lot fighting. That’s what the fans ultimately want for their club.”Echoes of 30 years ago, of Paul Tait’s Autowindscreens Shields Trophy winner with an estimated 50,000 City fans at Wembley, Barry Fry was Blues manager. Fry – the ever ebullient, archetypal wheeler-dealer – is, at 80, still Peterborough’s director of football. The club he joined from the Blues in 1996 will defend the Vertu Trophy at Wembley, where they have never lost. His former club’s fans gave him a rousing reception during a pre‑match promenade.View image in fullscreenBirmingham City players celebrate promotion after their hard-fought win at Peterborough.Photograph: Joe Giddens/PAWith Wembley in mind, Davies – the antithesis of last season’s disastrous dalliance with Wayne Rooney – had rested Jay Stansfield, whose August signing for £15m from Fulham sent shockwaves across the EFL, as well as Marco Silva, who had made plans for the striker. At London Road there appeared to be no appetite for a pre-Wembley détente; instead, an open contest, both teams looking to attack.Krystian Bielik, the Blues captain, thrashed an effort wide with the entire goal to aim at but soon enough, in the 20th minute, Alfie May headed in Taylor Gardner-Hickman’s cross to begin the party in the away end.View image in fullscreenBirmingham fans in full voice after securing promotion to the Championship.Photograph: Joe Giddens/PAThe travelling fans’ noise didn’t abate when Kwame Poku thrashed in an equaliser. That increased Birmingham’s concentration on the task in hand, as Tomoki Iwata and Marc Leonard gained control of midfield. Eventually, after a patient buildup, Gardner-Hickman from the left fired in a shot to which Nicholas Bilokapic could only get a hand.Tom Wagner, the venture capitalist majority City owner, was not present, and neither had the minority owner and chairman of the advisory boardTom Bradytravelled to Cambridgeshire. Presumably both, and special guests, will be at Wembley. Davies said: “What I do know is that we’ve got great owners that are extremely ambitious, but also very supportive and understand the challenges of the landscape of English football.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

News of a goal from third-placed Wycombe solidified the requirement of victory.With 15 minutes left, Stansfield replaced May, Davies seeking the cutting edge his team’s dominance had not produced. All the noise came from the west Midlands contingent attempting to kill their own nerves through song.There was defending to do, too, Ryan Allsop making a save from Sam Hughes’s header. Another substitute, Keshi Anderson, looked set to seal it but fired wide, leaving five minutes to play in which the veteran Grant Hanley came on to add defensive numbers.Eventually, gratefully, Birmingham reached their finish line, and the players could run to 3,379 away fans for a lengthy celebration ritual, including fizz-fuelled photo call.“These young men have had a lot of expectation and pressure,” Davies said, while the party raged on inside the dressing room. “In there they’re loving it.” The belief at Birmingham is that promotion, and Wembley, will be just the start.Explore more on these topicsLeague OneBirmingham CityTom BradyPeterboroughmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

He played for a then record 13 different teams, spending the most time with the Houston Astros between 2000 and 2004. His career high-point came when he was part of theSt Louis Cardinalsthat won the World Series in 2011. His final season in the majors was with the Detroit Tigers in 2013. Dotel was known as a strikeout pitcher and at his peak was one of the best relievers in the league.At least 58 people dead after roof collapse at Dominican Republic nightclubRead more“We are heartbroken to learn the tragic news that former Astros pitcher Octavio Dotel was one of several individuals that passed away when a roof collapsed in his native Dominican Republic last night,” the Astros said in a statement on Tuesday. “While in Houston, he was one of the top relievers in all of baseball and was a significant part of a dominant bullpen that included Hall of Famer Billy Wagner and All-Star Brad Lidge. A workhorse, Dotel’s club-leading 159 appearances in 2002-03 combined were second in the Majors in that span, during which he posted a 2.15 ERA.”During the Mets-Marlins broadcast on Tuesday afternoon, longtime Mets play-by-play announcer Gary Cohen said: “Everyone who ever met Octavio loved him.”Another Dominican baseball player, Tony Blanco, was killed in the collapse. He had briefly played for the Washington Nationals in 2005.Dotel overcame significant challenges on his way to the majors, including the death of his fatherwho was murdered during a robbery. Dotel said he used baseball as a way of keeping his mind off his father’s death. “I can do nothing if I go to the ballpark and think about him all the time,” Dotel said. “I just have to keep playing hard and get what I’m looking for. I think God helps me because I’m here. I’m here and I appreciate it. I would enjoy it more if my dad was still here, but everybody’s got to die.”Jet Set, the nightclub where Tuesday’s tragedy took place, says it is cooperating with authorities. “The loss of human life leaves us in a state of deep pain and dismay,” the nightclub said in a statement.Explore more on these topicsBaseballMLBSt Louis CardinalsHouston AstrosUS sportsDominican RepublicAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Not the weather, not a bomb – nothing,” Trump told the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, by video link in January. “And we have more coal than anybody.”Energy experts say any bump for coal under Trump is likely to be temporary because natural gas is cheaper and there is a durable market for renewable energy such as wind and solar power no matter who holds the White House.Environmental groups were scathing about the orders, pointing out that coal is in steep decline in the US compared with the increasingly cheap option of renewable energy. This year, 93% of the power added to the US grid will be from solar, wind and batteries, according toforecastsfrom Trump’s own administration.“What’s next, a mandate that Americans must commute by horse and buggy?” said Kit Kennedy, managing director of power at the Natural Resources Defense Council.“Coal plants are old and dirty, uncompetitive and unreliable. TheTrump administrationis stuck in the past, trying to make utility customers pay more for yesterday’s energy. Instead, it should be doing all it can to build the electricity grid of the future.”Clean energy, such as solar and wind, is now so affordable that 99% of the existing US coal fleet costs more just to keep running than to retire a coal plant and replace it with renewables, a2023 Energy Innovation report found.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationCoalRenewable energyArtificial intelligence (AI)Electric, hybrid and low-emission carsEnergy industryFossil fuelsnewsShareReuse this content"

In 1844 Ketill Ketilsson won the race to grab the last pair of great auks. They were nesting on Iceland’s Eldey Island. Millions of these penguin-like birds had been slaughtered for feather-stuffed quilts to keep Europe’s burgeoning human population warm. Ketilsson strangled the two but tripped over and broke their egg. Never mind, he won the reward being offered by museums in Copenhagen for the final specimens.A perverse market rule on species had been established: the rarer a species gets, the more valuable it becomes. It came too late for those who killed the last dodo, moa or Steller’s sea cow – but look at the money now going into resurrecting mammoths and thylacines.Extinction is forever but it is mostly ho-hum for the rulers of our age of materialism. In this world of commercial expedience, it can even be a worthy thing. In 1888 the Tasmanian parliament legislated a one-pound bounty on thylacine heads – more than 2,000 bounties were paid – in its successful bid to “extirpate” the species.The rate of loss of nature has accelerated ever since and in my short lifetime three-quarters of the world’s volume of wildlife has been eradicated, including most of the big specimens of human-edible fish.1:06Last chance: the extinction crisis this election is ignoring (series trailer) – videoThe Maugean skate is a contemporary headache.

So far the corporate lobbyists have managed to keep the big-party politicians subsidising the forest destruction even though primary schoolchildren, and the national minister for the environment, know that it is a prime cause of habitat loss and extinction.Then there’s coal and gas extraction driving an age of global heating and consequent worldwide extinctions. That includes coral bleaching. The corporate-dependent parties back more coalmines and gas extraction and promise cuts in the “green tape” which protects species – but their stand is not free of political risk.Millions of voters, especially young voters alarmed about their future in a nature-depauperate world, have turned to the Greens and green-minded independents to stop the rot.The new generation is very aware that things are worse than the conventional and co-opted commercial coverage makes out and is not comforted by the false government estimate that since 1788 “only 100” species of plants and animals have gone extinct.According to the Biodiversity Council’s Prof John Woinarski and the researcher Jess Marsh, 9,000 species of Australian insects may be extinct, including many “ghost extinctions” of species before they were discovered or described.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Minden Pictures/AlamyMonica Feria-Tinta is one of a growing number of lawyers using the courts to make governments around the world take actionBySamira ShackleTue 8 Apr 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 8 Apr 2025 10.48 EDTShareIn November 2024, Monica Feria-Tinta, a veteran of UN tribunals and the international criminal court, strode through a heavy black door into a Georgian building in London’s august legal district for a meeting about a tree in Southend. Affectionately known as Chester, the 150-year-old plane tree towers over a bus shelter in the centre of the Essex seaside town. The council wanted to cut it down and residents were fighting back – but they were running out of options. Katy Treverton, a local campaigner, had travelled from Southend to ask Feria-Tinta’s legal advice. “Chester is one of the last trees left in this part of Southend,” said Treverton, sitting at a large table in an airy meeting room. “Losing him would be losing part of the city’s identity.”Feria-Tinta nodded, deep-red fingernails clattering on her laptop as she typed. She paused and looked up. “Are we entitled to nature? Is that a human right? I would say yes. It’s not an easy argument, but it’s a valid one.” She recommended going to the council with hard data about the impact of trees on health, and how removing the tree could violate the rights of an economically deprived community. Recent rulings in the European court of human rights, she added, reinforced the notion that the state has obligations on the climate crisis. This set a legal precedent that could help residents defend their single tree in Southend. “It isn’t just a tree,” said Feria-Tinta. “More than that is at stake: a principle.”The meeting was just a tiny example of a much bigger shift in how law is being used to fight climate breakdown. Since the early 1980s, communities and campaigners have turned to the courts to fight back against polluting industries. But traditional environmental claims are geographically specific – as in West Virginia, say, whereresidents sued the chemical firmDuPont for failing to prevent toxic chemicals from leaking into their water supply. Climate litigation presents very different challenges. A vast number of actors are responsible for emissions, making it hard to establish legal responsibility, and often the worst harms occur in a different continent to the worst emissions. But in the last decade, a series of court cases around the world have sought to change the legal status quo. “It’s been a huge shift,” said Adam Weiss, chief programmes and impact officer at ClientEarth, an environmental law charity that has spearheaded this approach. “Judges now see the environmental issues we’re facing as existential, and have allowed the interpretation of human rights law to shift to grasp that.”Feria-Tinta is one of the pioneers of this change. In 2017, she worked on the first case to argue before an international court that state failings on the climate crisis were violating the human rights of a group of Indigenous people. The case was successful, and since then, hundreds of claimants around the world have made similar arguments. Feria-Tinta is “one of a small group that’s really engaged in thinking strategically about how to use the law as a tool to push for greater ambition on climate change and biodiversity”, says Margherita Cornaglia, a barrister specialising in climate and environmental justice.After the meeting with Treverton, Feria-Tinta explained to me how all of these grand legal debates related to Chester the tree. “It is not just that this tree is threatened, but that it’s valuable,” she said. “After the second world war we developed certain standards in human rights treaties because of the horrors humanity endured. But we separated what is human from nature. We are living in such a cataclysmic moment that only now are we realising how vital nature is for human beings. The law has to be reframed, rethought.”Many observers see the law as the last hope for preventing catastrophic climate change. “It seems to me all other avenues have been exhausted,” says Brett Christophers, professor at Uppsala University and the author of The Price is Wrong: Why Capitalism Won’t Save the Planet. “Governments and companies aren’t taking serious and significant action, but in theory, at least, both are beholden to the law.” This strategic shift also has limitations, since, put bluntly, states can ignore rulings made in faraway international courts (or, for that matter, in their own courts). Meanwhile, it is not just environmental groups who are embracing climate-related litigation. In the US, there has been a significant rise in cases filed by airlines, fossil fuel producers and even states arguing against the obligation to consider climate risk in their financial planning. Yet Feria-Tinta passionately believes in the power of the law to create change. As the world passes the grim benchmark of 1.5 degrees of global heating, can the law save us from environmental destruction?The barristers’ chambers grouped around the four Inns of Court in central London are the epitome of the British establishment. The buildings – courtyards with neatly manicured lawns, stone staircases and gothic masonry – resemble Oxbridge colleges and grand private schools, and many of the people who work there are graduates of these institutions.Feria-Tinta’s path was different. She grew up in Peru, the daughter of Indigenous parents who had migrated to the capital city, Lima, and become successful businesspeople. Although she occasionally visited her grandparents in the Andes, most of her early life was spent in Lima, which she describes as a “grey, concrete city”. Indigenous culture was part of the background of her life, but one step removed; her parents spoke Quechua at home, but she never learned to speak it. She couldn’t communicate fully with her grandmother, who refused to learn Spanish – the language of the colonisers.At school, Feria-Tinta excelled in debating and she ended up studying law at university. Soon after graduating, she was offered an exciting work opportunity, as an assistant producer on a British documentary about the political situation in Peru. She helped the team orchestrate interviews and set up shoots. By the time the programme aired in 1992, everything had changed. In April that year the president, Alberto Fujimori, dissolved Congress and began a brutal dictatorship. Political opponents were being persecuted. Facing the threat of jail time, torture or even death for her work on the film, Feria-Tinta fled to the UK in 1993 with the help of the documentary team. “It was difficult to accept that I’d become a refugee,” she told me. “Suddenly, I was at the very bottom of the social hierarchy. I was unprepared for that. Then I thought: OK, now what do I do?” She decided international law would be the best use of her training, and soon won a scholarship for a graduate degree at the London School of Economics.View image in fullscreen‘Painstakingly focused and intellectually very ambitious’ … Monica Feria-Tinta.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianAdjusting to life in Britain wasn’t easy; she was confused by people’s physical reserve and struggled to understand the accent. But these were small complaints. “I understand what it is to live in fear,” she said. “This was an opportunity to be alive, and I took it seriously.” She spent hours at London’s many free museums and public libraries and developed an enduring passion for English literature – her conversation is full of references to writers such as Alfred Tennyson, William Blake and Virginia Woolf. After graduating from LSE, she spent the next decade and a half working in international courts in Strasbourg, The Hague, Latin America and elsewhere. In 2014, she qualified as a barrister and won a pupillage at the London chambers Twenty Essex, where she is still based.Feria-Tinta’s interest in environmental law developed in the wake of the 2015 Paris agreement, when she found herself wondering how the treaty could be enforced. The agreement set out states’ obligations on the climate but it did not include any enforcement mechanism to ensure that they actually complied. “At Cop each year, states seemed happy to just chat, chat, chat, despite how critical the situation was,” she said. “I wondered whether the old frameworks could be used to address it.”Human rights law is broadly individualistic – to win a claim, someone has to show that their particular rights are being violated by a state, corporation or other entity. Environmental destruction tends to have more diffuse causes and effects. But in the aftermath of the Paris agreement, a fierce debate broke out among lawyers and scholars about whether international courts could be used to pursue climate justice – and if so, how.In 2018, Feria-Tinta entered the fray with a paper arguing that even specific human rights agreements, and other longstanding, binding treaties such as the Law of the Sea, could apply to the climate crisis. “Treaties are living instruments – they have to be interpreted in light of modern developments,” she told me. Using apparently narrow treaties to build legal cases about climate change would prove to be an influential idea. But the only way to find out if it would work was to test the principle in court.The year before Feria-Tinta published her paper, Sophie Marjanac was living in her native Australia and working for ClientEarth, a legal charity focused on the environment. Her first job after university had been working on indigenous land rights on the Torres Strait, an archipelago off the northern coast of Australia. From the mid-2000s, tidal surges had sent flood water crashing over the inhabited islands, destroying graves and leaving human remains washed up on the land. Rising sea levels had led to saltwater seeping into the soil and poisoning coconut trees. Coastal erosion and flooding had decimated other crops.For years, islanders had campaigned for help from the Australian government. They wanted funding for seawalls and other coastal defence measures, and they wanted Australia to address the root problem by setting more ambitious targets for reducing emissions. But nothing was changing. Marjanac, who had stayed in touch with elders on the islands, hit on the idea of arguing that climate breakdown was violating the islanders’ human rights.At first glance, it was not a promising strategy: there was no successful precedent in the international courts. But the timing, at least, was good. Several similar cases had recently been brought in domestic courts around the world in what legal experts now call the “rights turn” in climate litigation. In 2015, a district courtin the Netherlandsruled that the Dutch government had an explicit duty to protect the human rights of the Dutch population against climate breakdown and to reduce emissions. The same year, thePakistani high courtruled that the government had violated citizens’ constitutional rights by not upholding its climate policy. Marjanac reasoned that if international courts made similar findings – that states have a legal duty to tackle the climate emergency – it could have a significant global impact.In the autumn of 2018, ClientEarth contacted Feria-Tinta to ask whether she would act on behalf of the Torres Strait islanders. The team decided to bring a case before the UN Human Rights Committee, which monitors compliance with a specific treaty, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights – one of the courts of limited jurisdiction that Feria-Tinta believed could be used for this purpose. But there were many reasons to think the case might fail. Back in 2005, an Inuit activist had filed a similar claim against the US, arguing that global heating was melting the Arctic and violating the inhabitants’ human rights. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights had rejected the claim without considering it. “One of the things that the petitioner in that case said is that what starts in the Arctic doesn’t end in the Arctic,” Feria-Tinta said. “That really, really stayed in my brain.”As Feria-Tinta immersed herself in the islanders’ testimony, she found herself deeply moved. Feria-Tinta has two distinct modes: one is sharply rational, the other is emotionally attuned to the point of raw vulnerability. (During one of our conversations, she told me a story about watching a brood of newborn ducklings, gearing up to jump from their nest into the pond water far below. “Watching nature, you learn what courage is,” she said. “I thought: if a duck can do that, what can’t you do?” Her voice was steady as she recounted this, so it took me a moment to realise her eyes were streaming with tears.)View image in fullscreenDowar Islet and Waua Islet in the Torres Strait.Photograph: John Rainbird/AlamyFeria-Tinta brought a fresh perspective to the Torres Strait islanders’ case. Indigenous people have special status in international law, and having worked with these communities professionally and being intimately connected with them personally, she was able to build a powerful argument. “She really helped us think how to broaden [the case],” said Marjanac. “She talked about bringing in children to the claim, because the right to culture was something transmitted to young people – and if the islanders are forced to leave because of the climate crisis and rising seas, it’s a fundamental breach of culture.”In May 2019, the case was filed with the Human Rights Committee. The UN moves slowly at the best of times, and the committee faced pushback from the Australian government, which argued that climate breakdown was not the fault of any one state, and that Feria-Tinta’s interpretation of the treaty was incorrect. This approach was no surprise. Australia’s prime minister at the time, Scott Morrison, had once brandished a lump of coal in parliament as a sign of his commitment to the fossil fuel industry.In September 2022, three and a half years after the case formally began, the verdict was announced. The committee found that the Australian government had failed to adequately protect Torres Straits islanders against the adverse impacts of the climate crisis. The UN ordered the government to compensate people for the harms they had suffered and to take measures to secure their communities’ safe existence.Feria-Tinta was thrilled, not only for the islanders, but because of the possibilities the case opened. “It was the first time in international litigation that the question was, ‘Can a state be held responsible for lack of climate action?’” she recalled. “And the answer was ‘yes’.”In the five years between the inception of the Torres Strait case in 2017 and its conclusion in 2022, the field of climate litigation had transformed. In that time, the number ofclimate-releated casesgoing through courts had more than doubled. In 2023, theWorld Economic Forumidentified failure to mitigate climate breakdown as the biggest risk facing the planet, and suggested that the increase in litigation was a result of governments moving too slowly in the transition to net zero. Today, litigation is an integral part of the climate movement.Not everyone is happy about this shift. Recent judgments in the European court of human rights – such asa 2024 rulingin favour of a group of Swiss women who argued that their rights were being violated by their governments’ inadequate action on the climate – set a precedent that will have a sweeping impact on all European states, including the UK. Speaking to a British parliamentary committee soon after this ruling, Lord Sumption KC, a former supreme court justice, warned that such court decisions could limit national governments from making their own climate legislation. He was concerned that some of the interpretations were a stretch. “You can’t have moving goalposts and call it law,” he said.Within the climate movement, most agree that a variety of tactics – protest, political negotiation, lawsuits – are needed to force change. But some are concerned that litigation risks absorbing disproportionate time and funding. “Donors like litigation,” one campaigner told me, with a weary shrug. It’s not hard to see why: a victory can make a tangible difference and generate a torrent of good publicity. The2015 Dutch casespent years going through the courts – the government lost its final appeal in 2019 – but is credited with leading to a more stringent climate policy in the Netherlands and the phase-out of coal power stations. But litigation is also “slow, expensive and difficult”, says Catherine Higham, a senior policy fellow at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, and winning a legal battle is usually only the start of the story. Consider the Torres Strait, where three years after their moment of triumph, the islanders are still fighting for all the mitigation measures they were promised.In March 2025, a landmark trial began in Germany that shows the limitations and possibilities of this approach. A Peruvian farmer, Saúl Luciano Lliuya, is suing the German energy multinational RWE. His argument is that the company’s greenhouse gas emissions have fuelled global heating and accelerated glacial melt above his home town of Huaraz, Peru. This is despite the fact that RWE has never operated in Peru. The case has been extremely slow. First filed a decade ago, it is only just going to trial – but if it succeeds, it will open up a whole new avenue to hold major polluters accountable.Feria-Tinta believes deeply that progress can be achieved through the courts, even if that change is incremental. “The law is what we have,” she told me, firmly. Yet in our conversations, she made clear that her loyalty is to the courts rather than to any particular cause. “There’s nothing like a dictatorship to make you appreciate the rule of law,” she said. “Try to live without it and you realise how important it is.”This can lead to work that, to an outsider to the legal world, may seem odd. In her book,A Barrister for the Earth,which will be published later this month, Feria-Tinta discusses her work in 2019 on behalf of communities in West Timor affected by the Montara oil spill, one of the worst offshore oil platform accidents in history. Describing the “disturbing images” she saw of the aftermath of the spill, she writes that the quiet of her barristers’ chambers helped her “avoid becoming paralysed by the weight of it all”. Given this strong reaction, I was surprised when she later told me that even after she started working on groundbreaking climate crisis cases, she has acted on behalf of oil companies; in one case advising a company after an oil spill caused by a third party, in others advising on reputational risk or disputes.Feria-Tinta does not see this as contradictory to her climate work: it is simply the nature of her job. She is not an environmental campaigner but a barrister. As such, she is a firm advocate for the “cab rank” rule, a professional obligation that states that barristers cannot pick and choose their cases according to personal preference. “I will sometimes defend parties with whom I disagree completely,” Feria-Tinta said. “I can still argue their case within the limits of the law.” One reason she particularly values the cab rank rule, she told me, is because in Latin America, where it doesn’t exist, lawyers can be persecuted for representing certain clients, whereas in Britain the rule helps maintain a level of distance. (Even so, Feria-Tinta’s stance is not shared by all of her peers. In 2023 more than 100 lawyers, including more than 20 barristers, said they wouldno longer abide by the cab rank rulewhen it came to climate-related cases.)Feria-Tinta’s respect for the law does not amount to reverential conservatism: she wishes to change it from within. “She’s painstakingly focused and intellectually very, very ambitious,” said Jake White, head of legal at World Wide Fund for Nature. As her work repeatedly brought her into contact with people at the frontlines of climate disaster, she started to wonder if the legal system needs to change even more drastically – and to recognise the rights of nature itself.For a long time, even as an adult, Feria-Tinta felt disconnected from the natural world. It was through her long-term partner, Klemens Felder, who grew up in the Austrian Alps, that she began to develop an appreciation for nature. “I was oblivious – but he’s the kind of person to tell me, ‘Actually you’re not seeing this properly’,” she said. Learning to love the English landscape has been a way of connecting both with her adopted homeland and with Indigenous ideas about the interrelation of life on Earth.This personal transformation was under way when, in the summer of 2020, Feria-Tinta was asked to provide advice for a case against a mining company that had begun exploration in Ecuador’s Los Cedros forest. Spanning almost 5,000 hectares (12,000 acres), Los Cedros is home to an extraordinary variety of species – from fungi and orchids to snails, jaguars and bears – many of which cannot be found anywhere else.Feria-Tinta had worked on many cases involving mining in Latin America. But this one was unusual because there were no people in the area where mining was to take place – and therefore, no basis for a human rights claim. However, it happened that in 2008, Ecuador had become the first country in the world to recognise the rights of nature. Its constitution states that “nature, where life is reproduced and occurs, has the right to integral respect for its existence and for the maintenance and regeneration of its life cycles, structure, functions and evolutionary processes”.Sewage sleuths: the men who revealed the slow, dirty death of Welsh and English riversRead moreThe idea that nature could have legal rights has gathered pace in the 21st century. Bolivia and Panama have followed Ecuador’s lead, while other countries have passed laws awarding rights to natural entities. In 2017, the government of New Zealand passed legislation which recognised the Whanganui river as a legal person. In 2019, Bangladesh granted all its rivers the same status as humans, empowering the National River Conservation Commission to represent them. These rights of nature cases tend to focus on biodiversity, distinguishing them from strategic climate litigation, which uses the law to hold states and corporations to account for climate harm. But biodiversity and climate breakdown are closely interrelated. Forests, rivers and oceans sustain human life and absorb carbon emissions, even as rising temperatures threaten their survival.Awarding rights in principle is only one part of the battle; these rights also have to be protected on the ground. The Los Cedros case, which would be heard in the constitutional court of Ecuador, was going to test this principle. The mining company’s argument was that preventing them from going ahead would violate a trade agreement between Ecuador and Canada. Feria-Tinta had been asked to act as “amicus curiae”, providing expertise without acting on behalf of either party. As she worked on her brief, Feria-Tinta found herself thinking much more broadly about what the law is actually for. “Not that long ago, women were not considered legal persons,” she said. “In Europe, abstract entities – corporations, robots – can end up having rights. So what is the proper legal argument against a river or a forest being a legal entity?”In December 2021, Ecuador’s constitutional court delivered its verdict. The rights of nature, the court said, were not mere rhetorical statements, but “binding legal obligations”. The forest had won. It was a judgment that showed what is possible for the worldwide rights of nature movement.Los Cedros has, for now, been preserved. But the outcome of such cases is not always so clearcut, even after a positive court verdict. In 2017, India’s Ganges river was recognised as a legal person, but by 2023 pollution had continued to the extent that most of its water is undrinkable.The notion of trees or rivers having rights may seem distant from the UK. These ideas are most firmly established in countries with organised Indigenous communities, who see the Earth as a “single, interconnected organism”, as Feria-Tinta puts it in her book. “I suspect many British judges would roll their eyes if you tried to argue a forest should have rights,” said Will McCallum, co-executive director of Greenpeace UK. But even in Britain, there have been some developments on this front.A few years after the Los Cedros case, an environmental group in Sussex instructed Feria-Tinta to help them draft a charter for the river Ouse. Like many other rivers in the UK, the Ouse is polluted with effluent and wastewater. The charter they produced states that the Ouse is a living entity with eight specific rights, including the right to flow and the right to be pollution-free. In February 2025, Lewes district council passed the charter, making the Ouse the first river in the country to have legally recognised rights. The charter isn’t binding, and the next stage is for the council to work out how these rights can be implemented. And yet seeing this happen in her adopted country was emotional for Feria-Tinta. “I’ve come to love the rivers of England, which have been on this island long before any form of human life,” she said. “Rivers are places where civilisations began, and most people I have met around here want nature to be cherished.”View image in fullscreenThe Ouse near Lewes, East Sussex.Photograph: Peter Cripps/AlamyThe more cases she has worked on, the more Feria-Tinta has come to see commonalities in how seemingly very different communities relate to their natural environments. At the start of 2025, she finalised her legal advice about Chester, the tree in Southend that the council intended to chop down. She set out the council’s obligations on the climate under the European convention on human rights. As she drafted the document, she found herself thinking about the Salween river in Myanmar, where she had advised an Indigenous community fighting a dam project some years earlier. Both the tree in Essex and the river in Myanmar were seen by the authorities as expendable, rather than as living entities valued by the people around them. “Whether it’s a single tree, or a whole community depending on a river, what is at stake is the future of humanity,” she told me.A couple of months later, on a blustery day in early spring, I met Feria-Tinta in the village on the border of Surrey and Sussex where she now lives. Mud squelched underfoot as we walked through woodland, stepping over twisted tree roots, past banks of heather and marshy pools of water. “Back in 2016, I was one of the pioneers doing this [work], but now it’s become mainstream, and it’s a knowledge you can’t be without,” she said excitedly, reaching out a hand to help me climb over a tree felled by a recent storm. “We need everyone.”Listen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere.A Barrister for the Earth by Monica Feria-Tinta (Faber & Faber, £22).

The public were told to avoid the area, where emergency services remained on the scene.A team of investigators from the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) was also in attendance.In a statement, Derbyshire police said: “Two men have died after a light aircraft crashed at Darley Moor racetrack. The incident happened at about 11.30am today.“Emergency services remain at the scene, and we ask that the public avoid the area at this time. Family members of the two men have been made aware and our thoughts are with them at this difficult time.”In a statement, the AAIB said: “An accident in the Ashbourne area of Derbyshire involving a light aircraft has been notified to the AAIB. An investigation has been launched and a multidisciplinary team of inspectors are on their way to the accident site.”Flying restrictions are in place via an order signed by the transport secretary on Tuesday afternoon. It says that no aircraft can fly below 1,600ft (488 metres) over the Darley Moor area.The restrictions do not apply to any aircraft operating with the permission of the Derbyshire constabulary, the order said.A fire brigade spokesperson said: “Derbyshire Fire & Rescue Service was called to reports of an incident involving a light aircraft at Darley Moor racetrack at 11.25am.“Firefighters from Ashbourne, Wirksworth, Nottingham Road, Staveley and Staffordshire’s Uttoxeter attended the scene.“Fire service resources have since been scaled back, with fire crews from Ashbourne and Wirksworth remaining on scene supporting colleagues from Derbyshire constabulary.”On its website, the Darley Moor racetrack calls itself “a small friendly club that runs motorcycle road racing events … from March to October each year”.The BBC, reporting from the scene, said the crashed aircraft sat close to a wooded area of the racetrack and that bodies were being recovered from the scene.Explore more on these topicsDerbyshireEnglandAir transportnewsShareReuse this content"

A jury also found her guilty of manslaughter.Jurors deliberated for six hours and 46 minutes before unanimously convicting the pair of manslaughter. The boy had also been charged with an alternative count of murder, but was found not guilty by the jury.The teenagers, who were in the dock for the first time since their trial began, sat as the foreman of the jury returned the verdicts.Leicester crown court heard that Kohli suffered a broken neck and three broken ribs in the assault that happened on his daily dog walk, metres from his home in Braunstone Town, Leicestershire. Hedied in hospital the following day.He told a paramedic the boy had racially abused him and he had been pushed, punched and kicked.The jury was shown footage filmed by the girl of Kohli on his knees as the boy slapped him.Harpreet Sandhu KC, prosecuting, told the jury: “You heard that slap, you heard the slider making contact with Mr Kohli’s face. There was nothing for [the boy] to fear from an 80-year-old man who was on his knees. It was pure violence used by [the boy], pure violence encouraged by [the girl].“[The girl] made a noise. That noise was her laughing. She laughed as [the boy] assaulted Mr Kohli.”Sandhu said the girl had prior knowledge of what was about to happen. He said: “She knew there would be violence and she had a desire to capture it – and capturing it provided encouragement for the violence to be meted out.”The youth had no reason at all to hit Kohli, Sandhu said, adding that the boy’s actions had been “gratuitous violence against a man who was defenceless and a man who, because he was on the ground, was in a vulnerable position”.The court heard that the defendants, who cannot be named because of their age, were part of a group of five children in the park that evening. When they saw Kohli the girl told the group that the elderly man had tried to hit one of the boy’s friends with a stick.Only the two defendants approached Kohli and the others ran away. One later told police they did so because they thought the boy was “either going to start on him or be mean”.Jurors were read a letter the boy wrote while in custody in which he said he hated what he did. He wrote: “I regret it so much. I have flashbacks of that day and it just upsets me. I just want my freedom or even to go back and not do it.“I feel like my case is evil. I ain’t that type of person. I kinda just needed anger etc releasing.”He continued: “I feel like I have let my mum down so much. I am nervous, well scared and worried. I accept I did it and I am doing time. I am just scared about how long I have to do.”The prosecution said at no point in the letter did the boy say he was acting in self-defence or in someone else’s defence. When told the letter would have to be disclosed, he responded: “That’s my manslaughter plea gone.”The boy denied charges of murder and manslaughter. In a prepared statement he said he thought Kohli was about to hit the girl, so he ran over and fell on top of him.Kohli’s family said they were heartbroken by his death, describing him as a “loving, caring person whose life centred around his family”.In a statement released by Leicestershire police, Kohli’s daughter Susan Kohli said: “The boy, who told witnesses he had anger problems and couldn’t stop, used violence so severe that he broke three of Dad’s ribs and neck, which caused trauma to his spinal column.“Videos of the incident were filmed and shockingly found on the girl’s phone. Dad did not deserve this, and we wouldn’t wish this pain on anyone else … Hearing the girl laugh at this assault on Dad is utterly disgusting. This sound plays over and over in our heads.“Losing Dad in these cruel, violent and deeply shocking circumstances feels like our hearts have been pulled apart. We can’t put into words the pain we feel every day, and this has magnified during the trial.”The judge remanded the boy into custody and granted the girl bail, with sentencing adjourned until 20 May.Explore more on these topicsUK newsLeicestershireCrimenewsShareReuse this content"

Matthew recalls a family story: “She was managing the pen counter and one time she was demonstrating a lever filling mechanism and accidentally squirted ink all over a balding gentleman’s head. In her panic, she grabbed a duster and smeared it in as she tried to clean it off.”Matthew recalled how his grandfather would buy him gifts from the store when he was young, and how his father, Michael, who lived in flat above the shop, loved sneaking down to read comics. “WH Smith has not been the same for years,” Matthew said, “but it is these associations, and the life it offered, that we will continue to fondly remember.”‘It wasn’t just a workplace– it was a soundtrack to my teenage years’Ranjit was 16 when he got his first job working Saturdays at WH Smith in Warrington. “By sheer luck I landed in the coolest spot of all – the music department,” said Ranjit, now a 60-year-old lecturer who lives in Leeds.The staff chose which records were played in store and Ranjit found himself exposed to artists such as David Bowie and the Beatles. Soon his friends were eagerly requesting their favourite songs. “I quickly became the go-to DJ of my little corner of WH Smith. Watching my friends nod their heads, singing along to Depeche Mode or the Human League, was pure joy. For a teenager, that was as close to rock-star status as it got.”He worked there for two years before going to university, and earned £12 for a day’s work. “It felt like a small fortune,” he said. “Looking back, I’m filled with gratitude for those days. WH Smith wasn’t just a workplace – it was a soundtrack to my teenage years.”‘I stole a copy of Jimmy Osmond’s Long Haired Lover From Liverpool’For Jane in Cornwall, her memories of WH Smith are not as fond. Aged nine, she stole a copy of Long Haired Lover From Liverpool by Jimmy Osmond from the store on Tunbridge Wells’ high street. “It’s embarrassing,” said the 61-year-old writer. “I didn’t even have my own record player at the time so I don’t know why I did it – I must’ve heard the song on the radio.”When her parents were asleep, she recalls, she played the song on her father’s record player, but she “felt sick with guilt” the next day, snapped the vinyl into pieces and hid it in the garden. A few weeks later, her golden retriever dug up the shards.“I confessed and my parents made me tell the manager of WH Smith. He was suitably stern. My dad paid for the record but I had to wash his car for years to repay the debt incurred. I still feel a degree of shame when passing a store.”‘I always have to go inside aSmithsto breathe in its smell’In 1985, Lucy wanted a Saturday job, so she wrote speculative letters to high street shops such as Boots, Marks & Spencer and WH Smith. “Smiths got back to me and offered me a job – I was 15,” said the now 55-year-old teacher from Sussex.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I’ll have to get my fix at stations, I suppose.”‘Working atSmithswas a formative part of my career’View image in fullscreenJohn Haslam.Photograph: John Haslam/Guardian CommunityJohn Haslam, 45, said he was “terrified of the public” when he applied to work at the Altrincham branch of WH Smith after leaving university aged 21. “I soon learned the importance of simply being kind to customers, and for a natural introvert that’s still how I strike up conversation with strangers,” said Haslam, the chief executive of a credit union, from Sale, Greater Manchester.Haslam worked there for two years and feels the skills he learned remain a “formative” part of his career. “I get up and speak to large groups of people now and Smiths was probably the start of helping me be able to do that,” he said.‘Whenever I see anything related to The Lord of the Rings, I’m transported back’One of Matthew’s memories is of picking up a new pencil case, pencils, rubber and ruler every September before the new school term. “Years later I’d buy my first Parker fountain pen – immediately seduced by its smooth, silky writing style,” said Matthew, 45, who is from Enfield and lives in Barcelona. “I still have that pen today and use it to write birthday and Christmas cards.”But it was the “cavernous yet cosy” basement where he spent most of his time browsing books, regularly spending his birthday and Christmas book tokens on teen series such as Adrian Mole and Point Horror. “WH Smith was one of the only places in my neighbourhood where I could buy books,” said Matthew, who works as a translator.He was 16 when he bought his last book from the store, JRR Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings. “I read it that same summer during lunch breaks while working at a factory and the volume still occupies a proud place on my bookshelves. To this day, whenever I see a film, episode or other content related to Tolkien’s creation, I’m transported back to the welcoming vault of treasures inside the WH Smith in Enfield.”Explore more on these topicsWH SmithRetail industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Additionally, the implementation period has been doubled to a maximum of four years for an assisted dying service to be in place.The legislation argues that someone in England and Wales who is terminally ill, with less than six months to live, should be legally allowed to end their life, as long as it has been approved by two doctors and an expert panel.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsAssisted dyingHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

She also referenced an incident in May 2023 when Harry and Meghan were involved in a “dangerous car pursuit with paparazzi in New York City”.The grounds of the appeal were that the judge had erred in his conclusion there was “good reason” to depart from Ravec’s terms of reference and that Ravec could properly decide that the duke was not within the “other VIP” category without procuring the analysis of the RMB, she said. The judge had also erred by concluding Harry was not in an analogous position to those in the category.The core question raised by this appeal is whether Ravec has given a “clear, logical and convincing reason” for failing to do an RMB assessment, she said. “The answer to that question is no.”Sir James Eadie KC, for theHome Office– which has legal responsibility for Ravec - said Harry’s appeal involved a “continued failure to see the wood for the trees, advancing propositions available only by reading small parts of the evidence, and now the judgment, out of context and ignoring the totality of the picture”.It was not that personal security of the kind previously provided would under no circumstances be provided, rather that “security would not be provided on the same basis as before” because of his change in status to no longer being a working royal and living abroad.Eadie said in written submissions no RMB was done “because [Harry] instead has had created for him and his particular circumstances a bespoke, individualised, decision-making process which considers what is appropriate and justified by way of protective security in relation to each visit he wishes to undertake to Great Britain”.The previous judge could accept “bespoke was better suited” and the duke would be “better served by that approach”.He said Sir Richard Mottram, the then chair of Ravec, had noted that an RMB assessment would be “difficult to produce in an effective manner”. Mottram had been provided with updated threat assessments of various kinds specific to the duke which informed his understanding of risk. “This approach was at all times a matter for the expert judgment of Ravec and the judge was right to find that it was lawful.”Eadie said “bare disagreement” with the previous ruling and the Ravec decision, was the “gravamen” – or essence – of Harry’s complaint, and “does not amount to a ground of appeal”.The appeal court hearing before Sir Geoffrey Vos, Lord Justice Bean and Lord Justice Edis is due to be heard over two days with a decision expected at a later date.In February 2020, Ravec decided that the duke and his family should receive a different degree of taxpayer-funded protection when in the country, after they moved to the US.After Harry took legal action the following year, the high court heard in 2023 that an offer from Harry to pay for security himself had been refused, with the duke’s lawyers claiming he “does not feel safe” when visiting under the new security arrangements.The case continues on Wednesday, when some of the evidence will be heard in private due to security concerns.Explore more on these topicsPrince HarryHome OfficenewsShareReuse this content"

Then Lowry wrote back to him saying: ‘I think I’ve charged you too much. Can I give you another one as well?’ So Grandpa got two Lowrys for his £10.”Going to the Mill, the painting that caught Arthur Wallace’s eye, is now coming to auction for the first time since that generous exchange, after the Wallace family finally decided to part with it.The rare early work, which is to be sold by Lyon & Turnbull in London at the beginning of May, is a preliminary depiction of what would become Lowry’s classic subject, said Simon Hucker, a fine art specialist at the auctioneer.“That mill and the chimney behind, the domed roof and then the wall of windows – he will paint that view for the next three decades. This is his subject and the little figures all scurrying towards a door, like water pouring towards a drain.”What is especially rare is for a painting such as this to have had only one owner, Hucker added. A work of similar size and date sold from HSBC’s collection last year went for £1.2m, and the estimate for Going to the Mill is £700,000 to £1m.View image in fullscreenLS Lowry (pictured) remained in touch with the Guardian’s former literary editor, Arthur Wallace.Photograph: Robert Smithies/The GuardianAs a child, Keith Wallace ate family dinners overlooked by the Lowry. “By the time I was a lad of eight, we kept it in the dining room, so we’d see it every evening over dinner and it was probably a bit grubby by then.”It remained on his mother’s wall, “uninsured and unsecured”, until the family arranged a long-term loan to the Pallant House Gallery in Chichesterin 2013, allowing the public to view it for the first time in more than 80 years.Keith’s father sold the other work that Lowry gave to his grandfather “to pay for my two sisters’ weddings”, he said.Arthur and Lowry remained in touch in later years, and Arthur’s retirement book from the Guardian included “a nice letter from Lowry saying ‘so sorry to hear you’re retiring through ill health’,” said Keith.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was well before he was able to sell any work to any public gallery. He was very much struggling, and so we Wallaces like to think that at the very least [the sale to Arthur] gave him a bit of a boost and encouraged him to keep on painting.”Hucker said it was possible to trace the development of Lowry’s signature style from Going to the Mill. “As he went on it becomes a little bit more stylised – that famous white background with black figures on – but here you’ve still got the sooty grey background which is a little more impressionistic, a little more realistic.”The more you examine the work, the more you discover, he said. “Initially, you see this sweeping movement of the crowd and a great mass of people. But when you look more closely you see that they’re all individuals.“There’s the woman standing alone looking out at us, in the style ofSeurat, drawing the viewer into the lives of others, or the man carrying what seems like a large portfolio, who could be Lowry himself.”Lowry was immortalised in popular culture through the one-hit-wonder pop song Matchstalk Men and Matchstalk Cats and Dogs by the folk duo Brian and Michael, released in late 1977 as a tribute to the artist who had died the previous year.“But he’s much more sophisticated than that,” said Hucker. “This idea that he’s a naive painter who can’t paint any better … god, he can paint, he’s a proper impressionist. These people are not caricatures – he can give you the impression of a man with a couple of strokes at the brush. In these little tiny figures you get a lot of story, and that’s his genius.”Explore more on these topicsLS LowryPaintingArtManchesterNorth of EnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Canada launched abuy Canadiancampaign in response to a 25% US tariff on Canadian imports.During Treasury questions on Tuesday, the Lib Dems’ deputy leader and Treasury spokesperson, Daisy Cooper, asked the government to “commit to a ‘buy British’ campaign as part of a broader national effort to encourage people to buy British here at home”.Reeves replied: “In terms of buying British, I think everyone will make their own decisions. What we don’t want to see is a trade war, with Britain becoming inward-looking, because if every country in the world decided that they only wanted to buy things produced in their country, that is not a good way forward.”The prime minister’s spokesperson backed Reeves and said there were no plans for the government to launch a buy British campaign. He said the government “will always back British manufacturers” but it was up to individuals to decide what they wanted to buy.Asked if the government would advise people to avoid US products, he said that would not be consistent with Britain being an “open, trading nation” and the government was “not going to tell people where they buy their stuff”.He said: “That is something the prime minister and the chancellor have previously said, and we want to see fewer trade barriers around the world, such that we’re continuing to support our economy. At the same time, we also continue to prioritise and support British manufacturers, British producers.“We have a significant programme of support, whether it’s farmers, whether it’s manufacturers, as yesterday withsupporting the car industry. So, we can take a two-pronged approach. We can be an open trading nation whilst also supporting British producers and manufacturers.”Cooper said Reeves’s comments were “an insult to businesses being pushed to the brink by Donald Trump’s trade war”. She said: “This is completely out of touch with the British people who are rallying behind local businesses in their time of need.“Instead of talking down our high streets, the government needs to send a clear message to the White House that they stand squarely behind British businesses and against Trump’s damaging tariffs. Buying British is a powerful way that people can get behind local businesses and show that as a country we won’t give in to Donald Trump’s bullying.”Reeves fronted a plan to “make, buy and sell more in Britain”in 2021when Labour was in opposition, promising to award more public contracts to British businesses and pass a law requiring public bodies to report on how much they are buying from British businesses including small and medium-sized enterprises.No 10 said the government did want to move towards more British procurement. “We already have got significant ambitions to ensure that we’re supporting British industry,” the spokesperson said. “Obviously, I can’t get ahead of procurement rules and all of that, but it is important that the government is using its weight as a procurer to support British industry, and that will definitely be part of our agenda.“There’s a lot of work across government to ensure we’ve got the most active, effective state possible that is supporting the economy, that is delivering value for money for taxpayers. We’re always going to back British manufacturers and producers whilst also ensuring that we’re an open trading nation that is exporting around the world.”Explore more on these topicsEconomic policyRachel ReevesTrade policyLabourTrump tariffsManufacturing sectorRetail industrynewsShareReuse this content"

In the recent past, we’ve signed agreements with Australia, the UAE, with Oman, and we’re looking forward to concluding the bilateral trade agreement with the UK, negotiating also with the EU,” she said. “I think that’s the way the world is going.”Asked whetherDonald Trump’s tariffs had created more urgencyin the UK-India trade talks, Sitharaman said the negotiations had been going on for “a very long time” and that it was “not as if we are rushing into a UK FTA because of what is going on in the US”.But, she added: “We hope that [with] the new government showing a great deal of commitment and enthusiasm to have this agreement signed, we will be in a position to sign it sooner rather than later.”Sitharaman said the world was increasingly multipolar with many competing powers, which had created “a rapidity with which countries are talking to each other and seeing if they can come up with something, an arrangement”.India has historically been one of the world’smost protectionist countries, with a focus on self-sufficiency over opening up for international trade. When Modi came to power he promised to boost India’s already rapid growth byliberalising its economic and trade policy.Nonetheless, Delhi has often taken a cautious approach towards trade deals. An agreement signed last spring with the European Free Trade Association, made up of Norway, Switzerland, Iceland and Liechtenstein, took 16 years to negotiate.UK ministers are accelerating trade negotiations with the world’s fifth-largest economy, which have been happening since January 2022, in hopes ofmitigating the impact of US tariffs. Reeves will meet Sitharaman for talks on Wednesday, withthe UK and India pursuing a bilateral investment treaty in parallel to a free trade agreement.Reeves said ahead of the talks that “in a changing world, this government is accelerating trade deals with the rest of the world to back British business and provide the security working people deserve”.She and Sitharaman are expected to hold a working dinner on Wednesday night, which may also be attended by Keir Starmer.Sitharaman said in London that the discussions would touch on “successfully concluding the investment treaty”, mutual recognition of professional qualifications and collaboration on science and technology.She said the two countries would also discusshigher education. “There was a time when the first choice for Indian higher education seekers was UK, but gradually it came down,” she said. “You see Indians discuss prioritising the United States rather than UK … That momentum will have to be regained.”There have been reports of tensions between the Home Office and Department for Education over graduate visas which allow international students to stay in the UK for two years after completing their degrees, even if they are not working.Ministers are drawing up policies to reduce legal migration into the UK and aretargeting graduate visasamid government concerns they are being abused. However, the education department is said to be anxious about the impact this would have onthe beleaguered university sector.Jonathan Reynolds, the trade secretary, is also due to take part in talks with India on Wednesday. He travelled to India last monthto formally relaunch trade negotiations under Labour.As part of the negotiations, the UK has asked for lower tariffs on goods such as cars and whisky, and increased access for British lawyers and financial services companies to the Indian market. In return, India has asked for faster and easier processing arrangements for its companies to send workers to the UK.One sticking point has been Delhi’s concern that Indians working temporarily in the UK on business visas have to pay national insurance, despite not being eligible for UK pensions or social security benefits.Explore more on these topicsIndiaTrump tariffsRachel ReevesInternational tradeTrade policyGlobal economyTariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

She said that if the evidence does not support deportation, she may rule on Friday on his release from immigration detention.Khalil, a green-card holder and leader in the pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University last year,was detained on 8 March. The Trump administration claims that his presence has adverse foreign policy consequences, an argument decried by his legal team as a blatant free speech violation. The government has not provided any evidence that he broke the law, a typical condition for revoking permanent residency.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) can “either can provide sufficient evidence or not”, said the judge, Jamee Comans, from her courtroom in Jena,Louisiana. “If he’s not removable, I’m going to terminate this case on Friday.”‘We will persist’: Mahmoud Khalil’s wife says pro-Palestinian voices won’t be silencedRead moreA lawyer for DHS told the judge: “We have evidence we will submit.”During the hearing, Khalil sat beside an empty chair, his immigration attorneys and counsel appearing over video on a flatscreen TV. Behind him sat a handful of supporters, some of whom had been directed by security to remove keffiyehs. Khalil, in navy blue detention-issued clothes, sat calmly, sometimes fingering a set of prayer beads.The proceedings were delayed as Comans tried to pick the attorneys out of the nearly 600 people – media, supporters and observers – attempting to join the video call.“This is highly unusual,” began Comans, in reference to the number of people attempting to watch the hearing.“Your honor, I’d appreciate it if you could let my wife in,” Khalil said softly into the microphone. A moment later, the face of Khalil’s wife,Noor Abdalla, appeared on the screen.“Your honor, there is obviously a lot of public interest in this case, and we would appreciate if there could be online access” granted to the public, began Khalil’s immigration lawyer, Mark Van Der Hout. Comans denied this request and added, seeming frustrated, that she was “very, very close” to making the rest of the legal team appear in person as well.Van Der Hout said they had requested DHS’s evidence of the allegations more than two weeks ago and had not received a response. “We cannot plead until we know the specific allegations,” he added.Mahmoud Khalil says his arrest was part of ‘Columbia’s repression playbook’Read moreThe DHS also alleges that Khalil failed to disclose on his visa application that he had previously worked in a Syrian office of the British embassy and for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), before becoming a member of a pro-Palestinian activist group at Columbia.Van Der Hout requested to postpone a follow-up hearing Comans had set for Friday, noting: “We may have to depose the secretary of state” due to the nature of the charges against Khalil.Comans declined, telling him: “You’re in the wrong court for that.” Indicating she wanted to move the case along, she added: “I’m like you, Mr Van Der Hout: I’d like to see the evidence.”Apart from his immigration case, Khalil is challenging his detention in a separate case before afederal judge in New Jersey.Explore more on these topicsMahmoud KhalilTrump administrationLaw (US)US immigrationUS politicsLouisiananewsShareReuse this content"

There has been an unprecedentedUS militarybuildup across the Middle East in recent weeks, and Trump’s decision to make the talks public looks designed to press Iran to negotiate with urgency.The US delegation to the talks will be led by Steve Witkoff, Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East, who has also been involved in talks with Russia over the Ukraine war; and the Iranian side by its foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi. Witkoff’s efforts to broker peace between Israel and Hamas and between Russia and Ukraine have so far failed.Iran had in public been stalling about talks, saying simply that it was prepared for indirect talks with the US, but had not yet received a formal response from the US as to whether talks were going ahead. In a post on X issued some hours after Trump used an Oval Office press conference to reveal the agreement to stage weekend talks, Araghchi described the talks as an opportunity and a test. He insisted the ball was in the US’s court.Trump says US ‘having direct talks’ with Iran over nuclear dealRead moreSpeaking during a visit to Algiers, Araghchi elaborated that Iran wanted indirect talks. He said: “The form of negotiations is not important, whether they are direct or indirect. In my opinion, what is important is whether the negotiations are effective or ineffective, whether the parties are serious or not in the negotiations, the intentions of the parties in the negotiations, and the will to reach a solution. These are the criteria for action in any dialogue.”He added Iran had not agreed on any formula that would allow indirect talks to convert into direct talks, but the US expects the talks to evolve into a direct negotiation. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, has vetoed direct talks in protest at US sanctions and in deference to hardliners that believe talks with the US over Tehran’s nuclear programme are a political trap.The former Iranian president Hassan Rouhani welcomed the news of the talks and said if the 2015 nuclear deal was conducted indirectly it would have taken 20 years and not two to conclude.Trump pulled out of that deal – known as the joint comprehensive plan of action – during his first term. That deal had offered Iran sanctions relief in exchange for limitations on its uranium enrichment activities.Iran is waiting to see if Trump will be content if the talks focus on a new system of surveillance of its civil nuclear programme, not dissimilar to the treaty from which Trump withdrew the US in 2018; or instead the US will seek to dismantle Iran’s entire nuclear programme, a step that increasingly has been referred to as the Libya option. In December 2003, Libya’s longtime leader Muammar Gaddafi renounced the country’s weapons of mass destruction programme and allowed international inspectors to verify that Tripoli would follow through on its commitment.Speaking alongside Trump in the Oval House on Monday, Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, advocated the Libya option, but Iran insists it will not abandon its civil nuclear programme. Israel ultimately does not trust Iran and expects the talks to fail. It then favours a US-Israeli military strike to destroy Iran’s nuclear sites.But Witkoff, in an interview with Tucker Carlson three weeks ago, suggested Trump’s demands of Iran may be relatively modest. He said Trump, in his letter seeking talks with Iran, had said: “We should clear up the misconceptions. We should create a verification programme so that nobody worries about weaponisation of your nuclear material. And I’d like to get us to that place because the alternative is not a very good alternative. That’s a rough encapsulation of what was said.”But Trump is under pressure to reach an agreement that is more watertight than the agreement reached by Barack Obama in 2015.Previewing Iran’s position in the talks, Araghchi said: “Iran’s nuclear programme is completely peaceful and legitimate. UN security council resolution 2231 has just confirmed its legitimacy. There is no doubt about it internationally. If anyone has any questions or ambiguities, we are ready to clarify. We are confident that our nuclear programme is peaceful and we have no problem building more confidence into this unless it creates a limitation for us or is an obstacle to Iran’s goals.”Iran has always insisted a fatwa exists against building nuclear weapons, but senior Iranian politicians, faced by a series of military reversals, have increasingly challenged that.Iran also faces the threat that Trump has set a two-month deadline – expiring in May – for the talks to achieve an outcome. Iran, being a consummate negotiator, may test Trump’s patience, especially if Witkoff eventually demands its ballistic weapons programme and financial support for militant forces is also put on the agenda.A February report by the International Atomic Energy Agency found that Iran’s stockpile of uranium enriched to 60% purity had increased sharply since December. Experts say that reaching 90% enrichment – the threshold for weapons-grade material – is relatively easy from that point. As of 8 February, Iran’s 60%-enriched uranium stockpile had grown by 92.5kg over the previous quarter, reaching 274.8kg. Iran says the stockpile is a response to US sanctions.Explore more on these topicsIranDonald TrumpNuclear weaponsUS militaryMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It was published in October 2024, on the website of the ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute, a research centre based in Singapore.“[Chambers] denied all charges. He neither wrote nor published the blurb on the website,” said Akarachai Chaimaneekarakate, of Thai Lawyers for Human Rights, which represents Chambers. Chambers plans to appeal against the court’s decision to deny bail, Akarachai added.Thailand has one of theworld’s most strict lese-majesty laws, under which criticism of the royal family can lead to 15 years in jail on a single charge.If a person faces multiple cases, they can be sentenced to decades in prison: in January 2024 a man was sentenced to 50 years over his comments about the royal family.At least 277 people have been charged under the law since authorities cracked down onyouth-led mass protests that began in July 2020. People have been prosecuted for political speeches, wearingclothes deemed to be impersonating the royals, or for being involved in the sale ofsatirical cartoons.It is rare for a foreign national to be charged under the lese-majesty law, however.Chambers, who is a well-known academic, is a lecturer at Naresuan University in northern Thailand, and a visiting fellow at the ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

To say otherwise would be an insult to the king and would tarnish the king’s reputation and dignity”.Sunai Phasuk, a senior researcher on Thailand in Human Rights Watch’s Asia division, said lese-majesty prosecutions were “a serious blot” on Thailand’s human rights record.“The abusive use of the royal insult law in Thailand has reached a new height of absurdity when Paul Chambers, a prominent Thai studies scholar, is charged with lese-majesty and cybercrime offences for commenting about the monarchy and the military. Academic freedom and free speech in Thailand will suffer devastating blows if this baseless prosecution proceeds,” Sunai said.Explore more on these topicsThailandAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Sometimes – in the context of Gaza – it suggests one of Hamas’s own rockets fell short, causing the casualties.Otherwise, it might allege that those killed were either combatants themselves, or collateral damage from the targeting of combatants.And the case of theGazamedics is only the latest incident when Israel has altered its account of a high profile killing.The killing of the celebrated Palestinian American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh, who worked for Al Jazeera, while covering a protest on the West Bank in 2022, saw a similar shifting of explanations.Initially, then Israeli prime minister Naftali Bennett suggested that Akleh “likely” had been killed by Palestinian fire. A day later the government issued a statement where it decried “hasty” accusations of one of its soldiers being behind the killing as being “misleading and irresponsible”.Then, under pressure from witness testimony, the IDF conceded she had been shot by an Israeli soldier, saying then that she was not the target but had been hit by accident.When evidence emerges to challenge the Israeli military’s account, history shows the IDF then changes its story to suggest the circumstances are not the result of military orders or systemic issues but a “mistake” or – rarely – individual, but not organisational, culpability.In the case of the paramedics killed on 23 March, theIDF’s initial explanationas the bodies were discovered in a mass grave was that their vehicles had been “advancing suspiciously toward IDF troops without headlights or emergency signals”.Aswitness testimonyandvideo from the phone of one of the dead medics emergedto show that account was untrue and that the ambulances were travelling with lights on and with paramedics wearing identifying hi vis vests, Israel suggested – without providing evidence – that six of the dead were somehow linked to Hamas, even if they were unarmed.Last week, briefings to Israeli media settled on one of the IDF’s most familiar claims seen over the years: the assertion that the soldiers felt they were under threat and that Hamas has used ambulances to move men and weapons.The IDF’s evolving narrative in such cases is often supported with claims made by pro-Israel accounts on social media.In this case, a video was posted on X by a pro-Israel account claiming to show in a blurred image that one of those killed may have been carrying a weapon in their hands. However,examination of the video by the German broadcaster DWjudged that all that was visible was a shadow cast by the lights.If some have identified a pattern of obfuscation over the years, there is also a suspicion that it is in service of a wider aim: muddying the waters when an investigation is launched.And when the IDF does launch an investigation, through the auspices of its Military Advocate General’s office, the results are often opaque and seldom lead to the most serious charges.According toanalysis conducted by Israeli human rights organisation, Yesh Din,published last year, the mechanism set up by the IDF’s general staff to investigate potential war crimes is designed to avoid responsibility while giving the impression that a process is taking place.An examination by Yesh Din of “all complaints transferred to the military” during major Israeli military campaigns over the previous decade “at least 664 complaints were transferred … for review.”Of that, the organisation says, “542 (81.6%) incidents were closed without a criminal investigation, with “just 41 incidents (6%)” leading to a criminal investigation.That led Yesh Din to conclude that “the results of Israel’s law enforcement mechanism’s work over the past decade shows that it rarely opens investigations against junior-ranking soldiers and completely refrains from investigating decision makers at the top command levels”.All of this has prompted urgent questions about Israel’s account not only in more familiar quarters, but this time in Germany, one of Israel’s strongest backers in Europe.“There are very significant questions about the actions of the Israeli army now,” the foreign ministry spokesperson, Christian Wagner, said on Monday after video footage emerged of the incident concerning the medics.“An investigation and accountability of the perpetrators are urgently needed,” he said, adding that a full investigation of the incident would be “a question that ultimately affects the credibility of the Israeli constitutional state”.As Amos Harel suggested in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz earlier this week, all the presentational manoeuvring around the incident may be obscuring a more brutal truth: that all Palestinians in Gaza – civilians included –are perceived as a threat to be encountered with lethal force.A few days ago, a video was aired showing a battalion commander talking to his soldiers on the eve of their return to the enclave.‘“Anyone you encounter there is an enemy.

This order does not address the claims of the other plaintiffs, which did not form the basis of the district court’s preliminary injunction.”Two of the court’s three liberal justices, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson, dissented.The victory, though limited, is likely to embolden theTrump administrationin the belief that the spate of legal reverses it has faced since taking office can be eventually overturned in the supreme court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, due largely to three rightwing judges Trump nominated to the bench during his first presidency.The extent of Tuesday’s victory was qualified by the fact that it does not affect a separate order by a judge in Maryland applying to the same agencies plus several others. Judge James Bredar of the Maryland federal district court ordered the administration to reinstate workers in response to a case brought by 19 states and the government of Washington DC.In the California ruling, the court heard how staff were informed by a templated email from the office of personnel management that they were losing their jobs for performance-related reasons. “The Agency finds, based on your performance, that you have not demonstrated that your further employment at the Agency would be in the public interest,” the email said.While accepting that workforce reductions were acceptable if carried out “correctly under the law”, Alsup said workers had been fired for bogus reasons.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Their status appears to be different to that of the 11,000 soldiers from North Korea who were deployed on the frontline after a political agreement between Pyongyang and Moscow.Zelenskyy said identity documents, bank cards and personal data were found in the possession of the two men captured, and that his country’s domestic security agency, the SBU, was “verifying all the facts”.He argued that the capture of the two men indicated that Russia had no interest in agreeing to a ceasefire in US-brokered peace negotiations, which have made only limited progress over the past two months.“Russia’s involvement of China, along with other countries, whether directly or indirectly, in this war inEuropeis a clear signal that Putin intends to do anything but end the war. He is looking for ways to continue fighting,” Zelenskyy wrote on social media.He said the development “definitely requires a response” from the US, Europe and “all those around the world who want peace”. There was no immediate reaction from Moscow or Beijing.Below his post on X, Zelenskyy released a short video apparently showing a captured soldier, his hands tied, speaking in Mandarin. Prisoners of war are protected from public curiosity according to the Geneva conventions and should not have their images published online.China says it is a neutral party in the conflict. Russia makes heavy use of Chinese-made components in its arms industry, andUkrainedoes so to some extent.

Pictures/APMoviesMinecraft mania: how millions of rowdy kids saved the box officeVideo game adaptation broke records over the weekend as reports pour in about chaotic screenings and TikTok trendsJesse HassengerTue 8 Apr 2025 12.43 EDTLast modified on Tue 8 Apr 2025 13.06 EDTShareMinecrafthas jumped from game consoles to movie screens, and theaters across the country are shaking with perhaps the most vocal fan participation this side of an Avengers finale. As the filmbroke box office records, reports (and phone-shot videos) have been pouring in across the internet of the game-based fantasy-comedy inciting near-riots of applause, cheersand popcorn-chucking as the youthful target audience expresses their gratitude for references to the source material’s characters, memes and attendant lore – particularly the Chicken Jockey, a visual reference to a relatively rare but well-known phenomenon within the game. If you don’t know any more than this, there’s no real need to investigate further; the answer doesn’t matter. Even for someone actively watchingA Minecraft Movie, it has absolutely no bearing on the actual story or characters at hand.A Minecraft Movie breaks records to become highest opening video game movie of all timeRead moreThe reactions have become a TikTok trend unto themselves, with viewers making sure to record the screen in readiness for the audience bedlam that ensues (curiously, it happens whenJack Blacksays “Chicken Jockey”, not when the character actually first appears). Essentially, the kids are watching themselves watch the movie, not unlike how they might watch a stream of someone else playing the game and screaming along in real time. Some adults are amused by the chaos; others have attempted to decode how much of it is genuine enthusiasm and how much is half-ironic insta-nostalgia (yes, Minecraft has been around long enough to inspire nostalgia). Still others have simply panicked and called the cops; as seen in thevideothat helped establish the trend, officers apparently escorted the rowdiest kids out of one showing.But even some adults who have not gone that far are nonetheless horrified that kids are watching movies primarily like amped-up YouTubers or TikTok influencers, in noisy search of content. This in turn has inspired a broader debate, especially in the more film-focused corners of social media, about whether it makes sense to criticize AMinecraftMovie at all.Here are the two opposing schools of thought: one says that any disgust or disdain expressed towards A Minecraft Movie is wasted breath, the sour rantings of adults who simply are not the target audience and, as such, have forgotten the value of kids enjoying junky movies aimed straight at their still-forming brains and no one else’s. The other rejoins that kids are not, in fact, mindless YouTube receptacles, and deserve entertainment, maybe even art, that reflects this, whether or not they yet have the tools to evaluate movies critically.The thing is, both of these ideas are essentially correct.First, in the short run, A Minecraft Movie is undoubtedly good for the film exhibition industry, which is probably in more immediate danger than the film production industry. Movies will continue to be made for the foreseeable future, whether for big studios, Netflix, other tech companies, or specialty companies such as A24 and Neon. Theaters, though, require individual paid-ticket hits in a way that, say, the self-dealing Netflix absolutely does not. Anything that draws tweens and teens – a demographic that seems increasingly likely to scroll endlessly through their algorithm-driven virtual worlds – into a communal viewing experience will be a net good for everyone (except the poor workers who have to clean the popcorn-strewn, pubescent-sweat-soaked auditoriums).Block-busted: why homemade Minecraft movies are the real hitsRead moreAnd frankly, the mania greeting A Minecraft Movie is not especially less sophisticated than the howls of delight that greeted the big portal sequence from Avengers: Endgame, even if some would undoubtedly quibble with the, ah, craft that has gone into these respective fantasy worlds. Ironically, some of the hardcore fans who get most amped about one brand of mass-appeal spectacle are most likely to turn up their noses at another group’s equivalent of the same thing, whether Twilight (because it is for teen girls) or Minecraft (because it is not their preferred childhood game). Some of these movies are quite bad. But grownups seething over a children’s movie is pretty undignified; just think of the adult men who were never actually interested in a Snow White movie, pretending to care about some supposed woke desecration by the live-action remake. Movies should be judged at least in part by their aims, and A Minecraft Movie aims to entertain giddy 10-year-olds, just as Snow White is a fairytale for even younger kids.On the other hand: it is also the critic’s imperative to point out when they find a movie lazy, uninspired, mercenary, or just plain hideous to look at, all things that a children’s film can be, even if some children enjoy it. Personally, I kind of like A Minecraft Movie; the first half of it reminded me enough of director Jared Hess’s Napoleon Dynamite that I was more amused than irritated. But it’s more than fair to argue that kids deserve better than regurgitations of their favorite characters, games or memes.View image in fullscreenSebastian Hansen, Danielle Brooks and Emma Myers in A Minecraft Movie.Photograph: Courtesy Warner Bros. Pictures/APThat’s not exclusive to kids, though. No single piece of junk can annihilate anyone’s cultural diet, and no single type of media can expand it. Many superhero movies are pretty good, but viewers who subsist primarily on them will eventually see their cultural taste buds dulled. YA novels aren’t less real than other books, but it is not unreasonable to wonder whetheradults who read themnear-exclusively might challenge themselves more often. (I know this well as a frequent comics reader.) It’s hard to keep a tween away from internet videos where people play video games and scream (or, sometimes worse, try to do comedy sketches without any training in or observation of sketch comedy); probably the best you can do is to also have them watch movies and shows that are written, directed and/or acted with some genuine care or sensitivity. True cultural curiosity doesn’t have to leave out Minecraft or Sonic the Hedgehog or endless Minions sequels with dance-party endings. It just needs alternatives.The problem with A Minecraft Movie hitting so big isn’t this movie in particular so much as the vast gulf between its massive grosses and whatever types of movies could be left in the dust in the rush to make cinema into game-adjacent content. So let kids have their popcorn riots over the Chicken Jockey, by all means – and then see if you can work in some Looney Tunes, or Studio Ghibli, or King Kong (or, for that matter, Napoleon Dynamite) before they turn into little fandom tribalists.Explore more on these topicsFilmMinecraftGamesJack BlackChildrenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Taken together they build a miraculous lens through which to view human experience, both the truly disturbing and the achingly beautiful.”The shortlisted titles are slim, with four coming in at under 200 pages, including Latronico’s Perfection. The novel, about a millennial expat couple living in Berlin, “transcends its satire of 2010s hipsterdom through the depth of Latronico’s sociological observations”, writes Thomas McMullanin the Guardian. “This chronicle of contemporary Berlin is strongest in its articulation of how a certain kind of globalisation dislocates us from our surroundings.”Small Boatby Vincent Delecroix, translated from French by Helen Stevenson, was also selected. The book was written in three weeks, and is based on recordings from a real event in November 2021, when a dinghy carrying migrants from France to the UK capsized in the Channel, causing the death of 27 people on board.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

In a new interview, creator Mike White hit back at composer Cristóbal Tapia de Veer, whotoldthe New York Times last week that he is quitting the show.De Veer, who composed the show’s score and viral title sequence stylized for each of the three seasons’ locations, told theTimesthat he would not return for the show’s fourth season following creative differences with White. “We already had our last fight for ever, I think,” he said of White. “He was just saying no to anything.”Speaking with Howard Stern on Tuesday following the season finale, White, who also serves as the show’s sole writer and director, disputed de Veer’s characterization of the split. “I honestly don’t know what happened, except now I’m reading his interviews because he decides to do some PR campaign about him leaving the show,” he said. “I don’t think he respected me. He wants people to know that he’s edgy and dark and I’m, I don’t know, like I watch reality TV.”‘We already had our last fight’: White Lotus composer quits in frustration at show’s creatorRead more“We never really even fought. He says we feuded,” he continued. “I don’t think I ever had a fight with him – except for maybe some emails. It was basically me giving him notes. I don’t think he liked to go through the process of getting notes from me, or wanting revisions, because he didn’t respect me. I knew he wasn’t a team player and that he wanted to do it his way. I was thrown that he would go to the New York Times to shit on me and the show three days before the finale. It was kind of a bitch move.”De Veer’s work has been acclaimed by fans and critics: he won three Emmys for The White Lotus, including outstanding theme for season one. Theseason two versionof the theme song became a club hit, remixed by artists such as Tiësto and Sofi Tukker.White added that he and de Veer had had a rocky relationship during the first two seasons of the black dramedy, which has netted HBO 15 Emmys to date. “By the time the third season came around, he’d won Emmys and he had his song go viral, he didn’t want to go through the process with me, he didn’t want to go to sessions,” he told Stern. “He would always look at me with this contemptuous smirk on his face like he thought I was a chimp or something … he’s definitely making a big deal out of a creative difference.”Stern replied: “You’re the genius behind this thing. Why quit a hit show because you got some notes and some differences? Just work it out.”White responded: “He is very talented. [But] I’ve never kissed somebody’s ass so hard to just get him to – to lead that horse to water. Have fun with whatever you’re doing next.”In the Times story, de Veer said: “Maybe I was being unprofessional, and for sure Mike feels that I was always unprofessional to him because I didn’t give him what he wanted. But what I gave him didthis, you know – did those Emmys, people going crazy … That is the main thing that I’m most happy about – it was worth all the tension and almost forcing the music into the show, in a way, because I didn’t have that many allies in there.”From irritating storylines to behind-the-scenes bust-ups: how The White Lotus went off a cliffRead moreAt issue appears to be the third season’s title sequence, which provedmore divisivewith fans – someexpressed disappointmentover the absence of the distinctive “ooh-loo-loo-loo” vocal ululation of the previous versions. According to de Veer, he attempted to persuade producers to assuage critics by releasing a full version of the theme that included it, but White refused.“I texted the producer and I told him that it would be great to, at some point, give them the longer version with the ooh-loo-loo-loos, because people will explode if they realize that it was going there anyway,” he said. “He thought it was a good idea. But then Mike cut that – he wasn’t happy about that.”Though the third season and its conclusion drewmixed critical reviews, The White Lotus has become a juggernaut for HBO.

It made headlines because he was the guy who “could throw that speedball by you / Make you look like a fool, boy” in Bruce Springsteen’s 1984 hit Glory Days – one of the numerous ordinary people that have proved inspirational in pop.The old crowd from the Jersey Shore still make their way into Springsteen’s songs: the centrepiece of his huge stadium shows these last couple of years has been a solo acoustic number called Last Man Standing, which appeared in his 2020 album Letter to You. It was written following the death of George Theiss, in 2018. As a teenage boy, Theiss had been courting Springsteen’s sister Virginia, but ended up instead in a band with the young Bruce – the Castiles. When Theiss died, it left Springsteen the last living member of his high school band, and he composed a requiem for his friend: “Faded pictures in an old scrapbook / Faded pictures that somebody took / When you were hard and young and proud / Backed against the wall, running raw and loud.”The Beatles – Lovely Rita (traffic warden Meta Davies)It’s no fun being a traffic warden. In Liverpool they’ve been given bodycams; in Essex there is a campaign to raise awareness of the human cost of abuse for those who give out parking tickets. So Meta Davies got away lightly when she penalised Paul McCartney. “It was in the spring of 1967 that I ticketed Paul’s car,” she said. “He was on a meter showing excess, so I gave him a 10-shilling ticket.” After noting her unusual name, McCartney asked if he might use it in a song. When she heard the song – in which the singer “took her home and tried to make her” – Davies admitted, “it makes me blush.”The Knack – My Sharona (real estate agent Sharona Alperin)“For over 35 years, Sharona has held a coveted position in the upper echelon of Los Angeles area real estate,” observes Sharon Alperin’s website,mysharona.com. She gets to call it that because she was the Sharona written about by Doug Fieger of the Knack. He wrote the song about his infatuation with her – she was in her late teens, he nine years older – though they also had a relationship and she appears on the cover of the single. Fortunately, there were no recriminations – though they went their separate ways, they remained friends until his death in 2010.View image in fullscreen‘It’s eternal’ … Heloisa Eneida Menezes Paes Pinto on the song she inspired, The Girl From Ipanema.Photograph: ABACA/ShutterstockDe Moraes/Jobim – The Girl From Ipanema (local teen Heloísa Eneida Menezes Paes Pinto)Back in 1962 Vinicius de Moraes would see the same girl pass by the Veloso cafe on the Ipanema beachfront in Rio all the time. She was 17-year-old Heloísa Eneida Menezes Paes Pinto, and when De Moraes and Antonio Carlos Jobim were asked to write for a musical, she became one of their subjects. She was, De Moraes said, “a golden teenage girl, a mixture of flower and mermaid, full of light and grace, the sight of whom is also sad, in that she carries with her, on her route to the sea, the feeling of youth that fades, of the beauty that is not ours alone.” And what did she think? “It’s eternal. Whenever I listen, I remember my past, my younger days,”she told the Guardian in 2012. “Ipanema in 1962 was a great place. You never saw aggression. Everyone wanted to fall in love.”View image in fullscreenDelilah DiCrescenzo, who inspired the song Hey There Delilah arrives with Plain White T’s at the 50th Grammy awards.Photograph: Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagicPlain White Ts – Hey There Delilah (student Delilah DiCrescenzo)Tom Higgenson of Plain White Ts met Delilah DiCrescenzo when she was a student at Columbia University. Besotted, he told her would write a song about her – even though she had a boyfriend – which he did. Several years later, in 2007, Hey There Delilah became a huge hit. By that time, DiCrescenzo was a star in her own right as an international athlete. The experience didn’t seem to scar her: she attended the Grammys in 2008 as Higgenson’s guest. The irony is that these days Higgenson doesn’t have a Wikipedia page, but DiCrescenzo does. Fame is fickle.The Clash – Stay Free (bank robber Robin Crocker)At school in south London, Mick Jones had been friends and co-conspirators with a lad called Robin Crocker. One of them went on to join the Clash, and the other went on to rob banks. On the second Clash album, Jones wrote a nostalgic reverie for his pal, and his joy on hearing of his release from prison: “And if you’re in the Crown tonight / Have a drink on me / But go easy / Step lightly / Stay free.” Croker was moved. “Somebody once said to me it’s the most outstanding heterosexual male-on-male love song, and there is a lot of truth in that,”Crocker told the Guardian in 2008. “Unfortunately, I didn’t Stay Free. I did a wages snatch in Stockholm and got banged up again.”View image in fullscreen‘I’m flattered’ … Danny Nedelko, inspiration for Idles song of the same name.Photograph: Andy Catlin/AlamyIdles – Danny Nedelko (musical peer Danny Nedelko)Danny Nedelko moved to England from Ukraine, aged 15, ending up in Bristol and befriending Joe Talbot, who would co-foundIdles. When Idles released their second album, Joy As an Act of Resistance, they were still a cult band, and Nedelko was their mate in an another, less successful band. By the end of that album campaign, he was the subject of lines roared by thousands of people at every Idles gig: “My blood brother is an immigrant / A beautiful immigrant.” Fortunately, he was not disgruntled by being made a political poster boy, pronouncing himself “very flattered and humbled”.The Kinks – David Watts (promoter David Watts)Perhaps the most double-edged song about a real person – but that’s Ray Davies’ writing for you. The Kinks’ staple – later recorded by the Jam – was named for a promoter in Rutland with whom the Kinks had dealings, and who had a crush on Dave Davies. Hence David Watts being “so gay and fancy free”. But it’s also homoerotic in itself, and Ray later said it was also inspired by a real-life schoolfriend, whom he wouldn’t name because they were still in touch. And the envy, the desperation, to be that boy is palpable: “And when I lie on my pillow at night / I dream I could fight like David Watts / And lead the school team to victory / Take my exams and pass the lot.”Explore more on these topicsPop and rockThe BeatlesBruce SpringsteenJazzIdlesThe KinksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He may be missing the pointTue 8 Apr 2025 06.27 EDTLast modified on Tue 8 Apr 2025 12.45 EDTShareNot winning an Oscar can do funny things to people. Look at Leonardo DiCaprio. He tried harder and harder with every successive loss until he eventually made The Revenant, the movie equivalent of getting punched in the face for likes on TikTok. Same with Lady Gaga, who reacted to losing for A Star Is Born by going so method for House of Gucci that she essentially lived as a Dolmio puppet for nine months.And so we come to Timothée Chalamet. Now, on paper Chalamet doesn’t need to worry about winning an Oscar, because he played the lead in two films that were nominated for best picture. That’s a huge achievement, especially when you consider that those films – Dune: Part Two andA Complete Unknown– each appealed to wildly different audiences. Before that he made Wonka, which proved his chops in another field. Chalamet appeals to kids, sci-fi fans and people’s dads. He just needs to be announced as lead in a Bridget Jones reboot and he’ll have all four quadrants locked up forever. My point is that Chalamet doesn’t need an Oscar. He has already transcended awards.View image in fullscreenSeeking Oscars attention … Timothée Chalamet at the Academy Awards in March.Photograph: Monica Schipper/Getty ImagesHowever, Chalamet was up for the best actor Oscar this year and lost to Adrien Brody. And judging by the effort he’s put into his new film Marty Supreme, there’s a chance that he’s learned the wrong lesson from the loss. You’ll remember that much was made of Chalamet’s preparation for A Complete Unknown, which involved five years of singing lessons, guitar lessons and generalBob Dylanstudies. Indeed, by the end of this preparation, Chalamet couldn’t have been any more like Dylan if he’d toured the world honking atonally to the bafflement of fans. And this got him nominated for an Oscar. So now it’s lodged in his head: preparation equals glory.Marty Supreme is also a film based on a real person. It’s being released at Christmas, a sure sign that it’s expected to do well at theOscars. And so now word is starting to leak out that Chalamet threw everything he had into preparing for the role. That role, by the way, is a professional ping pong player.Speaking to Variety, the film’s cinematographer Darius Khondji revealed that Chalamet spent “months and months” learning ping pong because “he wanted to be like a real (professional) ping pong player when he started shooting”. Khondji explained that the preparation was necessary because “you can do anything, any camera tricks you want, but you need to have a core”.In truth, few films this year sound as exciting as Marty Supreme. It’s directed by Josh Safdie and, aside from Chalamet and his co-star Gwyneth Paltrow, it is stuffed with hundreds of non-actors ranging from world class ping pong players to Philippe Petit and Abel Ferrara. Everything about it suggests that it’s going to be something special. Indeed, with a pedigree like this it might result in Chalamet finally winning best actor at the Oscars next year.But this might not be the right lesson to learn. Spending months and months disappearing into role after role doesn’t sound very healthy and, what’s more, it doesn’t always win awards. Again, look at this year’s Oscars. The supporting actor award was basically a two-horse race between Jeremy Strong (who speaks lovingly about his craft, and the intellectual and physical challenges of becoming another person for a living) and Kieran Culkin (who basically played himself in A Real Pain and then spent the promotional campaign making lots of different fart noises with his mouth). You don’t need to be told that Strong went home empty-handed that night.So it isn’t necessarily a bad thing to do the work, especially if Marty Supreme ends up being as good as it’s shaping up to be, but it isn’t always wise to explain to the world how much effort the roles took. Timothée Chalamet, you are a movie star. Take a couple of easy jobs and coast on your charisma for a bit. You might win an award, you might not. But at least you’ll have several months of your life back to spendriding Lime bikes around London, or whatever it is you do with your time.Explore more on these topicsFilmTimothée ChalametSport filmsOscarsA Complete UnknownBob DylanAwards and prizescommentShareReuse this content"

It will satisfy retail cravings but comes with less environmental guilt, offering an antidote to the overproduction of fast fashion, and it can be kinder on your bank account.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.However, it also comes with its own problems. It’s hard to assess the fit, and returns aren’t always easy. The often next-to-nothing price means it’s tempting to impulse buy, but then you end up with a wardrobe full of unworn pieces that aren’t quite right – speaking from experience. And, it’s not easy to “browse” when each product is essentially one-of-a-kind.Where to start? Let me be your guide: I’m an avid secondhand shopper, whether it’s riffling through charity and thrift stores or trawling online retailers, such as Vinted and Depop.Over the years, I’ve found what feels like everything: from a Christian Dior shirt at Portobello Road market in London to a pair of Wales Bonner x Adidas trainers onStockX– an online marketplace for deadstock designs, pieces that are no longer in production and, therefore, even more desirable. It’s particularly known for itstrainers, and everything has to be new with tags and original packaging.To give me a helping hand, I’ve enlisted the insight of Amy Bannerman, pre-loved style director at eBay UK, and Joy Montgomery, shopping editor at British Vogue and an expert in secondhand garb. Here’s our guide to shopping online, and the best websites to visit.Finesse your search termsView image in fullscreenThe amount of pre-loved pieces online is overwhelming, so it helps if you know what you’re looking for. There are useful tools: “Make the most of filters to navigate by size, colour, brand, location and price,” says Bannerman.If you’re still not hitting gold, it’s worth being creative with your search terms, she says. “That may mean spelling brand names or items incorrectly or using alternative search words. For example, if something is diamante, it may be described as shiny, sparkly or sequined.”Whenever I’m browsing, I tend to stick to my favourite brands rather than aimlessly sifting through thousands of listings. For well-known labels, there are usually enough options to make it feel like you’re shopping on the brand’s own website but for a fraction of the price.Bannerman’s top tip? “If you’re feeling stuck for inspiration or your proactive search isn’t working, lean on the tool which shows you similar brands and related items.” Every service does this differently. On Vinted, it could be suggested items on the homepage based on your search history; Depop asks you your favourite brands for a personalised homepage; and every eBay product offers alternatives.Shop off-season, and set alerts“In winter, everyone’s looking for a big coat, meaning your chances of winning that item are lower, and the price may be higher due to demand,” says Bannerman. “Instead, search during hot weather, as people may not see the need for it then, or search for a light summer dress in winter.”For me, alerts work a treat. Whenever I’m looking for something specific and can’t find it, I save the search on eBay, Vinted, Vestiaire Collective and Depop so I get notifications as soon as there’s a match. Just make sure you’re quick off the mark when it comes through.Be a detective“My top tip is finding the really good accounts,” says Vogue’s Montgomery. “The best way to do that is to search for in-the-know brands – designers like Stefan Cooke or Chopova Lowena – who fashiony people will probably be selling. Often, when you find these pieces, you click on the profile of the person who’s selling and you’ll find loads of other cool brands.”If you’re looking for menswear, you could search for brands such as Our Legacy or Ahluwalia; womenswear fans could look for the likes of 16Arlington or Nanushka, while for interesting luxury, try labels like Loewe and the Row.“I also use [image search tool] Google Lens a lot,” says Montgomery. “The other day, I saw my colleague wearing an amazing Alexander McQueen parka. I took a photo and searched it on Google Lens and found something similar at Urban Outfitters, which I then found on Vinted for £20.”Look at trendsSince fashion often takes inspiration from the past, you can usually shop current trends more responsibly by buying secondhand. Whether it’s boxy blazers, which were big in the 1990s, or the ongoing Y2K revival, which this year is focused on Christina Aguilera-style snake print, it’s not hard to find what’s trending because the big vintage retailers usually offer easy-to-shop edits on their homepages.However, follow the same rule as shopping new: invest only in pieces that feel right for your style, rather than what’s hot. A good tip is to imagine what you might wear your new purchase with, from your own wardrobe. If you can think of a few good options, then it’s not a wasted buy.Montgomery’s advice? Look for pieces that brands reissue year after year, such as T-shirts or bags. “For example,Prada’s Re-Nylon bags,Fendi baguettes, andJ’adore Dior T-shirts– these originals are a lot cheaper [than the new versions].”The best secondhand clothes websitesView image in fullscreenPre-loved stores, both on and offline, are good for different things. Thrift stores are best for retro vintage pieces; charity shops are good for everything from affordable basics to hidden gems; while specialist retailers like Vestiaire Collective and Hardly Ever Worn It are the go-to for luxury brands. And, perhaps most popular of all, online marketplaces that sell everything from £2 T-shirts to Chanel handbags.EverydayDepopView image in fullscreenIt’s big, but the edit feels curated because of a section of current trends on the homepage – making it easy to browse if you don’t have anything specific in mind. Right now, country chic, slam dunk style and preppy are big for spring/summer 2025.You’ll findarchive Vivienne Westwoodfor as little as £12, and sought-after collections such asKate Moss x Topshop(one of the asymmetrical dresses was on sale for just £20 at the time of writing). Since the sellers are fashion-savvy, the price tends to be a little higher – but it’s much easier to stumble upon pieces you never knew you wanted. Unlike eBay, everything is sold with a buy-it-now price, but sellers often build in a contingency price for buyer offers, so it’s worth trying to get a few pounds off.VintedView image in fullscreenThough Vinted launched in the UK in 2014, it wasn’t until 2021 that the app took off. It was helped along by our decluttering obsession during the pandemic, but it’s really the cheap prices, in-app postage system, user-friendly experience and free seller fees that keep people coming back.The fashion is a real mix, but Vinted is mainly good for securing well-known brands for less, whether it’s Gant, Reformation or New Balance. As with Depop, everything has a set price. It’s common practice for buyers to submit offers, though: according to Vinted, 6pm to 9pm is the time sellers are most open to cutting their prices.EbayView image in fullscreenOne of the OG auction sites – which was originally called AuctionWeb – eBay has been dressing people insecondhand clothessince 1995. There’s an overwhelming number of pieces to sift through, so it’s best if you know what you’re shopping for. Use filters to sort by size, colour, fabric and brand, and try a few different search terms. The retailer also offers a professional authentication service, as well as a mixture of auctions and buy-it-now prices.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

The Parisian company focuses on authentication and quality control and has the largest selection of secondhand luxury pieces on the market. While it’s not the best for a bargain, you can find great designer pieces for a fraction of the RRP: a leatherPrada bagfor £230, for example. Roughly 20,000 listings are added daily, so if there’s a discontinued Chanel bag or pair of Gucci sunglasses you’ve always wanted, set an alert.Hardly Ever Worn ItView image in fullscreenWhere Vestiaire is the era-defining retailer of pre-loved luxury, Hardly Ever Worn It (Hewi) is the cooler younger sibling, offering a more curated take. Expect womenswear, menswear, kids, accessories, beauty and homeware from everyone from Celine and Louis Vuitton to Brunello Cucinelli.You’ll even find coveted Hermès and Chanel bags in the mix.Since it’s a destination for designer brands, the prices are considerably higher than on eBay or Vinted: there was ablack Loewe puzzle bagon sale for £1,377 at the time of writing.At the more affordable end of things, small accessories – designer scarves, phone cases, headbands – start at about £20. The brand already has collaborations with Sotheby’s, events with British Vogue and a starry fanbase, from Harry Styles to Rosie Huntington-Whiteley: one to watch.RellikView image in fullscreenRellik is a west London institution. Founded in 1999 by Fiona Stuart, Claire Stansfield and Steven Philip, the vintage boutique has an expertly curated collection of archive designer pieces sourced by Stuart, from a 1970s Yves Saint Laurent dress to an early 90s Jean Paul Gaultier coat. Though it’s a joy to browse the rails in person, the good news is that the store has been online since 2020. It’s largely focused on womenswear and accessories, but there’s a small selection of menswear, too.CharityshopsOxfamView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Andy Doherty/OxfamWith more than 500 locations across the UK, most high streets will have an Oxfam. However, it also has a great online store and its clothes selection is among the best. There’s outerwear by Italian house Max Mara, Dr Martens shoes, pieces by Zara and Cos, and everything in between. Dresses and men’s shirts start at about £2. The only downside? It’s not a great online shopping experience. Though there are filters – as well as specialised collections like bridal or natural fabrics – the search tool isn’t super-responsive.ShelterView image in fullscreenThe website is a treasure trove of hidden gems. Sure, there’s the usual secondhand pieces from brands such as Next and M&S, but among them, you can find anything from a Marni shirt for £40 to a £35 Polo Ralph Lauren jumper, as well as a vintage Lanvin LBD for just £80. There are even bags by maisons such as Bottega Veneta (£845), Dior (£550) and Alexander McQueen (£179) among many other more affordable options.British Heart FoundationView image in fullscreenThe British Heart Foundation’s online presence works slightly differently. The charity has two storefronts for clothes – oneon eBayand the otheron Depop. On eBay, there’s a selection of high-street brands, including Jigsaw, Marks & Spencer, H&M and Zara, among some popular mid-range labels such as AllSaints and Fred Perry, while the Depop shop is distinctly more fashion forward with hypey labels such as Stone Island, Stüssy and Vivienne Westwood.Thrift storesBeyond RetroView image in fullscreenBeyond Retro, with branches in London, Brighton, Cardiff, Bristol and Cambridge, is a textbook thrift store: rails stacked with great denim, retro T-shirts and a huge range of shirts and knitwear. You’ll also find varsity-coded pieces, vintage 1990s gems and a great array of accessories.It now has a huge online presence. My advice? It’s easiest to navigate the website by category, say “T-shirts”, “dresses” or “shirts”, because the search tool can be temperamental.It’s best for tried-and-tested classics for less – Tommy Hilfiger, Carhartt, Dickies, Levi’s, Fila et al. Take Carhartt dungarees, for example – they’d set you back more than £150 bought new, but Beyond Retro sells them for better than half price at £70.Goldsmith VintageView image in fullscreenGoldsmith Vintage started life as a market stall in east London and now has a second London store and an online marketplace. There’s a strong edit across different categories, from sporty labels such as Champion and Nike to denim by Levi’s and Wrangler, as well as a smattering of designer pieces like aValentino skirt setor aJean Paul Gaultier jacket. As a result, it tends to be a little pricier than the other vintage vendors – Levi’s go for up to £50 while used Nike trainers cost upwards of £45 – but you don’t have to do much legwork to find good-quality garb.RokitView image in fullscreenRokit has been around for nearly four decades – and for good reason. It has one of the best vintage selections going, which you can peruse at one of its five shops, or online.You’ll find the usual baseline of retro tees for £20 to £30, Oxford shirts and denim, as well as a mixture of branded streetwear, designer goods and trend-based edits. You can search by decade and find collectible pieces like a Pendleton jacket from the 1950s for £385 or a 1980s Christian Dior that costs more than £2,000.Explore more on these topicsVintage fashionThe FilterShoppingMen's fashionEthical and green livingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We all know that mashed potatoes can cause heated debate, with smooth and buttery making some folk purr, while others prefer a bit of texture, and this also affects what you do with any spares. “It can be difficult to use leftover mash, because many recipes depend on how creamy you like it to begin with,” says the author ofThe Potato Book, although she says one “surefire way” begins by putting a good splash of olive oil in a frying pan on a medium-low heat. “Fry two chopped spring onions [green bits and all] until soft, add the leftover mash, and fry until hot and almost caramelising.” Season, and you’ve got a great base for all sorts.Alternatively, O’Toole might mix her mash with a handful of crumbled feta, some cooked and squeezed spinach, a pinch of chilli flakes, a little grated nutmeg and lemon zest, plus salt and pepper. “Divide into pingpong ball-sized portions, then wrap in filo glued together with a touch of water. Shallow fry in oil until golden and crisp all over.” Perhaps the easiest solution of all, though, is to use excess mash to thicken soups: “Sweat some leeks, add the mash, season and cover with vegetable stock and 100ml whipping cream,” says O’Toole, who then cooks the lot for 30 minutes before tucking in with a good hunk of bread.The first job with leftover roasties, meanwhile, is to bring back their crispness. “Chop them and pan-fry in a drizzle of oil until golden and sizzling,” O’Toole says, then serve with a fried egg and thick-cut ham. “Or, if you’re feeling fancy, toss them in a spiced tomato sauce for a speedy take onpatatas bravas– simple but delicious.” Mind you, accessorising will always set you apart. “You don’t necessarily need to transform roast potatoes into something else,” says Stuart Andrew, head chef at64 Goodge Streetin London, “but you could freshen them up with a littlepersillade[chopped parsley and garlic] or, for something rougher around the edges, whack mayo and chilli oil on top.”Gratins are, of course, always a good idea, and they’re an excellent home for leftover boiled potatoes. Take a leaf out of Andrew’s book with a gratin Savoyard: “Rub a baking dish liberally with unsalted butter and garlic, then layer up the sliced boiled potatoes with salt and pepper, some grated gruyere, sliced onion, parsley and mushrooms, much as you would a lasagne.” Pour over cream, dot with butter and bake until golden. “Serve with afriséesalad dressed with a mustard vinaigrette, and it’s actually quite a light meal.”For O’Toole, however, excess boiled potatoes mean one thing: smashed spuds. “Grab a jar [or anything with a bit of weight], press down on the spuds to break them up a bit, then brush with oil and coat in plenty of spices [smoked paprika, fennel seeds, ground allspice, say].” Roast, turning halfway, until golden and crisp. That said, the exception to O’Toole’s rule is when she’s in “barbecue mode”, when she’d chop boiled potatoes to mix with a mayo dressing for a classic potato salad. When said mode can next be activated, though, is anyone’s guess.Got a culinary dilemma?

The man beside me seems similarly disappointed. “Are you looking for theDubaichocolate?” he asks. It might be kept behind the till, I say, given how precious and popular it is. He stops the security guard and she looks at us sympathetically. No chance, she says. They sold out in hours.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.If you don’t spend your life on TikTok, the latest viral food trend may have passed you by. But you won’t escape it for long. “Dubai chocolate” has gone mainstream.The bars were first invented in 2021 by Sarah Hamouda, a British-Egyptian living in Dubai. When she was pregnant with her second child, her cravings inspired her to come up with a chocolate bar containing a sweet, gooey filling of pistachio cream and tahini with the crunch of knafeh, a traditional Middle Eastern dessert made from shredded filo, soft cheese and syrup.Hamouda was an engineer, not a chocolatier. “That one craving sparked a passion I never expected,” she says. “I threw myself into learning everything I could, and along the way, I had the privilege of working with some truly amazing people who helped bring this dream to life. I never imagined Dubai chocolate would become such a global craze. Seeing it resonate globally has been surreal and deeply rewarding.”View image in fullscreenSarah Hamouda and her husband, co-founder of Fix Dessert, meeting Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, prime minister of UAE.Photograph: instagram/fixdessertchocolatierCraze is certainly the word. When Lidl launched its own version of Dubai chocolate at the end of March, there were reports of people queueing before stores opened. It sold out within hours, despite the £4.99 bars being limited to two per person. The chocolate brand Lindt launched its version at the end of last year – the £10 price tag hasn’t put off the shoppers at my local Sainsbury’s, where it was out of stock. When it launched in Waitrose in March, a two-bar-per-customer limit was imposed there as well.Upmarket chocolatiers have created their own versions. Maison Samadi, which has a shop in west London, sells a “Dubai viral chocolate” bar for £15.75. Budget retailers are stocking it, too. Home Bargains sells Dubites, a bag of bite-size morsels, and Aldi is about to launch its Dubai-style chocolate ice-cream.As I trawl my local shops and supermarkets – including Morrisons, which sells a £5 bar from the brand Bolci – it’s out of stock everywhere. If I wasn’t so exhausted by the search, I could create my own; Brooklyn Beckham is one of many social media users to post a video of themselves doing just that. Eventually I find a small bar – for £5.99! – at a garage shop, from a brand I’ve never heard of. It is wrapped in gold foil. I feel like Charlie Bucket winning a golden ticket.People love it, but this is not chocolate – it is confectionery, flattened to take the shape of a barThere are numerous imitations of Dubai chocolate for sale online, with at least one site accepting cryptocurrency as payment for what it claims is the original Fix Dessert Chocolatier bar, created by Hamouda. Last year, Fix, which only sells its chocolate through the food delivery app Deliveroo, and only in theUnited Arab Emirates, warned of “scammers”.At the end of last year, the German food authority raised food safety concerns about less-than-scrupulous manufacturers and importers, after a random small sample of Dubai chocolate bars foundharmful mould toxinsandundeclared sesame, an allergy risk.Social media is the reason for the confectionery’s rapid rise. Hamouda created her chocolate bar with the help of chef Nouel Catis Omamalin, a trained pastry chef turned culinary consultant living in Dubai. “So many versions were created I lost count,” says Hamouda. “We kept refining, tweaking and testing, never settling. Even after we launched, we continued to improve the recipes because we knew they could be better. I’d say we finally nailed it by early 2023.” Sweet, creamy, crunchy, with a chocolate shell decorated with splashes of colour and a whimsical name (Can’t Get Knafeh of It), the finished product must have seemed like a winner.Even so, when she began selling it through her online shop, it wasn’t an instant success.So she tried sending bars to local influencers. One of them was Maria Vehera, who posts ecstatic videos of herself trying delicious new treats in her car. Thevideo of her trying Dubai chocolatewent viral in December 2023 and has now had more than 122m views. In an interview with the New York Times this year, Hamouda said her company received more than 30,000 orders after Vehera’s video went up. Although Hamouda’s product is still only available in Dubai and Abu Dhabi,it topped Deliveroo’s global table of most popular orderslast year, and still sells out quickly.View image in fullscreenA chef prepares Dubai chocolate in Turkey.Photograph: tolgart/Getty ImagesLike the rapturous Vehera, I greedily unwrapped my Dubai chocolate bar in the car – although sitting in a grubby 13-year-old family estate gobbling up petrol station chocolate isn’t quite the same vibe. I will eat all chocolate, from 90% cacao artisan bars to the trashiest kind, so I’m perhaps not the best judge, but the Dubai chocolate was delicious. This version was too sweet to detect the pistachio, beyond its suspiciously bright green colour, but the creamy-meets-crunchy texture was new and delightful.Alon Chen, chief executive of food trend analysts Tastewise, says his system flagged “Dubai chocolate” as a trend in January 2024. Tastewise’s technology monitors menus from restaurants in the UK, the US and nine other countries. “Restaurateurs or restaurants are the biggest innovation lab in the world,” he says. “If you know what’s happening there, you can see the trends.” Think of the rainbow bagel that came out of the Bagel Store in Brooklyn, or thecronut (croissant-donut hybrid)created in 2013 by French pastry chef Dominique Ansel.Tastewise also keeps an eye on blogs about what people are cooking at home (which recipes are published, and which ones are popular), and social media. By the time a product reaches the shelves of a supermarket, the trend will already be 12 to 18 months old.View image in fullscreenA shop window in California.Photograph: Smith Collection/Gado/Getty ImagesNobody specifically predicted the rise of “Dubai chocolate”, says Chen, but there were other signs that the world was ready for it. In the west, there has been growing interest in Mediterranean and Middle Eastern food for a while. “And the explosion of pistachio was everywhere. So would Dubai chocolate have exploded if it wasn’t with the tailwind of the pistachio prevalence? Probably not.” It was three years ago that his company flagged the growing popularity of the pistachio-and-chocolate combination, he adds. Middle Eastern flavours are also becoming more fashionable in sweet treats – other trends he predicts include the rise of date syrup and tahini.Middle Eastern chocolate has not traditionally been renowned around the world, says Chloé Doutre-Roussel, former chocolate buyer at Fortnum & Mason, and author of TheChocolateConnoisseur. Even in places such as the United Arab Emirates, prestige international brands are traditionally more popular than local chocolate products. It was at the Salon du Chocolat last autumn in Paris, a trade show for the chocolate industry, that Doutre-Roussel first noticed the pistachio-filled treat.The trend has largely been driven by marketing, she says – “the social media, the colourful packaging” – but also by Dubai chocolate’s broad appeal. “People prefer filled chocolates – these bars with a thick filling and very sweet. It’s very indulgent. People love it, but this is not chocolate – it is confectionery, flattened to take the shape of a bar.” Even with bars of chocolate, she adds, “If you look at consumers’ behaviour, most of the time they prefer flavoured chocolate.”Doutre-Roussel likens the world of chocolate to coffee: to connoisseurs, an unadulterated specialty coffee is a thing of beauty. For the rest of us, it has to be made more palatable with frothy milk or – horror! – flavoured syrups. In chocolate, people “prefer something with orange, cinnamon or fancy flavours like wasabi”, she says, “and are not used to looking for the wonderful aromas behind quality cacao”. With Dubai chocolate, it’s for people “who want easy, fast pleasure – sweet and fat – but not necessarily elegant”.View image in fullscreenA sweetshop in Ankara, Turkey.Photograph: Xinhua/AlamyWill the trend continue? That’s what retailers want to know, and what Chen is monitoring. The growing number of knock-off versions suggests it will. “Copycats are inevitable and honestly, it’s a compliment,” says Hamouda, who adds she is cheered by smaller chocolate producers and home cooks creating their own versions. Although in the past she has seemed frustrated by big companies jumping in, she says that “when century-old chocolate giants begin replicating your flavour, that’s when you know you’ve made an impact”. Dubai chocolate is apparently better suited to the small producers; Fix still only makes a limited number of bars each day, though Hamouda says it is scaling up production to meet demand, and “expanding beyond the UAE is absolutely part of the plan, including to places like the UK”. The hype is partly caused by scarcity, but there is a good reason for the shortage.“The interesting thing with Dubai chocolate is the food science part,” says Chen. “Dubai chocolate cannot be made at large scale. Why? Because the knafeh is very crispy and fragile, and it takes a lot of technology on a large production line to be able to cover the knafeh and add the cream, and still keep the crunchiness. Without the crunchiness, it’s just another pistachio-flavoured chocolate bar.” Manufacturers have figured out how to make mass-market products that have some of the same qualities – think of the creamy fillings and crunchy wafer middles of Kinder Bueno and Ferrero Rocher – but a lot of time and expense will have been spent developing those. Dubai chocolate could go totally mainstream, says Chen – “it’s just going to take longer.”‘I could eat the lot!’: the best new Easter eggs for 2025Read moreHe suspects the trend is here to stay.Foodtrends begin with a consumer need, he says: people like to try new things, but that’s not enough on its own. “For a trend to start, it needs to address something more basic, such as: ‘I want to be healthier, I want more energy, I want something indulgent.’ You’re going deeper into the human motivation.”Dubai chocolate hits the indulgence craving, he says. “It has flavourful nuts, different textures, the creaminess, the crunchiness, which is something people really like.” The fact that it has cut across all demographics – ages, genders, and different socioeconomic groups, as suggested by it being stocked in both Lidl and Waitrose – is another clue to its possible longevity.Nobody is apparently safe from the temptation of Dubai chocolate, and Chen suspects it won’t be long before other audiences are targeted. “I’m waiting for the high-protein version,” he says.Explore more on these topicsFoodChocolateNuts and seedsFood & drink industryDubaiUnited Arab EmiratesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There is no point in defrosting four portions if you are dining solo as this may lead to waste.Likewise, when freezing meats, it is best to portion out how much you are likely to use. Recipes tend to be in 100g increments, so divide 500g of minced beef into five 100g balls and then freeze them on a covered tray before transferring them into a bag. It may sound like a faff but doing that can mean you avoid having groups of them stuck together when you only need a couple. Do the same with individual sausages as well.Freezer burn is what happens when food items are exposed to cold, dry air, resulting in them dehydrating and forming ice crystals, which affects quality. To avoid it, take time to package food properly before you put it in the freezer.The first step is to make sure that food is cooled to room temperature, Marley says. After that, you should use vacuum-sealed bags, freezer-safe containers or aluminium foil to keep burn at bay.View image in fullscreenRemove the risk of freezer burn by taking time to package food properly before you store it in the freezer.Photograph: gerenme/Getty Images/iStockphotoAgain, planning is very important, says Ben Ebbrell, a chef who co-founded the YouTube channel SortedFood. “The likes of Tupperware are convenient options and they stack well, although they often result in you locking in and freezing (sometimes large) pockets of air, thus wasting valuable space in the freezer,” he says.“A brilliant hack is to fill quality liquid-proof zip slider bags with stews, casseroles, curries, soups and the like … when they are cooled, lay them flat and squeeze out all excess air. They then lay to freeze and stack well; it also helps it to defrost quicker due to a larger surface area.”Use labelsOnce food is packed, label packaging with the name of the dish and when it was frozen. You can buy freezer labels cheaply (Dunelm has packs of 250 for £3, for example), or buy a reusable, erasable version (Dunelm’s costs £1.50 for 70) or a chalk marker pen and write on to the bag or container and rub it off afterwards (Uni-Balls get good reviews – you can gettwo for £5 from Asda).The Food Standards Agency (FSA) says meat is best eaten within two to three months of going in the freezer, while baked goods, fruit and vegetables will last up to four months.View image in fullscreenThe Food Standards Agency says vegetables and fruit will last up to four months in the freezer.Photograph: artursfoto/Getty Images/iStockphoto“One other tip would be to include any simple allergies if you sometimes cook for friends or family who require certain things,” Ebbrell says.“For example, a friend of mine is lactose intolerant and if I cook a dish that has ‘hidden’ dairy in it – starting it off in butter, or with a roux, or with grated cheese in it – then I label that so if I later defrost for an impromptu dinner I’m still aware of what it contains.”Don’t freeze everythingIn theory, you can freeze anything to extend its life – but some things freeze better than others as quality, structure and texture can change.“Fruits with a lot of water content are great frozen for a future time if they are later to be cooked, stewed or baked,” Ebbrell says. “The challenge is they go mushy. Some fruits, tomatoes and soft-stoned fruit, for instance, and aromatic ingredients like ginger, garlic and chillies are brilliantly frozen and can be quickly prepared by grating them while still frozen, so you only take what you need for a dish.”Cooked meals with rice do not fare well when frozen because the cold temperatures alter the texture of the grain. A risotto can come back very mushy when defrosted, as can pasta. To get around this, it is best to freeze the sauce and then cook the pasta fresh when you want to eat.Marley says raw eggs in their shells, cream and watermelon, as well as fried foods, do not hold up well.Use your ice traysYou can portion out stocks and other liquids to use them in the most efficient way with your ice tray. So if a recipe requires a small shot of stock, you can put in a cube instead of thawing a whole block.In the same way, sauces for young children’s meals can be stored and defrosted when necessary. “You can even blend fruits and yoghurt and freeze them in cubes, and have smoothie packs ready to go,” Marley says.Buying garlic, ginger and chilli in bulk can be cheaper and more convenient. Crushing or chopping them and mixing them with water or oil before putting them in trays gives them extra life, Ebbrell says. “Flavour bombs like homemade curry pastes, pestos, gremolata or chimichurri also work a treat,” he says.If you do not have a tray already, buy one with a lid, otherwise your ingredients risk freezer burn, says Aliya Porter, a nutritionist from the Nutritionist Resource directory. (John Lewis sells a well-reviewed onefor £6.50.)Otherwise, put the cubes of ingredients into a sealed bag once they are frozen.Thaw it properlyThe freezer acts as a pause button for food, according to the FSA. It will not go bad and bacteria will not grow. But it is not a time machine, so food that has one day left before its use-by date when frozen has the same amount of time when defrosted and cannot be left in the fridge for a few days.View image in fullscreenThe chef Ben Ebbrell has tips on lime and lemon zest.Photograph: ribeirorocha/Getty Images/iStockphotoThe safest way to defrost food is to move it to the fridge the day before you need it, according to Marley. “For quicker options, seal the food in a watertight bag and submerge it in cold water, changing the water every 30 minutes. If you are in a hurry, use the microwave’s defrost setting, but make sure to cook the food immediately afterward,” she says.Or use it frozenFrozen cooked apples can be put with yoghurt for a quick dessert, Porter says.If you use the zest of a lemon or a lime but not the fruit, you can cut it up and freeze it for drinks in the future, Ebbrell says. Cubes of frozen leftover filter coffee can be put into iced coffee and will not dilute the drinks.For a simple lunch, he says, you can freeze ripe tomatoes and then grate them over a bowl of burrata with some olive oil, balsamic vinegar and some fresh herbs.Explore more on these topicsFoodMoney hacksConsumer affairsFood wasteSaving moneyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In the meantime, it ruledmy ex was to live in it and pay the mortgage, which was in our joint names. I warned the courthe had a history of missed payments.The house has proved hard to sell, and the mortgage is now five months in arrears. The bank is about to start repossession ­proceedings. My credit rating has already plummeted and a repossession will leave me struggling to get a mortgage. My lawyers tell me that I can’t go back to thefamilycourt about the damage to my credit ­rating because it is outside its remit, even though the court imposed this situation on me in the first place.GS, DorsetThis is an agonising situation for you and I really hoped I could find you a path out of it. I began with the Judicial Office, which said it was unable to comment ­generally or ­specifically on what options are available in such circumstances. The Law Society was also unable to provide any wisdom. So I ­consulted the debt charity StepChange, which had just published a report on coerced debt.It confirmed that even if you were to go back to the courts, you are still contractually liable for the joint debt to the mortgage lender. It ­suggested that, contrary to your lawyers’ advice, your ex-husband’s failure to follow a court order is potentially in contempt of court and that a judge may issue enforcement penalties against him or amend the original decision. You should perhaps consult a new lawyer about this.Lastly, I tried the credit reference agency Experian. It reckoned you could explain the situation to the mortgage lender and provide a copy of the court judgment to see whether they could offer a way out. Failing that, you could add a written statement termed a “notice of correction” to the files of all three main credit reference agencies, explaining the circumstances to prospective lenders and offering supporting evidence. It won’t repair the damaged score, but could help support any future credit applications.Explore more on these topicsDivorceYour problems, with Anna TimsConsumer affairsMortgage arrearsFamily financesMortgagesBorrowing & debtPropertyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

If I don’t want anything too hearty, I’ll often serve it with greens or a salad, so it really is a quick turnaround. I love this simple brown butter caper dressing, because it doesn’t overpower the fish. However, if you want something a little punchier, add a spoonful of harissa to the mix.Fried sea bream with herby lemon and caper burnt butterPrep5 minCook20 minServes22 sea bream fillets(about 100g each)Sea salt andblack pepper40g unsalted butter2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely grated2 tbsp capersJuice of½ lemon½ bunchmixed soft herbs(ie, flat-leaf parsley, chives, mint)2 tbsp olive oilTake the fish out of the fridge, pat it dry with kitchen paper so there is no moisture on the fillets, and season generously. Make sure you have the rest of your ingredients ready, because this cooks so quickly.Put the butter in a large frying pan on a medium heat. As soon as it melts and starts to smell nutty, add the grated garlic and capers, and fry for a few minutes, until golden. Squeeze in the lemon juice and take off the heat. Stir in most of the chopped herbs, then pour into a small bowl and set aside.Drizzle the olive oil into the same frying pan over a medium heat, then lay in the fish skin side down and fry for four to five minutes, until the skin is crisp and golden. Turn up the heat a little, flip over the fish and fry for a couple of minutes more, until cooked through and golden all over.Pour the caper butter back into the pan for the last 30 seconds, then serve scattered with the remaining herbs.The Guardian aims to publish recipes for sustainable fish.

Just be sure to use perfectly ripe mangoesNigel SlaterTue 8 Apr 2025 07.00 EDTShareBlueberries actually have a pinch of acidity that helps lift this rather mild and soothing puréed mango.I like to use a thick, strained Greek-style yoghurt here, and only partially mix it into the purée to leave some attractive swirls of it marbled through the fool.Tip 150g ofblueberriesinto a saucepan, then add 2 tbsp ofsugarand 100ml ofwaterand bring to the boil.Lower the heat and wait until the berries start to burst and a purple juice forms. Then set aside to cool.Cut the flesh from 2 largemangoes, slicing it from the large, flat stones at their centres. (Discard the stones and skin.) Put the flesh into a blender together with the juice of half alemonand process to a thick, smooth purée.Stir in 200ml of thick Greek-styleyoghurt, taking care not to overmix it – ideally you’ll have ribbons of yoghurt still visible throughout the fool as you scoop into it.Pour the mixture into serving dishes, then swirl a little of the blueberry purée through each one with a spoon. Top with a few fresh berries, if you like.Serves 4. Ready in 30 minutesYou can always use other berries in place of the blueberries. A raspberry purée will work well, too, or even one of passion fruit. (If using passion fruit I like to keep the crunchy seeds in to contrast the smoothness of the mango.)For a softer flavour, use double cream that has been lightly whipped in place of the strained yoghurt.Use any variety of mango, just make sure they are truly ripe.Explore more on these topicsFoodNigel Slater's midweek dinnerfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Like, I think you should care about other people, but you need to have empathy for civilization as a whole and not commit to a civilizational suicide.”The idea that caring about others could end civilization may seem extreme, but it comes amid a growing wave of opposition to empathy from across the American right. Musk learned about “suicidal empathy” through his “public bromance” with Gad Saad, a Canadian marketing professor whose casual application of evolutionary psychology to culture war politics has brought him a sizable social media following. By Saad’s accounting – and this is not dissimilar from the white nationalist “great replacement theory” – western societies are bringing about their own destruction by admitting immigrants from poorer, browner and more Muslim countries.“The fundamental weakness of western civilization is empathy,” Musk continued to Rogan, couching his argument in the type of pseudoscientific language that’s catnip to both men’s followings on X. “The empathy exploit. They’re exploiting a bug in western civilization, which is the empathy response.”The idea that empathy is actually bad has also been gaining traction among white evangelical Christians in the US, some of whom have begun to recast the pangs of empathy that might complicate theirsupport for Donald Trumpand his agenda as a “sin” or “toxin”. The debate has emerged among Catholics too, with JD Vance recently using the medieval Catholic concept of “ordo amoris” to justify the Trump administration’s policies on immigration and foreign aid. (Vance’s stance – that it’s righteous to privilege the needs of one’s family, community and nation over those of the rest of the world – earned arebukefrom the pope, butsupportfrom other influential Catholic thinkers.)It’s not every day that evolutionary psychologists and evangelical creationists end up on the same side of an issue, but it’s also not every day that empathy is treated as anything other than a broadly positive feature of human experience – your standard, golden rule-type stuff.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump, center, prays during an ‘Evangelicals for Trump’ coalition launch event in Miami, Florida, in 2020.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesCoined in 1908 as the English translation of the German “Einfühlung”, or “in-feeling”, empathy originally referred to the feelings a person might have when projecting themself into a piece of artwork or nature. It is now understood to mean both the effortful, cognitive process by which a person projects themself into another’s situation and point of view, and to the unconscious (and at times unwelcome) affective process by which another person’s emotions can influence or even take over one’s own. It is variously described as an innate characteristic and a skill that can be acquired and honed; some see in it the potential to learn, others to heal.The study of empathy begins with a central mystery of subjective existence: what are the limits of the self? If I can be transported into a work of art or piece of music, can I also extend my consciousness into another person’s thoughts and feelings? It also speaks to one of the great quandaries of social life – that we can never really know what other people are thinking and feeling. Is your blue my blue? Is your pain my pain?The disparagement of empathy is … a deliberate effort to set up a permission structure to dehumanize othersSusan LanzoniHow we relate to the pain of others is a question that always lurks beneath our politics, but it’s one that is particularly relevant now. In its first months, the Trump administration has begun to implement aradical rightwing regimefeaturingmass deportationswithout due process, draconian cuts todomesticandforeignaid programs, and venallyself-interested foreign policy– a set of policies that amount to a prescription for mass suffering anddeath. Whether Trump succeeds or fails in his quest to remake US society is very much a question of how much of the pain of others Americans are willing to abide in the pursuit of making America great again.The rightwing movement against empathy seeks to dismantle and discredit one of the essential tools for any society – our capacity to recognize and respond to suffering. We should see the campaign against empathy by Trump supporters for what it is: a flashing red light warning of fascist intent.How empathy became the enemyOn 21 January, the Right Rev Mariann Budde delivered amessagefrom the pulpit of Washington National Cathedral to a newly inaugurated President Trump. Immigrants and LGBTQ+ children were living in fear, the Episcopal bishop of Washington said. “In the name of our God, I ask you to have mercy upon the people in our country who are scared now.”Budde’s appeal was standard fare for a denomination that has beeninclusive of LGBTQ+ peoplesince 1976 and, like many churches, undertakesministry workin support of immigrants and refugees. But it touched off a firestorm among some of Trump’s evangelical supporters, who saw in Budde three outrages – the ordination of women, tolerance of LGBTQ+ people and support for immigrants – with a common, rotten core: empathy.“Do not commit the sin of empathy,”tweetedthe Christian podcaster Ben Garrett with a photo of Budde in her religious garb. “This snake is God’s enemy and yours too.”Another Christian podcaster, Allie Beth Stuckey,tweeted: “This is to be expected from a female Episcopalian priest: toxic empathy that is in complete opposition to God’s Word and in support of the most satanic, destructive ideas ever conjured up.”View image in fullscreenDonald Trump stands near the Right Rev Mariann Budde (left) as he attends a service on 21 January.Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/ReutersThe pastor Joe Rigney drove the argument home in the evangelical publicationWorld. “Budde’s attempt to ‘speak truth to power’ is a reminder that feminism is a cancer that enables the politics of empathetic manipulation and victimhood that has plagued us in the era of wokeness,” Rigney wrote. “Bishop Budde’s exhortation was a clear example of the man-eating weed of Humanistic Mercy.”Rigney has been the leading evangelizer against what he calls the “sin of empathy” since 2019, when he first aired his views on avideo serieshosted by the far-right Christian nationalist pastor Douglas Wilson. A professor of theology, Rigney looks the part of the mild-mannered, devout scholar – he’s a big fan of CS Lewis and gives interviews from a room lined with bookshelves – but his toothy grin betrays a trollish side: he admits the phrase “the sin of empathy” is a provocation and seems pleased with the resulting furore.In 2023, Rigneystepped downas president of a seminary in Minneapolis, after years ofconflictover issues including his close ties with Wilson, support for Christian nationalism and infant baptism, and his views on empathy. He now serves as a fellow at a Christian college in Moscow, Idaho, where Wilson is attempting to build a “theocracy”. Rigney’s book The Sin of Empathy: Compassion and its Counterfeits was released in February by Canon Press, a publishing house founded by Wilson and best known for releasing – and thenwithdrawingover allegations of plagiarism – Wilson’s co-authoredapologiafor the antebellum south that characterized slavery as “a relationship based upon mutual affection and confidence”.Rigney’s argument is that empathy can be sinful if it is “untethered” to biblical truth on issues such as homosexuality and gender. While he acknowledges that “the Scriptures command us to have sympathy and a tender heart”, he defines empathy as “an excess of compassion, when our identification with and sharing of the emotions of others overwhelms our minds and sweeps us off our feet”.Women are more empathetic than men, which is why God does not allow them to be ordained, Rigney argues. Quoting extensively from Calvin Robinson, the rightwing British cleric who was recentlydefrockedby the Anglican Catholic church for mimicking Musk’s apparent Nazi salute at an anti-abortion rally, Rigney connects progressive political values to “a culture of victimhood flowing from toxic female empathy”.Everything about Trump flies in the face of orthodox ChristianityJohn W Compton“Empathy feeds the competitive victimhood mentality that is rampant in our society,” he writes. “The same empathetic logic lies beneath the societal indulgence of criminality that particularly plagues progressive cities (always provided that the criminal is a member of some aggrieved group), as well as the empathetic paralysis that prevents western nations from wisely and justly addressing the challenges of both legal and illegal immigration. Compassion for refugees and ‘kids in cages’ is used to open the border to millions of able-bodied young men. But nowhere is this pathological feminine empathy more evident than in the various controversies surrounding transgenderism.”This is pure Maga red meat, largely untethered from any version of reality, secular or otherwise (the US criminal justice system is notoriouslypunitivecompared with other western countries; crime rates in US cities are nearhistoric lows; Jesus’s calls to “love thy neighbor” and “welcome the stranger” did not specify by age, gender or physical ability, etc). But it is useful for those devout Trump supporters who are looking for Christian-coded justifications of their political beliefs.View image in fullscreenAn ‘Evangelicals for Trump’ campaign event in Florida in 2020.Photograph: Joe Raedle/Getty ImagesJustification is also at the heart of Stuckey’s book, Toxic Empathy: How Progressives Exploit Christian Compassion. Stuckey takes as her starting point that great ethical quandary of early June 2020: whether or not topost a black squareon Instagram in protest of the police murder of George Floyd. After five pages of deliberation – “I thought some more about posting. It would’ve been easy to do. It would’ve been a way to demonstrate my empathy toward Floyd and victims of racism” – Stuckey decided to post instead a video of an elderly Black woman lamenting the destruction of riots. Accused by some commenters of being disrespectful to Floyd’s loss of life, she concluded: “I was facing weaponized, toxic empathy.”Like Rigney, Stuckey emphasizes the emotional nature of empathy, writing: “It may be part of what inspires us to do good, but it’s just an emotion and, like all emotions, highly susceptible to manipulation.” The book, published just ahead of the 2024 election, provides arguments for Christians to use in defense of five political positions (against abortion, against gay marriage, against trans people, against immigration and against social justice), no matter how many people on Instagram implore them to show a little empathy.“For the Christian, empathy should never compel us to affirm that which God calls sinful or to advocate for policies that are ineffective at best and deadly at worst,” she writes. Not only are the liberal positions on these issues ungodly, she argues, they end up hurting “the very people empathy-mongers claim they’re trying to help: the truly marginalized and vulnerable”. (To make this claim, Stuckey engages in a bit of empathy-mongering of her own, on behalf of embryos and unborn fetuses.)It should be noted that many Christianleadersandbelieversdisagreewith this interpretation of empathy. The message board at Judson Memorial church in Manhattan recentlycarriedthe message: “If empathy is a sin, sin boldly.” Michael C Rea, a professor of the philosophy of religion at the University of Notre Dame, compared Rigney’s logic to that of Adolf Eichmann in anop-edfor the Religious News Service. Stickers with logos like “brb committing the sin of empathy” are popping up on Etsy.But Rigney’s views are increasingly appealing to evangelical Christians. In February he was invited to promote his book on thepodcastof Albert Mohler, an influential leader in the Southern Baptist Convention. A one-timecritic of Trumpwho came around toendorsinghim by 2024, Mohler offered up some of his own arguments against empathy, saying: “It has always seemed to me to be a synthetic word, an artificial word.” Empathy was too closely tied to the “constant emoting” of the modern age, a sign of how leftist thought has replaced the concrete with the abstract, and an outgrowth of Marxism and identity politics, Mohler argued. In a recentinterviewwith the New Yorker, he described empathy as “never having to say no”.View image in fullscreenAlbert Mohler and Joe Rigney.Photograph: YouTube via Albert MohlerWhite Christians in the US once served as a pillar of the civil rights movement. The white evangelical embrace of Trump – 81% supported him in 2016 – represents the tail end of a broader shift, according to John W Compton, a professor of political science and author of the 2020 book The End of Empathy: Why White Protestants Stopped Loving Their Neighbors.Compton connects the shift to expanded higher education and social mobility after the second world war, which made membership in mainline Protestant churches less important to those seeking middle-class respectability. “Focused on personal salvation and stripped of any concern with social justice, post 1970s evangelicalism struck a chord with white middle-class Protestants who now had little reason to concern themselves with the plight of the less fortunate,” Compton writes.Crucially, leaders of the religious right rose to positions of prominence because they voiced the political views of their followers, not because they had formed them, Compton argues. In the early 2000s, when these leaders made concerted efforts to promote immigration reform and the fights against the climate crisis and HIV/Aids, they saw little success. Compton sees this dynamic at work again with the rise of explicitly anti-empathy messaging. “Increasingly politics drives religion instead of religion driving politics,” he said in an interview.It also helps explain how Rigney, who may once have been too extreme for American Christians like Mohler, has found an audience among Christians seeking to reconcile Trump’s increasingly inhumane positions with their faith.“Everything about Trump flies in the face of orthodoxChristianity,” Compton said. “His policy agenda is the opposite of traditional Christian compassion. So I think it’s not surprising that there’s a market for books, podcasts and other content that tells people who like Trump that there’s nothing wrong with liking Trump, and, in fact, that Trump’s doing exactly what the Bible or Christianity demands.”Wood crickets and parasitized mindsGad Saad likes to tell a story about a rape. When he’s lecturing, he’ll tell it while standing next to a photograph of the rape victim’s face, as he did at arecent talkfor students at the University of Austin, the unaccredited Texas college founded by the Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale and the Free Press editor, Bari Weiss.“This guy is super progressive and empathetic,” Saad begins in his jocular style. “He’s very touching. Let me tell you why. He’s a Norwegian guy who presents himself to the world as a male feminist and anti-racist ally.” Here Saad gestures to the headshot of the man and its caption: “Karsten Nordal Hauken, who describes himself as feminist and anti-racist …”“He was raped and sodomized by a noble Somali immigrant,” Saad continues. “As it goes in Norway, you don’t get much of a sentence for rape. You know, very, very light sentence. I think maybe he got a year or something, whatever it was. When he came out of detention, [Hauken] was racked with existential guilt because his sodomizer was now going to be potentially deported to Somalia, where he wouldn’t be able to maximally flourish. And so he was guilty that his rapist was now going to have a bad life in Somalia.”The story concludes with the moral, which is also the title of Saad’s forthcoming book: “That’s not an emotional system that we have evolved,” he says, clicking to the next slide. “This is what happens when you have suicidal empathy.”View image in fullscreenAbortion rights demonstrators rally in front of the supreme court in April.Photograph: Anna Rose Layden/UPI/Rex/ShutterstockSuicidal Empathy may still be in the process of being written, but its thesis has already been taken up by the world’s richest (and arguably most powerful) man, Elon Musk. It is, Saad has explained in various podcast interviews and public talks, the other half of the thesis from his previous book, The Parasitic Mind: How Infectious Ideas Are Killing Common Sense, which became a bestseller in part thanks toMusk’s enthusiastic endorsementof Saad’s notion of a “woke mind virus”.“Parasitic mind is what happens to human brains when their cognitive abilities are parasitized,” Saad explained in arecent talk. “We’re both a thinking and feeling animal. Suicidal empathy completes the story by now explaining what happens when [human emotions are] hijacked by parasitic nonsense, and hence suicidal empathy. It’s the misfiring of an otherwise noble emotion called empathy.”Saad has a PhD in marketing, and his academic career saw him apply evolutionary thinking to consumer behavior through studies on the testosterone levels of men after theydrive a Porscheor the amount womenspendon food versus apparel over the course of their menstrual cycle. He views human behaviors and traits through the lens of natural and sexual selection, and speaks with disdain of scientists who limit themselves to considering the “proximate cause” of an event or phenomenon, arguing that evolutionary thinking allows him to extrapolate an “ultimate cause”. This certainty allows him to make claims that would not be out of place in Rigney’s church, albeit with slightly different vocabulary. It is an “unassailable” truth that “sex-specific biological forces” shape boys’ and girls’ different toy preferences, heargues. Another conviction is to dismiss out of hand transgender people’s account of their own identities.Saad rose to prominence on social media when he began applying this kind of evolutionary thinking toward politics, often presenting his views (anti-immigration, anti-Islam, anti-feminist and anti-trans) as possessing the weight of scientific or biological truth. He uses examples of parasites to argue that certain “pathogenic” ideas – such as postmodernism, social constructivism and radical feminism – can take over a person’s brain and force them to act counter to their own survival. He frequently cites wood crickets, which can be infected by ahair wormthat hijacks its brain and forces it to jump into water. Once in water, the hair worm completes its reproductive cycle while the host cricket drowns.“When this guy who hates water is parasitized, it merrily and happily jumps to its suicide in the service of this hair worm,” he said in a recentlecture. “Queers for Palestine are wood crickets.”Saad claims to support empathy “at the right place, to the right people, at the right amount”. But he also argues that evolution has resulted in him being “much more likely to jump to save my biological children if there’s a truck hurling at them than I am to save a random person. That doesn’t make me callous. I’d like to also save the random children, but that’s not how evolution works.”View image in fullscreenGad Saad speaks at a summit in Budapest, Hungary, in September 2023.Photograph: Noemi Bruzak/EPA-EFEExcept, it doesn’t appear that hewouldlike to save the random children, considering the fact that he accuses those people who do want to save random – or, perhaps, asylum-seeking – children of suffering from either a brain virus or a case of suicidal empathy. It’s an entirely circular logic that relies on appeals to “biology” or “common sense” in the same way that Rigney and Stuckey appeal to biblical truth. The only real difference is the audience.There is precedent for expanding the logic of natural selection to social groups, and it’s not a pretty one. Social Darwinism rubs shoulders with eugenics and scientific racism, and Saad does himself no favors by so frequently referring to his ideological nemeses as “degenerate”, anotherpseudoscientific conceptwith an ugly history.Because there should be no mistaking the real menace that lurks beneath Saad’s gregarious delivery of anecdotes. Take the rape story. The version Saad related at the University of Austin was designed to cast support for immigration from the global south to western countries as self-sabotaging lunacy; it is also highlyinaccurate. Saad exaggerates the leniency of the sentence (the attacker served four and a half years), and the significance of Hauken’s sense of guilt (Hauken described a complex range of emotional reactions to his assault, which included but were very much not limited to feelings of guilt around his relative social position to his attacker). Haukenspoke outabout his ordeal to encourage other young people to seek mental health support despite feelings of stigma and shame; Saad took the opportunity to pile more shame upon him.There is no word for this but cruelty. Saad offers up the name and photograph of a rape victim as an object of derision. He hijacks a real person’s story of sexual violation in order to condemn that person for how he made peace with it, an act of profound violation in and of itself. There is perhaps a lesson to be learned about empathy in all this, but it is not the one Saad thinks.Trump’s achilles heelSince the civil rights movement brought the question of people’s ability to relate to one another as equals in a multiracial democracy to the forefront of American consciousness, empathy’s relevance to politics has only increased.This liberal ideal of empathy’s political capacity may have reached its apotheosis with Barack Obama, who memorablydeclaredin 2006 that America was suffering, not from a budget deficit, but from an “empathy deficit”. At the same moment themediawas growingenamoredwith research on “mirror neurons” – a type of nerve cell that reacts both when a subject performs an action and when the subject sees that action performed by someone else. The prospect of abiological explanation for empathyproved irresistible topopular sciencebook authors,Ted Talkersandmanagement gurusalike, resulting in a mirror-neuron-empathy hype cycle thatpeakedaround 2013 and began aprecipitous falloffjust as Obama was entering the lame duck era of his presidency and a new, reactionary political movement was preparing to be born.Not all of the backlash to Obama’s version of empathy came from the far right.In the 2016 book Against Empathy: The Case for Rational Compassion, the Yale psychology professor Paul Bloom argued that allowing empathy to guide our actions – particularly around philanthropy or politics – opens us up for emotional manipulation, unconscious bias and chauvinism. Leftwing critics have alsowarnedagainst the potential for a claim of empathy to bleed into colonizing others’ experiences. Empathy cannot replace mutual respect and recognition, as the bankers of Davos who cosplay as refugees as an “exercise in empathy” each year should surely know by now.View image in fullscreenDemonstrators hold signs in New York during a rally for ‘Trans Day of Visibility’ in March.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesA recent exchange in the Journal of Genocide Research saw scholarsdebating the limits of empathyin relation to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that for so long has been patronizingly presented as an issue that could be solved with just a bit more empathy on all sides. “Empathy can be ‘an extremely dangerous vision’ when the other is an invader,”wroteZahi Zalloua, a professor of philosophy and ethnic studies. “In the colonial situation it can get you killed.”There have also been signs of some empathy fatigue on the left, especially when it is demanded for people on the right. This was evident in the concentrated schadenfreude of themessage boardon which Reddit users gathered in 2021 to compile death notices of social media users who succumbed to Covid alongside their earlier posts declaring an intent not be vaccinated against the virus. Even more notable was thecollective refusalof Americans to extend empathy toward the family of Brian Thompson, the chief executive of UnitedHealthcare who was shot and killed in midtown Manhattan last December, with many declaring that their empathy was “out of network”. (This was an anti-empathetic act with an insistent core of empathy, however; the point of the refusal was not to deny Thompson’s humanity but to protest against how the health insurance industry systematically dehumanizes patients.)We just need to be a little bit less callous with the way … we talk about Doge-ing peopleJesse WattersBut what is happening on the American right is on an entirely different scale. Susan Lanzoni, a historian of psychology and author of Empathy: A History, said by email that through all her research into the intellectual history of empathy, she had “never seen empathy vilified in the way it has been in these current sources”.“The disparagement of empathy is the flip side, I believe, of a deliberate effort to set up a permission structure to dehumanize others, and to narrow the definition of who should be included in a democratic state, or in a Christian community,” she said. “To me, this disparagement marks a step in the destruction of our multicultural democracy, and provides a path from the verbal dehumanization of others to open discrimination and maltreatment.”Indeed, the rightwing critique of empathy is not an attempt to find a better way to achieve altruistic ends; it’s an excuse to turn away from altruism entirely. We are witnessing the construction of the ideological architecture to excuse violence and suffering on a mass scale. While the religious right attends to a moral justification, the secular right is hard at work on a pseudoscientific one. Meanwhile, the Maga movement has created an online culture that is steeped in an aesthetic of anti-empathy, from dismissing fellow human beings as “NPCs” (or non-player characters) to joking about relaxing to the “ASMR” sounds of human bondage.View image in fullscreenTrump supporters pray outside the courthouse where he is scheduled to be arraigned in Miami in June 2023.Photograph: Stephanie Keith/Getty ImagesFor them, empathy assumes the power of a phantasmagoric threat – it can subvert God’s will, corrupt the church, and end western civilization as we know it. The Christian and patriotic public must harden their hearts to any empathy that might prevent them from supporting the actions needed to “save” America – whether they be cutting off millions of people from live-saving medication, firing tens of thousands of public servants, threatening to invade sovereign countries, or rounding up and deporting the millions of workers on whose backs the entire economy rests. The fabrication of an existential threat in order to motivate popular support for otherwise unsupportable actions is a classic tactic of fascist regimes. Where Hitler focused on the supposedly all-powerful Jews, Trump has presented his supporters with a rotating cast of bogeymen, including Muslims, immigrants, transgender people, critical race theorists, federal employees and feminists. Conveniently, empathy manages to unite them all.If there is any consolation, it is perhaps in the fact that such work is even necessary.Take Jesse Watters, the shock jock of Fox News who built a career by ambushing people and filming their humiliation. As hard-hearted a Trump supporter as they come, Watters was nevertheless shaken in his enthusiasm for Musk’s federal job cuts when they hit first aveteran friendof his. “We just need to be a little bit less callous with the way … we talk about Doge-ing people,” he said on Fox News. “I finally found one person I knew that got Doged and it hit me in the heart.”Watters’ fit of compassion for his personal acquaintances was short-lived, but impactful, according to theAtlantic, which reported that Watters’ viral plea for a bit more empathy bothered Trump so much that he took his “first steps to rein in Musk’s powers”. Trump’s 100 days of frantic democratic destruction continue apace, but it seems noteworthy that he sensed in Watters’ reluctant admission to caring about other people a vulnerability that could prove to be his achilles heel.Empathy is not a sin, a toxin, or an evolutionary dead end. It is a tool, and like all tools it can be a weapon. We are going to need it."

They were so irrational that it felt like magical realism,” said Silvana Vicenti, the journalist who broke the story.According to the contracts, seen by the Guardian, Kailasa would control vast swathes of land, “with full sovereignty and autonomy” within each Indigenous territory including rights over the airspace and all natural resources above or below the ground.The Indigenous groups would be obliged to “defend Kailasa in any legal proceedings” and support its recognition “as a sovereign and independent state, protect it against aggression, and back its admission to international organisations such as the UN”.For Vicenti, it seemed like “a monarchy with Indigenous subjects”.Jhovana Morales, a lawyer from Fundación Tierra, an NGO that works on Indigenous land issues, said the contracts were abusive and violated several Bolivian laws. One example was the perpetual lease clause, as the civil code sets a maximum term of 10 years.“The contracts are a total scam,” said Morales. “But the strangest part is that, to this day, no one knows exactly what happened. First, how did they get in? … How did they reach these places and start directly approaching sectors of Indigenous Amazonian territory?”The Bolivian government has yet to provide all the answers.After the case broke, itissued a statementdenying diplomatic ties with the fictitious country.A photoof the Bolivian president, Luis Arce, smiling as he receives a book entitled United States of Kailasa from a woman wearing a saffron-coloured sari has begun circulating.View image in fullscreenPresident Luis Arce was pictured at event in which he received a book entitled United States of Kailasa from a woman wearing a sari.Photograph: Claudia Morales/ReutersAlthough Arce has not commented, his national director of migration, Katherine Calderón, said the woman had requested a picture with the president during an event – hosted by an Indigenous confederation in October – “as is common at any public gathering”.On 24 March, Calderón announced that Bolivia had expelled 20 foreigners “linked” to Kailasa – of different nationalities, including Indian, British, American and Chinese – who had entered the country as tourists but were seeking to “obtain land” in Indigenous territories.Experts such as Morales have criticised the decision, saying the government should have completed its investigation before expelling those who may have been involved.Bolivian journalist associations issued a joint statement denouncing threats reporters had received “from representatives of the self-proclaimed state of Kailasa” since they began covering the case.Nithyananda, whose whereabouts remains unknown, gave a“live presidential address”on social media last Wednesday to dispel “malicious rumours” allegedly spread by “anti-Hindu media outlets” claiming he was dead.He did not mention Bolivia directly, but his YouTube channel has published videos where his followersadmit to signing the lease agreementsand claim they sought to “support environmental protection … and [provide] humanitarian aid” to the Indigenous communities.The Guardian sent a list of questions to the Bolivian government and Kailasa’s “office of international relations” but has not received a response.The Multi-ethnic Indigenous Territory II organisation, which includes the Ese Ejja people who signed the contract, issued a statement that said Kailasa had “manipulated” some of its representatives and taken “advantage of their vulnerability to extract a signature with the promise of easy money”.The group added: “Our territory is not for sale, it is not for rent, and it is not subject to any kind of negotiation. Our land is the legacy of generations who have cared for and defended it with blood and resistance.”Explore more on these topicsBoliviaIndigenous peoplesIndiaAmericasSouth and central AsiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s been a busy week in tech news: Donald Trump’s tariffs led to an enormous sell-off of tech stocks; Elon Musk and Trump are playing will they, won’t they with the billionaire’s departure from the White House; and TikTok has been temporarily rescued from a ban, yet again.Tech backs Trump, loses out with Trump’s tariffsThe US stock market has lost more value in the days since Trump announced sweeping tariffs than all US equities were worth in total in 1990. Tech stocks, the most valuable on the US exchange, have suffered serious losses. Apple andNvidia, two of the five most valuable companies in the world, saw their share prices drop by double digits. Valuable startups Klarna and StubHub have postponed their anticipated initial public offerings because of the market turbulence that followed the tariff announcement. In marginally but personally devastating news, Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders were also delayed.With a globalized supply chain that touches dozens of countries, Apple is a big loser here, and serves as an emblem for the effect of the tariffs on most consumer electronics companies. Listing the nations where the iPhone’s components originate from creates a Venn diagram sporting a significant intersection with the countries Trump has penalized. Nvidia, the maker of one of the most highly specialized goods on the planet, is also suffering. There are only a handful of companies that can complete each step of the semiconductor manufacturing process, and the majority of them are not located in the US. Both companies rely on Asia, particularly China, for manufacturing, where Trump has imposed steep trade barriers. Apple has been moving some iPhone production to India in recent years, but the process hasn’t been fast enough to avoid the impact from the tariffs. The semiconductor industry will enjoy a carveout from some of the White House’s tariffs, but analysts predict that exception won’t be enough to keep costs stable or to fosterthe US semiconductor boom Trump desires. AI, an industry the US has heretofore led in, might become a lot more expensive because of the roadblocks erected to chip imports and production.Like Apple and Nvidia, Tesla has seen its stock sink by double digits. Musk’s carmaker relies on China for sales and manufacturing, and hisbuy-one-get-one-free event on the White House lawndoesn’t seem like it will save him from the worst of Trump’s economic retaliation. Musk broke with Trump over the weekend and said he hoped for a “zero-tariff” agreement between the US and the European Union. In response, the outgoing German economy minister said Trump’s economic models were “ridiculous” and Musk’s remarks were “a sign of weakness”. We can’t attribute Tesla’s stock slump to tariffs alone, though. First and foremost: it was already in decline before Trump’s announcements. No one is in the streets protesting against Tim Cook.Tech bet big on Trump. Its foremost delegates, the richest men in the world, sat with him and his family during his inauguration. We have yet to see how the industry – led by Tim Cook in this scenario, I predict – may try to persuade Trump to grant exemptions from the tariffs so as to keep the prices of iPhones stable. Cook is a more subtle statesman thanMark Zuckerberg. He personally gave $1m to Trump’s inauguration but didn’t appear on the dais beside the president during the ceremony. Apple has wriggled out of tight spots with Trump before, and it would seem to be in Trump’s best interest not to cause the price of America’s favorite phone to rocket.Trump teases Musk’s exit from the White HouseView image in fullscreenElon Musk attending a cabinet meeting at the White House on 25 March.Photograph: Carlos Barría/ReutersIn Wisconsin and on the stock market, Musk suffered dual losses last week. Then Donald Trump and JD Vance said the billionaire would exit the White House. When? Who can say.The remarks came after two serious blows to Musk. On Wednesday, Tesla reportedextremely weak delivery numbersfor the first quarter of 2025. The same day, theliberal candidate in a special electionto the Wisconsin supreme court won. Musk had backed the conservative candidate with $20m and multiple appearances in a cheesehead.Though this is a low point for Musk in both politics and business, it is not the end of his alliance with Trump.***My colleague Nick Robins-Early reports:After months of exerting extraordinary power over the US government and becoming a mascot for Trump’s new administration, the first signs that may shift away from his prominent role in the White House began to appear this week.Both Trump and JD Vance have stated in interviews over the past few days that Musk would eventually leave the administration and the “department of government efficiency” (Doge) that he founded, their most direct statements yet on his tenure. Politico also reported on Wednesday that Trump had told members of his inner circle that theTeslaCEO would be departing in the coming weeks, though Musk called the article “fake news”. Musk is a “special government employee”, a designation that technically carries a 130-day term that, depending on how the administration chooses to log those days, could run out at the end of May. Vance made sure to say that Musk would remain a close “friend and adviser” to the administration even after leaving, further muddying the waters on how to mark Musk’s potential departure.The question of exactly when Musk may leave the White House, however, is less consequential than the circumstances of his exit. Rather than an explosive split that many commentators predicted, Trump has repeatedly defended Musk, and there has been little public indication from either man of anything acrimonious. Politico reported that Trump has been pleased with Musk’s performance even as the president forecasts the billionaire leaving. Musk instead appears set to keep his close ties with the president and retain the wealth, influence and intent to shape the country’s politics.Read Nick’s full analysis.Trump pauses the TikTok ban againView image in fullscreenThe TikTok offices in Culver City, California.Photograph: Daniel Cole/ReutersOn Friday, Trump signed an executive order to keepTikTokonline for another two and a half months.***My colleague Dara Kerr reports:This is the second time the president will have delayed the ban or sale of the social media app, and will punt the deadline to 75 days from now.The TikTok deal “requires more work to ensure all necessary approvals are signed”, Trump announced on his Truth Social platform on Friday.ByteDance, TikTok’s parent company, issued a statement in response to the executive order: “ByteDance has been in discussion with the US government regarding a potential solution for TikTok US. An agreement has not been executed. There are key matters to be resolved. Any agreement will be subject to approval under Chinese law.”China put a possible deal on hold this week after Trump announced his sweeping tariffs, according to Reuters.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now, however, the likes of Musk,Jeff Bezosand Anduril founder Palmer Luckey have extraordinary influence on national security operations, thanks to close personal relationships with Trump.***James Risen reports for the Guardian:The emergence of Musk, Bezos and a handful of other pro-Trump billionaires as key players in US intelligence marks a radical change in US spy operations, which have traditionally been controlled by career government officials working closely with a few longstanding defense and intelligence contractors, giant corporations such as Lockheed Martin, RTX and Northrop Grumman that are adept at lobbying both Democrats and Republicans in Washington. But with Musk, Bezos and other pro-Trump Silicon Valley figures gaining an edge through their personal ties to Trump, civil servants in the intelligence community may be reluctant to deny them ever-larger contracts, especially since Trump has already fired several inspectors general who investigated Musk’s businesses in other areas of the government.Anticipating big rewards, Musk is reportedly joining forces with other pro-Trump billionaires to try to carve up the defense and intelligence business. SpaceX is working with Palantir, a hi-tech data analytics intelligence contractor co-founded by Peter Thiel, one of the most prominent rightwing figures in Silicon Valley; Anduril, a new defense contractor founded by 32-year-old pro-Trump tech bro Palmer Luckey; and several other Silicon Valley firms to form a consortium geared towards loosening the grip of the defense industry’s traditional players.It is hard to separate Silicon Valley’s calls for breaking up the oligarchy now controlling the defense and intelligence business from the eagerness of pro-Trump tech bros to grab as much power and cash as possible while creating a new oligarchy of their own.Read the full story.The wider TechScapeOpenAI raises $40bn in deal with SoftBank that values it at $300bnMeta faces £1.8bn lawsuit over claims it inflamed violence in Ethiopia‘Profiting from misery’: how TikTok makes money from child begging livestreamsUK Home Office loses attempt to keep legal battle with Apple secretAustralia’s social media ban is attracting global praise – but we’re no closer to knowing how it would workRevealed: Trump’s fossil-fuel donors to profit from data-center boom and green rollbacksExplore more on these topicsElon MuskTechScape newsletterDonald TrumpUS politicsAppleNvidiaTrump tariffsTeslanewslettersShareReuse this content"

The prime minister, Pham Minh Chinh, even joked in January that he would happily “play golf all day long” at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home in Florida if it could “bring benefits to my country and my people”.The strategies do not appear to have worked. Trump has inflicted an extraordinary 46% tariff onVietnamthat threatens to devastate its economic growth plans and undermine relations between the two countries. The tariff has sent shock waves through Vietnam, a manufacturing powerhouse where Trump has always been fairly popular, and across south-east Asia.Across the region, which is highly dependent on exports, Trump is introducing similarly punishing tariffs, including in Cambodia (49%), Laos (48%), Thailand (36%), Indonesia (32%), Malaysia (24%), Brunei (24%), the Philippines (17%), and Singapore (10%).The announcement has damaged the US’s reputation as a reliable partner in the region, said Kevin Chen an associate research fellow with the US programme at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, in Singapore. The Trump administration’s approach was “unilateral, coercive, and undermines the trading system that countries in this region prospered under”, Chen said.South-east Asia is a strategically important region for the US, especially in light of Washington’s competition withChinaand tensions in the South China Sea.Vietnam and the US had grown closer under Trump’s predecessor, Joe Biden, with thetwo countries upgrading their partnership. Trump is known to be well liked in Vietnam, where his books are translated into Vietnamese, and he has gained respect as a businessman and as a politician tough on China.Yet relations between the US and south-east Asia have been undermined in recent months. The tariff announcement comes on top of thegutting of USAIDand other foreign assistance programmes, which halted life-saving projects across the region.America’s image has also been damaged in recent years in countries including the Muslim-majority Malaysia and Indonesia, owing to Washington’s support for Israel during its war on Gaza. US companies have been targeted with prolonged boycotts in both countries.China is expected to try to capitalise on the chaos. Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, is due to visit Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia this month and “will likely use the opportunity to portray China as a steadfast and reliable partner in contrast to the US”, Chen said. A slew of economic agreements are expected to be signed between China and those countries by the end of his visit.In the longer term, whether China can leverage frustration in south-east Asia is less straightforward, say analysts, especially as Beijing risks becoming embroiled in a worsening trade war with its superpower rival.Trump hasthreatened China with an extra 50% tariff, which will exacerbate the economic difficulties already affecting dynamics between China and its south-east Asian neighbours.Peter Mumford, the head of practice for south-east Asia at Eurasia Group, said the region was “grappling with a flood of low-cost Chinese goods, and that’s going to get even more complicated”. The oversupply of cheap goods, from clothing to steel, had damaged small businesses and contributed to hundreds of factories closing in Thailand.South-east Asian leaders will seek to diversify by looking to Europe or Japan, say analysts, while also scrambling to negotiate with Trump.It is unclear what countries such as Vietnam can offer to placate Washington. Vietnam’s trade surplus with the US has surpassed $123bn, a figure that has grown rapidly over recent years as companies moved there from China to skirt tariffs imposed by the previous Trump administration.“Trump would likely push Vietnam to commit to purchasing significantly more American goods and services. As Vietnam has been seen as a conduit for China to bypass US tariffs, the Trump administration may also demand that Vietnam restrict transshipment of Chinese goods,” said Phan Dung, research officer of the Vietnam Studies Programme at the ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute, in Singapore.Vietnam was doing its best to negotiate to persuade the US to reduce the tariffs, said Khang Vu, a visiting scholar in the political science department at Boston College. But, he added, the US tariffs would “damage the Vietnamese government’s goodwill toward the Trump administration”.He said Trump’s tariffs on Vietnamese goods showed Hanoi that, despite everything Washington had said of Vietnam’s regional importance, their partnership was “dispensable”.Countries in the region would be cautious about leaning too closely to China, already south-east Asia’s largest trading partner. In the past the US had served as a counterbalance in the region. “The major difference this time,” said Chen, “is that they will need to account for a potentially unfriendly, if not hostile United States as well as an assertive China.”Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsVietnamAsia PacificChinaTariffsDonald TrumpInternational tradeanalysisShareReuse this content"

So the very online candidate for a solid blue congressional seat inIllinoisis channeling her energy into in-person events.The entry fee for her campaign’s kick-off event was a box of tampons or pads to be donated to The Period Collective, a Chicago-based non-profit that distributes free menstrual products to low-income communities in the area. The debut was such a success, she said, theyfilled her campaign manager’s SUVwith donations. (“I want him to get pulled over so bad,” Abughazalehquippedin a video for her YouTube series How to Run for Congress.) It’s part of her pledge to disrupt politics as usual and run a campaign that promotes mutual aid and community organizing rather than a candidate-centered “vanity project” that relies on expensive TV ads and “grifty” fundraising texts.“This is about trying a new type of campaign,” Abughazaleh said in an interview with the Guardian shortly after launching her campaign, with a video that asked: “What if we didn’t suck?”Abughazaleh’s campaign arrives at a moment whenDemocrats are furiouswith their party’s leadership and demanding change to a political status quo long dominated by septuagenarians and octogenarians. Despite astring of recent electoral gains, polls show the party is demoralized: their popularity is at an all-time low and, according to one survey, the overwhelming majority of Democratic voterssayelderly leaders should pass the torch to the next generation of leaders. The party is also desperate to expand their presence – and influence – on social media where their carefully crafted messaging often falls flat.Her pitch seems to have struck a chord. In the week after Abughazaleh launched her campaign, she said it had raised more than $300,000 and received more than 1,000 volunteer sign-ups.“I am sick of waiting around for someone to do something,” she said, speaking via videoconference from her apartment inChicago, where she has a set-up for recordings and interviews. “There is no mythical, perfect candidate that’s coming out of the woodwork to save us.”After Democrats’ devastating 2024 defeat, Abughazaleh has criticized what she describes as the party’s lack of a post-Trump vision and its attachment to political norms and bipartisanship that Republicans have long abandoned.“This is [the result of] just continually not listening to voters, not considering any other solutions, even if they might be different,” she said. “There’s a lot of talk about being a big tent, but it feels like they’re only extending that tent to the right, and they’re kicking the rest of us out.”Abughazaleh, who boasts more than 200,000 followers on TikTok, flatly rejects the view that Democrats’ losses are the result of the party becoming “too woke” or too supportive of trans rights and pro-Palestinian protests. A Texas native and the daughter of a Palestinian immigrant, Abughazaleh displays her keffiyeh – the black and white checkered headscarf that has long symbolized Palestinian rights – prominently in her campaignvideo. Last year, she was one of the more than 200 content creators credentialed to cover the Democratic national convention in Chicago, where pleas to include a Palestinian American speaker weredismissed.“The Democratic party ignored us during 2024,” she said. “I kept saying, like, talk to one Arab person to just show, like, some empathy on the issue of Gaza, which now we know impacted a lot of voters staying home.”Having worked as an extremism researcher at the liberal watchdog group Media Matters, she warns that authoritarian regimes often begin their power grab by cracking down on LGBTQ+ rights and implored Democrats not to be complicit in the Trump administration’s attacks on trans people.“Democrats deciding that trans people are the reason they lost the election in 2024 – it’s ridiculous. It’s offensive, and frankly, they are contributing to Trump’s authoritarianism,” she said in a recent CNN interview that her campaign clipped and promoted. “A far bigger issue is that we aren’t giving people something to vote for.”Illinois’s ninth district, anchored in Chicago’s North Side and stretching west, is one of the most reliably blue congressional districts in the state and has been represented by Jan Schakowsky since 1999 – the year Abughazaleh was born. In the interview, Abughazaleh said her candidacy was not intended as a “referendum” on the 80-year-old Democrat who has not said yet whether she intends to seek re-election. Nor is it a leftwing challenge, she said, acknowledging Schakowsky’s progressive record.“This is about: we need to try something different,” Abughazaleh said, arguing that the party has lost touch with many of its voters, especially young people. “A lot of these people in Congress never had to go through school shooting drills at school. I did. A lot of them haven’t had to worry about insurance ever in their lives. I don’t have insurance. I use GoodRx as my insurance. These are things that are very common for young people and just not for most people in Congress.”In a statement, Schakowsky said she planned to make a decision on her re-election “soon” but she welcomed “new faces getting involved as we stand up against the Trump administration”.Abughazaleh’s candidacy has also piqued interest on the right. “Now, even longtime liberals are facing the wrath of their own movement,” Mike Marinella, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Campaign said in a statement that claimed Democrats were so astray that they were now “eating their own”.Asked by a reporter whether Abughazaleh’s entry into the race was a worrying sign for Democratic incumbents, Hakeem Jeffries, the House minority leader, said at the time that he was unaware of her campaign and hailed Schakowsky as a “longstanding, stalwart progressive member”.But he also acknowledged that Democrats were confronting “a lot of energy, a lot of angst, a lot of anxiety” in response to Trump’s return to power.Sharing a clip of Jeffries’ response, Abughazaleh replied: “Nice to meet you, Hakeem! It’s time to get familiar.”Despite her desire to campaign differently, there are some old rules of politics that may be harder to break.Abughazaleh is a recent Chicago transplant who doesn’t technically live in the district, at least not yet, a status that has generated accusations of “carpetbagging”. Addressing the criticism in a YouTube video, Abughazalehsaidshe and her partner moved to the city abruptly last year and took the first furnished apartment they could find – a place “literally one bus stop” away from the ninth district. The move had nothing to do with her desire to run for office, a decision she said she made after KamalaHarris lost the election and she felt the urge to get involved. Abughazaleh said she intends to move in-district, but cited the cost of breaking her lease as part of the reason she hasn’t done so yet.Supporters also raised concerns about her pledge not to spend money on TV ads, which some argued would put her at a disadvantage in a competitive contest. She said her campaign would re-evaluate the policy.Before entering politics, Abughazaleh spent years monitoring Fox News and other rightwing media at Media Matters. She waslaid offlast year after legal battles with Musk sapped the progressive group of its resources, in a move that theFreedom of the Press Foundationwarned at the time was a worrying example of “billionaires and pandering politicians abusing the legal system to retaliate against their critics”. Muskcelebratedher job loss on X: “Karma is real.”In that sense, Abughazaleh can empathize with the tens of thousands of government employees who have lost their jobs as part of Musk’s chainsaw-approach to downsizing the federal workforce.“People are pissed off for good reason. They’re losing their jobs, they’re losing their healthcare, they’re losing the people in their community who are being deported without any due process. Of course, they’re mad, and we should be matching that with anger.”After watching Fox News nearly every day for four years, Abughazaleh said there were some lessons Democrats could learn from the right.“Throwing some metaphorical punches, not reacting to everything,” she said. “What if we didn’t just let them set the agenda all the time? What if we came out strong?”Explore more on these topicsDemocratsIllinoisHouse of RepresentativesUS politicsProtestChicagofeaturesShareReuse this content"

Firing someone for a security violation gave Doge an excuse to circumvent the defenses of civil service protection, or performance reviews, or seniority.Loose badge. Gone.If being fired for leaving a badge at a bathroom break seemed arbitrary to those working at the CDC – some for decades – then the mass firings on 1 April made it brutally so. On that day thousands of federal workers at the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) all of its branches and related agencies across the country were let go in a culling indicative of Donald Trump’s second term.Roughly 10,000 people lost their jobs at agencies including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health in a continuation of one of the largest mass firings in American history.Among the cuts to the CDC: the entire Freedom of Information Act team, the Division of Violence Prevention, laboratories that test antibiotic resistance and a team that determines recalls for dangerous baby products.“There’s been no guidance and no leadership,” said one CDC scientist who still has a job, speaking on condition of anonymity. “This week has just been looking through the wreckage for survivors.”A week of chaos and confusionThe scope of the cuts remains a mystery to federal health workers, including it seems the Department of Health and Human Services secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, who said as much as 20% of the cuts may bemistakes, and moved to reinstate some staff fired in error. Kennedy said that “was always the plan”.In the hours after the cuts, an aqua-green dry erase board in a library at the CDC headquarters in Atlanta tallied the losses Tuesday morning like a casualty board for earthquake victims.View image in fullscreenDry erase boards at the CDC.Photograph: Obtained by the GuardianThe words “DO NOT ERASE” topped a constellation of acronyms like NCCDPHP for the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, or NCICP for the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control. Under each top line followed a second set of acronyms showing the branches of each department that had been pruned, like the Women’s Health and Fertility Branch (WHFB) of the Division of Reproductive Health, or the Violence Prevention Practice and Translation Branch (VPTB) in the Division of Violence Prevention.No real warning had been given about who would keep their job and who could expect to be fired. Right up until Doge sent reduction-in-force notices to inboxes early Tuesday morning, even supervisors had no idea who would be left.People gathered around the board for updates as word drifted in from colleagues about cuts, as it was the only planning document staff leaders had. Health workers circulated updated pictures of it through informal group chats and Discord servers.Scientists began breaking down in tears in the library stacks.An inquiry to the CDC about the scope of the cuts and its plan was routed to HHS.“All statutorily required positions and offices will remain intact, and as a result of the reorganization, will be better positioned to execute on Congress’s statutory intent,” said Emily G Hilliard, a deputy press secretary for the department. Hilliard claimed the “collaborative” process “included three rounds of feedback from each division”, and that “HHS leaders focused personnel cuts on redundant or unnecessary administrative positions”.Thefact sheetHilliard provided contained no references to the scientific functions lost in the purge.Heartbreak and warnings of dangerShelby Hutton, a biologist working on HIV research, learned she had been fired on 1 April. “We had until the end of the day to pack up our personal belongings before we lost all access,” she said at a press conference with Nikema Williams, the Democratic congresswoman representing Atlanta, on Friday.“We were given no time to conduct an orderly shutdown of the laboratories to ensure that our sensitive equipment and priceless biohazardous specimens were protected and stored properly.”Fired staffers like Hutton found themselves mourning not just for their lost jobs, but because they are acutely aware that without their research some people will die who would have otherwise lived, but for the research they had been conducting.View image in fullscreenPeople demonstrate outside the main campus of the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on 1 April 2025 in Atlanta, Georgia.Photograph: Elijah Nouvelage/Getty ImagesLaboratories around the world submit biological samples and testing data to the CDC, which maintains a repository of historical information for research references.In critical areas like antibiotic-resistant infection surveillance, no one is left at the labs to take those samples, one scientist said.Hospitals also ask the CDC for advice when seeing a novel illness. But the process of examining those requests and answering them has been disrupted, said Kevin Pettus, a 30-year-old veteran scientist at the agency who lost his job last week.“I think when they decided to cut our branch, they didn’t think this through,” he said. “If the agenda was to make America healthy again, all Elon Musk and 47 have done is make this country in a worse position than it already was.“What has occurred has put everybody in danger, not just our families, but their families as well. Some of this needs to be addressed and addressed immediately and reversed.”Kennedy, the US health secretary, said at a press availability Wednesday that administrative roles, not research, was the Doge target. But as healthcare workers piece together the scope of the cuts, it’s clear that the cuts struck bone, not fat.“The US had incredible research infrastructure and was doing incredible research to identify the next cure, to prevent the next disease, and that’s what’s being cut,” said Carmen Marsit, executive associate dean at Emory University’s Rollins School of Public Health.“I mean, the government has made enormous investments in many of these drugs, in many of the programs that have been developed, and now we’re ready to move them over the finish line and really get them to act. And that’s being stopped.”Widespread cuts impact health and safetyAs federal workers learn of the work that has been stalled and teams have been cut, the impact is slowly becoming clear.Among the cuts are almost everyone at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which among other things, monitors air quality around fracking drill sites, tests personal protective technology and provides injury data to government agencies for recalling consumer products like defective baby cribs.The office of Smoking and Health at the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion saw its public health work disrupted. As did the division of violence prevention, injury prevention and informatics at the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control. Among other things, the division researches gun violence and domestic violence, which both spiked during the pandemic, with the goal of reducing sexual assault and gun deaths.Cuts hit the laboratories researching viral hepatitis and sexually transmitted diseases at National Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention, as well as the Division of HIV Prevention’s communication, surveillance and research branches.The Global Health Center at the CDC saw health informatics, scientific integrity and special initiatives for HIV and tuberculosis decimated.View image in fullscreenPeople demonstrate outside the main campus of the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on 1 April 2025 in Atlanta, Georgia.Photograph: Elijah Nouvelage/Getty ImagesAnd amid a larger effort to dismantle environmental protection, workers were cut at the asthma and air quality monitoring and childhood lead prevention teams in the CDC’s environmental health division.Other CDC reductions include the technology branch of the Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics, housing the software engineers and computer scientists supporting a new center created amid the Covid-19 pandemic to help predict disease outbreaks.CDC staff had already been navigating the impact of a deluge of executive orders raining from Trump’s pen since January. At one point, research databases had been taken off line to comply with an order to replace all references to “gender” with “sex,” even in scientific research documentation.But at least then, the CDC had staff ready to fix a problem. Now workers say the problems will emerge and the people who understand how to solve those problems are gone.Insiders say only a skeleton staff remains in dozens of departments and branches, capable only of performative gestures toward the work mandated by law and congressional budgets.Looking forwardStanding across the street from the CDC headquarters on a busy street near Emory University, Atlanta drivers honked in support as congresswoman Williams stood with fired CDC workers at a press conference.Williams called the CDC the “pride of the fighting fifth”, a reference to Trump’s disrespect for the city that began with his conflict with the late congressman John Lewis and Georgia’s fifth congressional district.“It is in these moments of public transgressions against our communities that our reaction in the name of justice and prosperity must be loud and clear,” she said, describing the firings as illegal and unconstitutional. “We fight for the health and decency of our country.“We fight in our communities.”Explore more on these topicsUS healthcareTrump administrationRobert F Kennedy JrUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

All six of them, two adults and four children, were poisoned by carbon monoxide gas seeping out from their coal-fired stove into their home in Ulaanbaatar in January, the coldest month in the world’s coldest capital city.Mongolians were touched by the tragedy but there was anger a month later when, during atwo-day parliamentary hearingforced by a public petition against pollution levels, the government released figures showing there had been 779 deaths from carbon monoxide poisoning in the country in the past seven years. By 19 February, when a couple in their 40s were found lifeless in their bed, that number had risen to 811.Yet coal is killing people far beyond the accidental carbon monoxide leaks as winter in Ulaanbaatar, a valley city, becomes ever more deadly.View image in fullscreenNomadic herders are being driven off the steppe into makeshift settlements in cities, with half the country’s population now living in Ulaanbaatar.Anestimated 7,000 citizensof this vast, thinly populated country of 3.48 million have died this winter due to air pollution, indoors and out. Respiratory diseases, liver and lung cancers, asthma and recurrent flu bouts are rife, while pneumonia is the leading cause of children being hospitalised and pollution is thesecond highest cause of deathin under fives. Women try to time pregnancies to avoid the coldest months, when the rates of miscarriage and premature birth soar.Pollution levels have been climbing inMongoliafor almost a decade. No longer just an issue in the capital, it affects every province, every settlement.Temperatures can dip to -28C(-18.4F) in the winter months and it is coal that keeps the fires burning round the clock in homes, schools, industries and power stations. In January 2018,levels of PM2.5– ultra-fine carcinogenic particles – reached133 times the WHO safe limitsin Ulaanbaatar, leading to a government ban on raw coal within the city, although not elsewhere in the country. A government-subsidised coal briquette was introduced, but these have introduced different toxic particles, and are behind the steep rise in carbon monoxide poisonings. About70% of Mongolia’s energycomes from coal.The climate crisis has exacerbated the situation. Theextreme winter of 2024killed more than 10 million of Mongolia’s 64 million animals, pushing some herding families from the wide open spaces of the steppes, where the nomadic way of life was strong, into the cities to look for work and schools that aren’t cut off or closed for weeks during heavy snowfall. Due to a lack of housing in Ulaanbaatar, people buildgers– circular white tents clad with felt around a thin latticed-wood frame. The structures have no running water and a central stove feeds out through a chimney pipe in the roof. Pit latrines are dug outside. More than 50% of Mongolia’s population live in gers, with about 800,000 people in Ulaanbaatar alone – about half the city’s population. An estimated 196,000 domestic chimneys puff coal fumes into the dry city air, with each household burning an average of 23kg of coal daily in winter.View image in fullscreenLast year millions of animals did not survive the particularly cold winter in Mongolia.At the 680-bed child and maternity hospital in north Ulaanbaatar, built by the Russians, who left Mongolia in 1992, Dr Oyuchiney Aatsan has some advice: “For those with kids getting sick non-stop? Get out of town. That is what we advise to the wealthiest.”In winter the hospital opens five intensive care units for children with pneumonia, while asthma, bronchitis and leukaemia rates rise.“We are also quite used to seeing carbon monoxide poisonings. Actually, last night we had none,” Aatsan says in surprise. “There is no follow-up with such cases, so we don’t know if the child goes on to have violent outbursts, mood swings, cognitive impairment. Mild symptoms and we can save the child, but not always their brain.I grew up in the countryside where winter used to be loved, winter meant something beautiful. Now, it is dreadedDr Oyuchiney Aatsan“At this time of year we struggle; we receive 300 to 400 cases a day, and we can’t send children home to recover because the indoor air quality in the gers can be very poor.”Pneumonia survival rates remain good, she says, although the impact of repeated illnesses on children’s immune systems lasts for life, and growing antibiotic resistance is “a very big concern”.“The deaths are mostly among the babies. Premature births and miscarriage rates are very bad in the winter. I feel sorry that we have a vast beautiful country, so big, and we are all crammed in this small place and our children are sick.“I grew up in the countryside where winter used to be loved: winter meant something beautiful. Now, it is dreaded. Why on earth can we not solve this problem?”View image in fullscreenDr Oyuchiney Aatsan (in the white coat) in the children’s intensive care unit at the capital’s main hospital.Globally,air pollution is the second biggest killerof children under five after malnutrition, according to Unicef, witheast Asia especiallyaffected. It kills7 million people a year, and Ulaanbaatar is far from the worst-polluted, with cities such as Lahore, Delhi and Chengdu jostling for top spot.Dr Jigjidsuren Chinburen is an MP, oncologist and former director of Mongolia’s cancer centre. He has just completed a study showing a link between pollution andliver cancer– previously thought to be an illness mostly caused by alcohol abuse.“For cancers there is a very clear link with burning coal, especially lung cancer, but we hadn’t expected to see liver cancer. It’s a new discovery,” he says. “But it is not just cancer: the effect on babies is an emergency. We know PM2.5 can reach unborn babies in the womb. We have smaller babies in polluted areas and the rate of live births drops down during the pollution season, by 15 to 25%.”View image in fullscreenTraffic causes about 29% of pollution compared with up to 55% from coal in Ulaanbaatar, according to the city’s air pollution data specialist.Chinburen gave evidence at February’s parliamentary hearings and bemoans the lack of a national plan. He believes too many people are making money producing and selling coal, as well as manufacturing the stoves.“We need our government to support the people who are trying to fight air pollution. In the short term, we need to insulate housing and refine the coal,” he says.“We can solve it easily, we just need a good heart. Don’t think about the money, think about the health. Everyone is breathing this air – the poor and the wealthy.”In his shared office, five floors up in the Mongolian metrological office, Unurbat Dory is the sole collator of the country’s data on air pollution. He monitors 43 air quality stations and 19 automatic stations around Ulaanbaatar, where the levels of six noxious gases are measured. The rest are manually operated and in the provinces, where only NO2 and CO2 levels are collected.View image in fullscreenAir quality specialist Unurbat Dory looks out from his office across a smoggy cityscape.“In the city the latest figures show 55-56% [of pollution] comes from the ger districts, traffic causes 28-29%, and the rest is the power stations,” he says. “Generally – not on a bad day – the readings show pollution is 12 to 13 times higher than the safe standard, so you can imagine the health impact.“Mid-November to mid-February is when pollution is at its worst, so if you look at the data of the annual average, Mongolia doesn’t look so bad. But it is. You know that the colder it is, the worse the air quality will be because of the burning of coal.”He adds: “SO2 [sulphur dioxide] reached a reading of 702 [micrograms per cubic meter] on 28 January2024. The standard we should be meeting is 50.”Dory would like to measure lead levels as well. “It’s unreported information that the vehicle fuel we import has a lot of lead.”Climate has always steered Mongolia’s fate. Scientists suggest that the 13th-century Mongolian empire, the biggest land empire the world has ever seen, emerged thanks to a run of mild winters that had strengthened the people and their horses. At as much as 12m sq miles (31m sq km), it stretched from China to western Europe at its peak, twice the area the Romans managed to control. Genghis Khan united the nomadic peoples, set about his military campaign, but also promoted trade and religious tolerance and banned torture and enslavement. It is a history in which modern Mongolians take pride, and continues to inspire activists to believe they can make their country a better place.But plans touted before have come to nothing: at February’s parliamentary hearings, political analyst Ganbayar Javkhlan, said responsibility for pollution control efforts “were unclear, implementation efforts had been inconsistent, financing had been inefficient, and monitoring and evaluation had been inadequate”.View image in fullscreenGer districts in the city are growing as extreme weather makes traditional herding life harder.A proposal to move households into apartments has been suggested but there is a shortage of decent or insulated housing, and a suspicion of high-rise living among nomadic people. In the ramshackle jumble of gers and illegally thrown up shacks in Ulaanbaatar, everyone has some kind of fenced plot of land between them and their neighbour, a free space few city dwellers in the world could boast for their own.“There is a lot of desire from people living in ger areas to stay in ger areas,” says Mungunkhishig Batbaatar, the father of a child hospitalised twice with pneumonia. “They just want clean electricity and sanitation.”Batbaatar started the petition that triggered the February hearing after it reached 71,000 signatures in three hours, supported by Enkhuun Byambadorj, founder of the Breathe Mongolia campaign.View image in fullscreenBags of coal stacked outside homes are a familiar sight in the city.Batbaatar believes ger dwellers have been useful scapegoats for a government with little inclination to solve the pollution and housing problems.He says: “There has been this rhetoric that the people who live in gers are the polluters, rather than the victims – they are to blame for burning the coal and they should go back to the countryside. Politically, it’s a hot potato that gets tossed from minister to minister with no one ever taking responsibility.“Yet just insulating homes could drop air pollution by 40 to 60%. That is the lowest hanging fruit; it is really quite simple and the money is there.” He says Mongolia, blessed with wide open spaces and few cloudy days, then needs to look to green energies: thermal, solar and wind.View image in fullscreenByambauren Gansukh inside her ger with her daughters Khuslen Zaya, 11 (left) and Amin Erdene 10. She had to stop using her electric heater after energy prices doubled.Change has to be serious, as tinkering on the edges has been ineffective: for example, a UN project to replace ger stoves with electric ones has stalled.Byambauren Gansukh, sitting with two of her six daughters, Amin Erdene, 10 and Khuslen Zaya, 11, says she unplugged her free electric heater after one month and reinstated their coal stove.“The electricity price had doubled,” she shrugs. “Although they took away the carbon monoxide alarm when they gave me this, so I’m left worse off. Back to coal but now with no alarm if it goes wrong.”Stepping from the warmth of her ger into the freezing air, Gansukh gestures to the familiar sight of her stash of dust-coated coal bags, brought by one of the many delivery lorries that constantly prowl the city.She understands the link between the coal and her daughters’ frequent illnesses, but has no alternative.And the population of the city is growing. Batbold Vandan was a herder who arrived in October after losing his animals last winter. Now, he is one of three janitors at School 151 who work in rotating 24-hour shifts feeding the school boiler, which consumes 30 25kg bags of coal a day.View image in fullscreenBatbold Vandon is a janitor at a school in Ulaanbaatar, which is heated by polluting coal-fired boilers.Outside the hot boiler room, where the stifling black dust settles like tar, Vandan says: “It was a hard decision to move to the city, very hard. I found this job easily enough, but I didn’t know the pollution was so bad here. If you think about the air then certainly it was better in the countryside. That is where I’d rather be.”Afew hours drive from Ulaanbaatar, in the steppes of Khentii province, birthplace of Gengis Khan, the herding life is still surviving. The view from the door of the family ger of herders Baterdene Tuvshintur and Baigal Batulzii is of an idyllic valley framed by curving, snow-covered hills. Cows and sheep drift about, some with colourful blankets tied to their backs.Inside, their two youngest children play with a lamb, born too early for the -18C day, which has come inside for warmth. The eldest is at school in the nearest town – also affected by poor air quality – where he boards during the week.View image in fullscreenNomadic herdsmen look after their livestock on plains in the heart of the Mongolian steppe, Khentii province.“Living out here is the best,” says Tuvshintur. “The stress, the pollution, all is gone.” The couple, in matching handmade animal-skin boots, met in Ulaanbaatar. She was a student and he worked for a meat processing firm. The Covid pandemic closed down his company and he used the sale of his flat to return to the herding life of his youth, buying the ger and animals of his dreams. For Batulzii, this life was maybe not a dream, but she is adjusting and thinks her children are healthier here, although she misses having coffee with her friends. Even though the sheltered valley escaped the worst of the severe winter of 2024, they were snowed in for a month.“We won’t go back to the city,” they agree. “This is the life that should be available to all our citizens and their children if they want it.”View image in fullscreenBaterdene Tuvshintur and his wife, Baigal Batulzi, left Ulaanbaatar with their children to become herders.The environmentalists say solutions to Mongolia’s deadly air are within easy reach if the political will can be mustered. However, spring is here already. And memories are short.At the meteorological office Dory is dutifully sending off his reports on air quality to the government ministries. Does he think anyone looks at them? “Some do, some don’t. Nobody cares, as after winter the air pollution is not so bad and everyone forgets.“Then once winter starts they are surprised again.”The headline on this article was amended on 8 April 2025. Ulaanbaatar is not the world’s coldest city, but the world’s coldest capital as stated in the article itself.Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentMongoliaAir pollutionCities and developmentCoalfeaturesShareReuse this content"

His company, The Gym Group, has rolled out Hyrox training sessions to about half of its 245 sites and prides itself on being the biggest club for the discipline in the UK.However, the silver-haired chief executive has a confession to make: he has never done a Hyrox competitive event, although he has done some training.“They’re quite demanding; that’s not to say I couldn’t do it,” he tells theObserveras we meet in the no-frills gym chain’s new site in Elephant and Castle, south London. “I’m old-school – I go on the treadmill and the rowing machines.”Hyrox is certainly not for the out of shape: participants have to perform eight 1km runs on a treadmill, each followed by a workout on a different station, such as the sled, sandbag lunge or wall ball.Launched in Germany eight years ago and touted as the sport for everybody, it has become particularly popular with twentysomethings, who post social media snaps of themselves training for races held around the world. Christian Yanga, the Elephant & Castle gym manager, says their oldest member doing Hyrox is 75, while the youngest is 16.The craze is just one leg of a strategy has helped The Gym Group become one of the biggest players in the fitness sector. Founded in 2007 by the former England squash player and accountant John Treharne as Britain’s first budget, 24-hour gym chain, it has since grown to 951,000 members, with plans to open 50 more gyms in the next three years.Orr says the founder was inspired by what other no-frills players, such as Premier Inn and easyJet, were doing in their sectors. “It’s about really focusing on the things that matter … great equipment, a nice, big space that’s clean and safe and well run, and engineer out some of the things that are less important to people, like a receptionist, somebody laundering towels, and a swimming pool.”Initially backed by Phoenix Equity Partners and Bridges Ventures,the chain floated in London in 2015and has a market value of £237m, down by a third since the IPO. Its main low-cost rival, PureGym, set up in 2009, is the biggest chain in the UK in terms of sites (412) and members (1.5 million). The Gym Group tried to merge with PureGym in 2014 but the deal was blocked by the competition watchdog.Gyms and fitness are increasingly part of the identity of emerging generations. It’s part of how they want to liveToday, one in six people aged 16 or over in the UK are members of a gym, and numbers are growing. Providers range from £200-a-month luxury health clubs, such as David Lloyd Leisure or Third Space, which offer hot yoga andreformer pilatesat the top end, to Virgin Active and Fitness First in the middle, and PureGym and The Gym Group at the low-cost end, with contract-free membership from £14.99 a month and a £15 joining fee.The Gym Group’s sites are open around the clock – members can get in, with a code, to work out at 3am if they wish – with 24/7 CCTV monitored externally when there are no staff on site. The chain signed up to the mayor of London’s women’s night safety charter in 2022.In fact, there are now more 24-hour gyms than 24-hour licensed nightclubs in the capital, confounding predictions that the fitness sector might never bounce back from the pandemic boom in home workouts.Orr, who was headhunted from theTimesto become chief executive of the company in August 2023, says that, as a no-contract business, it had to build its membership back from scratch after lockdowns. “But it came back very quickly. Like so many other businesses in that period, it was obviously a very, a very challenging time.”The future looks much more promising.Record numbers of Britons are going to the gymto socialise while getting fit, a report from trade body UKActive said last week. It found that, since 2022, gym membership had risen by 1.6 million to 11.5 million people aged 16 and over, driven by generation Z.The fitness industry in the UK has grown by 3.5% between 2012 and 2024 to £5.9bn, according to data firm Leisure DB. Much of that was driven by low-cost gyms, which account for 15% of the market by value, up from 2% in 2012, and 28% of membership, up from 4% in 2012.Orr also credits a rise in “fitness IQ”, with people increasingly aware of the health benefits of exercise for mind as well as body. “Our members cite mental health as high as physical health in terms of the reason to join and the reason to stay,” he says. “And that’s a huge change: maybe 10 years ago, people weren’t talking much about mental health.”Gym-goers are roughly 60% male, 40% female with an average age of 30; two-fifths are gen-Z 18- to 24-year-olds, plus a big chunk of millennials, aged 26 to 41.“Gyms and fitness are increasingly part of the identity of emerging generations. It’s part of how they want to live, how they want to socialise, how they want to express themselves, both in the real world and in social media,” Orr says.“My 19-year-old son – when I was 19, I did occasionally go to the gym because I thought I ought to. He’s going every day because he wants to, which kind of amazes me.”Orr has had a varied career. Armed with an MBA from Imperial College London, he ran the ad agency WCRS for five years, which created the widely known“The future’s bright, the future’s Orange” adto launch mobile phone provider Orange in 1994 (now part of EE). He moved on to senior roles at British Gas and the RAC.In 2020, he became managing director of Times Media, where he oversaw the strategic development of theTimesandSunday Timesacross digital and print platforms.Lessons learned there about retaining interest have been applied to his current job, where there is a lot of churn in the first 45 days of someone joining. “It’s not uncommon in subscription businesses for the highest churn to be near the beginning. A subscription at theTimesis no different in terms of that sort of fundamental dynamic,” he says.The chain, which employs 1,900 people, swung to an adjusted pre-tax profit of £3m last year, from a loss of £5.5m in 2023, with like-for-like revenues up by 7%. Orr expects the rise in employers’ national insurance, which came in on 1 April to result in a £1.3m hit – “very modest compared to Wetherspoons” or other leisure businesses.As an avid Fulham FC fan, Orr insists that this is the job he has enjoyed most. “I’ve always liked sport and fitness, and it’s not a difficult area to get excited about, because we make a positive difference to the UK.”CVAge54FamilyMarried with three sons.EducationSt Paul’s school; Durham University; Imperial College London (MBA).PayTotal package of £1.6m in 2024.Last holidayCornwall.Best advice he’s been given“Lots of people are good at starting things.

Thanks for a mercifully brief Pass Notes.Wait, you don’t understand. Dire wolves have been extinct for more than 10,000 years.I knew there’d be a catch. So what happened?Why,Colossal Biosciences Inchappened.Is that a real name?Yes, it’s the real name of a real US company that just announced it has successfully bred three brand-new dire wolf pups, after editing some DNA recovered from ancient remains. Two were born in October, one in January. It’s being billed as the world’s first “de-extinction”.Jurassic Park review – Steven Spielberg’s dinosaur-fest is still wondrous and exciting as everRead moreIt’s likeJurassic Parkcome to life!Yes, Jurassic Park, that film about a famously successful business where everyone was happy and nothing went wrong.Did this actually happen?Yes. Scientists extracted DNA from a 72,000-year-old dire wolf inner-ear bone and a 13,000-year-old dire wolf tooth, combined it with grey wolf cells, edited the genes to make the animals larger and more muscular, inserted the resulting cells into domestic dog egg cells and implanted those into another dog’s womb. And lo, a dire wolf was born.And what are the animals like?Massive. Six-month-old pups Romulus and Remus weigh 36kg, 25% more than a grey wolf would at this age, and measure nearly 1.2 metres (4ft). By the time they are fully grown they could weigh 68kg, making them some of the largest carnivores on the planet.Am I right to feel a building sense of existential dread?No, don’t worry. The dire wolves are being kept at a top-secret nature reserve in the US. You’re safe for now. Although life finds a way and all that.Pardon?No, nothing. Everything’s fine.Wow, they really brought back the dire wolf.Well now, steady on. Some geneticists have claimed that these pups can’t be true dire wolves because they aren’t being raised in a dire wolf pack, and thus can’t fully learn true dire wolf behaviour. Also, the scientists made only 20 gene edits to the cells, which meansthey could be wildly inaccurate.So there are just a load of random, human-created giant wolves running around?Pretty much. That’s a comforting thought, isn’t it?Hang on, has this got something to do withGame of Thrones?Yes, there are dire wolves in Game of Thrones. And the third pup has been named Khaleesi. It’s safe to say the scientists are fans.So they used this technology to make dire wolves, when they could have made …The White Walkers from HBO’s hit show? Ice monsters determined to eliminate all of humanity as we know it!I was going to say three-eyed ravens.Oh yes, those too.Do say:“Dire wolves have been reintroduced, thanks toGame of Thrones.”Don’t say:“I can’t believe they invented a new species of animal in less time than it took George RR Martin to finish the next book.”Explore more on these topicsExtinct wildlifePass notesWildlifeAnimalsJurassic ParkGame of ThronesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He played for a then record 13 different teams, spending the most time with the Houston Astros between 2000 and 2004. His career high-point came when he was part of theSt Louis Cardinalsthat won the World Series in 2011. His final season in the majors was with the Detroit Tigers in 2013. Dotel was known as a strikeout pitcher and at his peak was one of the best relievers in the league.At least 58 people dead after roof collapse at Dominican Republic nightclubRead more“We are heartbroken to learn the tragic news that former Astros pitcher Octavio Dotel was one of several individuals that passed away when a roof collapsed in his native Dominican Republic last night,” the Astros said in a statement on Tuesday. “While in Houston, he was one of the top relievers in all of baseball and was a significant part of a dominant bullpen that included Hall of Famer Billy Wagner and All-Star Brad Lidge. A workhorse, Dotel’s club-leading 159 appearances in 2002-03 combined were second in the Majors in that span, during which he posted a 2.15 ERA.”During the Mets-Marlins broadcast on Tuesday afternoon, longtime Mets play-by-play announcer Gary Cohen said: “Everyone who ever met Octavio loved him.”Another Dominican baseball player, Tony Blanco, was killed in the collapse. He had briefly played for the Washington Nationals in 2005.Dotel overcame significant challenges on his way to the majors, including the death of his fatherwho was murdered during a robbery. Dotel said he used baseball as a way of keeping his mind off his father’s death. “I can do nothing if I go to the ballpark and think about him all the time,” Dotel said. “I just have to keep playing hard and get what I’m looking for. I think God helps me because I’m here. I’m here and I appreciate it. I would enjoy it more if my dad was still here, but everybody’s got to die.”Jet Set, the nightclub where Tuesday’s tragedy took place, says it is cooperating with authorities. “The loss of human life leaves us in a state of deep pain and dismay,” the nightclub said in a statement.Explore more on these topicsBaseballMLBSt Louis CardinalsHouston AstrosUS sportsDominican RepublicAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

At the scene, firefighters removed blocks of broken concrete and sawed planks of wood, using them to lift heavy debris as the noise of drills filled the air.Méndez said rescue crews were prioritising three areas in the club: “We’re hearing some sounds.”Nelsy Cruz, the governor of the north-western province of Montecristi and sister of seven-time Major League Baseball All-Star Nelson Cruz, was among the victims.She had called President Luis Abinader at 12.49am saying she was trapped and that the roof had collapsed, first lady Raquel Arbaje told reporters. Officials said Cruz died later at the hospital.“This is too great a tragedy,” Arbaje said in a broken voice.The Professional Baseball League of theDominican Republicposted on X that MLB pitcher Octavio Dotel died. Officials had earlier rescued Dotel from the debris and taken him to a hospital.Meanwhile, the injured included legislator Bray Vargas and merengue singer Rubby Pérez, who was performing when the roof collapsed, officials said.His manager, Enrique Paulino, whose shirt was spattered with blood, told reporters at the scene that the concert began shortly before midnight, with the roof collapsing almost an hour later, killing the group’s saxophonist.“It happened so quickly. I managed to throw myself into a corner,” he said, adding that he initially thought it was an earthquake.It wasn’t immediately clear what caused the roof to collapse.Jet Set issued a statement saying it was cooperating with authorities. “The loss of human life leaves us in a state of deep pain and dismay,” it said.Manuel Olivo Ortiz, whose son attended the concert but did not return home, was among those anxiously waiting outside the club, which is known for its traditional parties where renowned national and international artists perform. “We’re holding on only to God,” Olivo said.Also awaiting word was Massiel Cuevas, godmother of 22-year-old Darlenys Batista. “I’m waiting for her. She’s in there, I know she’s in there,” Cuevas said, firm in her belief that Batista would be pulled out alive.President Abinader wrote on X that all rescue agencies are “working tirelessly” to help those affected.“We deeply regret the tragedy that occurred at the Jet Set nightclub. We have been following the incident minute by minute since it occurred,” he wrote.Abinader arrived at the scene and hugged those looking for friends and family, some with tears streaming down their faces.“We have faith in God that we will rescue even more people alive,” he told reporters.An official with a megaphone stood outside the club imploring the large crowd that had gathered to search for friends and relatives to give ambulances space.“You have to cooperate with authorities, please,” he said. “We are removing people.”View image in fullscreenRescuers work at the site of the collapsed Jet Set nightclub.Photograph: Erika Santelices/ReutersAt one hospital where the injured were taken, an official stood outside reading aloud the names of survivors as a crowd gathered around her and yelled out the names of their loved ones.Meanwhile, dozens of people gathered at the National Institute of Forensic Pathology, which projected pictures of the victims so their loved ones could identify them.Explore more on these topicsDominican RepublicAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

That would come on top of the existing 20% levy and take the total tariff on Chinese imports to 104%.The White House confirmed that the higher US tariffs onChinawould, indeed, be imposed from Wednesday. “President Trump has a spine of steel and he will not break,” the press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said. “And America will not break under his leadership.”Musk reportedly made several pushes for Trump to back off global tariffs surgeRead moreThe billionaire Trump adviserElon Muskhas also reportedly asked the president toreverse course, and the New Civil Liberties Alliance, a libertarian group funded by organisations affiliated with conservative businessmen Leonard Leo and Charles Koch,filed a lawsuitagainst the “illegal” tariffs.The latest tariffs are higher thanthe 10% flat rate imposed on all global imports to the USon Friday last week and are tailored to specific countries based on aformula that has been criticised by economiststhat divides trade in goods deficit by twice the total value of imports.Afterdays of turmoilsince they were first revealed last week, global markets initiallyrecovered some ground on Tuesday as senior US officials attempted to reassure investors that the new tariffs – including rates of 20% on the European Union, 26% on India and 49% on Cambodia – could be temporary.But the bounce didn’t last long. On Wall Street, the benchmark S&P 500 closed down 1.6%, at 4,982.77 – below 5,000 for the first time in more than a year – as the Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.8%. The technology-focused Nasdaq Composite also came under pressure, dropping 2.2%.Earlier in the day, the FTSE 100 rallied by 2.7% in London, recovering some of the losses it has endured since Trump’s announcement – on what was dubbed“liberation day”by his aides – last week. The Nikkei 225 rallied 6% in Tokyo. The Hang Seng Index rose 1.5% in Hong Kong.Scott Bessent, the US treasury secretary, has insisted the new tariffs are at “maximum” levels, and expressed confidence that negotiations will bring them down.“I think you are going to see some very large countries with large trade deficits [with the US] come forward very quickly,” he told CNBC, the financial news network, on Tuesday. “If they come to the table with solid proposals, I think we can end up with some good deals.”Trump was asked on Monday whether the tariffs set the stage for negotiations with countries, or were permanent. “Well, it can both be true,” he told reporters. “There can be permanent tariffs, and there can also be negotiations.”But he again raised the prospect of agreements with countries on Tuesday, trailing a potential deal with South Korea.“Their top TEAM is on a plane heading to the US, and things are looking good,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. “We are likewise dealing with many other countries, all of whom want to make a deal with the United States.”The president added: “‘ONE STOP SHOPPING’ is a beautiful and efficient process!!! China also wants to make a deal, badly, but they don’t know how to get it started. We are waiting for their call. It will happen!”Rachel Reeves, the UK chancellor, sought to ease concerns about market volatility, telling parliament she had spoken to Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, who confirmed “markets are functioning effectively and that our banking system is resilient”.A trade war “is in nobody’s interest”, Reeves argued, confirming that the UK was seeking to negotiate a new deal with the US. Trump has imposed a 10% tariff on UK exports, in line with the minimum benchmark introduced at the weekend.How Trump tariffs could push Vietnam into the arms of ChinaRead moreShe declined to back calls from Liberal Democrats for the government to launch a “buy British” campaign. “In terms of buying British, I think everyone will make their own decisions,” Reeves said. “What we don’t want to see is a trade war, with Britain becoming inward-looking.”China adopted an altogether different stance. In a scathing editorial, the official state news outlet Xinhua accused the US president of “naked extortion”.“Utterly absurd is the underlying logic of the United States: ‘I can hit you at my will, and you must not respond. Instead, you must surrender unconditionally,’” it said. “This is not diplomacy. It is blunt coercion dressed up as policy.”On social media a 1987 speech by Ronald Reagan posted by China’s foreign ministry has been widely shared. The video clip, in which the former US president criticises the use of tariffs as leading to retaliation and ultimately hurting theUS economy, “has a new meaning in 2025”, China’s the Paper said.Bessent argued on Tuesday that China was making a “big mistake” by daring to retaliate. “They’re playing with a pair of twos,” he claimed on CNBC. “What do we lose by the Chinese raising tariffs on us? We export one-fifth to them of what they export to us, so that is a losing hand for them.”This article was amended on 8 April 2025 to clarify that a lawsuit against the tariffs was filed by the New Civil Liberties Alliance, a group that has been funded by organisations affiliated with Leonard Leo and Charles Koch, rather than the businessmen themselves.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsEuropeCanadaAmericasTariffsDonald TrumpUS economynewsShareReuse this content"

It was published in October 2024, on the website of the ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute, a research centre based in Singapore.“[Chambers] denied all charges. He neither wrote nor published the blurb on the website,” said Akarachai Chaimaneekarakate, of Thai Lawyers for Human Rights, which represents Chambers. Chambers plans to appeal against the court’s decision to deny bail, Akarachai added.Thailand has one of theworld’s most strict lese-majesty laws, under which criticism of the royal family can lead to 15 years in jail on a single charge.If a person faces multiple cases, they can be sentenced to decades in prison: in January 2024 a man was sentenced to 50 years over his comments about the royal family.At least 277 people have been charged under the law since authorities cracked down onyouth-led mass protests that began in July 2020. People have been prosecuted for political speeches, wearingclothes deemed to be impersonating the royals, or for being involved in the sale ofsatirical cartoons.It is rare for a foreign national to be charged under the lese-majesty law, however.Chambers, who is a well-known academic, is a lecturer at Naresuan University in northern Thailand, and a visiting fellow at the ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

To say otherwise would be an insult to the king and would tarnish the king’s reputation and dignity”.Sunai Phasuk, a senior researcher on Thailand in Human Rights Watch’s Asia division, said lese-majesty prosecutions were “a serious blot” on Thailand’s human rights record.“The abusive use of the royal insult law in Thailand has reached a new height of absurdity when Paul Chambers, a prominent Thai studies scholar, is charged with lese-majesty and cybercrime offences for commenting about the monarchy and the military. Academic freedom and free speech in Thailand will suffer devastating blows if this baseless prosecution proceeds,” Sunai said.Explore more on these topicsThailandAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The prime minister, Pham Minh Chinh, even joked in January that he would happily “play golf all day long” at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home in Florida if it could “bring benefits to my country and my people”.The strategies do not appear to have worked. Trump has inflicted an extraordinary 46% tariff onVietnamthat threatens to devastate its economic growth plans and undermine relations between the two countries. The tariff has sent shock waves through Vietnam, a manufacturing powerhouse where Trump has always been fairly popular, and across south-east Asia.Across the region, which is highly dependent on exports, Trump is introducing similarly punishing tariffs, including in Cambodia (49%), Laos (48%), Thailand (36%), Indonesia (32%), Malaysia (24%), Brunei (24%), the Philippines (17%), and Singapore (10%).The announcement has damaged the US’s reputation as a reliable partner in the region, said Kevin Chen an associate research fellow with the US programme at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, in Singapore. The Trump administration’s approach was “unilateral, coercive, and undermines the trading system that countries in this region prospered under”, Chen said.South-east Asia is a strategically important region for the US, especially in light of Washington’s competition withChinaand tensions in the South China Sea.Vietnam and the US had grown closer under Trump’s predecessor, Joe Biden, with thetwo countries upgrading their partnership. Trump is known to be well liked in Vietnam, where his books are translated into Vietnamese, and he has gained respect as a businessman and as a politician tough on China.Yet relations between the US and south-east Asia have been undermined in recent months. The tariff announcement comes on top of thegutting of USAIDand other foreign assistance programmes, which halted life-saving projects across the region.America’s image has also been damaged in recent years in countries including the Muslim-majority Malaysia and Indonesia, owing to Washington’s support for Israel during its war on Gaza. US companies have been targeted with prolonged boycotts in both countries.China is expected to try to capitalise on the chaos. Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, is due to visit Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia this month and “will likely use the opportunity to portray China as a steadfast and reliable partner in contrast to the US”, Chen said. A slew of economic agreements are expected to be signed between China and those countries by the end of his visit.In the longer term, whether China can leverage frustration in south-east Asia is less straightforward, say analysts, especially as Beijing risks becoming embroiled in a worsening trade war with its superpower rival.Trump hasthreatened China with an extra 50% tariff, which will exacerbate the economic difficulties already affecting dynamics between China and its south-east Asian neighbours.Peter Mumford, the head of practice for south-east Asia at Eurasia Group, said the region was “grappling with a flood of low-cost Chinese goods, and that’s going to get even more complicated”. The oversupply of cheap goods, from clothing to steel, had damaged small businesses and contributed to hundreds of factories closing in Thailand.South-east Asian leaders will seek to diversify by looking to Europe or Japan, say analysts, while also scrambling to negotiate with Trump.It is unclear what countries such as Vietnam can offer to placate Washington. Vietnam’s trade surplus with the US has surpassed $123bn, a figure that has grown rapidly over recent years as companies moved there from China to skirt tariffs imposed by the previous Trump administration.“Trump would likely push Vietnam to commit to purchasing significantly more American goods and services. As Vietnam has been seen as a conduit for China to bypass US tariffs, the Trump administration may also demand that Vietnam restrict transshipment of Chinese goods,” said Phan Dung, research officer of the Vietnam Studies Programme at the ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute, in Singapore.Vietnam was doing its best to negotiate to persuade the US to reduce the tariffs, said Khang Vu, a visiting scholar in the political science department at Boston College. But, he added, the US tariffs would “damage the Vietnamese government’s goodwill toward the Trump administration”.He said Trump’s tariffs on Vietnamese goods showed Hanoi that, despite everything Washington had said of Vietnam’s regional importance, their partnership was “dispensable”.Countries in the region would be cautious about leaning too closely to China, already south-east Asia’s largest trading partner. In the past the US had served as a counterbalance in the region. “The major difference this time,” said Chen, “is that they will need to account for a potentially unfriendly, if not hostile United States as well as an assertive China.”Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsVietnamAsia PacificChinaTariffsDonald TrumpInternational tradeanalysisShareReuse this content"

Last week Trump announced a swathe of tariffs ranging from 10%-50% against US trading partners to come into effect this Wednesday. He placeda 34% tariff on imports from China– in addition to a previous 20% levy.Beijing then retaliatedwith a reciprocal 34% tariff on all US imports. That prompted Trump on Mondayto threaten an additional 50% tariffon to Chinese imports if Beijing did not reverse theirs.“IfChinadoes not withdraw its 34% increase above their already long term trading abuses by tomorrow, April 8th, 2025, the United States will impose additional tariffs on China of 50%, effective April 9th,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated!”A scathing editorial in Chinese official state news outlet Xinhua accused Trump of “naked extortion”.“Utterly absurd is the underlying logic of the United States: ‘I can hit you at my will, and you must not respond. Instead, you must surrender unconditionally’,” it said. “This is not diplomacy. It is blunt coercion dressed up as policy.”On social media a 1987 speech by then US president Ronald Reagan posted by China’s foreign ministry has been widely shared. The video clip, in which Reagan criticises the use of tariffs as leading to retaliation and ultimately hurting the US economy, “has a new meaning in 2025”, China’s The Paper said.Wen-ti Sung, a non-resident fellow with the Atlantic Council’s Global China Hub said the US and China were “locked in a game of chicken”. “Like two race cars driving directly toward each other, whoever swerves first will stand to lose prestige and profit,” Sung told the Guardian.“China seems determined to signal that the world is still bipolar, and that Beijing will not let Washington get to call the shots, lest it sets the tone for the years to come. Plus China is still waiting to get more assurance from Trump that if it accommodates Trump’s demand will it get China out of his crosshairs or whether it will only whet his appetite more.“If not, China’s main option is to respond with proportional retaliatory trade sanctions against the US, while trying to negotiate with Washington at the same time.”On Tuesday, Japan’s Nikkei index rose 6%, rebounding from an 18-month low on Monday, after Trump and Japanese prime minister Shigeru Ishiba agreed to open trade talks in a phone call late on Monday.Chinese blue-chips climbed 0.7%, recouping a fraction of the more than 7% slide on Monday. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index jumped 2% after suffering the worst day since 1997. US stock futures also pointed higher after a rollercoaster session in which it touched its lowest level in more than a year.Trump’s “liberation day” tariffs targeted dozens of countries, and China is not the only one to respond. The European Commission has proposed counter-tariffs of 25% on a range of US goods, including soybeans, nuts and sausages, while saying they stood ready to negotiate a“zero for zero” dealwith Trump.EU trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic said at a news conference: “Sooner or later, we will sit at the negotiation table with the US and find a mutually acceptable compromise.”The 27-member EU, which had already been hit with tariffs on vehicles and metals, faces another 20% on other items from Wednesday. Trump has also threatened to impose tariffs on alcoholic drinks from the bloc.Taiwan, which faces a 32% reciprocal tariff and saw its worst ever market fall on Monday, has said it is ready to negotiate “at any time”, with president Lai Ching-te proposing a zero-tariffs agreement, removal of trade barriers, and increased investment in the US.Taiwan has repeatedly said its large trade surplus with the US is due to the US’s soaring demand for tech, given its companies are major suppliers to companies such as Apple and Nvidia.Explore more on these topicsChinaTrump tariffsAsia PacificTariffsInternational tradeGlobal economyEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Australian powerbrokers are likely to abandon plans to buy a stake if Catalans Dragons and Toulouse are ejected by clubs leading a review into the sport in the UK.There is an increasingly hostile power struggle developing in British rugby league after a number of clubs – spearheaded by Leigh Leopards and Batley Bulldogs –successfully removed Simon Johnson as the Rugby Football League chairand installed as his replacement the governing body’s former chief executive Nigel Wood.From one crisis to another: rugby league in dire need of real leadershipRead moreWood will lead a strategic reviewover the coming months that could determine the future direction for the sport. Clubs met last week and were asked for their views on a number of subjects includingthe long-term deal with IMG, the structure of Super League and, perhaps most pertinently, the role of Catalans and Toulouse in the pyramid.There is understood to be growing apathy from clubs – mostly those outside Super League – about what the French clubs bring to rugby league. However, that is not a viewpoint shared by a number of teams, including Wigan Warriors and Warrington Wolves, who are fully supportive of Catalans and Toulouse and did not vote in favour of Wood’s return.Crucially, though, it is a sentiment with which theNRLand its chief executive, Peter V’landys, also disagree as they prepare to table a bid for control of Super League. They also have minimal desire in working with a regime spearheaded by Wood before the review is published this summer.According to reports in Australia, the NRL is ready to take a 33% stake in Super League, but only on the condition that it assumes full administrative control of the competition, breaking the cycle of British rugby league’s major decisions being made by its own clubs.Among their leading options for change should they complete a deal is a reduction in Super League from 12 teams to 10. But they want Catalans and Toulouse – the latter side now plays in the Championship – to be in that elite competition.Sources in the UK and Australia have intimated that if a vote to eject the French teams succeeded it could have a major effect on the NRL’s plans. “No France would mean no PVL [V’Landys],” one senior figure in Australia said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAustralia SportFree newsletterGet a daily roundup of the latest sports news, features and comment from our Australian sports deskEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Several Jewish groupshave also written to the prime ministerto urge the same.New Liberal candidate for Whitlam claimed ‘Marxist brainwashing’ happening at Australian schoolsRead moreThe ad, shared by a group called “Macnamara voters against extremism”, pictures five Greens MPs and senators, and accuses them of voting against a range of national security laws introduced to federal parliament since 2014. It also shows the Greens candidate for Macnamara, Sonya Semmens, asking “Can we afford what’s next?” Meta estimates the ad has an audience reach of up to 500,000 people.“Votes against laws like these risk helping outlawed groups like Hamas,” the ad says. “If Josh Burns finishes below the Greens, they could win Macnamara.”A Greens spokesperson said the suggestion the party supported a listed terrorist organisation was part of “an inflammatory and untruthful political campaign against the Greens”.They accused Danby and Lupton of “masquerading as a community group”, calling it “extremely disappointing”.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterWhen contacted by Guardian Australia, Lupton said he did not believe the ad was inflammatory or untruthful. He said it was designed to highlight an alleged “lack of concern about national security at a time when there are significant and increasing threats, in particular from radical Islamist forces”.Lupton said the group had other members and that he and Danby were merely figureheads. He said the group was not affiliated with Labor and that he would welcome the Liberals winning the seat if Labor could not.Labor sources told Guardian Australia the ad was not endorsed by the party and they did not know about it until it was published.Danby represented the seat of Melbourne Ports before it was abolished and replaced with Macnamara in 2019. Lupton was the state Labor MP for Prahran, which is within the Macnamara electorate, from 2002 to 2010. He ran as an independent at the2025 Prahran byelection, receiving 12.7% of the primary vote, and encouraged his supporters to preference the Liberals over the Greens. The Liberal candidate took the seat on a 1.3% margin after receiving just one more primary vote than the Greens candidate.The Liberal candidate for Macnamara, Benson Saulo, told an executive meeting of ZionismVictorialast year that the Greens were “not a party for the environment any more, they are a party for protest and antisemitism”.In Macnamara, 10% of the population is Jewish, making it the second-largest Jewish electorate in Australia. With Labor, the Liberals and the Greensseparated by only a few hundred primary votesat the last federal election, the community’s vote is crucial. A similar vote spread at the 2025 election would make preference distribution vital in determining the outcome.Labor was yet to finalise its position on preferences in Macnamara but two sources previouslytold Guardian Australia Labor was likely to run an open ticket and not direct people on how to fill out their ballot papers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Overall, deliveries of Porsche cars fell by 8% in the first quarter of the year to 71,470.Slowing orders come as the US presidentenforces a 25% levyon car imports to the US, as part of a bigger package of trade tariffs that has caused abrutal sell-off in global stock markets.The tariffs are a threat to sales in an automotive industry already grappling with a broader slowdown in consumer spending and intense electric vehicle competition for US and European firms fromChina.Porsche did not say whether the US tariffs had had an impact on sales.Part of the drop in its deliveries in Europe was also down to the discontinuation of some models that did not meet EU cybersecurity regulations, including the 718 and the Macan combustion-engine model.The Macan model was, however, still Porsche’s bestseller in the period, with deliveries up 14% to 23,555. More than 60% of these cars were the all-electric type.Shares in Porsche, which is listed in Frankfurt, have lost roughly a quarter of their value since the start of the year as investors have braced for a hit from Trump’s tariffs. The shares were flat on Tuesday.Some of the world’s biggest carmakers have been forced to find ways to mitigate the cost of the new tariffs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Their status appears to be different to that of the 11,000 soldiers from North Korea who were deployed on the frontline after a political agreement between Pyongyang and Moscow.Zelenskyy said identity documents, bank cards and personal data were found in the possession of the two men captured, and that his country’s domestic security agency, the SBU, was “verifying all the facts”.He argued that the capture of the two men indicated that Russia had no interest in agreeing to a ceasefire in US-brokered peace negotiations, which have made only limited progress over the past two months.“Russia’s involvement of China, along with other countries, whether directly or indirectly, in this war inEuropeis a clear signal that Putin intends to do anything but end the war. He is looking for ways to continue fighting,” Zelenskyy wrote on social media.He said the development “definitely requires a response” from the US, Europe and “all those around the world who want peace”. There was no immediate reaction from Moscow or Beijing.Below his post on X, Zelenskyy released a short video apparently showing a captured soldier, his hands tied, speaking in Mandarin. Prisoners of war are protected from public curiosity according to the Geneva conventions and should not have their images published online.China says it is a neutral party in the conflict. Russia makes heavy use of Chinese-made components in its arms industry, andUkrainedoes so to some extent. Both sides make significant use of Mavic drones from the Chinese manufacturer DJI, though Kyiv is trying to reduce its dependence on products from Beijing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The letter – which was criticised by the city’s mayor on Tuesday – comes three months after the citywas namedas one of 11 Spanish venues for the tournament taking place in Spain, Morocco and Portugal.Signed by associations representing several areas around the San Sebastián’s historic centre as well as a platform of residents pushing for “tourism degrowth,” the letter said: “Hosting the Fifa World Cup will only worsen living conditions in our city,” adding that it would “further exacerbate the touristification” of the city.View image in fullscreenThe Anoeta Stadium, home to Real Sociedad, is due to host matches in the 2030 men’s World Cup.Photograph: Álex Caparrós/Uefa/Getty ImagesBetween 2015 and 2024, the number of tourists visiting San Sebastián – from within Spain and beyond – climbed by 78%, according to those behind the letter. The effect on the city, long celebrated for its Michelin-star restaurants, scores ofpintxo barsand crescent-shapedLa Conchabeach, has been “brutal,” they said. “Residents are being pushed out of the city, public spaces are being reshaped according to commercial interests, infrastructure is being designed to meet the needs of the tourism industry and the local language and culture are being fetishised for marketing purposes.”Anger over the issue ledhundreds of peopleto take to the streets in late October, echoing the widespread protestsacross Spainlast year as tourismsoaredto record levels.The arrival of the world’s largest football tournament would probably exacerbate the situation while benefiting only a “privileged few,” the letter to Fifa said. “The effects of this mega-event on most of the population are dramatic: the worsening of the housing crisis, the increase in tourist activity, the commodification of urban space, the development of unsustainable transport infrastructure and the implementation of security-driven measures that will constrain daily life.”The associations said their call to Fifa was part of a wider push. “Tourism in our city has already had a major impact on daily life, causing serious harm,” the letter said. “We therefore believe it is urgent to follow the path of tourism degrowth and hosting events like the Fifa World Cup moves us in precisely the opposite direction.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The list of potential targets facing mostly 25% retaliatory tariffs now ranges from almonds to yachts, via diamonds and dental floss, soya beans and steel parts. But bourbon and wine have been dropped.France, Italy and Ireland protested against their inclusion after Trump threatened a counter-punch on learning of the threat to bourbon last month. On social media on 13 March,he warned of“a 200% Tariff on all WINES, CHAMPAGNES, & ALCOHOLIC PRODUCTS COMING OUT OF FRANCE AND OTHER E.U. REPRESENTED COUNTRIES”.Ireland’s foreign minister, Simon Harris, said on Monday he had “questioned the strategic relevance” of targeting bourbon, while the French prime minister, François Bayrou, described the proposal as “a misstep”.The French government, which has been calling fora tough response to US tariffs, feared damage to its drinks industry, as one champagne maker warned it would be “game over” for the US market if 200% tariffs came to pass.French cognac and brandy makers have since last October been grappling with Chinese tariffs, levied by Beijing in retaliation over the EU’s decisionto impose anti-dumping duties on Chinese electric vehicles.Bourbon became a possible target as it wasalready in the EU’s playbook. When Trump imposed steel and aluminium tariffs in his first term, the EU responded by targeting emblematic US goods such as Harley-Davidson motorbikes, blue jeans and bourbon. “We can also do stupid,” was how the then European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, described the counter-measures, as he said the bloc had no choice.The targeting of alcoholic drinks in trade wars has alarmed and baffled the industry. In the two decades following the removal of nearly all tariffs on spirits between the US and EU in 1997, transatlantic trade grew by 450%, reaching €6.7bn in 2018 before the start of tariffs, according to the pan-European trade body, spiritsEurope.In the US, Irish whiskey, Cognac and Polish vodka have protected status, while similarly, in the EU only US products can be bourbon or Tennessee whiskey.Ireland had also feared that Trump’s retribution would snare its sizeable whiskey industry, with Irish whiskey exports to the US in 2024 valued at between €420m and €450m by the national food and drink board Bia.The sector is dominated by brands such as Jameson. An explosion in the number of craft distilleries has led to around 40 whiskey and gin makers being established, often in rural areas, and another 10 north of the border, with 5.7m cases sent to the US in 2023 from the republic alone. These range in price from $30 a bottle to almost $5,000 for a bottle of Midleton Very Rare Foret de Troncais vintage whiskey.A tit-for-tat war could have hit production costs, too, as bourbon oak casks are used to colour and age whiskey in Ireland and elsewhere in the EU before sale back to the US.Under US rules, bourbon is aged in virgin oak, which is discarded after one or two years, but the barrels are sold on to the UK at £300 a unit, generating a whole new side business for the US drink trade.“It is not good for Europe, not good for Ireland. It’s not good for anybody,” said Paul Nash, the founder of Wild Atlantic Whiskey in county Tyrone, who is concerned about the 10% and 20% tariffs still facing UK and EU exports.The US applied a universal tariff of 10% on UK goods from 5 April, while the 20% rate on EU goods comes into force on 9 April.Northern Ireland whiskey is also hampered by the EU trade tariffs, partly because of Brexit rules tying it to the EU trade rules but mostly because whiskey makers source their barley in the republic.A European Commission spokesperson declined to comment on bourbon, as the list had not been made public. “We are taking every step to ensure that the measures we come forward with achieve their intended purpose, which is to allow for the minimum amount of damage here in the EU while providing us with the maximum amount of leverage in our negotiations,” the spokesperson said. “We don’t want tariffs. We want to avoid them.”Explore more on these topicsTariffsTrump tariffsWhiskyEuropean UnionFood & drink industryEuropeIrelandnewsShareReuse this content"

More than 12 million people visited it in 2024.AGCM said it had fined CoopCulture, which managed official ticket sales for the site between 1997 and 2024, €7m for “knowingly contributing to the substantial and prolonged unavailability” of standard-priced tickets.“On the one hand, CoopCulture failed to take adequate steps to counter automated ticket hoarding,” AGCM said in a statement. “On the other, it kept a sizeable share of tickets for bundled sales tied to its own educational tours, which generated considerable profits.”Customers were forced to turn to tour operators and online platforms, which resold tickets at higher tickets, bundling them with additional services such as guided tours, pickups from hotels and priority access.The remainder of the fine was handed out to six tours operators based in Italy, Germany, the Netherlands and Ireland, which scooped up tickets in bulk using software bots and other tools, contributing to their rapid disappearance from CoopCulture’s website.AGCM said: “The operators benefited from the constant unavailability of tickets, which left consumers seeking access to the Colosseum with no choice but to purchase them through these channels – often at much higher prices due to the bundling with additional services offered either directly or via other operators.”The authority did not say how much people ended up paying for entrance to the Colosseum as a result of the illegal practices. Thewebsitefor the ancient site, which is operated by Italy’s culture ministry, lists the basic adult ticket price at €18. That gives tourists 20 minutes to explore the amphitheatre’s main floor. A “full experience” ticket costs €24 and gives access to the wider Colosseum archaeological park, including the ruins of the Forum and the Palatine hill.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There has been an unprecedentedUS militarybuildup across the Middle East in recent weeks, and Trump’s decision to make the talks public looks designed to press Iran to negotiate with urgency.The US delegation to the talks will be led by Steve Witkoff, Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East, who has also been involved in talks with Russia over the Ukraine war; and the Iranian side by its foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi. Witkoff’s efforts to broker peace between Israel and Hamas and between Russia and Ukraine have so far failed.Iran had in public been stalling about talks, saying simply that it was prepared for indirect talks with the US, but had not yet received a formal response from the US as to whether talks were going ahead. In a post on X issued some hours after Trump used an Oval Office press conference to reveal the agreement to stage weekend talks, Araghchi described the talks as an opportunity and a test. He insisted the ball was in the US’s court.Trump says US ‘having direct talks’ with Iran over nuclear dealRead moreSpeaking during a visit to Algiers, Araghchi elaborated that Iran wanted indirect talks. He said: “The form of negotiations is not important, whether they are direct or indirect. In my opinion, what is important is whether the negotiations are effective or ineffective, whether the parties are serious or not in the negotiations, the intentions of the parties in the negotiations, and the will to reach a solution. These are the criteria for action in any dialogue.”He added Iran had not agreed on any formula that would allow indirect talks to convert into direct talks, but the US expects the talks to evolve into a direct negotiation. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, has vetoed direct talks in protest at US sanctions and in deference to hardliners that believe talks with the US over Tehran’s nuclear programme are a political trap.The former Iranian president Hassan Rouhani welcomed the news of the talks and said if the 2015 nuclear deal was conducted indirectly it would have taken 20 years and not two to conclude.Trump pulled out of that deal – known as the joint comprehensive plan of action – during his first term. That deal had offered Iran sanctions relief in exchange for limitations on its uranium enrichment activities.Iran is waiting to see if Trump will be content if the talks focus on a new system of surveillance of its civil nuclear programme, not dissimilar to the treaty from which Trump withdrew the US in 2018; or instead the US will seek to dismantle Iran’s entire nuclear programme, a step that increasingly has been referred to as the Libya option. In December 2003, Libya’s longtime leader Muammar Gaddafi renounced the country’s weapons of mass destruction programme and allowed international inspectors to verify that Tripoli would follow through on its commitment.Speaking alongside Trump in the Oval House on Monday, Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, advocated the Libya option, but Iran insists it will not abandon its civil nuclear programme. Israel ultimately does not trust Iran and expects the talks to fail. It then favours a US-Israeli military strike to destroy Iran’s nuclear sites.But Witkoff, in an interview with Tucker Carlson three weeks ago, suggested Trump’s demands of Iran may be relatively modest. He said Trump, in his letter seeking talks with Iran, had said: “We should clear up the misconceptions. We should create a verification programme so that nobody worries about weaponisation of your nuclear material. And I’d like to get us to that place because the alternative is not a very good alternative. That’s a rough encapsulation of what was said.”But Trump is under pressure to reach an agreement that is more watertight than the agreement reached by Barack Obama in 2015.Previewing Iran’s position in the talks, Araghchi said: “Iran’s nuclear programme is completely peaceful and legitimate. UN security council resolution 2231 has just confirmed its legitimacy. There is no doubt about it internationally. If anyone has any questions or ambiguities, we are ready to clarify. We are confident that our nuclear programme is peaceful and we have no problem building more confidence into this unless it creates a limitation for us or is an obstacle to Iran’s goals.”Iran has always insisted a fatwa exists against building nuclear weapons, but senior Iranian politicians, faced by a series of military reversals, have increasingly challenged that.Iran also faces the threat that Trump has set a two-month deadline – expiring in May – for the talks to achieve an outcome. Iran, being a consummate negotiator, may test Trump’s patience, especially if Witkoff eventually demands its ballistic weapons programme and financial support for militant forces is also put on the agenda.A February report by the International Atomic Energy Agency found that Iran’s stockpile of uranium enriched to 60% purity had increased sharply since December. Experts say that reaching 90% enrichment – the threshold for weapons-grade material – is relatively easy from that point. As of 8 February, Iran’s 60%-enriched uranium stockpile had grown by 92.5kg over the previous quarter, reaching 274.8kg. Iran says the stockpile is a response to US sanctions.Explore more on these topicsIranDonald TrumpNuclear weaponsUS militaryMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Sometimes – in the context of Gaza – it suggests one of Hamas’s own rockets fell short, causing the casualties.Otherwise, it might allege that those killed were either combatants themselves, or collateral damage from the targeting of combatants.And the case of theGazamedics is only the latest incident when Israel has altered its account of a high profile killing.The killing of the celebrated Palestinian American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh, who worked for Al Jazeera, while covering a protest on the West Bank in 2022, saw a similar shifting of explanations.Initially, then Israeli prime minister Naftali Bennett suggested that Akleh “likely” had been killed by Palestinian fire. A day later the government issued a statement where it decried “hasty” accusations of one of its soldiers being behind the killing as being “misleading and irresponsible”.Then, under pressure from witness testimony, the IDF conceded she had been shot by an Israeli soldier, saying then that she was not the target but had been hit by accident.When evidence emerges to challenge the Israeli military’s account, history shows the IDF then changes its story to suggest the circumstances are not the result of military orders or systemic issues but a “mistake” or – rarely – individual, but not organisational, culpability.In the case of the paramedics killed on 23 March, theIDF’s initial explanationas the bodies were discovered in a mass grave was that their vehicles had been “advancing suspiciously toward IDF troops without headlights or emergency signals”.Aswitness testimonyandvideo from the phone of one of the dead medics emergedto show that account was untrue and that the ambulances were travelling with lights on and with paramedics wearing identifying hi vis vests, Israel suggested – without providing evidence – that six of the dead were somehow linked to Hamas, even if they were unarmed.Last week, briefings to Israeli media settled on one of the IDF’s most familiar claims seen over the years: the assertion that the soldiers felt they were under threat and that Hamas has used ambulances to move men and weapons.The IDF’s evolving narrative in such cases is often supported with claims made by pro-Israel accounts on social media.In this case, a video was posted on X by a pro-Israel account claiming to show in a blurred image that one of those killed may have been carrying a weapon in their hands. However,examination of the video by the German broadcaster DWjudged that all that was visible was a shadow cast by the lights.If some have identified a pattern of obfuscation over the years, there is also a suspicion that it is in service of a wider aim: muddying the waters when an investigation is launched.And when the IDF does launch an investigation, through the auspices of its Military Advocate General’s office, the results are often opaque and seldom lead to the most serious charges.According toanalysis conducted by Israeli human rights organisation, Yesh Din,published last year, the mechanism set up by the IDF’s general staff to investigate potential war crimes is designed to avoid responsibility while giving the impression that a process is taking place.An examination by Yesh Din of “all complaints transferred to the military” during major Israeli military campaigns over the previous decade “at least 664 complaints were transferred … for review.”Of that, the organisation says, “542 (81.6%) incidents were closed without a criminal investigation, with “just 41 incidents (6%)” leading to a criminal investigation.That led Yesh Din to conclude that “the results of Israel’s law enforcement mechanism’s work over the past decade shows that it rarely opens investigations against junior-ranking soldiers and completely refrains from investigating decision makers at the top command levels”.All of this has prompted urgent questions about Israel’s account not only in more familiar quarters, but this time in Germany, one of Israel’s strongest backers in Europe.“There are very significant questions about the actions of the Israeli army now,” the foreign ministry spokesperson, Christian Wagner, said on Monday after video footage emerged of the incident concerning the medics.“An investigation and accountability of the perpetrators are urgently needed,” he said, adding that a full investigation of the incident would be “a question that ultimately affects the credibility of the Israeli constitutional state”.As Amos Harel suggested in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz earlier this week, all the presentational manoeuvring around the incident may be obscuring a more brutal truth: that all Palestinians in Gaza – civilians included –are perceived as a threat to be encountered with lethal force.A few days ago, a video was aired showing a battalion commander talking to his soldiers on the eve of their return to the enclave.‘“Anyone you encounter there is an enemy. You identify anyone, you eliminate him.’”Explore more on these topicsIsraelHamasPalestinian territoriesGazaMiddle East and north AfricaanalysisShareReuse this content"

Announcing the deal on Wednesday, the prime minister, Keir Starmer, was eager to claim credit for any potential benefits.“This is our plan for change in action,” Starmer said, “combining local and national growth with creating around 28,000 new jobs across sectors such as construction, AI, and tourism.View image in fullscreenThe proposed location – a 192-hectare site that was formerly a brickworks.Photograph: Universal Destinations & Experiences/PA“It is not just about numbers; it’s about securing real opportunities for people in our country. Together, we are building a brighter future for the UK, getting people into work and ensuring our economy remains strong and competitive.”The project, the government says, will bring a £50bn boost to Britain’s economy and create 20,000 jobs in construction, with a further 8,000 operational roles once it is up and running, forecast for 2031.The enormous project does not yet have planning permission and will be a test of the government’spromise to speed up major construction projectsby reducing the scope for legal challenges. It has been strongly backed by local government leaders, however.Questioned by Bedford MP Mohammad Yasinlast month, Starmer agreed that it was “vital that we do unleash the potential of … Bedford, by generating growth, jobs, and opportunities”.As part of the announcement the government said it will make “a major investment in infrastructure around the site” to ensure it is easily accessible.The rollercoaster king: the man behind the UK’s fastest thrill-ride – podcastRead moreEarly discussion of the project – which has been under negotiation formore than a year– made much of Bedford’s relative proximity to London.Earlier this week, the transport secretary approved plans for a major expansion of nearby Luton airport –overruling planning inspectorswho had recommended blocking the scheme on environmental grounds – which will see annual passenger numbers almost double to 32 million by 2043.As well as Universal Studios Hollywood in Los Angeles, its flagship theme park in Orlando, Florida, and its 2021 venture in Beijing, Universal also runs resorts in Japan and Singapore.The company, rebranded Universal Destinations and Experiences in 2023, is owned by the US telecoms groupComcast, which is also the parent company of Sky.Mike Cavanagh, president of Comcast Corporation, said he “could not be more excited to take this very important step in our plan to create and deliver an incredible Universal theme park and resort in the heart of the United Kingdom, which complements our growing US-based parks business by expanding our global footprint to Europe”.Rachel Reeves, the chancellor said: “At a time of global change, this investment is a vote of confidence in Britain as a place to do business.“Universal’s investment will bring billions to the economy and create thousands of jobs to the UK, putting more money in people’s pockets.”Explore more on these topicsTheme parksComcastUniversal PicturesnewsShareReuse this content"

Last year’s eventwas also plagued by anxieties about sewage in the river, and, after Cambridge had won, the Oxford team revealed thatsome of their numberhad been ill in the lead-up.Other river-based sporting events have also been affected; in May a Thames swimming race which has been held for more than120 years was cancelledover sickness fears.Oxford confirm illnesses before Boat Race but stop short of blaming pollutionRead moreSir Steve Redgrave, the Olympic gold medallist, said rowers needed to be protected from polluted water. “It’s a real worry that in 2025, unsafe water quality in the Thames is still a concern. Rowers, river users, and the public deserve better.”The testing, carried out every weekday between 10 March and 7 April at the beginning, middle and end of the race route between Putney and Mortlake, revealed that 29.5% of samples exceeded safe limits for entering the water,and were almost three times the threshold for bathing waters rated “poor”.It was also a particularly dry spell of weather. Raw sewage discharges from storm overflows are only supposed to take place during exceptional weather, like extreme rainfall or intense storms. Spills of raw sewage during dry weather could be illegal.The route does not have bathing water status but campaigners for River Action, who carried out the testing, used the threshold as a benchmark to indicate the threat to public health.River Action said the monitor on a sewage outflow at Kew – upstream of the race’s finishing post – went offline in January, and remained out of operation during the entire testing window.As well as raw sewage,Thames Watertreatment plants discharge treated sewage into the river on a daily basis.River Action believes the pollution from sewage treatment plants – which have no legal limits imposed on them for E coli – are a major but overlooked factor in the unsafe water quality.Erica Popplewell, River Action’s head of communities, said the victorious Boat Race crew should think twice about throwing their cox in the water after the race, as is the custom.She said systematic reform of the water industry and its regulators was needed.“The public demands Thames Water and regulators act now to improve sewage treatment infrastructure,” she said.“Thames Water has profited from pollution for years whilst the government has failed to enforce the law. It’s time to refinance the company without burdening bill payers and end pollution-for-profit.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The facility makes the steel for almost all UK rail tracks.Whitehall sources said Starmer and Reeves were aligned in considering steel to be of “huge strategic importance” and that “all options are on the table, including nationalisation”. The chancellor spoke to union leaders involved in talks over the weekend and made clear her support for the steel industry.Starmer promised a hearing of parliament’s liaison committee on Tuesday that he would do everything he could to keep a functioning steel industry in the UK. “We are doing our everything we can to ensure there’s a bright future for Scunthorpe,” the prime minister said.Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, is to have further meetings withBritish Steelbosses on Wednesday.Meanwhile,Nigel Farage, the leader of Reform UK, repeated his call for the government to nationalise the Scunthorpe plant within the next three days or risk the closure of its two blast furnaces.Farage said three days would allow time for orders to be placed for iron ore pellets and coking coal, which keep the furnaces running.It forms part of Reform UK’s three-point plan to save British steel, which includes the government taking over two electric arc furnaces at Liberty Steel’s plant in Rotherham, and hiring global steel experts.Speaking from the Scunthorpe plant, Farage criticised the government for having “dithered and delayed”, given “the UK’s steel industry is broken”.The steel industry has been affected by Donald Trump’s tariffs: a 10% tariff on US imports of British goods has been imposed, along with a 25% tariff on cars and separate import taxes for steel and aluminium.Starmer has said he does not believe Trump’s tariffs are a “temporary passing phase”, telling MPs that he would be pushing for mitigation but was prepared to retaliate if necessary.The prime minister set out his latest stance on the tariffs that have caused chaos in global stock markets, saying the UK would not “jump in with both feet” to retaliate.In a hearing of MPs, he said: “Obviously, we have to keep our options on the table and do the preparatory work for retaliation if necessary. But I think that trying to negotiate an arrangement which mitigates the tariffs is better.”The UK is seeking to negotiate with the US over the tariffs, with Starmer confirming there could be “questions” about objections by the US to the digital services tax on big tech companies and new online safety laws that affect them.However, he emphasised that he would not “trade away” the NHS with any concessions to the US in trade talks about access to the UK’s health market.The Liberal Democrats called on Starmer to commit to giving parliament a say over any future US trade deal, saying: “It would be immoral for Trump’s tech bro backers to be given tax breaks while children’s safety online is thrown under the bus.”Polling fromMore in Commonhas found that two-thirds of Britons are worried about the tariffs and are nearly twice as likely to support as to oppose retaliation, with 51% of people saying the UK should respond with tariffs of its own.AfterReeves sought to reassure the financial marketson Tuesday that there was no systemic instability, Starmer said his goal was to ensure the UK economy was “resilient and thriving”.Asked if the government could intervene to prevent recession, similar to steps taken during the Covid pandemic, the prime minister said the support was “more in the nature of breaking down barriers that are in the way”, rather than spending cash. He said changes to the zero-emissions vehicle mandate and clinical trials announced on Monday were aimed at paving the way for this, along with changes to the planning system.During the hearing, Starmer was also questioned by the chairs of select committees, including the Labour MPs Debbie Abrahams and Sarah Owen, on the impact ofwelfare changeson disabled people. In the two-hour hearing, Starmer:Defended the welfare cuts as being based on “dignity” and criticised the Office for Budget Responsibility for not taking into account possible behavioural changes of people affected by the cuts when assessing the consequences of the policy.Said threats from foreign powers targeting people in the UK were “growing” and the issue was constantly being raised in international talks. He added: “I think we generally underestimate that threat, and it’s very important we’re alive to it.”Stepped up his criticism of regulators, telling MPs he was “astonished” by how many there were and saying he was “frustrated” by the barriers they put up.Called for an inquiry into thekilling of 15 aid workers in Gazaand said international law “underpins everything we do bilaterally and multilaterally” when questioned about the conflict in the Middle East.Said he would speak to the intelligence agencies and the Kyiv government after Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukraine president, saidtwo Chinese citizens had been captured fightingas part of the Russian army.Said changes to the social care system could come as soon as next year amid a review led by Lady Louise Casey.Explore more on these topicsBritish SteelKeir StarmerTrump tariffsDonald TrumpTariffsRachel ReevesNigel FaragenewsShareReuse this content"

Additionally, the implementation period has been doubled to a maximum of four years for an assisted dying service to be in place.The legislation argues that someone in England and Wales who is terminally ill, with less than six months to live, should be legally allowed to end their life, as long as it has been approved by two doctors and an expert panel.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsAssisted dyingHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

As well as Saunderson’s drug dealing, it revealed his relationship with Pegg.The trial at Preston crown court heard Pegg had signed off on temporary release for Saunderson while she was a governor at HMP Kirkham inLancashire. The court heard that Pegg, who had driven a Honda Jazz before Saunderson gave her the Mercedes, was seen as a “rising star” within the Prison Service, climbing the career ladder from graduate entrant to prison governor in just six years.View image in fullscreenPegg had been driving a Honda Jazz before being given the £12,000 Mercedes C-Class car (pictured).Photograph: Crown Prosecution Services (CPS)/PAPegg joined as governor of HMP Kirkham, a category D men’s open prison, in 2018. Saunderson had been moved to the prison in June 2017 after receiving a 10-year sentence in 2014 for drugs conspiracy and money laundering.“Despite her success, she didn’t play by the rules that everybody else had to follow,” the prosecutor Barbara Webster told the court at the opening of the trial. “Her downfall was twofold – the first, despite having a good income, she lived beyond her means.“She spent all her income and more, incurring debts, and she had county court judgments made against her. As a consequence, she became vulnerable and open to exploitation.”During the trial, it emerged Saunderson had developed and delivered a programme titled BADD (Beating Alcohol and Drug Dependency) for inmates at several jails – while at the time being a major drug dealer running an amphetamines factory.Pegg claimed her contact with Saunderson was owing to his involvement in the BADD programme, but the court heard that even members of his own gang had complained that their boss was spending too much time with Pegg and away from his wife and “work”.Detectives found Saunderson’s DNA on a pair of flip-flops and a toothbrush after a raid at Pegg’s home in Orrell, a suburb of Wigan, the court heard.A police investigation also found that despite Pegg’s £3,000 a month income, she had significant debts, and had not declared three county court judgments to her employers. This amounted to misconduct, as debts make officials vulnerable to corruption.Detectives found designer clothes, handbags and jewellery, and that Pegg had been living beyond her means, buying Jimmy Choo shoes and Chanel necklaces. Her four credit cards were “maxed out” and she had 6p in her savings account, the court heard.“I didn’t think I was doing anything wrong, but when I look back now, I was incredibly stupid,” Pegg told the court, giving evidence in her defence. She was convicted of two counts of misconduct in a public office and one count of possession of criminal property, after the jury deliberated for two hours and 43 minutes following a three-week trial.Pegg did not react as the guilty verdicts were delivered. Judge Knowles told her a prison term was “inevitable”, but bailed Pegg to the court building while the sentencing date was arranged.Outside court, Tarryn McCaffrey, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said: “Kerri Pegg’s conduct fell far short of what might be expected from any professional within the Prison Service, let alone one of such a senior grade as prison governor.“She was clearly involved in an inappropriate relationship with Saunderson after he was released and the evidence points to this going back further, to a time when he was in jail.“This relationship, and the fact that Pegg failed to disclose her debts to her employers, amount to a gross breach of trust and are therefore extremely damaging to public confidence.”Explore more on these topicsPrisons and probationUK criminal justiceLancashireLiverpoolnewsShareReuse this content"

The Ministry of Justice hopes the project will help boost public safety but campaigners have called it “chilling and dystopian”.The existence of the project was discovered by the pressure group Statewatch, and some of its workings uncovered through documents obtained byFreedom of Information requests.Statewatch says data from people not convicted of any criminal offence will be used as part of the project, including personal information about self-harm and details relating to domestic abuse. Officials strongly deny this, insisting only data about people with at least one criminal conviction has been used.The government says the project is at this stage for research only, but campaigners claim the data used would build bias into the predictions against minority-ethnic and poor people.The MoJ says the scheme will “review offender characteristics that increase the risk of committing homicide” and “explore alternative and innovative data science techniques to risk assessment of homicide”.The project would “provide evidence towards improving risk assessment of serious crime, and ultimately contribute to protecting the public via better analysis”, a spokesperson added.The project, which was commissioned by the prime minister’s office when Rishi Sunak was in power, is using data about crime from various official sources including the Probation Service and data from Greater Manchester police before 2015.The types of information processed includes names, dates of birth, gender and ethnicity, and a number that identifies people on the police national computer.Statewatch’s claim that data from innocent people and those who have gone to the police for help will be used is based on a part of the data-sharing agreement between the MoJ and GMP.A section marked: “type of personal data to be shared” by police with the government includes various types of criminal convictions, but also listed is the age a person first appeared as a victim, including for domestic violence, and the age a person was when they first had contact with police.Also to be shared – and listed under “special categories of personal data” - are “health markers which are expected to have significant predictive power”, such as data relating to mental health, addiction, suicide and vulnerability, and self-harm, as well as disability.Sofia Lyall, a researcher for Statewatch, said: “The Ministry of Justice’s attempt to build this murder prediction system is the latest chilling and dystopian example of the government’s intent to develop so-called crime ‘prediction’ systems.“Time and again, research shows that algorithmic systems for ‘predicting’ crime are inherently flawed.“This latest model, which uses data from our institutionally racist police and Home Office, will reinforce and magnify the structural discrimination underpinning the criminal legal system.“Like other systems of its kind, it will code in bias towards racialised and low-income communities. Building an automated tool to profile people as violent criminals is deeply wrong, and using such sensitive data on mental health, addiction and disability is highly intrusive and alarming.”A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said:“This project is being conducted for research purposes only. It has been designed using existing data held by HM Prison and Probation Service and police forces on convicted offenders to help us better understand the risk of people on probation going on to commit serious violence. A report will be published in due course.”Officials say the prison and probation service already use risk assessment tools, and this project will see if adding in new data sources, from police and custody data, would improve risk assessment.Explore more on these topicsCrimeUK criminal justicePrisons and probationPolicenewsShareReuse this content"

The grant was intended to help the company upgrade its ageing blast furnaces, so they would be powered by hydrogen, natural gas and electricity instead of coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel.How JD Vance’s home town has won millions in climate investment that he calls a ‘green scam’Read moreInternal administration documents obtained by CNN reportedly lay out intentions to cut these grants, which would have created more than 100 permanent jobs and 1,200 construction jobs. Sources told CNN that representatives from the “department of government efficiency” had been involved in deciding which funding programs to cut.Marcy Kaptur, theOhiorepresentative, told CNN in a statement: “An unelected billionaire who made his vast fortune off government contracts should not be able to unilaterally stop these programs,” referring to Elon Musk, whose Doge has continuously cut funding and jobs across the federal government.When the grant was first announced, it was met withexcitement among residents and unions, promising new jobs and a more climate-friendly agenda.“It felt like a miracle, an answered prayer that we weren’t going to be left to die on the vine,” Michael Bailey, who worked at the plant for 30 years, told the Guardian.Trump has long been an outspoken fan of coal, and the US vice-president referred to the clean energy legislation as a “green scam”. When Trump won the election in November last year, those who worked in the Ohio steel manufacturing industry and climate advocates were immediately fearful that the promised grant would never be delivered.“It’s no surprise that he’s now threatening to gut a $500m investment in US manufacturing in his own home town,” said Pete Jones, rapid response director at Climate Power.“Vance wrote a book about economic hardship in his home town, and now he has 900 new pages from Trump’s dangerous Project 2025 agenda to make the problem worse so big oil can profit.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationManufacturing sectorOhioJD VanceUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Not the weather, not a bomb – nothing,” Trump told the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, by video link in January. “And we have more coal than anybody.”Energy experts say any bump for coal under Trump is likely to be temporary because natural gas is cheaper and there is a durable market for renewable energy such as wind and solar power no matter who holds the White House.Environmental groups were scathing about the orders, pointing out that coal is in steep decline in the US compared with the increasingly cheap option of renewable energy. This year, 93% of the power added to the US grid will be from solar, wind and batteries, according toforecastsfrom Trump’s own administration.“What’s next, a mandate that Americans must commute by horse and buggy?” said Kit Kennedy, managing director of power at the Natural Resources Defense Council.“Coal plants are old and dirty, uncompetitive and unreliable. TheTrump administrationis stuck in the past, trying to make utility customers pay more for yesterday’s energy. Instead, it should be doing all it can to build the electricity grid of the future.”Clean energy, such as solar and wind, is now so affordable that 99% of the existing US coal fleet costs more just to keep running than to retire a coal plant and replace it with renewables, a2023 Energy Innovation report found.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationCoalRenewable energyArtificial intelligence (AI)Electric, hybrid and low-emission carsEnergy industryFossil fuelsnewsShareReuse this content"

That would come on top of the existing 20% levy and take the total tariff on Chinese imports to 104%.The White House confirmed that the higher US tariffs onChinawould, indeed, be imposed from Wednesday. “President Trump has a spine of steel and he will not break,” the press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said. “And America will not break under his leadership.”Musk reportedly made several pushes for Trump to back off global tariffs surgeRead moreThe billionaire Trump adviserElon Muskhas also reportedly asked the president toreverse course, and the New Civil Liberties Alliance, a libertarian group funded by organisations affiliated with conservative businessmen Leonard Leo and Charles Koch,filed a lawsuitagainst the “illegal” tariffs.The latest tariffs are higher thanthe 10% flat rate imposed on all global imports to the USon Friday last week and are tailored to specific countries based on aformula that has been criticised by economiststhat divides trade in goods deficit by twice the total value of imports.Afterdays of turmoilsince they were first revealed last week, global markets initiallyrecovered some ground on Tuesday as senior US officials attempted to reassure investors that the new tariffs – including rates of 20% on the European Union, 26% on India and 49% on Cambodia – could be temporary.But the bounce didn’t last long. On Wall Street, the benchmark S&P 500 closed down 1.6%, at 4,982.77 – below 5,000 for the first time in more than a year – as the Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.8%. The technology-focused Nasdaq Composite also came under pressure, dropping 2.2%.Earlier in the day, the FTSE 100 rallied by 2.7% in London, recovering some of the losses it has endured since Trump’s announcement – on what was dubbed“liberation day”by his aides – last week. The Nikkei 225 rallied 6% in Tokyo. The Hang Seng Index rose 1.5% in Hong Kong.Scott Bessent, the US treasury secretary, has insisted the new tariffs are at “maximum” levels, and expressed confidence that negotiations will bring them down.“I think you are going to see some very large countries with large trade deficits [with the US] come forward very quickly,” he told CNBC, the financial news network, on Tuesday. “If they come to the table with solid proposals, I think we can end up with some good deals.”Trump was asked on Monday whether the tariffs set the stage for negotiations with countries, or were permanent. “Well, it can both be true,” he told reporters. “There can be permanent tariffs, and there can also be negotiations.”But he again raised the prospect of agreements with countries on Tuesday, trailing a potential deal with South Korea.“Their top TEAM is on a plane heading to the US, and things are looking good,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. “We are likewise dealing with many other countries, all of whom want to make a deal with the United States.”The president added: “‘ONE STOP SHOPPING’ is a beautiful and efficient process!!! China also wants to make a deal, badly, but they don’t know how to get it started. We are waiting for their call. It will happen!”Rachel Reeves, the UK chancellor, sought to ease concerns about market volatility, telling parliament she had spoken to Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, who confirmed “markets are functioning effectively and that our banking system is resilient”.A trade war “is in nobody’s interest”, Reeves argued, confirming that the UK was seeking to negotiate a new deal with the US. Trump has imposed a 10% tariff on UK exports, in line with the minimum benchmark introduced at the weekend.How Trump tariffs could push Vietnam into the arms of ChinaRead moreShe declined to back calls from Liberal Democrats for the government to launch a “buy British” campaign. “In terms of buying British, I think everyone will make their own decisions,” Reeves said. “What we don’t want to see is a trade war, with Britain becoming inward-looking.”China adopted an altogether different stance. In a scathing editorial, the official state news outlet Xinhua accused the US president of “naked extortion”.“Utterly absurd is the underlying logic of the United States: ‘I can hit you at my will, and you must not respond. Instead, you must surrender unconditionally,’” it said. “This is not diplomacy. It is blunt coercion dressed up as policy.”On social media a 1987 speech by Ronald Reagan posted by China’s foreign ministry has been widely shared. The video clip, in which the former US president criticises the use of tariffs as leading to retaliation and ultimately hurting theUS economy, “has a new meaning in 2025”, China’s the Paper said.Bessent argued on Tuesday that China was making a “big mistake” by daring to retaliate. “They’re playing with a pair of twos,” he claimed on CNBC. “What do we lose by the Chinese raising tariffs on us? We export one-fifth to them of what they export to us, so that is a losing hand for them.”This article was amended on 8 April 2025 to clarify that a lawsuit against the tariffs was filed by the New Civil Liberties Alliance, a group that has been funded by organisations affiliated with Leonard Leo and Charles Koch, rather than the businessmen themselves.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsEuropeCanadaAmericasTariffsDonald TrumpUS economynewsShareReuse this content"

Some requested anonymity for fear of retaliation.Knock-on effects from Trump’s attempt to rapidly shrink the federal government by firing workers, slashing funding and cancelling grants are already reaching the private sector, with workers reporting layoffs, price hikes and supply issues.Consumer confidence in the US hasdroppedin March to the lowest level in four years.At least 60,000 federal civil servantshave been fired in recent months, in addition to about 25,000 probationary employees who have been ordered by courts to be reinstated.The federal layoffs have also created challenges in the private sector, with contractors and businesses reliant on federal workers or agencies as customers hit hard.Joseph Revard of Seattle, Washington, worked at a non-profit which provided support and referrals for mental health, substance abuse and problem gambling, he said – until his position was eliminated due to grant withdrawals from the state health department in response to federal cuts.“We work with mostly individuals who are on the state Medicaid program,” said Revard, 67. “These are disenfranchised individuals for a large part, who mean nothing to Donald Trump or Elon Musk.”Another worker, at a copper and brass manufacturing facility in Michigan, said Trump’s aggressive tariff strategy had already caused layoffs and price hikes.“We have had to raise our prices in order to stay profitable,” they said. “We’ve had a round of layoffs and firings, and we’re expecting more as the economy worsens.”Leo Robertson, a metal worker in New Orleans, Louisiana, said many of his suppliers had already increased prices due to uncertainty caused by Trump’s tariffs, forcing him to raise prices, too. He has already lost international customers, he said, including a repeat customer in Canada.“The increase in steel and aluminum tariffs has caused my tools and replacement parts to get even more expensive than they already were,” Robertson said. “My domestic sales have dropped noticeably also, which is understandable, as I’ve had to almost double my prices to keep up with the unstable metals market.“I lost one particularly large commission for some architectural copper panels because the client could no longer afford the materials cost.”A worker at a defense contractor in Alabama, meanwhile, said a number of colleagues had opted for early retirement due to the federal funding cuts. “That leaves a backlog of responsibility,” they said. “But with the hiring freeze it just creates more work for the already overworked.”Amy Wachspress, 70, a semi-retired grant writer based in Portland, Oregon, said their work had dried up through a contractor in Washington DC due to federal funding and grant cuts.“I have continued to work to make enough money to supplement our income and meet our basic living costs,” she said. “We do nothing extravagant. No travel. Rarely eat out. Modest living. But I am seeing my work dry up. I need to make about $15,000 a year to cover our expenses that go beyond what we can pay using my husband’s pension and our social security.”Wachspress and her husband are particularly concerned about cuts to social security benefits. Without them, she said, they would lose their house. Her husband relies on Medicare for treating diabetes and several chronic health conditions.“If we lose Medicare, he will die. So will many, many other people,” she added. “I am personally more sad than anxious. I am grieving for all that we have lost and all that we stand to lose.”Explore more on these topicsUS economyTrump administrationDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Prior to that it was 2008.”Others leaving the exchange agreed that the reaction to a false report of a 90-day pause on US tariffs, except for China, which the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt,shot downas “fake news”, showed just how edgy the markets are.“The markets want to go higher, but they’re waiting for a reason to go higher,” said a trader who offered his name as Jay, who, like many traders, said he did not want to give his full name as he was not authorized to speak to the media.Monday’s wild gyrations came after a misreading of aninterviewwith Kevin Hassett, director of the national economic council, on Fox News on Sunday. In the interview, Hassett was asked whether Trump could call a “90-day timeout” on his tariffs, to which Hassett responded: “I think the president will decide what the president is going to decide.”But Jay said “everything” they saw was about Trump’s relationship with China. The administration, he said, “was trying to get everyone onboard so they can box China out. I think they’re saying, look, we will drop the tariffs on you, but you have to tariff China.“Everything is about China. Everything. It’s not about lumber or fentanyl, it’s about China. Greenland is 100% about China – and Russia, to a degree. Panama is about China. This is all about slowing China down.”But, he said, no one was anticipating that the US was looking to become an insulated, self-sustaining nation. “Nobody wants that. They just want it more fair,” he said.“Now we’re $37tn in debt and it needs to be rejigged, but he [Trump] is trying to do it in a shock-and-awe fashion. It could be months or years before we know whether he’s successful or not … but obviously it’s going to take some pain.“The question is, how much pain can our economy and stock market take for the good things to happen? If it’s one or two weeks of sell-offs, we can stomach that, but if it’s months, the congressmen facing election next year are going to squeal …”The market swings, said Stephen, another trader, showed that “no one knows what’s going on. We don’t know. The swing came out of nowhere, so what was that? Then the market falls out of bed. And then you read fake news. I mean, who put that up? A mistake? Ah, I don’t know.”Asked if we are all in Donald Trump’s hands, the trader said: “You’ve got to hope he has a gameplan he’s not disclosing. That’s where I lay my hope. In actuality, it’s very scary. It’s a scary time right now.”Another, leaving the exchange, said the picture of a trading floor with brokers yelling and screaming to sell was highly archaic. There had been anxiety on the trading floor, yes, but since most trading is done automatically, by computer: “It’s more like organized chaos.”The day’s trading had in fact been relatively quiet, with the Dow Jones ending down 349 points, or less than 1%, on the day, and the S&P down 12, or 0.23%.“I think there was a lot more anxiety overnight in the pre-market trading, and then it settled down and evened out,” said a trader who offered his name as Gordon. Looking toward the next few days, many expect continuing volatility.But with volatility also comes the opportunity to make money. Trump may have set off the market turmoil last week with his Rose Garden“liberation day”reciprocal tariff presentation – including Heard Island and McDonald Islands in the southern Indian Ocean, populated only by penguins – but there are trading patterns to be found, and where there are patterns, there is opportunity.A technical analyst, Anthony, a veteran of Wall Street since 1997, said the volatility in trading was being determined by Trump’s comments, that were in turn triggering automated trading algorithms to move the markets “like a rubber band”. He analyst said retail investors had not even begun selling off yet, “but it’s coming”.“What’s happening is that it’s going to hit the American people, and they’re going to keep their wallet closed in their pocket. Without a doubt, we’re hitting a recession,” he said. But would the traders still make money? “You bet. You can make more in a down market than up market.”But ultimately, he said, Donald Trump is not for ever. “We might be under the mercy of him right now, but just like the World Trade Center, the 70s oil embargo, [Alan] Greenspan with Long-Term Capital Management – all these things happen. It’s a blip. He’s going to come and he’s going to go.“He’s going to try to push everything he can through now, before the midterms. It’s going to blow up in his face, cause a recession, and any president that causes a recession never gets re-elected – and nor does his party.”Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsStock marketsEconomicsTariffsDonald TrumpfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But the president ultimately disregarded the representations and doubled down on his policy on Monday bythreatening to impose an additional 50% tariffon China after it responded to the original trade levy by announcing a 34% tariff on US imports.At the same time as Musk was pleading with Trump, he was appearing online at a rightwing conference in Italycalling for zero tariffsbetween the US and the European Union. “That has certainly been my advice to the president,” he told attenders of the far-right League party conference in Florence.On Monday, Musk escalated an insult-heavy social media feud with Peter Navarro, a key Trump ally and White House trade adviser said to be a guiding force behind the tariffs strategy.China vows to ‘fight to the end’ against latest Trump tariff threatRead moreOver the weekend, in response to a video Navarro posted about the administration’s rationale for the tariff strategy, Muskattacked Navarro’s master’s degreein economics from Harvard University. Musk did the same in a reply to a commentator who praised the Navarro video, writing: “He ain’t built shit.”More name-calling followed on Monday, after Navarro called Musk a “car assembler” rather than a manufacturer because many Tesla electric vehicle (EV) parts come from overseas.“Navarro truly is a moron. What he says here is demonstrably false,” Musksaid in one post. In another, he wrote a derogatory term for somebody with a learning disability andadded: “Tesla has the most American-made cars. Navarro is dumber than a sack of bricks.”Neither theTrump administrationnor Musk responded to requests for comment.The Post said Musk’s opposition to what has become Trump’s signature economic policy “marks the highest-profile disagreement between the president and one of his key advisers”. It follows reports that the billionairewill soon be leaving governmentto return to running his businesses.Experts, however, expect the split to be amicable, with Musk set to retain close ties and influence with the president as well as onUS politicsgenerally.“Elon is fantastic,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One on his way to Florida on Thursday, saying he wished Musk could stay in government but wanted to return to his various companies.Tesla, in particular, has seen asharp drop in salesof EVs in the US and Europe since Musk began his work for Doge. A backlash to Musk’s politics materialized in the form of protests and vandalism at his vehicle dealerships.The FBI announced in March that it was forming a taskforce to target violence at Tesla sales points and charging stations, which included the discovery of incendiary devices at a dealership in Austin, Texas, and the arrest of a man in West Palm Beach, Florida, who allegedly tried to use an SUV to strike a group of protesters.Wall Street traders on Trump tariffs: ‘Without doubt, we’re hitting a recession’Read moreShares in Tesla were trading at $233.29 at market close on Monday, Reuters reported, down more than 42% since the beginning of the year.More trouble for Musk could be looming in Washington DC over potential conflicts of interest involving SpaceX, a key Nasa contractor.The Democratic congressmen Gerald Connolly and Maxwell Frost havewritten to Nasa’s chief legal officerseeking information about $38bn in government contracts awarded to SpaceX at a time when Musk’s Doge is gutting federal spending and slashing jobs at numerous federal institutions, including the US government’s space agency.“At Nasa, where Mr Musk has both benefited from significant contracts and has the potential to receive vast amounts of new business, his defiance of recusal laws and control of operations directly benefit his businesses,” the Democrats wrote.“The known conflicts of interest presented by this arrangement are illegal and must be addressed immediately.”Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsElon MuskDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

TheWall Street Crashof 1929 came after a frenzy of speculative share-buying, creating a bubble in the market, with the subsequent collapse triggering the Great Depression of the 1930s and the economic climate that led to the second world war.The Dow Jones industrial average fell by 11% on “Black Thursday,” 24 October, which was followed by a 13% fall on the Monday and an 11% tumble a day later. The downward spiral wouldtake until June 1932 to bottom out, by which point the companies on the New York stock exchange had lost 90% of their value.1987 ‘Black Monday’The first big global financial crash of the modern era, brought about, again, by a speculative bubble in the boom and bust 1980s. The Dow Jones recorded its biggest-ever daily fall, with a 22% rout on 19 October.The London market also came crashing down; in a collapse made worse by the closure of the stock exchange on the Friday amid the travel chaos caused by theGreat Storm of 1987– infamously glossed over the previous evening by the BBC weather forecaster Michael Fish.With City traders struggling to return to their desks, and with computer-automated trading adding to the rout, theFTSE100 fell by 10.8% on the Monday, with a further 12.2% plunge the following day.Here’s one key thing you should know about Trump’s shock to the world economy: it could work | James MeadwayRead more2000 dotcom crash and 9/11The hysteria of the1990s boom in stock market listingsby fast-growth internet companies drove the FTSE 100 to a peak of 6,930.2 on 30 December 1999 – a record that would stand for the next 15 years.Early in the new millennium, the dotcom bubble burst in March 2000, and the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001 crashed the index back down to a trough of 3,287 by the time coalition forces were gathering to prepare for the invasion of Iraq in 2003.Investors have drawn parallels with the market exuberance at the end of the last century by highlighting themeteoric rise of the so-called “magnificent seven”group of US tech stocks, and subsequent crash in valuations over recent weeks.2008 financial crisisLehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy on 15 September 2008, in the watershed moment of the worst financial crisis of the postwar age. Global markets had been in deep trouble for some time as the credit crunch raged; with its roots in theUS sub-prime home loan market.On the day of Lehman’s collapse, the FTSE 100 fell by a relatively limited 4%, but would go on to lose almost a third of its value in 2008 as a result of the global financial crisis.The bank runs, company failures and fears of the international recession it would trigger led to some of the steepest daily losses in trading history, with an almost 9% rout on 10 October marking the height of the chaos.FTSE graphic2016 Brexit voteBritain’s shock vote to leave the EU sent the pound tumbling to a 31-year low anderased more than $2tn (£1.57tn) of valuefrom global financial markets, with the heaviest losses on the FTSE 100 and European trading hubs.The FTSE 100 collapsed by 8% within the first minutes of opening; but recovered some ground afterMark Carney, the then governor of the Bank of England, promisedit would not hesitate to take action to stabilise markets and the economy. The FTSE 100 ended the day down 3.2%.2020 Covid pandemicThe forced shutdown of the global economy during the health emergency of the Covid pandemic triggered panic in financial markets and the deepest recession since at least the 1930s Great Depression.Major landmarks in the global markets toppled in a matter of hours and days, including more than eight years of gains on the FTSE 100 being wiped out in barely a month, while global stocks had their best and worst sessions in a decade on consecutive days.The FTSE 100 recorded its biggest daily fall since Black Monday, of almost 11%, while the Dow fell by about 13% on 16 March. However, rapid intervention from central banks and governments helped instil a dramatic turnaround.Explore more on these topicsMarket turmoilStock marketsFTSELehman BrothersCredit crunchFinancial crisisBankinganalysisShareReuse this content"

Overall, deliveries of Porsche cars fell by 8% in the first quarter of the year to 71,470.Slowing orders come as the US presidentenforces a 25% levyon car imports to the US, as part of a bigger package of trade tariffs that has caused abrutal sell-off in global stock markets.The tariffs are a threat to sales in an automotive industry already grappling with a broader slowdown in consumer spending and intense electric vehicle competition for US and European firms fromChina.Porsche did not say whether the US tariffs had had an impact on sales.Part of the drop in its deliveries in Europe was also down to the discontinuation of some models that did not meet EU cybersecurity regulations, including the 718 and the Macan combustion-engine model.The Macan model was, however, still Porsche’s bestseller in the period, with deliveries up 14% to 23,555. More than 60% of these cars were the all-electric type.Shares in Porsche, which is listed in Frankfurt, have lost roughly a quarter of their value since the start of the year as investors have braced for a hit from Trump’s tariffs. The shares were flat on Tuesday.Some of the world’s biggest carmakers have been forced to find ways to mitigate the cost of the new tariffs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the first leg of aChampions Leaguequarter-final. And not just once, either. On a red-letter occasion for Arsenal, probably the finest since the Emirates Stadium opened in 2006, their key midfielder brought the house down; Real Madrid to their knees, as well.It is never wise to write off the Champions League holders, the 15‑time winners – the club that have the patent on astonishing comebacks. Surely not this time.‘Nice bit of history’: Rice delight after Arsenal’s famous win against MadridRead moreRice had never scored from a direct free-kick in his nine-season professional career. That took in 338 previous games forArsenaland West Ham; 64 for England, too. That he did it twice inside 12 second-half minutes had grown men and women rubbing their eyes and contending with extraordinary levels of delirium.Rice’s conversions were marked by precision, a total mastery of the flight of the ball, vicious levels of whip and for Arsenal, there would be even more. The outstanding Myles Lewis-Skelly had carried the fight to Real throughout; they could not cope with his inverted runs into midfield, his shoulder drops and bursts, his searching low passes.When he went square at the end of yet another Arsenal incision, Mikel Merino swept home for 3-0 and Arsenal could start to dream of the semi-finals and beyond. It was the latest dividend from Merino’s switch to centre forward. To think that he had never played in the position until mid‑February; from it, he now has six goals for Arsenal.Real had lost at home against Valencia in La Liga on Saturday, conceding a 95th‑minute winner, which is not the kind of thing that is supposed to happen to them. It is normally them driving the last-gasp turnarounds. They now trail Barcelona by four points and the muttering about just how good this team is has been a soundtrack of the season.The Champions League is the competition that tends to lift their numerous A-listers into Best Actor nomination territory, but not here. Save for a spell of 20 minutes or so in the middle of the first half, they were second best, outrun and outplayed, their misery complete when Eduardo Camavinga was sent off for kicking the ball away at the very end; a second bookable offence.Rice transcended the night, one of the images of it coming after he had picked out the far, top corner for his second. He jumped on to the top of an advertising board, arms outstretched, literally 10 feet tall. Was that the better goal? It was hard to say because the first was also a beauty.Rice started the ball a yard or so outside Thibaut Courtois’s left-hand post and he was able to bring it back inside at the very last – halfway up the net. There was a reason why the TV cameras picked out the former RealgalacticoRoberto Carlos in the crowd and it is worth making the point that the beaten goalkeeper, Courtois, just might be the best in Europe.It was an extraordinary occasion for Arsenal, the club’s biggest game since 2009-10 when they faced Barcelona in the quarter-final of this competition and lost. The ensuing years have not been kind to the Gunners in terms of the Champions League, their only quarter-final appearance since then and before this coming last season when they fell against Bayern Munich.View image in fullscreenReal Madrid’s goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois looks dejected as Mikel Merino (centre) wheels away in celebration after scoring Arsenal’s third goal.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianHow they have craved a night of this type of glamour and it was one when the goosebumps rose on arms around the stadium from the first whistle, the tempo so high.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But Mikel Arteta’s players seemed intent on answering the call on a pre-match tifo from their fans. “Make it happen,” went the wording.Arsenal almost got one of their trademark inswinging corners to work in the early going, Courtois losing his bearings and happy to see the ball hit William Saliba, who was almost on the line in front of goal. Thomas Partey would also work Courtois.Real defended in a 4-4-2 formation, Jude Bellingham dropping to the left of the midfield but they menaced on the transitions in the first half. Their big chance came when Bellingham robbed Jurriën Timber and played a pass in behind for Mbappé, who turned on the jets. David Raya stood tall to block.Back came Arsenal before the interval and it was Bukayo Saka to the fore. He tricked and teased, getting around the outside but nobody in red could read his crosses. Rice would pop up on to one from Timber on 45 minutes only for Courtois to repel his header and block the follow-up shot from Gabriel Martinelli.It was Saka who won the free-kicks for Rice’s goals and, in between times, Courtois saved from Martinelli and after Merino’s follow-up was cleared off the line by David Alaba, the goalkeeper turned over when Merino shot again. Bellingham also cleared a Rice shot off the line. It was simply a scintillating Arsenal performance.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueArsenalReal MadridEuropean club footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

He played for a then record 13 different teams, spending the most time with the Houston Astros between 2000 and 2004. His career high-point came when he was part of theSt Louis Cardinalsthat won the World Series in 2011. His final season in the majors was with the Detroit Tigers in 2013. Dotel was known as a strikeout pitcher and at his peak was one of the best relievers in the league.At least 58 people dead after roof collapse at Dominican Republic nightclubRead more“We are heartbroken to learn the tragic news that former Astros pitcher Octavio Dotel was one of several individuals that passed away when a roof collapsed in his native Dominican Republic last night,” the Astros said in a statement on Tuesday. “While in Houston, he was one of the top relievers in all of baseball and was a significant part of a dominant bullpen that included Hall of Famer Billy Wagner and All-Star Brad Lidge. A workhorse, Dotel’s club-leading 159 appearances in 2002-03 combined were second in the Majors in that span, during which he posted a 2.15 ERA.”During the Mets-Marlins broadcast on Tuesday afternoon, longtime Mets play-by-play announcer Gary Cohen said: “Everyone who ever met Octavio loved him.”Another Dominican baseball player, Tony Blanco, was killed in the collapse. He had briefly played for the Washington Nationals in 2005.Dotel overcame significant challenges on his way to the majors, including the death of his fatherwho was murdered during a robbery. Dotel said he used baseball as a way of keeping his mind off his father’s death. “I can do nothing if I go to the ballpark and think about him all the time,” Dotel said. “I just have to keep playing hard and get what I’m looking for. I think God helps me because I’m here. I’m here and I appreciate it. I would enjoy it more if my dad was still here, but everybody’s got to die.”Jet Set, the nightclub where Tuesday’s tragedy took place, says it is cooperating with authorities. “The loss of human life leaves us in a state of deep pain and dismay,” the nightclub said in a statement.Explore more on these topicsBaseballMLBSt Louis CardinalsHouston AstrosUS sportsDominican RepublicAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The Nuggets said Malone’s long-time assistant coach, David Adelman, will take charge for the rest of the season.ESPN reported on Tuesdaythat there had been tension between Malone and Booth over the direction of the team as the Nuggets integrated younger players and let veterans of the title run leave.Josh Kroenke, the vice chairman of Kroenke Sports and Entertainment, said “it is with no pleasure” that the Nuggets made the change.“This decision was not made lightly and was evaluated very carefully, and we do it only with the intention of giving our group the best chance at competing for the 2025NBAChampionship and delivering another title to Denver and our fans everywhere,” Kroenke said.The Nuggets are 47-32 this season with three games left but have dropped four consecutive games and are in a logjam of teams fighting for home-court advantage in the first-round of the playoffs. Denver won the title in 2023 and lost a Game 7 at home in the Western Conference semi-finals a year ago to Minnesota.Nikola Jokić is putting up record numbers. So why is he unlikely to be NBA MVP?Read moreMalone had the fourth-longest tenure of any active NBA coach, behind San Antonio’s Gregg Popovich, Miami’s Erik Spoelstra and Golden State’s Steve Kerr.Malone won 471 regular-season games in Denver, 39 more than Doug Moe for the franchise’s all-time coaching lead.“While the timing of this decision is unfortunate, as Coach Malone helped build the foundation of our now championship level program, it is a necessary step to allow us to compete at the highest level right now. Championship level standards and expectations remain in place for the current season, and as we look to the future, we look forward to building on the foundations laid by Coach Malone over his record-breaking 10-year career in Denver,” Kroenke said.Malone had consistent success in Denver. The Nuggets finished with losing records in his first two seasons but then posted winning records in his next eight years with the club. He also helped oversee Nikola Jokić’s development from a second-round pick intoarguably the best player in the world. The three-time MVP, who is averaging 30 points, 12.8 rebounds and 10.2 assists per game this season, was asked after Sunday’s defeat to Indiana what his biggest concern about the team was.“I don’t know. Maybe we just, maybe we just ... I don’t know, actually,” Jokić said.Malone blamed himself for the team’s form after Sunday’s loss. “I’ll start with me: We’ve lost four games in a row and I’m never going to this-guy, that-guy. How about me, as a head coach, not doing my job to the best of my ability,” Malone said. “We haven’t lost four in a row in a long time. It’s really easy to be together and say ‘family’ when you win, but when you’re losing games, can you stay together?”This year’s postseason appearance will be the team’s seventh in a row; the Nuggets have not clinched a playoff berth yet this season but are assured of finishing no worse than in the play-in tournament.Starting with the first playoff appearance under Malone in 2019, the Nuggets got out of the first round six times in seven chances. They made the Western Conference finals in the Walt Disney World bubble in 2020 and then rolled to the championship by winning 16 of 20 playoff games in 2023.It is the second time a postseason-bound team has fired a coach in the last two weeks. Memphis parted ways with Taylor Jenkins late last month, replacing him with Tuomas Iisalo on an interim basis.Booth came to the Nuggets in 2017 as an assistant general manager and was promoted to GM in July 2020. He signed his most recent contract with the club in 2022. Kroenke credited Booth “for helping put the final pieces in place for the roster that delivered Denver and our fans their first NBA championship.”“Calvin’s knowledge of the game, his passion for scouting, and his long history as a player and executive in the NBA helped lift our organization to new heights which we will continue moving forward,” Kroenke said.Explore more on these topicsDenver NuggetsNBABasketballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Meteorologists at the National Hurricane Center had been watching it building for a week, as it moved away from Nicaragua, up past Grand Cayman, Cancún, and Cuba, and the governor of Georgia, Brian Kemp, had declared a state of emergency on the Tuesday afternoon.“The current forecast for Hurricane Helene suggests this storm will impact every part of our state,” Kemp said, but in Augusta, over in the east of the state, people felt safe, they had not had a hurricane here in almost 100 years, and this one was forecast to pass it by.McIlroy claims accepting ‘heartbreak’ at Masters can aid Augusta pursuitRead moreUntil it took a turn north‑northeast, and started to accelerate. It hit the city at a hundred miles an hour, the anemometers at Augusta airport stopped working at 82mph, right around the time the power went down. “Augusta ended up sitting under the absolute worst part of the storm,” reported the National Weather Service. It was not just the wind – more than 12 inches of rain, an entire winter’s worth, fell in the space of a few hours. People talk about how the pop-and-flash of the power lines going down lit up the sky.When it was over, more than 30 people had died in the city and the surrounding counties, 11 people were killed by falling trees, which crushed cars, trailers, and houses, and many more of cardiac and respiratory failure during the power outage that followed, often because their medical equipment could not function, 362 homes were destroyed, more than 3,000 suffered what was described as “major damage”.Six months on,the city is still recovering. The authorities have had to clear almost 3m cubic yards of debris from the city streets, and the work is still going on in the suburbs, especially out by Tobacco Road. In the streets around Augusta National, the fences are gap-toothed, the panels cracked and scattered, and giant rootballs, ripped out of the ground, squat on front lawns like Brobdingnagian dust balls, plenty of houses are still under tarpaulins, the entire process has been slowed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s decision to cut off relief funding in February.View image in fullscreenA tree on top of a building in Augusta in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.Photograph: Joe Raedle/Getty ImagesIn years gone by, Augusta has often seemed ambivalent about the National golf club, which sits up on the hill just outside the centre. But it was glad to have it now. In the days immediately after the Hurricane, the club pumped money into the city, culminating in a $5m donation to local relief aid. The chair, Fred Ridley, has done a good job of improving relations with the local community. His big announcement this year was about the redevelopment of the municipal golf course, The Patch, and the establishment of a new community education centre, both in partnership with Tiger Woods.“I’m most proud of how our organisation pitched in with the Augusta community and really helped out because there were many, many people, many of our people were out of their homes for a number of weeks,” Ridley said. “No electricity, no water for a while.”People remember who was there when the city needed help, which local restaurants were the ones to start handing out free hot meals and which stores were the ones to put up the prices of badly needed essentials. Ridley made sure that Augusta National played its part, and it has been rewarded for it with renewed goodwill this spring, when most locals are happy to have it back.There is a stark contrast with the club’s reaction after the ice storm that hit the city in 2014, when the biggest worry was how the 17th was going to play after the Eisenhower Tree fell down.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Stand outside the clubhouse now and you can see all the way through to the 15th green, and from the 11th tee-box, you can even see right over into the Augusta Country Club next door. Even Gary Player, who has been coming here for the best part of 70 years, can’t recall the last time that was possible. Their guess is that at least a few hundred fallen trees had to be removed from the property. They have put in plenty of new ones, but they’re still growing.It means the course will play a little differently this year.“There are a couple of tee shots that are maybe a little less visually intimidating now,” Rory McIlroy said. On the 10th, for instance, players tend to shoot for the camera tower down at the bottom of the hill. “You used to not be able to see it, but now you can see that pretty clearly, which means visually it looks like you don’t have to turn the ball as much as you used to.” On the 3rd, there is more room up the right side, “where a couple of the overhanging trees aren’t there any more.” It may even open up a couple of shots. “I have heard a few things. Somebody did tell me you can hit a high cut over the cabins on 10,” said Jon Rahm. “I don’t believe it.”You notice it on the 1st most of all, the opening shot passes by a line of eight new trees in between three or four that made it through the storm. They’re snaggled and toothpick skinny, their upper reaches sheared clean by the wind, a lasting reminder that there are some things beyond even Augusta National’s control.Explore more on these topicsThe MastersPGA TourGolfUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The prospect of a home final will disappear if they do not win at San Siro next week and there may be no fairytale goodbye for one of their legends.Thomas Müller is an all-Bavarian icon and, sniffing space in the manner that has defined his career, appeared to have salvaged at least a draw soon after arriving from the bench. The script seemed clear enough from there: three days after the announcement that a 25-year marriage is almost over, Muller would bring Bayern closer to a blissful reunion with the trophy they cherish most.Declan Rice’s double rocket sinks Real Madrid to put Arsenal in dreamlandRead moreThat was until Inter put it in the shredder. Simone Inzaghi’s side spend periods looking indifferent but can produce moments of thrilling incision and are emphatic in front of goal. They were on the ropes after Müller’s equaliser but did as so many Italian sides have, mastering the situation and finding a way. When the tireless Carlos Augusto mustered one last lung-busting up run up the left flank, the substitute Davide Frattesi was placed to crash in his delivery and send Inter’s contingent streaming towards the corner flag.Frattesi ripped off his shirt but Bayern, guilty of leaving the door unlocked when searching for a winner, were the ones exposed. A cobbled-together team, visibly diminished by the long-term injuries to Alphonso Davies and Jamal Musiala, may regret not opting to lock the result down. Perhaps the absence of Dayot Upamecano, one of several others in the treatment room, played into their ragged defensive shape when Inter picked them apart decisively.If you cannot win it, at least do not lose it? “It wouldn’t be the right thing to feel that this 2-1 was a reflection of us not being able to win the game,” Vincent Kompany demurred, preferring to point out the flawless execution of an Inter counterattack masterminded by the exceptional Nicolo Barella. “The result is for Inter at half-time, well done to them, but we still have full belief we can win.”Their confidence might be burgeoning were it not for a moment that may yet give Harry Kane nightmares. The horror on his face was palpable when, after 26 minutes in which Bayern peppered Yann Sommer’s goal, he was found eight yards out by an unselfish Michael Olise. Even at a slight angle, only one outcome seemed possible when Kane wrapped his right foot round the ball. Instead his shot clipped the far post; nobody has scored moreChampions Leaguegoals than Kane since his move to Bayern but it is hard not to wonder whether his pursuit of glory is cursed.By then Bayern should have already been in front, if only due to the volume of half-chances created. Olise, trying to summon the big-game impetus Musiala has honed, saw an early shot deflected inches wide and forced two saves from Sommer. The former Bayern keeper also denied Raphaël Guerreiro, who was pressed into an attacking role due to Bayern’s selection issues, and caught a header from Kane.

Martínez began a move on halfway that ended with Augusto centring low for MarcusThuram, who showed extraordinary presence of mind to detect the Argentinian behind him. He wrong-footed the Bayern rearguard by flicking backwards towards his colleague and the finish, taken first-time with the outside of Martínez’s foot, was resounding.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Kompany’s players came to look laboured, nobody proving capable of emulating Musiala’s bursts beyond Kane and a lack of left-sided thrust painfully evident without Davies.There was little to enthuse the home crowd until Müller’s introduction, which raised the volume and brought fleeting reward when he bundled Konrad Laimer’s cross in from close range. “A fantastic moment for Thomas,” Kompany said. Bayern will need another when they seek inspiration in Lombardy.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueBayern MunichInternazionaleEuropean club footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

To the Premier League and beyond is the mission, no longer being the second city’s second wheel.Chris Davies, a rookie manager – though someone football insiders will point to as a significant power behind the thrones of Brendan Rodgers and Ange Postecoglou – could celebrate promotion at first time of asking.“This club has suffered a lot,” he said. “It’s about creating memories, bringing fans joy and making them proud of their club.”Birmingham’s aptitude for the task of returning to the Championship has been apparent since early season and spending £25m on 17 new players. A record League One points total remains possible, too. Now for Wembley, the Vertu Trophy final on Sunday, again againstPeterborough, the chance to complete a lower league double. After that, controls are set for the heart of the sun.“We signed good characters,” Davies said. “I think for too long this club had players that weren’t the right character. Whether we win, lose or draw, you’ll always see this lot fighting. That’s what the fans ultimately want for their club.”Echoes of 30 years ago, of Paul Tait’s Autowindscreens Shields Trophy winner with an estimated 50,000 City fans at Wembley, Barry Fry was Blues manager. Fry – the ever ebullient, archetypal wheeler-dealer – is, at 80, still Peterborough’s director of football. The club he joined from the Blues in 1996 will defend the Vertu Trophy at Wembley, where they have never lost. His former club’s fans gave him a rousing reception during a pre‑match promenade.View image in fullscreenBirmingham City players celebrate promotion after their hard-fought win at Peterborough.Photograph: Joe Giddens/PAWith Wembley in mind, Davies – the antithesis of last season’s disastrous dalliance with Wayne Rooney – had rested Jay Stansfield, whose August signing for £15m from Fulham sent shockwaves across the EFL, as well as Marco Silva, who had made plans for the striker. At London Road there appeared to be no appetite for a pre-Wembley détente; instead, an open contest, both teams looking to attack.Krystian Bielik, the Blues captain, thrashed an effort wide with the entire goal to aim at but soon enough, in the 20th minute, Alfie May headed in Taylor Gardner-Hickman’s cross to begin the party in the away end.View image in fullscreenBirmingham fans in full voice after securing promotion to the Championship.Photograph: Joe Giddens/PAThe travelling fans’ noise didn’t abate when Kwame Poku thrashed in an equaliser. That increased Birmingham’s concentration on the task in hand, as Tomoki Iwata and Marc Leonard gained control of midfield. Eventually, after a patient buildup, Gardner-Hickman from the left fired in a shot to which Nicholas Bilokapic could only get a hand.Tom Wagner, the venture capitalist majority City owner, was not present, and neither had the minority owner and chairman of the advisory boardTom Bradytravelled to Cambridgeshire. Presumably both, and special guests, will be at Wembley. Davies said: “What I do know is that we’ve got great owners that are extremely ambitious, but also very supportive and understand the challenges of the landscape of English football.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

News of a goal from third-placed Wycombe solidified the requirement of victory.With 15 minutes left, Stansfield replaced May, Davies seeking the cutting edge his team’s dominance had not produced. All the noise came from the west Midlands contingent attempting to kill their own nerves through song.There was defending to do, too, Ryan Allsop making a save from Sam Hughes’s header. Another substitute, Keshi Anderson, looked set to seal it but fired wide, leaving five minutes to play in which the veteran Grant Hanley came on to add defensive numbers.Eventually, gratefully, Birmingham reached their finish line, and the players could run to 3,379 away fans for a lengthy celebration ritual, including fizz-fuelled photo call.“These young men have had a lot of expectation and pressure,” Davies said, while the party raged on inside the dressing room. “In there they’re loving it.” The belief at Birmingham is that promotion, and Wembley, will be just the start.Explore more on these topicsLeague OneBirmingham CityTom BradyPeterboroughmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Houston buckled. And for Kelvin Sampson’s Cougars, that sliver of difference will sting for a long time.“They made one more play than we did tonight,” said Sampson, denied his 800th win and first national title of a 30-year career in a contest where his team trailed for only 64 seconds all night. “We lost by two points. That’s what it came down to.”That play, and the championship, was decided in the final reel. With five seconds to go, Houston’s Emanuel Sharp caught the ball near the top of the key, preparing to rise for a potential game-winning three. But that’s when Walter Clayton Jr – Florida’s All-American guard who had struggled to find a rhythm all night – came flying at him, full sprint, hands high, staying just off-center to avoid fouling.Florida roar back to break Houston hearts and capture third NCAA titleRead moreSharp hesitated. He dropped the ball. And in that split-second of confusion, it was over.“My mind was kind of blank, honestly,” Clayton said. “I was just going 100%, trying to get a stop. We ended up getting it.”Florida’s bench erupted. The team’s Aussie center Alex Condon dove to the floor and covered the loose ball as the horn sounded. The Gators stormed the court in celebration, 65–63 winners and NCAA champions for the first time since their back-to-back titles under Billy Donovan in 2006 and 2007.“I just dove on it, heard the buzzer go,” Condon said. “Didn’t feel real. Crazy feeling.”Until the final three minutes, Houston had been in control. They are one of theslowest-paced teams in all of college basketball, and the game was played in the grind-it-out tempo where they thrive. The Cougars had committed just four turnovers through the first 36 minutes and 35 seconds. Then in a collapse as swift as it was shocking, they turned the ball over five times in the final 3:24, including on each of their final four possessions.That doomed stretch:1:21– Joseph Tugler stripped in the paint0:52– LJ Cryer lost the ball under pressure0:26– Sharp dribbled the ball off his leg in a triple-team trap0:00– Sharp dropped the ball on the final play, unable to recover without travelingOver that span, the Cougars couldn’t manage a single shot attempt.“Incomprehensible in that situation,” Sampson said. “We didn’t need a three. We just needed a good look. And we didn’t even get a shot off.”For a program defined by its late-game tenacity and composure all season, the meltdown was both uncharacteristic and heartbreaking. It’s a devastation right up there with 1983, when the Phi Slama Jama powerhouse led by Hakeem Olajuwon and Clyde Drexlerwere vanquishedby heavy underdog North Carolina State on Lorenzo Charles’ alley-oop dunk at the buzzer – a moment that has come to symbolize the anything-can-happen ethos of March Madness.“That’s been a strength of ours all year long, was winning close games,” said Sampson, who was making his third Final Four appearance after previous trips with Oklahoma in 2002 and Houston four years ago. “But tonight we didn’t.”View image in fullscreenHouston head coach Kelvin Sampson leaves the court after the Cougars’ defeat to Florida in the NCAA title game on Monday night at the Alamodome.Photograph: Eric Gay/APClayton, who didn’t score until nearly 15 minutes remained, finished with 11 points and the game’s defining defensive play.“We work on that stuff in practice,” he said. “Jumping to the side so you don’t foul the shooter, staying down on pump fakes. He pump faked, threw the ball down, and Do [Condon] got on it. We won the game.”For Houston’s seniors, the loss cut deep.“I wanted it so bad for him,” J’Wan Roberts said, speaking about Sampson, who at 69 would have become the oldest coach to win a national title. “So, so, so bad. And it hurts. This was my last time wearing the jersey, and I feel terrible.”LJ Cryer, who led all scorers with 19 points, was still processing the ending.“We thought this was a game that if we played well, we could win,” he said. “And we did play well. We just didn’t play very good the last three minutes.”Golden, who became the youngest coach to win a national title since Jim Valvano with NC State in 1983, knew the Gators had to make plays on the margins. And they did, denying Houston’s bid for the program’s first championship in its 80-year history and reducing the Cougars to a third-time bridesmaid.“Down the stretch, we just made some big-time winning plays defensively,” he said. “That last play was absolutely an amazing play. Walter recovered, closed out without fouling, and Condo did what he does – got physical, dove on the floor, made a winning play.”That was the difference: four final possessions, four turnovers, zero shots. And one more play for the Gators.Explore more on these topicsNCAA Tournament 2025College basketballUS sportsNCAA TournamentCollege sportsShareReuse this content"

They also have Jerry JonesDallas have a proven ability to pick up talented players in the draft. But their owner doesn’t help when it comes to free agencyDoug FarrarTue 8 Apr 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 8 Apr 2025 05.48 EDTShareWell, Jerry Jones has done it again – and not in a good way.The Dallas Cowboys’ owner, president, and general manager has once again waited too long to re-sign one of his key players, and he’s going to pay for it as a result. At the 2025 NFL owners’ meetings in early April, Jones was asked about edge-rushing superstar Micah Parsons, and how to keep him on the team.Parsons is probably the Cowboys’ best overall player at this point, and2025 will mark the final season of his rookie contract. Dallas will pay Parsons a fully guaranteed $24m in that final year, will soon look like a bargain – no matter when or where Parsons signs his next deal.The problem for Jones and his Cowboys is that Jones has waited too long to make the deal, and has cost himself too much money with the delay. As the NFL’s salary cap continues to rise as the result of increasing revenue from broadcast deals, players are getting bigger contracts, and every NFL executive worth his or her salt is well aware of the fact. Jones waited too long with quarterback Dak Prescott, who signed afour-year, $240m extensionlast September with $231m in total guarantees. Jones waited too long with receiver CeeDee Lamb, who signed a four-year, $136m extension last August with $100m guaranteed.Between the four-year, $160m contract with $95m guaranteed that Prescott signed in 2021 and his new deal, the market for quarterbacks exploded. Russell Wilson, Kyler Murray, Deshaun Watson, Joe Burrow, Justin Herbert, and Trevor Lawrence all agreed got deals with total guarantees of at least $120m.The interesting difference in the updated Prescott contract was the length of the deal. While most of those quarterback agreements were for five years, Prescott’s was once again for four years, and that was entirely intentional.In a recent appearance onthe Athletes First Podcast, Prescott’s agent Todd France detailed why he wanted the four-year deal for his client, and why the Cowboys were stuck for a long time on a five-year term. Prescott had already played on the franchise tag in 2020, so waiting it out for what his side wanted was not a new idea.“We get to the deadline where we have to either do a long-term contract, or play on the franchise tag, so another year of uncertainty on a one-year deal,” France said. “And the same aspect of the negotiation is the holdup.“The Cowboys still want a five-year contract. We still want a four-year contract. And the four-year term is of the utmost importance to us [with] quarterbacks because of the way that the market grows and the salary cap grows and the desire to get back to the market for these guys and maximize their career earnings.”In the end, after a lot of bluster and wasted time, the Cowboys capitulated. With Parsons, the capitulation may be more severe.“I don’t view it as urgent at all,” Jones said on 1 April of coming to an agreement with Parsons. “Some say using the basis that the earlier you get something done the cheaper … well, the earlier you get something done, a lot of times, the more mistakes you make. You might want to see a few more cards play, not just with that particular negotiation, but with the whole team.“I know I’m kind of being a little defensive here, but the idea that the only success is getting a contract done at an early time is incorrect, I’d rather pay more and get it right than if I had to pay less and screw it up.”Yes, but in this case, the Cowboys could have saved a ton of money by signing Parsons before the market at Parsons’ position exploded. The Cleveland Browns re-signed Myles Garrett, their own edge superstar, to a massive four-year, $160m extension in March with $124m guaranteed. The Browns had to pay the 30-year-old Garrett at the top of the market for his position becauseGarrett was making all kinds of noisesabout not even wanting to be a part of the roster any more, given the team’s struggles to be competitive.Parsons, who will turn 26 next month and is just coming into the prime of his career, will no doubt draw more than this when he eventually agrees a new deal, and use the amount of money Garrett got as leverage – he can reasonably argue he should get more than Garrett considering he is four years younger and not even at his peak yet.Jones further antagonized the situation with his comments about David Mulugheta, who represents Parsons and is one of the prominent agents in the industry.“I’m not trying to demean him in any way, but this isn’t about an agent,” Jones said. “The agent doesn’t have one thing to do with what we’re doing when we get on a football field against a team. Micah does, to the degree I’m involved I do. The people that have something to do with what we do going forward relative to our fans and football are me and the player, not the agent.”Parsons’ response on social media put a finer point on things. “Facts!! David is the best and I will not be doing any deal without [Mulugheta] involved! Like anyone with good sense I hired experts for a reason,” Parsons wrote. “There is no one I trust more when it comes to negotiating contracts than David! There will be no backdoors in this contract negotiation.”Alienating your best player’s agent is not a great idea. Alienating him when he also represents plenty of other talented players who you may want to sign one day is even worse.So, that’s wherethatall stands.The tragedy of the negotiating farce here is that the Cowboys are one of the bestNFLteams at acquiring talents in the draft; it’s only when it’s time to negotiate new contracts that Jones steps all over himself. Dallas’ player evaluation arm is led by Will McClay, the team’s vice-president of player personnel. McClay would be the general manager for a lot of NFL teams given the respect he has garnered in the industry, but when your team’s owner wants to be the general manager as well, you have to settle for the title that’s left on the board.McClay became the Cowboys’ senior director of pro/college scouting in 2015 after several years as a scout, scouting coordinator, and director of football research for the team, and with McClay in charge, Dallas have outpaced most other NFL teams in terms of adding talent in the draft. Per a recentPro Football Networkstudy, the Cowboys rank sixth in terms of homegrown talent in the draft – 60.8% of the roster. Conversely, the Cowboys rank 27th in terms of free agency and trades (39.1% of the roster), and that’s where the schism really rears its ugly head.Dallas don’t spend a lot on free agents, and that’s fine in the abstract when you get it right in the draft as often as McClay and his staff do. But tipping things on one side of the scale worked a lot better in the pre-free agency days that started to fade in the early 1990s, when teams could more easily hold on to their homegrown talent for better or worse – better for the teams, and worse for the players who wished to be paid in line with their talents.Dipping a toe in the free-agency waters in the modern day while refusing to pay your top-end talent in ways that will allow them to be retained at ideal market value? That’s a dangerous game with no margin for error, and it’s one of several reasons the Cowboys haven’t comeanywhere near a Super Bowl for 30 years.Jones has been pilloried for his insistence on control of his franchise when others would be far more qualified to take the reins. That has shown itself everywhere from the head coaches hired since Jones and Jimmy Johnson fell out over organizational control and the credit that comes with it in 1994, to overall personnel decisions that have mired the team in mediocrity for no good reason beyond Jones’s hubris and need to be the top dog.But the worst dysfunction may well be Jones’s misunderstanding of how the modern player market works, because over and over, it’s sticking a knife through the heart of one of the NFL’s best evaluation rooms.And based on Jones’s most recent comments regarding Parsons, there’s no reason to believe that it won’t continue for some time.Explore more on these topicsDallas CowboysNFLUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Having seemed to be back to their entertaining best whenemphatically beating Belgiumon home soil on Friday, an injury-hit England side produced a wholly contrasting first‑half display in Leuven and could have no complaints about the scoreline.Belgium 3-2 England: Women’s Nations League group stage – live reactionRead more“It’s April now. I’m not concerned,” Wiegman said. “Although this doesn’t feel good, it’s a huge learning for us. They [Belgium] actually played as we expected. We know it was going to be totally different [to Friday].“There are a lot of different circumstances. Friday was all good and we were 5-0 up. We just stay neutral. There are things in your journey that go well and things that don’t go well. Tonight was a disappointment but there were a lot of learnings.”One thing she will have learnt is that they have a magical talent on their hands. Brought on as a substitute for the final 10 minutes with England trailing 3-1, with her first two touches of senior international football the 19-year-old Agyemang controlled the ball with her thigh and volleyed home an outstanding, instinctive finish that gave the visitors hope of a late comeback, but they were unable to add to that magical moment and were left to rue their poor first-half performance.With this result England drop to second in their Women’s Nations League group with a total of seven points from four games, behind a Spain side who moved top courtesy of their 7-1 victory against Portugal. More pertinently, with just under three months before the start of the European Championship in Switzerland, the first 45 minutes of this game was another reminder that England must improve significantly and become more consistent if they are to retain their title.The first goal, scored inside four minutes, was alarmingly simple from an England point of view. A routine ball over the top of the Chelsea left-back Niamh Charles was latched on to by the fit-again Belgium captain, Tessa Wullaert, and she proved too quick for the England backline, having plenty of time to pick her spot and place the ball low into the far corner past Hannah Hampton. It was the hosts’ first attack and the European champions proved powerless to stop their break upfield.View image in fullscreenMichelle Agyemang resists pressure from Janice Cayman and Feli Delacauw to score England’s second goal.Photograph: Harriet Lander/The FA/Getty ImagesFor England’s coaching staff, the second Belgium goal will also have been worryingly easy, with the tallest player on the pitch heading in from a set piece. The Everton midfielder Justine Vanhaevermaet beat Leah Williamson in the air and looped her header into the corner from the Inter striker Wullaert’s well-placed free-kick delivery.When the third Belgium goal went in before the half hour, England were in truly uncharted territory in the Wiegman era and facing something of a humiliation. This time it was a well‑worked Belgium move that dragged the England back four across to the right and Wullaert beat Millie Bright to meet the low cross played in from the left by Davina Philtjens. The travelling England fans behind that goal could scarcely believe their eyes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On that night they were beaten 3-2 after being unable to contend with the pace of Wullaert on the counterattack. Admittedly, England had been depleted by injuries since the resounding win at Ashton Gate on Friday, with the Arsenal striker Alessia Russo and the Chelsea forward Lauren James – who both looked in excellent form in Bristol – returning to their clubs for treatment, with Chloe Kelly and Lauren Hemp also among the injured forwards.Quick GuideNations League roundupShowScotlandtook a deserved lead into half-time againstGermanyin Wolfsburg – only to concede six goals in 25 minutes. The Scots were much improved in the first period after losing 4-0 against the same opponents at Tannadice on Friday and Caroline Weir capped an impressive showing with the opening goal five minutes before the break. However, Scotland capitulated after the interval as they suffered a 6-1 defeat, Selina Cerci scoring a hat-trick, to remain without a point after four games.Kirsty Hanson and Claire Emslie were among four players drafted in after the defeat in Dundee and both had an impact as Scotland caused problems.Emslie and Lauren Davidson forced saves and Scotland defended well while showing composure and confidence on the ball. They took the lead after winning the ball back just inside the German half – Hanson's shot was spilled and Weir showed skill and composure to finish from close range.Germany made changes and the second half was a different ball game.  The hosts hit the post shortly before Cerci headed the equaliser from a 51st-minute corner. The same player scored from close range five minutes later after a second German header hit the bar.A slick passing move and a clever finish from Giovanna Hoffmann made it 3-1 in the 63rd minute and the forward scored again almost from the restart after she was left unmarked. Laura Freigang made it three goals in four minutes with a  back-heel finish but she was allowed too much space from the Scotland defence.Hanson should have had a penalty but the referee waved play on and Cerci completed her hat-trick with a brilliant strike.Hannah Cain struck in the second half to earnWalesa 1-1 draw in their match againstSwedenin Gothenburg. Only four minutes after coming on as a substitute, Cain collected a 68th-minute pass from Rachel Rowe and rounded goalkeeper Jennifer Falk before finishing via a post.Sweden had taken the lead through Magdalena Eriksson on the hour and while the Group A4 pacesetters dominated the closing stages, they were unable to find a winner.  It is the second time they have drawn 1-1 with Sweden having held the group favourites to the same scoreline in Wrexham in February.

She scored an incredible goal, the composure she has and the calmness. I think we do have to celebrate that a little for her.

If they were difficult decisions I could live with this coincidence … but when its three or four yards [onside].“I wouldn’t say they are the most difficult so why send him to Leeds games. I don’t think he intends it but he needs protection. Promotion to the Premier League is such a big reward, we are playing for so many millions of pounds.”Middlesbrough hope to secure such riches via the playoffs but securing a place seems touch and go for a side that slipped to sixth after Leeds swiftly undid Michael Carrick’s high defensive line.If Junior Firpo’s initial through pass was good, Manor Solomon’s expert dodging of Anfernee Dijksteel bewildered the rest of Boro’s backline. The resultant confusion left a stretching James to evade his supposed marker, Samuel Iling-Junior and flick the resultant low, hard, cross beyond Mark Travers.View image in fullscreenDan James (centre right) shows his delight after scoring Leeds’ winner.Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PAThe Tees glistened in glorious April sunshine when Leeds arrived at the Riverside and the travelling fans waiting to greet them muttered nervously about a demoralising run of one win in the previous six games.By now though darkness had descended and, menacing almost every time he touched the ball, visiting nerves were soothed as James sensed real opportunity. With the Wales winger repeatedly unwinding his sprinter’s legs Travers did well to prevent him scoring a second.Boro had registered five wins in their previous seven games but, despite enjoying plenty of possession Leeds allowed them to have the ball in areas where, initially at least, they could do minimal damage.Admittedly Tommy Conway did turn the ball beyond Karl Darlow, once again preferred to Illan Meslier in goal, from close range after meeting the fall out from a miscued corner but that effort was correctly disallowed for offside.In marked contrast, Tanaka had cause to feel wronged after directing Solomon cross’s past Travers only to see his celebrations ended abruptly by a faulty offside call.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Hackney’s ability to pass quickly with pace and urgency began threatening the Leeds defence as he brought the best out in Delano Burgzorg and Finn Azaz, creating chances for both forwards.Farke responded by turning to his bench and, with his first touch, Bamford slide the ball into the back of the net at the end of a fine counter-attack involving fellow substitutes Isaac Schmidt and Wilfried Gnonto.If Bamford thought that scoring against a former clubs would mark the end of almost 12 injury blighted months he was wrong as that assured finish was ruled out for offside. Once again replays showed it was the wrong decision.The good news is that he appeared fit and sharp. Farke believes that the loss of his No 9 to a knee injury at the Riverside almost exactly a year ago cost his team promotion. Maybe, just maybe, Bamford has returned at the right moment to help Leeds over the line this time.Explore more on these topicsChampionshipMiddlesbroughLeeds Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

In stepped Ruud van Nistelrooy, a club legend with a promising managerial pedigree, to deliver some interim magic. It worked surprisingly well: while Amorim was clearing his desk at Sporting, Van Nistelrooy went unbeaten in four home games across three competitions. In a further twist, Ruud’s reward for bringing a few feelgood vibes to the husk of Old Trafford was a one-way ticket through Carrington’s overcrowded door marked Do One.An important caveat for Ruud’s unbeaten run is that half of the games were against Leicester, who were beaten 5-2 in Milk Cup by United and 3-0 in the Premier League. It contributed to thedeparture of Steve Cooper, who had kept the Foxes above water but turned fans off with his conservative football and whiff of Nottingham Forest. But who to replace him? Perhaps a dashing Dutchman seen wandering towards Manchester airport. If Van Nistelrooy could beatthisLeicester side so comprehensively, not once buttwice, hemustbe good.Leicester’s new manager started off well with four points from two home games, but a trip to Newcastle in mid-Decemberdelivered a 4-0 defeat. That began a run of seven straight league losses, home fans quickly turning on Po’ Ruud as Leicester crashed into the bottom three. The Foxes enjoyed a b@ntorious win at Tottenham but Bilal El Khannous’ winner that day (26 January) was their last Premier League goal. It’s now April, with Leicester since racking up eight scoreless league defeats in a row, conceding 21 goals in the process.Newcastle started the slide towards the trapdoor and may have bolted it shut on Monday,winning 3-0in a contest with all the intensity of a Sunday afternoon post-roast kickabout. Despite earning an early corner, Leicester still managed to go behind after two minutes, before Fabian Schär showed the Baller League a thing or two with a long-range crossbar assist for Jacob Murphy, who benefited as the entire home defence simply stood and watched on.So, while Amorim gets a natty retro hoodie to wear on the touchline (Big Sir Jim knocking 20% off as a goodwill gesture) anda soft-rock inspired terrace chant, all Po’ Ruud has are unwanted records – the longest run of league defeats without scoring since 1977, zero home league goals in five months. After Monday’s mismatch, Van Nistelrooy appeared ready to walk before, likeIvan Juric at Southampton, he is pushed out of the exit door when relegation is confirmed. “The most important thing is the club and these players,” Ruud muttered when asked about his future, before zipping up a holdall and firing up the online check-in app.Whether he is still there or not, Leicester will surely already be down by 3 May when they face Southampton at home – a chance for both sets of owners to stand up and take accountability for dreadful seasons, which Football Daily is confident they’ll take.

But I didn’t. There I was, appearing as a guest at the Brighton branch of Sporting Memories, a UK charity which encourages older people to meet and reminisce through talking about sport, and I’d seemingly been exposed as a total fraud.A few educated guesses had been made initially by the 20 or so members who’d gathered to hear me talk about my latest book before getting down to the far more serious business of their weekly Monday morning quiz.Thierry Henry? Cristiano Ronaldo? What about Dennis Bergkamp? Or Luis Suárez?One by one our quizmaster, the former England rugby union international, cricketer and BBC broadcaster Alastair Hignell, batted away each incorrect answer including my own shot at restoring some professional pride (Mohamed Salah, just in case you were wondering).Gradually, the suggestions became little more than shots in the dark. Robin van Persie? Gianfranco Zola? Not Ricky Villa, surely? Robert Pires? Until, in David Ginola’s wake, the well of potential candidates ran dry and an air of befuddlement fell across the group.View image in fullscreenRobledo during his time with Barnsley.Photograph: PA Images/AlamyMaybe it was the presence of the former Wales andNewcastle Unitedgoalkeeper Dave Hollins in the room that did it, but out of the blue someone came up with a name, the correct name at that – George Robledo.George Robledo! Yes, YES! … and it all came flooding back.Some 20 or so years previously, I’d covered a Newcastle United game at St James’ Park during the managerial reign of Bobby Robson, often cited as one of the nicest guys to walk the earth, let alone work in football. The post-match press conference had ended but Robson continued talking to some of us hacks who weren’t on a deadline about his heroes, the ones he’d watched playing for Newcastle while growing up in north-east England in the years immediately after the second world war. He mentioned Jackie Milburn – I knew about him. He mentioned Joe Harvey – I knew about him, too. But then Robson said another name which meant absolutely nothing to me. That name was George Robledo.Clocking a couple of blank expressions in our midst, Robson gave us George Robledo in a nutshell. I wasn’t taking notes, just listening intently, but this much I do recall – he’d come as a boy from Chile to Yorkshire, worked as a miner before becoming a professional footballer, and scored lots of goals for several clubs (including Newcastle’s winner against Arsenal in the 1952 FA Cup final, a picture of which painted by the 11-year-old John Lennon would later appear on the cover of the former Beatle’s 1974 solo album,Walls and Bridges). I also recollect Robson saying he saw plenty of George Robledo in Alan Shearer. Praise indeed, as anyone who remembers Shearer in his pomp would acknowledge.On the long drive back to my home in Cardiff, I thought a lot about George. Here was someone who scored 33 league goals for Newcastle in the First Division (or the Premier League in today’s money) during the 1951-52 season. No overseas-registered, foreign-born player had reached that number before, and no overseas-registered, foreign-born player has reached that number since (although Mohamed Salah isdoing his level best to change this). At the time of my visit to Brighton (January 2023) Manchester City’s Norway international Erling Haaland was on course to break George’s record, a feat Planet Football has since decreed he achieved. But then, as one extremely clued-up member of that Sporting Memories group had pointed out, Haaland was born in Leeds. As in Leeds, England, where his father once played football. Going by the rules of geography George is, as I write, still the record holder. Splitting hairs? Maybe, maybe not. It all depends how accurate, or perhaps pedantic, you want to be.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

One, he had clearly been a phenomenal football player. And two, his remarkable achievements seemed to have been almost completely forgotten in his adopted country. On reaching Cardiff, I fired up my laptop to see whether a book had been written about George, partly because I wanted to read one, and partly (the greater part, admittedly) because I felt a sudden calling and fancied having a go myself.No such book existed. So I went for it, blind at that stage to what exactly I was taking on but determined to unearth the treasure that was, and remains, George Robledo. The catch about unearthing something long hidden is that besides all the “wonderful things”, as Howard Carter described the contents of Tutankhamun’s tomb on first sight, you can also chance upon plenty of heartache. And so it would prove with George. Aged six, he and his two younger brothers had been abandoned by their father on the very day the Robledo family was due to set sail from Chile to start a new life in England. One of those brothers, Ted, who would also become a professional footballer and sign for Newcastle, was later murdered in mysterious circumstances in the Middle East, his body supposedly thrown into the Gulf from an oil tanker. There was also the brother George never knew, the result of a clandestine meeting in Hull between his mother and the father who, years before, had walked out of his life at the drop of a hat in Chile. The baby was given up by his mother and raised in a children’s home.View image in fullscreenAnd yet, as befits someone who grew up surrounded by poverty and worked in a Yorkshire mine asa Bevin Boyduring the second world war, George never regarded himself as a victim. As a young man his creative feats at inside forward for Barnsley turned him into a local hero and secured a transfer to Newcastle in 1949. The following year he became the first Football League player from outside the British Isles to face England in an official international, acting as Chile’s talisman when the nations met at the 1950 World Cup in Brazil. In 1951 George was the first South American to play in an FA Cup final as Newcastle defeated Blackpool 2-0 at Wembley. Twelve months later he scored the only goal as the Magpies saw off Arsenal to retain the trophy. In 1953, driven by a desire to travel and with the maximum wage still in force in English football, George returned to Chile to sign for Colo-Colo, the country’s most successful club, more than doubling his weekly income.To quote George’s only child, Elizabeth Robledo: “That’s pretty good going for someone born in the Atacama desert, probably the driest, most inhospitable place on Earth, and I don’t think my dad ever lost sight of that.”Postcards From Santiago – The George Robledo Story by Spencer Vignes is published by Biteback(£20).

Less than three months after replacing Kvara Kvaratskhelia at Parc des Princes in a Ligue 1 draw against Reims, Asensio faces the unusual but not unprecedented challenge of trying to knock his parent club out of the Champions League, the competition PSG crave so badly.Villa were on the other end of this peculiarity in October, though the stakes were nowhere near as high. When Bologna came to Birmingham, they arrived with a Villa player in their ranks. With Villa leading 2-0, coasting towards a victory that maintained their 100% start to the league phase, Samuel Iling-Junior entered late on to gentle applause from all sides. It was the 21-year-old’s first appearance at Villa Park – albeit for the visitors – and it could prove his last given Iling-Junior, who signed from Juventus last summer as part of the package that saw Douglas Luiz depart, joined Middlesbrough on loan in February.Emery insists Martínez will cope with hostility for Aston Villa against PSGRead more“It is probably a strange one because you can never predict that you’re going to face your own team,” says the Villa midfielder Youri Tielemans. “He has been brilliant since he came in, he is working hard on the pitch, making efforts for the team defensively, and offensively you can see his class when he touches the ball. I remember his first cameo at Villa Park [against Tottenham in the FA Cup] and it was just brilliant, he just glided [past] some of the midfielders.”There is the sense Asensio is just getting started. Villa have been building his fitness, resisting the temptation to showcase their shiny new toy at every opportunity. It has been a similar story with Marcus Rashford, whojoined on loan from Manchester United.Here is an appetite to construct the perfect narrative arc around Rashford but Asensio has made a bigger splash. The 29-year-old has scored eight goals in 11 matches, eclipsing his tally of seven for PSG in double-quick time. Asensio has started five games for Villa, three in the Premier League, two in the FA Cup, in which Villa face Crystal Palace in the semi-finals towards the end of a busy month. To tee up this quarter-final, he scoredthree goals across two legsagainst Club Brugge.Villa won the European Cup in 1982 but this represents new territory for the club in the modern era. Asensio, meanwhile, is au fait with these kinds of matches and the grandest of stages: he is a three-timeChampions Leaguewinner with Real Madrid. Villa have been impressed with his humility and character off the pitch. On it Asensio has shown a willingness to get his hands dirty, typified by his sliding challenge to deny Elliot Anderson a clean shot as Nottingham Forest pushed for an equaliser at the weekend when Villa were on the ropes. “No big egos,” Villa’s captain, John McGinn, said.“When you look at him you don’t think he’s a hard worker,” Tielemans says, “because he’s more of a ball player, but off the ball he does his job really well … I think the system suits him to play as a No 10 off the striker and for him to be ‘free’ off the striker.”View image in fullscreenLuis Enrique questioned Marco Asensio’s attitude in training and commitment to trigger PSG’s press before loaning the forward to Aston Villa.Photograph: Abdullah Firas/ABACA/ShutterstockHow did Asensio get here? Emery tried to bring in Asensio in previous windows but it was always a complex – and expensive – deal. Villa’s manager drove his signing, aware his PSG counterpart, Luis Enrique, was not quite so enamoured. Enrique questioned Asensio’s attitude in training and commitment to trigger his team’s press in victory against Toulouse in November. Until then, he had played three of PSG’s four Champions League matches and 10 of their 12 league matches.Then Asensio voiced his surprise at the criticism given PSG had won comfortably and was benched a few days later against Bayern Munich. He totalled another 25 minutes before being allowed to depart. “When he has the ball, [he] is a top player,” Luis Enrique said ominously before that episode played out publicly. Villa do not have an option to sign the Spaniard and nor does he have a release clause in his PSG contract, which runs until 2026.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionRecently McGinn poked fun at an old social media post in which he declared his love for Asensio. On the night Asensio zipped a left-foot peach into the top corner to help Madrid past Barcelona to win the Supercopa de España, McGinn, then of Hibernian, posted on Twitter: “Asensio” and an emoji with a smiling face and heart-eyes. Asensio replied last week, posting a photo of the pair celebrating and the word: “Captain.”Asensio is symbolic of Villa’s rise under Emery. A player who appeared a fantasy target to those behind the scenes the summer after Emery averted the threat of relegation in 2022-23 evolved into a distinct possibility. Monchi, Villa’s sporting director, has been tasked with exploring a permanent deal. “He came to the [2022] World Cup with me and was very important, and he was important for us last season and at the start of this season,” Luis Enrique said on Tuesday.Could Asensio emulate those who have scored against their parent clubs in this competition? Patrick Roberts earned Celtic a point at the Etihad Stadium while a Manchester City player in 2016, though the game was a dead rubber. Fernando Morientes scored for Monaco to knock out Madrid in 2004 and Philippe Coutinho scored twice for Bayern in their 8-2 rout of Barcelona in 2020. James Rodríguez and Kingsley Coman scored against Real and Juventus respectively.If Asensio is burning with a point to prove, then so is Emery, who spent two years at PSG. His brief was to win the Champions League. He won Ligue 1 and two Coupes de France but in Paris they rememberLa Remontada, Barcelona’s 6-1 second-leg comeback which sent PSG packing from the last 16 of this competition in 2017, when McGinn was drooling over Asensio. Now, Emery has the player he has always pined for and Villa are in a place they could only dream of when he walked through the door.Explore more on these topicsAston VillaParis Saint-GermainChampions LeagueEuropean club footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was marginal gains for Arsenal at the weekend as they closed the gap to Liverpool at the top of the Premier League table by a point, but their only realistic chance of silverware this season is in theChampions League, where they turn their attention to a quarter-final against Real Madrid. Arsenal’s form has been mixed of late – they have only won three of their last eight games after their 1-1 draw at Everton on Saturday – but Real Madrid are coming off a 2-1 defeat to Valencia at the weekend.Mikel Arteta has a major injury concern at the heart of the defence, withGabriel Magalhães ruled out for the rest of the season with a hamstring injury. The Brazilian is not the only defensive absentee; Riccardo Calafiori and Takehiro Tomiyasu are both missing, meaning Jakub Kiwior may start alongside William Saliba at the back. Forwards Gabriel Jesus and Kai Havertz are also ruled out but Bukayo Saka made a scoring return against Fulham last week and should make his first start since December on Tuesday night.Thibaut Courtois is also likely to return to actionafter he missed the defeat to Valencia. Carlo Ancelotti is without a couple of key players, with Éder Militão and Dani Carvajal both long-term absentees, and Aurélien Tchouaméni suspended. These teams have only met in one previous European tie – when Arsenal beat Real 1-0 at the last-16 stage on their way to the final in the 2005-06 season. They would take a repeat this year, but Real Madrid have too many great players and too much history in this competition.Prediction: Real Madrid to progressBayern Munich v InterHarry Kane edged closer to his first major trophy on Friday asBayern Munichearned a 3-1 win over Bavarian rivals Augsburg. With six rounds of games to play in the Bundesliga, they have a six-point lead. Their attention now turns to hosting Inter in the Champions League. Vincent Kompany’s side have been nigh-on imperious at the Allianz Arena this season, failing to win only four of their 21 home matches in all competitions.Injuries pile up at Bayern Munich to threaten Thomas Müller’s perfect endingRead moreInter,who beat Bayern 2-0 in the final in 2010, will put this record to the test, particularly asBayern are missing a number of key players. Indeed, Friday’s win at Augsburg came at a cost as Jamal Musiala suffered a hamstring tear to join defenders Dayot Upamecano and Alphonso Davies on the sidelines. Aleksandar Pavlovic is also out, but Manuel Neuer may return to the starting XI. Thomas Müller, who will be leaving Bayern at the end of the season, might start behind Kane in Musiala’s absence.Inter extended their unbeaten run to 10 games at the weekend but they threw away a two-goal lead to draw 2-2 with relegation-threatened Parma, losing momentum in the title race. Their Champions League form, however, has been outstanding. They have won all but two of their 10 games in the competition this season, conceding just two goals in the process.Simone Inzaghi is unable to call upon the suspended Kristjan Asllani, but Nicolo Barella, Hakan Calhanoglu and Henrikh Mkhitaryan are available for selection. Beyond those three, midfield options are thin on the ground. Piotr Zielinski remains in Milan alongside Asllani, while Mehdi Taremi and, crucially, Denzel Dumfries miss out. Matteo Darmian is expected to start and Inzaghi is hoping Alessandro Bastoni can overcome a knee issue to feature.Prediction: Inter to progressView image in fullscreenInter players Francesco Toldo and Javier Zanetti celebrate after beating Bayern Munich in the Champions League final in 2010.Photograph: Christophe Simon/AFP/Getty ImagesPSG v Aston VillaFresh from winning the title on Saturday, PSG will be keen to build upon another domestic trophy and, at long last, go all the way in the Champions League. The French champions are on a six-game winning streak and a run of 25 victories from their last 27. That said, they have lost more European games (four) than any of the eight remaining teams in the competition, while four of their last five home losses have come in the Champions League.Luis Enrique also has a major selection concern at the back as captain Marquinhos is suspended for the first leg againstAston Villaat the Parc des Princes. Lucas Beraldo is likely to get the nod ahead of Lucas Hernández at the heart of the defence to partner Willian Pacho. PSG are on course for a treble – they play Reims in the Coupe de France final in May – but they would be foolish to underestimate Villa.Luis Enrique said PSG would improve without Kylian Mbappé. He was rightRead moreUnai Emery returns to Paris with his side on a seven-game winning run following Saturday’s 2-1 home triumph over Champions League-chasing Nottingham Forest. Villa have won their last four away matches, but they did lose when last away to Ligue 1 opposition,1-0 to Monaco in December.Emery isn’t the only member of the Villa camp returning to Paris this week. Marco Asensio will be facing his parent side if he is picked to support Ollie Watkins in attack. Donyell Malen and Andrés García, who are both ineligible, are Villa’s only confirmed absentees, with Leon Bailey and Ross Barkley both to be assessed this week. This will be the first match between PSG and Aston Villa – and the French champions have to be favourites.Prediction: PSG to progressBarcelona v Borussia DortmundBarcelona maintained their unbeaten start to 2025 at the weekend, though Real Betis held them to a 1-1 draw as they failed to fully capitalise on Real Madrid’s surprise defeat to Valencia. Their focus turns back to the Champions League on Wednesday, when they will looking to extend their unbeaten run in the competition to 10 games. One of those games was a 3-2 win againstBorussia Dortmundin Germany earlier this season in the group stage.Hansi Flick welcomes teenager Pau Cubarsi back after he was banned for the second leg of Barcelona’s last-16 tie against Benfica. The 18-year-old is likely to partner the experienced Iñigo Martínez at the heart of the defence. In attack, expect Robert Lewandowski to lead the line, with support coming from Gavi, Lamine Yamal and Raphinha, the competition’s top scorer with 11 goals.Borussia Dortmund made it three wins from their last four at Freiburg at the weekend, but they are without key central midfielders Pascal Gross and Marcel Sabitzer due to suspension and injury, respectively. Niklas Süle, Ramy Bensebaini and, crucially, Nico Schlotterbeck are injured, meaning changes to the core of Niko Kovac’s side are required.Carney Chukwuemka may step into midfield alongside Felix Nmecha, with Waldemar Anton partnering Emre Can at the back should Kovac revert to a 4-2-3-1 setup, having used a three-man backline in the aforementioned win over Freiburg. Youngster Daniel Svensson is in line to start at left-back, though another option is for Julian Ryerson to swap flanks and Yan Couto to feature at right-back. Given their injuries and patchy form – Dortmund are eighth in the Bundesliga – the German side are up against it.Prediction: Barcelona to progressThis is an article byWhoScoredThis article was amended on 8 April 2025. Inter have won all but two of their 10 Champions League games this season, not all 10 as an earlier version said due to an editing error.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueWhoScored?Aston VillaParis Saint-GermainArsenalReal MadridBayern MunichInternazionalefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Last year’s eventwas also plagued by anxieties about sewage in the river, and, after Cambridge had won, the Oxford team revealed thatsome of their numberhad been ill in the lead-up.Other river-based sporting events have also been affected; in May a Thames swimming race which has been held for more than120 years was cancelledover sickness fears.Oxford confirm illnesses before Boat Race but stop short of blaming pollutionRead moreSir Steve Redgrave, the Olympic gold medallist, said rowers needed to be protected from polluted water. “It’s a real worry that in 2025, unsafe water quality in the Thames is still a concern. Rowers, river users, and the public deserve better.”The testing, carried out every weekday between 10 March and 7 April at the beginning, middle and end of the race route between Putney and Mortlake, revealed that 29.5% of samples exceeded safe limits for entering the water,and were almost three times the threshold for bathing waters rated “poor”.It was also a particularly dry spell of weather. Raw sewage discharges from storm overflows are only supposed to take place during exceptional weather, like extreme rainfall or intense storms. Spills of raw sewage during dry weather could be illegal.The route does not have bathing water status but campaigners for River Action, who carried out the testing, used the threshold as a benchmark to indicate the threat to public health.River Action said the monitor on a sewage outflow at Kew – upstream of the race’s finishing post – went offline in January, and remained out of operation during the entire testing window.As well as raw sewage,Thames Watertreatment plants discharge treated sewage into the river on a daily basis.River Action believes the pollution from sewage treatment plants – which have no legal limits imposed on them for E coli – are a major but overlooked factor in the unsafe water quality.Erica Popplewell, River Action’s head of communities, said the victorious Boat Race crew should think twice about throwing their cox in the water after the race, as is the custom.She said systematic reform of the water industry and its regulators was needed.“The public demands Thames Water and regulators act now to improve sewage treatment infrastructure,” she said.“Thames Water has profited from pollution for years whilst the government has failed to enforce the law. It’s time to refinance the company without burdening bill payers and end pollution-for-profit.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

I think in a few years’ time it’ll hit me that what I’ve done tonight is really special.”Rice warned, though, that Arsenal cannot take anything for granted in the second leg against the 15‑time winners. “The manager just said with the individual quality they have it is scary and special things happen at the Bernabéu. We are not going there to defend, we are going to attack and we want to be in the semis.”Arsenal lost against Barcelona in the 2006 final after defeating Real in the last 16 on the only previous occasion they have faced them. Arteta, who revealed he had consulted Pep Guardiola about how to get the better of Real after they knocked out Manchester City earlier in the competition, was adamant that they are only halfway towards reaching the last four for the third time in their history and he paid tribute to Rice for making it a night to remember for the club’s supporters as he scored Arsenal’s first goal from a direct free‑kick since Martin Odegaard against Burnley in September 2021.“It’s been a long time so to score two goals in 12 minutes of that magnitude from a player who has never scored a free‑kick before in his career – what are the odds?

Saints are the only English team still involved in theChampions Cupthis season but Dowson believes Premiership teams are being handicapped by their own domestic calendar.Northampton werecrowned Premiership championslast season and also made the Champions Cup semi-finals, but Dowson believes it will require a “monumental effort” for any Premiership club to challenge successfully on two fronts given the current structure and salary cap restrictions.The Breakdown | Premiership clubs’ European debacle illustrates growing French and Irish strengthRead more“At the moment it’s dysfunctional, it doesn’t work,” said Dowson, whose team are struggling to make this season’s domestic playoffs despite possessing a number of first-choice England international players. “The more you develop players the less you see of them. There is a worry about that.“It’s no surprise that we’ve played our best with everyone available. When you get all your best players on the pitch you’re going to put some good stuff together. The problem we’re in is that Steve Borthwick wants the best players playing for him, I want our best players playing for us and Mark Mapletoft [head coach of England Under-20s] wants the best players for him.”A deliberate effort has been made this season to reduce the number ofPremiershipgames played during international windows but Dowson believes further tweaks are still required, particularly for the sake of clubs who supply lots of international squad members. “We talk about a deconflicted schedule [but] if they’re playing every game England players would have missed four games out of an 18-match league. That’s 20 points where they’re not available,” he said.“If the Premiership Rugby Cup is your development tournament you [also] can’t lose your U20s during that period. The players are getting pulled in different directions, there’s too much rugby and not enough players. There’s a fixture element to it and a financial element.“I’ve spoken to Michael Cheika about how he’s coped with it [at Leicester] and I’d love to talk to Mark McCall [at Saracens], too. At some points they had eight or nine players going to England. It is difficult. They had a big squad which they could back-fill when they were successful on both fronts.”Squad management is further complicated by the 30-game maximum limit introduced for player welfare reasons. Northampton’s Tommy Freeman has already played 23 games this season, however, and is almost certain to exceed the limit if he is selected for the British & Irish Lions tour to Australia. “If that’s what the research says about game limits then that’s what we should do,” said Dowson. “But it shouldn’t always fall on the club to carry the can for that.“If you say to Tommy ‘You can’t go on a Lions tour because we’ve got to a quarter-final or a semi-final’ he’s going to say: ‘This is mental.’ But it can’t always be us picking it up. We’ve got to make sure the risk, the burden, is carried by everybody.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

McIlroy’s latest bid to complete a career grand slam of majors here begins on Thursday.McIlroy needs no reminding that almost 11 years have passed since he won the last of his four major titles and on Tuesday he revealed an attitude switch he decided upon at the end of 2019. Since then, he has posted 11 top-10 finishes in majors.Robert MacIntyre: ‘Imagine taking a Green Jacket back to Glencruitten … ’Read more“It’s a self-preservation mechanism,” he said of his previous approach when he was unwilling to be psychologically damaged. “You’re trying to not put 100% of yourself out there because of that.“It happens in all walks of life. At a certain point, someone doesn’t want to fall in love because they don’t want to get their heart broken. Instinctually, as human beings, we hold back sometimes because of the fear of getting hurt, whether that’s a conscious decision or subconscious decision and I was doing that on the course a little bit for a few years.“Once you go through that, once you go through those heartbreaks or disappointments, you get to a place where you remember how it feels and you wake up the next day and you’re like: ‘Yeah, life goes on, it’s not as bad as I thought it was going to be.’“In the last few years I’ve had chances to win some of the biggest tournaments and it hasn’t quite happened. But life moves on. You dust yourself off and you go again. That’s why I’ve become a little more comfortable in laying everything out there and being somewhat vulnerable at times.”View image in fullscreenRory McIlroy comes into the Masters with two victories on the PGA Tour this season.Photograph: Mike Segar/ReutersMany regard this as McIlroy’s finest Masters opportunity. He arrived in Georgiahaving won twiceon the PGA Tour this year. Unsurprisingly, the 35-year-old shrugged off that external expectation. “It’s just narratives, it’s noise,” he said. “It’s just [about] trying to block out that noise as much as possible. I need to treat this tournament like all the other tournaments I play throughout the year.Quick GuideSelected Thursday tee timesShow8.24am EST/1.24pm BST:Danny Willett, Nicolas Echavarria, Davis Thompson9.47am/2.24pm:Collin Morikawa, Joaquin Niemann, Min Woo Lee9.58am/2.58pm:Phil Mickelson, Jason Day, Keegan Bradley10.15am/3.13pm: Scottie Scheffler, Justin Thomas, Josele Ballester10.26am/3.26pm:Jordan Spieth, Tom Kim, Tyrrell Hatton12noon/5pm:Max Homa, Justin Rose, JJ Spaun1.01pm/6.01pm:Adam Scott, Xander Schauffele, Viktor Hovland1.12pm/6.12pm:Rory McIlroy, Ludvig Aberg, Akshay Bhatia1.23pm/6.23pm:Hideki Matsuyama, Bryson DeChambeau, Shane Lowry1.34pm/6.34pm:Jon Rahm, Wyndham Clark, Tommy FleetwoodWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“Look, I understand the narrative and the noise, and there’s a lot of anticipation and build up coming into this tournament each and every year, but I just have to keep my head down and focus on my job.”McIlroy recounted an endearing tale in relation to his four-year-old daughter, Poppy, who was in attendanceas the Players Championship was claimedat Sawgrass last month. “It was the first time she sort of realised what I did, which was really cool and also a little scary at the same time,” he said.“The next day she went into school and there were a couple of kids that had said some stuff to her. She came home to me and said: ‘Daddy, are you famous?’ I said: ‘It depends who you talk to.’”Augusta has delivered some lusty blows to McIlroy –most notably in 2011– but he retains huge affection for the venue. “I’ve always loved this course. People ask me, if you could only play one course for the rest of your life, what would it be? Walking around this place every day would be pretty cool.“There’s the history, those spring evenings where I would sit down with my dad and watch this tournament. All that comes back to me, as well. Remembering why I fell in love with the game. It’s just a beautiful place. I don’t think there’s a more beautiful course on earth. It’s like you’re playing golf in the prettiest park in the world.”Explore more on these topicsRory McIlroyThe MastersUS sportsGolfPGA TourEuropean TournewsShareReuse this content"

The crowd inside a hangar-like 70,000-seat football stadium, just 198 miles down the road from the University of Houston campus, was a deafening sea of scarlet red.Houston rue ‘incomprehensible’ collapse to hand Florida NCAA titleRead moreAnd yet Florida found a way. In one of the most dramatic NCAA men’s championship games in recent memory, the Gators and Walter Clayton Jr overcame Houston’s suffocating defense to pull off an astonishing 65–63 victory on Monday night – a national title game thriller not put to bed until Florida’s own defense sealed it at the buzzer.Clayton finished with 11 points, all in the second half, but what he’ll be remembered for most was the final moment: sprinting at Houston’s Emanuel Sharp, who was trying to spot up for a potential game-winning three. Clayton’s closeout forced Sharp to stop mid-motion, and in that moment of hesitation, Sharp dropped the ball. He couldn’t pick it up again without traveling. It bounced away while the clock ticked to zero and the Gators stormed the court in celebration.YOUR NATIONAL CHAMPIONS: THE FLORIDA GATORS 🏆🐊#MarchMadness@GatorsMBKpic.twitter.com/XatLv5x2hm— NCAA March Madness (@MarchMadnessMBB)April 8, 2025“Our motto is, we all can go,” said Clayton, whose 713 points this year broke the program’s single-season record. “We’ve got a team full of guys that can go. It ain’t just about me. My team held me down until I was able to put the ball in the basket. Shout out to them boys.”Florida (36–4) claimed their third NCAA men’s basketball title and first since 2007, completing a postseason run fueled by resilience, timely shot-making and relentless defense. The Gators trailed for 38 minutes and 43 seconds overall and hadn’t led since 8–6 until the final minute, when Alijah Martin calmly hit two free throws with 46.5 seconds remaining to give them a 64–63 lead. Then came a series of plays that flipped the script on college basketball’s stingiest defense, the best in the countryby anymetric.Houston (35–5), seeking their first championship in the program’s 80-year history, were undone by Florida’s defense down the stretch. After Martin’s free throws, the Gators lured Sharp into a triple-team in the corner. Will Richard knocked the ball off Sharp’s leg and out of bounds. Florida added one more point at the line, then set up for one final stop. They’d get it.“We did what we did all year,” Florida coach Todd Golden said. “We stayed the course. We have the best backcourt in America. I think we have the best frontcourt in America. And like we’ve done all year, we made plays when we needed them the most. We guarded our butts off down the stretch. [We] made every 50-50 winning play.”View image in fullscreenFlorida guard Walter Clayton Jr and center Micah Handlogten embrace after the final buzzer.Photograph: Brynn Anderson/APThe first half wasn’t pretty. In fact, it was downright brutal for stretches. Nothing came easy – not for either side – with each team missing their first seven three-point attempts. Clayton, Florida’s electric combo guard, was held scoreless after back-to-back 30-point outbursts against Texas Tech in the Elite Eight and Auburn on Saturday night, harassed by a rotating crew of Cougar defenders and denied any space. The Gators coughed up nine turnovers (to Houston’s two), their frontcourt got pushed around and their offense sputtered for long stretches. And somehow, they trailed by just three at the intermission.Houston then opened the second half with an 11–2 run, pushing the lead to 42–30 with just under 16 minutes left. At that point, Houston’s win probabilitysoared past 90%. Florida looked rattled. The building – filled with red – spiked to ear-splitting volumes as the Cougars landed one body blow after another.But the Gators punched back. Clayton finally got going with a pair of three-point plays that helped Florida claw within striking distance. He hit his only three-pointer with 6:42 left, part of a second-half surge that included seven assists and multiple feeds to Thomas Haugh and Alex Condon for easy baskets. By then Houston’s offense was in a tailspin and the Gators were gaining confidence.Condon and Haugh combined for 18 points and 13 rebounds. Martin chipped in nine and made all four of his free throws. Florida’s depth and composure made the difference.View image in fullscreenHouston guard Milos Uzan reacts after Monday’s loss to Florida in the national championship game.Photograph: Brynn Anderson/APThe Cougars were led by LJ Cryer’s game-high 19 points and Sharp’s nine off the bench, but they missed their last four field goals and were held scoreless over the final 1:29. Jamal Shead’s pull-up jumper clanged off the front rim with 16 seconds to go andSharp’s botched final looksealed their fate. After committing four turnovers in the first 36:35, they gave it away five times in the final 3:24 including each of their final four possessions.Instead of becoming the oldest head coach to win a national title at 69, the Cougars’ Kelvin Sampson watched Golden – just 39 – become the youngest since North Carolina State’s Jim Valvano, whose own shock victorycame at Houston’s expensein 1983.Florida become the 10th different school with at least three national titles, joining UCLA (11), Kentucky (eight), North Carolina (six), Connecticut (six), Duke (five), Indiana (five), Kansas (four), Louisville and Villanova (three apiece).For the Gators, it capped a wild ride: a second-round win over two-time defending champions UConn, a tough Elite Eight win over Texas Tech and an overtime classic in the Final Four against Southeastern Conference rivals Auburn. Each time, the Gators made it through. Same for Monday’s finale – a heart-stopper that featured 12 ties, staunch defense and three lead changes in the final 90 seconds – they completed one final comeback.And while Richard’s hot start and Martin’s clutch free throws were critical, the game came down to Clayton: the guy who couldn’t buy a bucket early, then made the game’s defining play without one. And a short drive down Interstate 10 from Houston, it was the Gators and not the Cougars who cut down the nets.Explore more on these topicsNCAA Tournament 2025NCAA TournamentCollege basketballCollege sportsUS sportsBasketballShareReuse this content"

They will also require parental permission to turn off a feature that blurs images containing suspected nudity in their direct messages.The changes were announced alongside the extension of Instagram’s teen accounts system toFacebookand Messenger. Teen accounts were introduced last year and placed under-18s by default into a setting that includes giving parents the ability to set daily time limits for using the app, to block teenagers from using Instagram at certain times and to see the accounts with which their child is exchanging messages.Facebook and Messenger teen accounts will be rolled out initially in the US, UK, Australia and Canada. As with the Instagram accounts, users under the age of 16 will need parental permission to change the settings, while 16 and 17-year-olds defaulted into the new features will be able to change them independently.Meta said the Instagram teen accounts were used by 54 million under-18s around the world, with more than 90% of 13- to 15-year-olds keeping on their default restrictions.The NSPCC, a leading child protection charity, said it welcomed extending the measures to Facebook and Messenger, but said Meta had to do more work to prevent harmful material appearing on its platforms.“For these changes to be truly effective, they must be combined with proactive measures so dangerous content doesn’t proliferate on Instagram, Facebook and Messenger in the first place,” said Matthew Sowemimo, the associate head of policy for child safety online at the NSPCC.The announcement was made as the UK implements the Online Safety Act. Since March, every site and app within the scope of thelegislation, which covers more than 100,000 services from Facebook, Google and X to Reddit and OnlyFans, is required to take steps to stop the appearance of illegal content such as child sexual abuse, fraud and terrorism material, or to take it down if it goes online.The act also contains provisions for protecting children from harm and requires tech platforms to shield under-18s from damaging material such as suicide and self-harm-related content. Reports last week that the act could be watered down as part of a UK-US trade deal were met with protests from child safety groups, which said any compromise would be an“appalling sellout”that would be rejected by voters.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Then, led by Hodgetts, the team transformed the cells into cerebral organoids – clusters of neurons that mimic the human brain.During the pandemic, the team met with Lucier over Zoom every fortnight until he died in 2021. As his health declined, he spoke in whispered fragments, often relayed by his assistant, but he remained a guiding force.“We were like art students learning from the professor,” Thompson says. “He had this ability to cut through anything superfluous and get to the core of what he envisioned.”Ben-Ary adds: “But it was very much a collaboration. We came with 25 years experience in the biological arts … For [Lucier], it was very science fiction.”In early conversations, Lucier suggested ideas as fantastical as sending sound waves to the moon. But the musician and the team ultimately homed in on a performance that echoes his lifelong fascination with neural signals, acoustics and space.View image in fullscreenLucier’s organoids at 82 days oldView image in fullscreenLucier’s stem cells, which were used to grow an artificial brain: ‘We’re very interested to know whether the organoid is going to change or learn over time’Both sculptural and sonic, the installation features 20 large parabolic brass plates which curve out from the walls like golden satellite dishes. Hidden behind each plate is a transducer (like a speaker) and a mallet, which respond to neural signals from the mini-brain – filling the space with a kind of breathless, disembodied soundtrack.The Revivification team used custom technology to bring the work to life. Lucier’s organoids were grown on to a fine mesh of 64 electrodes, developed with a German bioengineer, allowing neural signals to be captured from multiple layers – much like a developing brain. Gingold then adapted an open-source platform to interpret this activity and generate sound, turning the artificial brain into a live, responsive performer.Importantly, Lucier’s organoids don’t just produce sound – they also receive it. Microphones in the gallery pick up ambient noise, including human voices and the resonant tones of the plates, and that audio data is converted into electrical signals and fed back into the brain. “We’re very interested to know whether the organoid is going to change or learn over time,” Ben-Ary says.View image in fullscreenThe work features 20 brass plates that produce the sound.Photograph: Rift PhotographyThe project raises timely ethical and philosophical questions about biology, artificial intelligence and authorship. But, according to the team, Revivification is art first and science second.“Where does creativity lie?” Thompson ponders. “As cultural workers, we are really interested in these big questions. But this work is not giving the answers. Instead we want to invite conversations … Can creativity exist outside of the human body? And is it even ethical to do so?”The Big Idea: how do our brains know what’s real?Read moreBut the team is hopeful that the extensive neural data they’ve collected might help future scientific inquiry. “When we work with these big artistic questions, we can push the limits of what’s possible,” Gingold says. “Because science hasn’t answered this. They’re not even at the point of asking the question.”Looking ahead, the team hopes Revivification will live on – literally and creatively. Ben-Ary says it’s his dream for Lucier’s surrogate performer to compose “new memories, new stories” indefinitely. There are also whispers of more extreme futures: adapting the system for remote, inhospitable environments such as Antarctica, or even launching it into orbit.For now, Lucier’s genius lingers in that darkened room in Perth, composing in real time through a brain that lives on without him.“When I told Lucier’s daughter Amanda about the project, she laughed,” Ben-Ary says. “She thought, this is so my dad. Just before he died he arranged for himself to play for ever. He just can’t go. He needs to keep playing.”Revivification isat theArt Gallery of Western Australiauntil 3 AugustExplore more on these topicsArtExperimental musicArtificial intelligence (AI)NeuroscienceAustralian artfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This is the longest we have been apart since we got married. I miss you more and more every day and as the days draw us closer to the arrival of our child, I am haunted by the uncertainty that looms over me – the possibility that you might not be there for this monumental moment. Every kick, every cramp, every small flutter I feel inside me serves as an inescapable reminder of the family we’ve dreamed of building together. Yet, I am left to navigate this profound journey alone, while you endure the cruel and unjust confines of a detention center.‘We will persist’: Mahmoud Khalil’s wife says pro-Palestinian voices won’t be silencedRead moreI could not be more proud of you, Mahmoud. You embody everything I ever hoped for in a partner and the father of my children. What more could I ask for as a role model for our children than a man who, with unwavering conviction, stands up for the liberation of his people, fully cognizant of the consequences of speaking truth to power? Your courage is boundless, and now more than ever, I am in awe of your strength and determination. Your voice, your belief in justice, and your refusal to be silenced are the very qualities that make you the man I love and admire.We will not forget those who have orchestrated this injustice, the government officials and university administrators who have targeted you without cause, without any shred of evidence to justify their actions. They sit in their ivory towers, scrambling to fabricate lies and distort the truth, throwing accusations like stones in the hope that something will stick. What they fail to realize is that their efforts are futile. Their wrongful detention of you is a testament to the fact that you have struck a nerve. You’ve disrupted the false narratives they’ve worked so hard to maintain, and spoken a truth that they are too terrified to acknowledge. What more do we have than our fundamental right to free speech, when they constantly attempt to strip us of our dignity, telling us we are unworthy of life, of respect, of voice? Now, they seek to punish that very speech, to silence the words that challenge their corrupt and oppressive systems.We will persist, with even greater resolve, and we will pass that strength on to our children and our children’s children – until Palestine is freeThey are trying to silence you. They are trying to silence anyone who dares to speak out against the atrocities happening in Palestine. But they will fail. We will not be silenced. We will persist, with even greater resolve, and we will pass that strength on to our children and our children’s children – until Palestine is free. I eagerly await the day when I can tell our son the stories of his father’s bravery, of the courage that courses through his veins, and of the pride he should feel to carry Palestinian blood … your blood. And, more than anything, I pray that he will not have to grow up fighting the same fight for our basic freedoms.We will be reunited soon. Until then, I will continue to fight for you, for us and for our family. Your resilience and your courage will guide us through the storm. You are my best friend, my comrade, the very air that sustains me when it feels as though there is none left. I know your spirit is unwavering, that they cannot break you, and that you will emerge from this stronger than ever. I have no doubt that, when you are finally released, you will raise your hands in the air, chanting: “Free Palestine.”Dr Noor Abdalla is a dentist and a soon-to-be mother.

Now he wants to deliver. Thousands of undocumented migrants have been rounded up by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials since he returned to the White House. On Monday, the US supreme court lifted a judge’s ban on deporting alleged gang members to Venezuelaunder an 18th-century law, though it said deportees had a right to judicial review. Even the Trump-backing podcaster Joe Rogan hasdescribed as “horrific”the removal of an asylum seeker –identifiedas a criminal because he had tattoos – under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act.What’s truly new is that the administration is also targeting those who arrived and remained in the US with official approval, such as the Palestinian activist and studentMahmoud Khalil. Normally, green card holders would be stripped of their status if convicted of a crime; he has not even been accused of one. But Mr Trump had pledged to deport international students who participated in pro-Palestinian protests that his administration has deemed antisemitic, and Mr Khalil was a leading figure in the movement at Columbia University. The president crowed that his arrest last month was “the first of many”. Rümeysa Öztürk, a Turkish student at Tufts, wasdetained by masked agentsin the street, reportedly for an opinion piece she co-wrote with other students. Unrelated to the protests, dozens if not hundreds more students havehad visas revoked, often for minor or non-criminal offences.This crackdown is exploiting legislation in ways that were never intended. The Alien Enemies Act was previously invoked only in wartime – but Mr Trump casts mass migration as an “invasion”. Mr Khalil and others are targeted under a rarely used provision of theImmigration and Nationality Act, which allows deportations when the secretary of state determines that a foreign national’s presence “would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States”. And while this campaign is indiscriminate in many regards, Mr Trump’s offer ofasylumto white Afrikaners facing “unjust racial discrimination” in South Africa speaks volumes about who is and is not wanted in his America.The current fear among migrants, with all itssocial costs, is not a byproduct of this drive, but the desired result. The Trump administration istrying to pushundocumented individuals into “self-deporting”, which is cheaper and easier than using agents to hunt people down. It reportedly plans tolevy fines of up to $998 a dayif those under deportation orders do not leave – applying the penalties retroactively for up to five years. Fairness, never mind mercy, is not relevant. The administration admits an “administrative error” led to theexpulsion to El Salvador of Kilmar Abrego Garcia– who is married to a US citizen and was working legally in the US – but fights against righting that wrong.This crackdown should frighten US nationals too, both for what it says about their nation’s character and for what it may mean for their own rights. The Trump administration wants toremove birthright citizenshipand is ramping updenaturalisationefforts. “I love it,”saidMr Trump, when asked about El Salvador’s offer to jail US citizens in its infamous mega-prisons – though at least he conceded that he might have to check the law first. The chilling effect of Mr Khalil’s arrest on dissent is already beingfelt by US nationals too: the first amendment’s protection of free speech is not exclusive to citizens.“The friendless alien has indeed been selected as the safest subject of a first experiment; but the citizen will soon follow,” Thomas Jeffersonwrotewhen the alien and sedition laws were passed. That warning now looks more prescient than ever.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Meanwhile, Elon Musk’s gone suspiciously quietTue 8 Apr 2025 10.47 EDTLast modified on Tue 8 Apr 2025 13.00 EDTShareTrade Wars, Episode V: The Empire Shoots Itself in the Foot. As the world financial markets fail to appreciate his genius, tariff-excreting president Donald Trump has explained it all away by stating that “sometimes you have to take medicine”. Why am I reminded of the bit in Covid where he appeared to suggest that disinfectant could helpfullybe injectedinto the lungs? I guess that was just science, same as this tariffs plan is just economics.Even so, can it really still be less than a week since a Wall Street Journal poll found 77% of US Republicans thought tariffs would have a positive impact? Ah well. Famously, the American people have a great tolerance for pain. If only one of their kindly gazillionare firms could come up with some sort of financial opioid epidemic to take the edge off the coming agonies.As discussedhere recently, in China, they call Trump “the nation builder”. And, spoiler alert, the nation they’re talking about is not the United States. Perhaps, then, it is not altogether strange and unpredictable that the Chinese have, thus far, failed to fold in the face of the American president’s tariffs, even as Trumpthreatens to slapan extra 50% tax on Chinese imports as revenge for Xi Jinping’s government having had the temerity to impose a 34% counter-tariff on the US.“If the US insists on going its own way,” a spokesperson for Beijing’s commerce ministry stated on Tuesday, “China will fight it to the end.” Big talk – but what about Xi’s midterm elections? This could really pile political pressure on – oh right, I just remembered. Presumably a future stage of Trump’s masterplan will be to explain that for too long, the rest of the world has been taking advantage of America because it has indulged them by holding regular elections. Well, NO MORE! The United States cannot be made a fool of by democracy any longer.View image in fullscreenBill Ackman publicly endorsed Donald Trump last summer.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesStill, as the world burns, we’ve got to take our cheap thrills where we can – so who’s your favourite embarrassingly disillusioned billionaire Trump backer? My current one is Bill Ackman, hedge-fund supremo, who last July publicly endorsed Trump, grandly declaring: “I assure you that I have made this decision carefully, rationally, and by relying on as much empirical data as possible.” Well, flash forward to Sunday, and – whaddayaknow? – the same Bill Ackmancould be found explainingthat Trump was launching “economic nuclear war on every country in the world”, and that we were “heading for a self-induced, economic nuclear winter”. Mm. I guess the ONE piece of empirical evidence Ackman overlooked about tariffs was all the many, many, many times during the election campaign that Trump clearly stated he was going to impose tariffs. Can’t believe he’s imposed tariffs. I guess strife comes at you fast. According to Bill, “this is not what we voted for”. Oh dear. Always read the big print, Bill!Then again, of all the wanky things Trump’s mega-rich backers say about him, the most masturbatorial of all is surely “take him seriously but not literally”. How many times have we had to sit through this trite little piece of wisdom-effect nonsense? But, gentlemen … he has quite literally done the very serious thing he said he was going to do. How to play this wholly unpredictable state of affairs? Tell you what – if any of your companies or the ones you invest in need goods or parts from overseas, why not simply inform your suppliers that you are taking the presidential tariffs “seriously but not literally”, and see how you get on?The added irony, of course, is that this is happening to members of that special class of Trump big-hitters who think about the Roman empire every day. I wonder which period of it they’ve been thinking of this past week. The good days, definitely! Especially when Trump hit the golf course while the markets were on fire. Take presidential first buddy Elon Musk, who has wimped out of saying anything explicit about tariffs, preferring instead to drag his brainworms on to his own platform again and post a video of Milton Friedman debunking the very notion of trade taxes. Good to see the guy retreating into his clicktivist phase, the period where he – along with everyone else on X – thinks that posting about something is the same as doing anything remotely useful.Speaking of conspicuously absent friends, though, whatever happened to Trump’s local beta, Nigel Farage? He’s gone rather quiet on the cheerleading front. In fact, given the raging shitstorm, it’s no surprise that all this is playing out as one of the great submarine moments of Farage’s career. He always does this when he’s afraid to front up, eventually emerging with some mealy-mouthed bollocks long after backbone and leadership were required. He didn’t surface in theimmediate aftermathof the murder of Jo Cox during the referendum campaign. He had scarcely a soundbite when his much-touted new friend Musksuddenly turned on himand said he didn’t have what it takes as a leader. And now Nigel’s declining to be meaningfully drawn as Donald Trump – a man in whose colon the Clacton MP has spent more time than his constituency – has unleashed destructive turmoil, even though Nigel told everyone he was a very stable genius. Nigel always pulls this trick when the going gets tough, somewhat like the child who imagines that putting his hands over his eyes means no one can see him.We’ve certainly yet to hear him expand on the real-world implications of the tariffs. After all, speaking of “taking medicine”, health secretary Wes Streeting has this morning said that tariffs could affect the UK’smedicine supply. That, I suppose, would be quite literally – and definitely seriously – “taking medicine”, in that it would be taking medicine away from people who urgently need it.Of course, Elon Musk isn’t the only wingnut to own his own platform, so let’s play out with a genuine statement posted to Truth Social by the occupant of the Oval Office. “The United States has a chance to do something that should have been done DECADES AGO. Don’t be Weak! Don’t be Stupid! Don’t be a PANICAN (a new party based on Weak and Stupid people!). Be Strong, Courageous, and Patient, and GREATNESS will be a result”. Righto. Last week, Republican house speaker Mike Johnson declared: “You have to trust the president’s instincts on the economy, OK?” Do you trust in the instinct of the man who wrote the above word salad? Or do you, like rather a lot of people, find yourself slightly panican?Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsTrump tariffsOpinionDonald TrumpTariffsUS economycommentShareReuse this content"

That’s no surpriseJudith LevineUS politicians and the media are focused on our domestic crisis. But we cannot close our eyes to the outside worldTue 8 Apr 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 8 Apr 2025 15.40 EDTShareSeven and three-quarters hours into his 25-hourspeechon the Senate floor, the New Jersey Democrat Cory Booker uttered the word “Gaza”.He was not talking about the war. He stepped nowhere near the 50,000 Palestinians killed by the Israeli armed forces since 8 October 2023, or the US’s military and political support of the genocide.Rather, Booker was searching for a particularly ludicrous lie from a presidential administration that has told thousands. “There are lies about USAID, like, I don’t know, 5 million condoms going to Gaza or something outrageous,” he said. Considering the other outrageous things Trump has said about Gaza – such as his planto “clean out”the strip to make room for luxury resorts – the remark felt trivializing.The word “Gaza” came up once more, when the senator mentioned his “humanitarian and peace-building work” with the UN there.It was not until hour 13, more than halfway through his oratorial marathon, that Booker engaged at any length with the subject of Israel and Palestine. This time it was not about the war, either. Instead, he was condemning the Trump administration’s attacks on free speech at universities and its summary deportation of legally resident foreign students who “espouse certain views on topics like Israel and Palestine”.The senator recounted the abduction of Rumeysa Ozturk, the Turkish Tufts University graduate student who was surrounded on the street by masked plainclothes agents, handcuffed and hustled into an unmarked vehicle, then shipped to a hellish Louisiana detention center, where she faces deportation – all apparently because she co-wrote an op-ed in the student newspaper urging the college to divest fromIsrael. “Her arrest,” said Booker, “looks like a kidnapping that you might expect to see in Moscow rather than in the streets of Boston.” True.Denouncing censorship, the senator self-censored. “Certain views on topics”: he neglected to specify which views. He didn’t say that punishment is being meted out exclusively to critics of Israel and never to its supporters, or that those supporters aresupplying homeland securitywith the names of the critics – in other words, collaborating in the very violations of constitutional rights that he decries.The atrocities Israel has been committing in Gaza since the temporary ceasefire collapsed are arguably the worst yet. Trump is cheering Bibi on like a fan at a wrestling match. His support of Israel’s policies is not only unconsciously racist, like Biden’s, but blatantly racist. Yet few Democrats are saying – or, more importantly, doing – anything to stop him. In fact, a few days after the speech, Booker voted againstBernie Sanders’ resolutionsto block $8.8bn in arms sales to the Netanyahu government. Only 14 of his colleagues voted in favor.Antiwar activists are having a hard time catching anyone’s eyes – including the eyes of those who are sympathetic to their causePerhaps senators are hoping their constituents won’t notice their inaction. Indeed, as the mudslide of executive orders buries immigrants, federal workers, transgender people, science, regulation, the economy, the rule of law and US democracy, it is hard for the press, or anyone else, to take their eyes off what is going on at home. Even when horrors are taking place abroad. Especially if they’re taking place in Palestine.For example: senior national security officials discussed classified military operations on the commercial message app Signal and inadvertently included a reporter on the call. The super-blunder got a name, andSignalgatewas all over the news. But on the subject of that discussion – US airstrikes on Houthi militants in Yemen – virtual silence.Only the most tuned-in of US news hounds know who the Houthis are, let alone why we might bomb them:their attacks on ships in the Red Sea, perpetrated in support of the Palestinians. Was the US strike a good idea? Was it consonant with the US’s Middle East strategy – if there is a Middle East strategy? Do the Houthis pose a threat to national security? Is the Yemen bombing an escalation of US involvement in the Gaza war? Don’t ask the mainstream media. Fixated on the incompetence of Trump’s cabinet and the president’s laid-back attitude toward classified information, Signalgate turned a military aggression in a country against which we have not declared war into a domestic story – about Trump.As in Booker’s speech, as last spring, when university administrators called in the police to break up student Palestine-solidarity encampments, the press focused narrowly on individual Americans’ acts in relation to a response to the war in Gaza, rather than on the war itself.Antiwar activists are having a hard time catching anyone’s eyes – including the eyes of those who are sympathetic to their cause. This Saturday, at opposite ends of the National Mall in Washington, two demonstrations occurred simultaneously: theEmergency March for Palestineand the much larger Hands Off rally, one of about 1,500 taking place nationwide.At the former event, a ribbon-like white banner inscribed with the names of the Palestinian dead flowed from hand to hand above the heads of the participants, drawing the crowd together like a seam stretching into the distance. Solemn, elegant, a symbol of the interminable war and the immensity of its damage, it was the kind of mediagenic political spectacle that deserved to be broadcast widely, at least at the end of the newscast. But it can be viewed only onsocial media.Why did these two events happen at the same time anyway? Was there no communication between Indivisible and the other Hands Off organizers and the groups, including Jewish Voice for Peace and the Palestinian Youth Movement, that planned the Palestine action? Did Indivisible consider the war too divisive for an action seeking to attract everyone from socialists to Republicans worried about their 401ks? Or was Trump’s stance on Israel not on the bill of indictments against him?What the Trump administration is doing to the US and what he is eagerly helping Netanyahu to do to the Palestinians are of a piece. Both are criminal, immoral campaigns against domestic and international law, causing immense suffering. Yes, it’s exhausting to contend with two major catastrophes at once. But we don’t have the time or the privilege to put either one aside.Judith Levine is a Brooklyn journalist and essayist, a contributing writer to the Intercept and the author of five books.

Moan, moan, moan.While it might be true that much of these predictions are coming from highly credentialed economists and people who tend to know what they’re talking about, I’d like to remind you thatthere are two sides to every story– and it’s always worth looking at both of them.You’ve already heard from voices who reckon Trump’s tariffs are misguided and dangerous. Now it’s time to focus on the people who support the president’s assessment that tariffs are a “verybeautiful thing” that will usher in a new golden age.Where do we find such people? Fox News, of course. The place where up is down, left is right, and Oceania has always been at war with Eastasia if King Trump says that’s the case. As the stock market plunges, Fox News has wheeled out a bunch of pundits and anchors to explain how your savings getting obliterated is a good thing, actually.First, there’s Fox News host Jesse Watters, who is known for making thoughtful and nuanced statements such as: “When a man votes for a woman, he actuallytransitions into a woman”; and announcing that men shouldn’t eat soup in public becauseit isn’t “manly”. In a recent segment,Watters saidthat these tariffs – which will make life more expensive – are actually “going to make it easier for people to start families”. He added: “These tariffs are for the children.” I polled my own child, who is three, on this, and she would rather have an Elsa doll than a tariff, but what does she know, eh?While Watters believes the children are our future, and tariffs will help them lead the way, Free Press columnist Batya Ungar-Sargon reckons Trump’s economic policy is going to fix the “crisis of masculinity”. On Sunday, Ungar-Sargon told Fox News that the US had “shipped jobs that gave men who work with their hands for a living, and rely on brawn and physicality, off to other countries … and imported millions and millions of illegals to work in construction, manufacturing, landscaping, janitorial services – jobs that used to give men access to the American dream.”Ah yes, as the old adage goes: if you’ve got nothing intelligent to say, go on Fox News and demonise immigrants. There are in fact plenty of jobs available in the US that rely on “brawn and physicality”; the problem is many of them wreck your body and don’t pay a living wage. You know the workers who cut quartz slabs for kitchen countertops, for example? They’re predominantly young Latino men who are said to besuffering from lung diseasebecause of the silica dust created by cutting said slabs. Meanwhile, construction workers are more likely todie of a drug overdosethan those in any other occupation because the physical nature of the work results in an increased likelihood of injury and the subsequent prescription of addictive opioids. Romanticising these sorts of jobs – particularly when your own job consists of typing on a computer – does absolutely nothing to help men.As I said, it’s always important to look atboth sides,even if one side of an argument appears completely demented. Still, I’m squinting very hard and I’m afraid that, despite Ungar-Sagon and Watters’s very persuasive arguments, I can’t see an upside to tariffs. Let’s say that more manufacturing jobs do open up in the US (a process that would take years). It seems unlikely Trump would fight for them to come with decent wages – he recently rescinded one of Joe Biden’s executive orders thatraised the minimum wagefor federal contractors. I’m not sure doing hard labour for a low salary gives you access to the American dream, unless your dream is going bankrupt from medical bills.But look at me: moan, moan, moan. You know what I’ve just realised my problem is? I think I need to watch more Fox News. And, if you’re feeling down about the state of the world, then you may need to, too. Now that Trump has started posturing over Iran, I can’t wait for Fox pundits to explain how accidentally inviting a nuclear war is going to be great, actually. Nothing like a little bit of radiation poisoning to fix the crisis of masculinity.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsTariffsOpinionTrump administrationTrump tariffsDonald TrumpUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

But they brought a glimmer of hopeMoira DoneganThe Hands Off event proved Americans with a slew of different priorities can still form a broad left-liberal coalitionTue 8 Apr 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 8 Apr 2025 12.04 EDTShareWhat is the point of street protest? This is the question I asked myself as I rode the bus downtown to San Francisco city hall, where activists were hosting a rally and march for Hands Off, a national day of action meant to collect a broad range of resistance to the Trump regime under one banner.During the firstTrump administration, I’d gone to these a lot. I’d attended the Women’s March in Washington in January of 2017, and felt myself crushed between the bodies of the hundreds of thousands of attenders; I’d held a sign at JFK airport, chanting “Immigrants are welcome here”, a few weeks later, when Trump instituted his travel ban. In 2020, I’d marched in Black Lives Matter protests, trying to avenge the horror I had felt when I’d seen videos of police officers killing Black men, often as they begged for their lives, played over and over again on the tiny screen of my phone. I’d inherited a brutal and ugly world, I felt, and it seemed urgent to say that I rejected it, that I felt the rage and grief of its injustice, and to be among other people who felt the same way.But in time, these demonstrations lost their salutary power, even as I kept going to them. I saw signs that irked me, making jokes that seemed cavalier or claims I found wrongheaded. I heard, and came to absorb, criticisms of protest movements as vain or self-congratulatory. Perhaps none was thought more so than the Women’s March, where I had once felt so hopeful, which became, instead of the blueprint for future activism that it was meant to be, something of a shorthand on the left for the feminine and the cringe, an effort thought to be heavy on self-seriousness and light on justifications for it.But most of all, I think, I stopped believing that protests like the kind I was attending could have a political effect. Policymakers seemed indifferent to the expressions of mass displeasure we were making in the streets; if anything, our actions seemed to be radicalizing them against us further. Those in power were hostile to our worldview and indifferent to our desires: they kept on supporting violence and depravation, no matter how clever our chants were, and no number of bodies in the streets seemed to slow the regression of our rights, or stop the flow of money to wars of aggression abroad, or keep the titans of industry from plundering our institutions, stealing our wages, or gouging their prices. It wasn’t clear that these efforts were accomplishing anything. I remember peeling off from one march, on Manhattan’s Sixth Avenue, and heading for my subway line: I had realized, after more than an hour of walking and chanting, that we had been going in circles.The protests offered a corrective, a sign that the depravity of the Trump agenda has roused a weary cohort from their defeatist malaiseI suspect that I have not been alone in this feeling. And perhaps it has been this sense of protest’s futility – its inadequacy or even foolishness in light of the regime’s indifference to popular will – that has caused the delay in left-liberal opposition to the restored Trump regime, the sense of defeat and the lack of visible opposition even as the Maga right has pursued an especially sadistic and lawless version of their agenda. We had, after all, tried all this before. And where had it gotten us?But the Hands Off protests that spread across the country this weekend offered a corrective, a sign that the depravity of the Trump agenda and the breadth of the injuries it is inflicting have roused a weary cohort of American liberals from their defeatist malaise. What emerged was a broad left-liberal coalition, with a slew of different priorities, united in opposition to what they see as an anti-constitutional assault on basic rights, civil society and human dignity.In San Francisco, I saw an older white couple wearing T-shirts that read Resist or Nasty Woman – clearly leftovers from the first Trump era, dug out from the back of the closet – chatting amiably with a pair of young Black women wearing keffiyehs as hijabs. Palestinian, American and trans flags were in bountiful supply – along with the newly familiar flag of Greenland, the icebound and mineral-rich northern territory that Trump has concocted a bizarre plan to take over. Handmade signs held aloft amid the massive crowd spoke to a dizzying array of grievances against the Trump administration: from “Medicaid saves lives” to “Childhood vaccines cause adulthood” to “Hands off my social security”. A child let me take a photograph of a sign he’d made himself, in his inexpert handwriting, that read, “If you think education is expensive, try ignorance”, and was complete with three drawings of open books. Some signs pointed to federal programs the maker had benefited from – the Veterans Administration, Pell grants, the National Institutes of Health, national parks, Medicare – while speakers cited the local costs of Trump’s cuts and agenda, from pollution in the San Francisco Bay, to layoffs at local employers, to the plight of immigrant communities.But overwhelmingly, the sentiment was pro-democracy and anti-oligarchical. One sign showed the Statue of Liberty covering her face and weeping: “No Fascists”, it said. Another showed Lady Liberty’s torch setting alight a Tesla Cybertruck. Elon Musk, Trump and Mark Zuckerberg appeared on one sign with the words “Down with the Broligarchy” – a popular catchphrase. Another sign read “End Citizens United” – a reference to the 2010 supreme court decision that allowed unlimited money into politics – a warping of the law that made the takeover of the federal government by monied interests inevitable. When a representative of a local nurses’ union spoke through a bullhorn, her most popular line summed up the tenor of the afternoon: “We can have billionaires, or we can have democracy,” she said. “We can’t have both.”Such a large coalition, with such diverse priorities, is bound to contain contradictions and conflict. And it is true that the exact end goal of the protests, which had no single demand and only vague or tenuous plans for further action, remains ambiguous. But the afternoon, with participation across such a broad array of American left-liberal activism, convinced me that it remains possible for Americans to form a popular front: an alliance of people whose politics would not normally put them in alliance, who nevertheless come together against a fascist threat.The future of the anti-Trump American political movement remains uncertain, and its direction is still not decided. But the work of shaping that future will happen on afternoons like this, in the heat or the rain, among people we might not otherwise choose to spend our time with. It will mean denying ourselves the luxury of hopelessness or disappointed fatigue. And it will mean proceeding doggedly along, through displeasure and uncertainty, towards a future we cannot yet see.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionDonald TrumpProtestUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

He had a simple question for Fifa presidentGianni Infantino. More of a demand, really.“Give me something about America that you really love,”Cowherd said.“Can I say burger?” Infantino offered, before laughing a little too hard. “I would say burger, definitely, but what I think as well, and this is not to flatter anyone, but this is really the land of opportunity. There are so many opportunities here for so many people. Which is why I still don’t understand why soccer has not become the No 1 [sport] here.”Burgers, sure. And opportunity, yes, that too. But Infantino’s answer elided the load-bearing pillar of his deep commitment to the American market: its economic might (for now).US and UK World Cup bid success boosts hosts but does little for global game | Tom GarryRead moreBy this point in his interview with Cowherd, Infantino had already uttered his usual vaporings about the grandeur of his steroidal Club World Cup. This was his latest stop in a media blitz to drum up even the slightest glimmer of interest in the tournament, as the scent of desperation grows pungent. He had also confessed thatFifa“basically doubles the revenues” by holding its signature tournaments stateside.At the same time, Infantino argued that a lack of investment is holding American soccer back. “They should listen to me, and then they’ll become the No 1 league in the world,” he said, apparently referring to Major League Soccer.And contained therein we find the tension between the growth of American domestic soccer on the one hand, and Americans’ mushrooming interest in the sport as a whole on the other.Long gone are the years whenMLSfelt like it was teetering on the brink of insolvency, its future forever tenuous. Yet some teams, usually ones owned by those who have been around the league the longest, still keep costs down wherever they can. The newer investors, by and large, are keen to spend more freely and dump cash into the gap separating the league from the more lavish circuits it could realistically catch up with. This internal disagreement has been a source of friction for years and will come to a head at some point. It is fair to say, then, that MLS could and probably should spend more.But it is also true that the rest of football has treated the American market as a giant ATM. For the next few years, Infantino’s Fifa is at the vanguard of this trend.MLS doesn’t just compete with the world’s other leagues for TV viewers – and the fact that it doesn’t come on the air until hours after most European games have already finished doesn’t help any – but it’s now the only league anywhere that also has to contend with a match-going alternative. The very reason the Club World Cup was planned here, and that the World Cup proper will be here, as Infantino openly admits, is to reach into the pockets of the American consumer. That’s why Europe’s most marketable clubs go on extensive pre-season tours here. It’s why the Mexican national team plays many of its matches here. It’s why Conmebol has heldtwoeditions of Copa América here in the span of just eight years.It’s why an American promoter, Relevent Sports, sued Fifa and US Soccer on antitrust grounds, fighting a policy that contained domestic league games to the borders of the nation in question. Relevent accomplished exactly what it aimed to when Fifa agreed to scrap the policyin order to be dismissed from the suit. Before long, Spain’s La Liga, or Italy’s Serie A, or any number of other leagues could attempt to put on their matches nearby your local MLS team.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Name another domestic league that has to fret about some other competition setting up shop in its backyard. Would Barcelona and Atlético Madridattempt to play a potentially title-swaying tiltin Germany or Argentina or Pakistan, as they tried to in Miami in December? It’s doubtful.MLS has Infantino to thank for that, on whose watch whatever protections existed for the league have vanished. The primary issue isn’t that MLS is underfunded. It’s that it faces murderous competition for fans.The American market is spending huge amounts of money on live soccer. A lot of it just isn’t going to MLS. That expenditure doesn’t come from a bottomless pit of wealth, although Fifa remains intent on finding out just where the floor is withtowering ticket pricesto the upcoming summer bonanzas. At some point, soccer fans will be tapped out on what they’re willing to spend to watch live games.If you want domestic American soccer to develop, you have to institute a kind of soccer protectionism –although that may presently not land so well. Or to do something, anything, to ensure that a growing league doesn’t spend its entire season fighting off all the interlopers keen on its market, arriving routinely to pick off the interest and ransack the audience’s disposable income.But then Fifa is no longer in the business of opening up new markets, as it once was. Rather, it is fully focused on monetizing the sport, no matter the collateral damage.Leander Schaerlaeckens is at work on a book about the United States men’s national soccer team, out in 2026.

The first patient, a middle-aged man, has been admitted with an “all-over” rash.Since every other patient was sicker, this patient had slipped my mind and I had left the hospital without seeing him, thus breaking my own rule.Now, struck by a dreadful thought, I text the medical fellow.“Could the rash be measles?”“I don’t think so … ” she replies.The ellipsis worries me.In my head, I see a bevy of patients and staff exposed to contagion. Shouty headlines and public outrage swim before my eyes and I prepare to go into the hospital again – better late than never.My fellow’s second text, “I also ran it past dermatology”, proves no more reassuring.NAD boosters: Kendall Jenner and Hailey Bieber are into them, but do they actually stop ageing? | AntiviralRead moreShe has never seen measles. In fact, I have seen it only once and that too, with its most feared consequence, disabling encephalitis. To young doctors, measles is a “textbook” disease, such as scurvy or pellagra. They would be excused for not even considering the diagnosis – until now.With an outbreak in parts of the USafflicting hundreds of patients, measles is back in the news. Almost all the affected are unvaccinated, of which a few have died.Hand in hand with measles reporting are the concerns about slashed US funding for public health measures that threatens to spur the spread of infectious diseases around the world.Thanks to the world really being a global village, an infectionin Texasor Tanzania could easily reach Tasmania. Given the giant contribution of US aid (and intellect) to global public health, the rolling announcements about cuts to those endeavours have caused a global shiver.But in challenging times I think that it also pays to understand what we can do to help ourselves, a philosophy especially relevant to one of the richest countries on the planet, Australia.I met a usually measured public health doctor who didn’t mince his words lambasting my home state Victoria’s management of the Covid pandemic as an inevitable disaster whose spillover effects were still reverberating five years later. I would have made less of his comment but for hearing it repeated in different contexts thrice that week.His words, coupled with readingthis Grattan Institute report, reignited my indignation or, more truthfully, my guilt at the price society paid for the country’s complacency about public health.Everyone has a painful Covid story and doctors have thousands but this one is emblematic for me. During one of our manyharsh (and questionable) lockdowns, I walked into a ward to find a non-English speaking elderly patient dying alone. After charting morphine, I noted that he lived locally and called his wife in. The rule that month allowed in one relative to see a terminally ill patient.The next thing I heard was that she had been stopped at the entrance because, in the time it took her to dash to the hospital, the patient had died. The second part of “the rule” was that a relative could attend a dying patient but not a dead one.I still don’t have the right words to describe those minutes when my attention flitted from the unknowing wife stuck at the door to the still-warm body of her husband and back to the administrator who expected a doctor to tell the wife.I felt compromised and dirty and cruel. I refused – and, since I wouldn’t allow any of my horrified interns anywhere near that job, the administrator quickly relented and the wife was allowed in.How a plant’s failure to thrive unexpectedly mirrored the life of my cancer patient | Ranjana SrivastavaRead moreI think about that family even today as I absorb the litany of failures of public health management laid out by experts since that time.We must own those failures. When the next health emergency strikes, Australians deserve better. Better intelligence, better advice and more evidence-based rules with room for adjustment. To avoid another disaster, we must arrestdown trending vaccination coverageand combat misinformation with education.The time to stock up on well-trained professionals and modern infrastructure for contact tracing, data collection and analysis is now, not in the middle of a crisis. Similarly, the socioeconomic determinants of health such as housing and employment are not soundbites but real issues all too easily neglected until we start paying the price.Of course, it all costs money. Of the $250bn (9.9% of GDP) Australia spends on health, most of it goes to hospitals. As someone who works in one, the amount of waste, believed to be as much asa third of the expenditure, throughlow-value careis eye-watering.A paltry1.8% is spenton sporadic and piecemeal public health initiatives, where arguably the greatest returns are.A robust public health system would not only keep Australians safe from preventable and avoidable conditions but also meet Australia’soft-stated obligationsto its vulnerable neighbours in the South Pacific whose diseases could easily become our diseases.I have long been drawn to the intellectual rigour and can-do attitude of my US colleagues, which is why they make such superb collaborators. This underlying sentiment and mutual respect is not about to change.US cuts to public health measures will affect many countries but Australia can and should meet this occasion with its own clear vision backed by its own wealth.In doing so, we might recall the words of President Theodore Roosevelt: “Do what you can, with what you have, where you are.”Ranjana Srivastava is an Australian oncologist, award-winning author and Fulbright scholar.

Judiciary officials have advised judges on how to deal with the issue after anecdotal reports of dogs barking, urinating and defecating, jumping up and otherwise disrupting proceedings. Assistance animals, such as guide dogs and medical alert dogs, are highly trained and covered under equality legislation to enter courts. “Emotional support animals” (ESAs), however, arenot regulatedin the UK; they may not necessarily even be trained at all.Though it’s become a punchline, the concept is not devoid of merit. ESAs first came tomainstream attention around 2015following some high-profile examples on US college campuses. The idea is that the presence and companionship of a pet can help to alleviate the symptoms or effects of someone’s disability or mental health condition, and help them to succeed at school. Educatorshave describedanddefendedthe transformative impact of these dogs (as they most often are) on disadvantaged students. Indeed, because they receive no special training, it is only “theimpact of those benefits… that makes an ESA therapeutically appropriate” (to quote froma 2019 editorial in theJournal of the American Veterinary Medical Association, my italics).But what started out rooted in reality, as a compassionate accommodation extended in specific circumstances to a few, is increasingly being taken advantage of. It is hard to believe that anyone would attempt to argue that they can’t function without theiremotional support squirrel.Orpeacock. Orturkey. And yet all those cases have been made, presumably with a straight face.Britain, a nation of dog lovers? Look at all the spoilt or abandoned pups, then tell me what you think | Elle HuntRead morePublic ridicule and disapproval hasn’t slowed emotional support animals’ roll into legitimacy. In 2014, a New Yorker reporter, trying to pinpoint the exact line where the “therapy animal” line crossed into parody, ended uptaking an alpaca on a train. Four years later, after a spate of “pigs, monkeys, turkeys, snakes and oh-so-many dogs” on planes, the New York Timescalled it a fadand even a “scam”. But since the pandemic widely stoked anxiety and unravelled the social fabric, perhaps beyond repair, it’s been harder to put the ESA back into its airline-approved cage. Yes, some will undeniably have therapeutic benefits, but more can only be bald-faced grifts.Last week, a 71-year-old Nevada man called Karl Mitchell, who had been keeping seven tigers at his home without a permit,argued that theywere there on doctor’s orders, to help with his post-traumatic stress disorder. In these post-truth times, it seems, one person’s emotional support animal may be another’s apex predator. Of course, dogs and cats are not the only legitimate pets, and I am more enthusiastic than most about species that are scaly, slimy or scary. But even if we are to take these cases in good faith, it’s not callous to say that one person’s coping mechanism can’t be allowed to take precedence over the experiences of everyone else.Take Wally,the emotional support alligator, who became briefly famous a few years ago. His owner said caring for Wally helped him with his depression, and I believe him. Equally I can see that, for other people, encountering the 5.5ft-long reptile at,say, a baseball gamemight induce anxiety – despite Wally’s owner’s assurance that he “doesn’t bite”.That’s the extreme (AKA American) presentation of the ESA phenomenon. But it’s not dissimilar in principle from the kennel-type chaos reported at British courts. The justice system is dysfunctional enough as it is; one dog may help one person through, but many dogs are likely to just add to the anxiety, delays and disruption. Having not been trained to resist distractions or weather long periods in unfamiliar, busy settings, it may not be much fun for the dogs, either. In recent years,dog ownership has cometo be understood by many as simply having a dog and taking it with you, wherever you go – first to the pub and cinema, now your sentencing. It may be preferable to leaving them cooped up at home alone all day – but it’s far from facilitating their natural behaviours, as is considered the gold-standard for animal husbandry.The rise of ESAs has been taken up in the culture wars, as evidence that somefeeble-minded “babies”are unable to cope with reality. A more compassionate view is that, clearly, people feel in need of support – but leaning on our pets isn’t the answer. That we’d even think to argue otherwise illustrates the heavy burden we expect animals to carry – the roles we expect them to play for us without, necessarily, equivalent regard for their wellbeing. Consider the animals that are claimed to alleviate flying anxiety, for example. Long-haul flights are uncomfortable enough for us – imagine if you had no idea why you were doing it or indeed what a plane was. Tywinn, the nine-year-old miniature schnauzer, certainly didn’t know what was in store.Just before Christmas in 2024, his owner, Alison Lawrence,tried to board a flightwith him from Florida to Bogotá, Colombia. When she was found to not have the correct paperwork, Lawrence allegedly took Tywinn to the airport bathroom and drowned him. She caught her flight; his body was later discovered in the bin.The story of Wally the alligator also seems to haveended unhappily,with Wally’s disappearance or perhaps abduction. He never bit, his owner said – butmaybe he should have. We may benefit from animals’ support, and even feel entitled to it. But can they count on ours?Elle Hunt is a freelance journalistExplore more on these topicsAnimalsOpinionMental healthHealthDogsCatsPetscommentShareReuse this content"

Behind those statistics is a heartbreaking condition for individuals (and their loved ones) as they become confused and disoriented, struggle to recognise family, friends and caregivers, and lose the ability to live independently.Recent studies fromacross the worldhave highlighted that dementia cases are likely to rise dramatically. For instance,an analysisof 15,000 middle-aged US adults in Nature Medicine in January 2025 found that in study participants, the lifetime risk of developing dementia after 55 was 42%. Basically, an estimated 42% of over 55-year-old Americans will eventually develop dementia. This is considerably higher than previous studies had found. The authors say that the number of US adults who will develop dementia annually is expected to double over the next four decades. The numbers are eye-wateringly high, and they align with a growing concern in public health that with more people living longer and elderly people becoming a larger proportion of the population, cases will increase dramatically, with associated health and social care challenges.Lowering bad cholesterol may cut risk of dementia by 26%, study suggestsRead moreHowever, these estimates of a future tsunami of dementia are nowbeing challenged, givendata showingthat age-specific dementia rates declined by about two-thirds among US adults between 1984 and 2024. Similar falling rates were found in Sweden, the Netherlands, the UK and France. To take it out of jargon, yes, the absolute number of people developing dementia is going up because of ageing and the increasing number of elderly people. Yet, at each age – whether it’s 50 or 60, or 70 – it seems that most studies show that the rate of developing dementia at a given age is going down, compared with what we’ve seen in the past. We’re getting better at living longer, with cognitive impairment still occurring but at a later age.There’s no simple answer to explain the decrease in age-specific dementia rates, although there are several hypotheses, such as lower smoking rates, higher education, better treatment of high blood pressure and early detection of cognitive impairment. We know that there are modifiable factors – that is, things that individuals and communities can do to prevent the onset of dementia. The Lancet Commission on dementia preventionestimatesthat about 45% cases of dementia are preventable if 14 modifiable risk factors are addressed. These include education, hypertension, hearing loss, vision loss, smoking, obesity, depression, physical inactivity, diabetes, high LDL cholesterol, excessive alcohol consumption, air pollution and loneliness and traumatic brain injury. The causes of dementia are complex, and include genetic predisposition, but there are also significant actions that we can each do to improve the health of our brain and delay the onset of disease.New blood test checks for Alzheimer’s and assesses progression, study saysRead moreOver the past couple of decades we’ve become better at understanding these risk factors and developing public health policies and education to address them. We’ve also seen massive scientific progress in medical drugs. For instance, the past couple years have seen the development oftwo new treatmentsfor Alzheimer’s (donanemab and lecanemab), which clinical trials indicate slow down the progression of the disease – and which have led to bold claims, by pharmaceutical companies such as Lilley, that this is the “beginning of the end” of Alzheimer’s. Caution is needed, given the high cost of treatment and serious side-effects that these medicines can cause, but it still shows the slow and steady forward movement in dealing with the disease.The decrease in age-specific dementia ratescontrasts with cancer, where incidence is expected to keep going up in young people. Referred to as the “birth cohort effect”, the numbers show that each group of people born at a later time have a higher risk of developing cancer later in life. So someone born in 1990 is at a higher risk of developing cancer younger than someone born in 1980, who has a higher risk than someone born in 1970. For instance, colorectal cancer increased by 70% among those aged 15-39 in G20 countries between 1990 and 2019. We’re doing better in some areas of health like delaying dementia and losing ground in others such as cancer prevention.Yes, we all have to die at some point, and something in our mind or body will eventually break down with time, but the public health goal is to push disease as far as possible into the future. We know that there are things we can do to delay dementia, and we are already seeing progress likely linked to public health policies and medical advances. Behind the headline news of a dementia tsunami, there’s some good news too.Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, and the author ofHow Not to Die (Too Soon)Explore more on these topicsAlzheimer'sOpinionDementiaHealthMental healthcommentShareReuse this content"

They didn’t succeedRachel HarrisonDespite Thai advisers, the series failed to escape the western lens of its rich protagonists and the history of the country’s representationContains spoilers for the finale of The White Lotus series 3Tue 8 Apr 2025 03.40 EDTLast modified on Tue 8 Apr 2025 12.49 EDTShareOne of the first things I noticed when I sat down to watch the eagerly awaitedthird seriesof The White Lotus was the birdsong. The distinctive call of two species peculiar to Thailand – the coucal and the Asian koel – conjure up precisely how it feels to be there, in the midst of a tropical soundscape. Then there are the exquisite opening credits, which plunge the viewer into a visceral experience of the Thai cultural environment: based on reimagined traditional Buddhist temple painting, the key protagonists are “Thai-ified” as they merge into the mural motifs.The expertise of an array of famous Thai actors, pop stars, fashion models and celebrities – along with the somewhat heavy hand of the Tourism Authority ofThailand– have helped this series achieve a cultural authenticity like no other previous western drama set in Thailand. Things have certainly come a long way since British governess Anna Leonowens (played by Deborah Kerr) waltzed gaily around the royal palace of Yul Brynner’s shiny-headed King Mongkut in the 1956 hit musical, based on the Rodgers and Hammerstein stage production, The King and I(perhaps unsurprisingly banned in Thailand for its derogatory portrayal of a highly revered monarch). Gone too are the crass depictions of Bangkok from the 2011 comedy The Hangover Part II; or the classic Lord of the Flies-style narrative that is explored in Danny Boyle’s 2000 adventure The Beach.In both these cases, the ill-fated western tourist faces crude symbols of the dangers posed by the tropics – from predatory sharks to kleptomaniacal monkeys and gun-toting cannabis farmers.In this persistent cinematic stereotype of south-east Asia, the intensity of the alien environment seizes hold of and contaminates the vulnerable and disoriented Christian western self– to comic, threatening or enlightening effect. The tenacity of this characterisation owes much to Francis Ford Coppola’s Apocalypse Now (1979), of which he famously claimed: “My film is not about Vietnam. My filmisVietnam.” What Coppola really meant was that Apocalypse Now encapsulated the American experience of the Vietnamwar– it features few Vietnamese characters, even less dialogue in Vietnamese language, and was filmed almost entirely in the Philippines.Despite the best efforts of The White Lotus to counter the cultural ignorance of these popular movies, the series fails to fully escape the grip of the exoticising stereotype. Therepresentation of Thailandis restricted by two key limitations. The first lies in the west’s inability to move beyond our own, Christian-influenced cultural position to wholeheartedly engage with another culture, while still finding it accessible and entertaining. The character ofVictoria Ratliffprovides the most overblown example of this, protesting in her fantastic Southern drawl at her daughter Piper’s plans to remain in Thailand. When Piper explains her desire to “meditate and immerse myself so that I can really understand Buddhism and develop my spirituality,” Victoria’s response encapsulates the cultural and religious dissonance: “You’re not a Boooodist – honey you’re not from China. You can be interested in this stuff, but you can never really be it. We’re from an entirely different world.”The second is the way in which Thailand has learned to tailor its forms of self-representation to western tastes. Early in the series, Thai pop group Carabao’s classic song Made in Thailand plays, but lost on the non-native speaker is the poignancy of the lyrics: “Our proud and ancient land, with all that is good, and where Thais love Thais.” This was written way back in 1984 to remind Thai listeners of their glorious cultural heritage, and of never having been colonised by the west, despite the Thai tendency to “sell out” to western markets. Apposite indeed for The White Lotusnarrative that ensues.From gun-toting monkeys to triple homicides: the wildest theories for the White Lotus finaleRead moreSiam, as it then was, resisted the worst vagaries of foreign aggrandisement by appealing to the aggressor as being “civilised” in the eyes of the west. The King and Ireveals this endeavour through Mongkut’s anxiety to have his children learn English, and by Anna teaching the monarch to use a knife and fork. This sense of attending to the desires of western visitors is central to the White Lotus and its depiction of Thailand’s luxury tourism industry. The Thai characters we meet at the White Lotus are embedded in this industry, and are largely seen in uniform and at work (although the depiction of the courtship between Gaitok and Mook is one of the most refreshingly authentic subplots). They reflect back to the foreign visitor what is both palatable and marketable.One element of Thai culture that has remained persistently resistant to western pressure, however, is that of the nationalreligion of Buddhism. The White Lotus makes an admirable stab at exploring how some of the key tenets of Theravada Buddhism might offer spiritual awakening to some of its most psychologically troubled characters – Tim Ratliff, Rick Hatchett and his long-term friend, Frank – as well as its more spiritually inquisitive ones – Piper Ratliff and her younger brother Lochlan. Rick’s journey is a particularly emotional one, as we see him face down his inner demons in the encounter with his nemesis, Jim Hollinger. But as Frank falls off the wagon in wildpost-showdown celebrations befitting One Night in Bangkok (the script references the 1984 song’s lyrics), we see Rick in turn rising above the enticement of debauchery, like the Buddha at the point of enlightenment defeating the temptations sent by Mara (Evil).Sadly, Rick’s release from the karmic cycle of suffering is short-lived. As the words of the venerated Buddhist abbot Luang Por Thera remind us at the opening of the final episode – there is no resolution. Even the Buddhist possibility of nonviolence evades the gentlest of characters, as Gaitok obeys instructions, shoots to kill, and wins the respect of his girl.Despite its exploration of Asian spirituality, and following in the footsteps of Apocalypse Now,theclosing episodeof The White Lotusfalls back into the stereotype of offering an essentially Christian resolution to the surviving characters of the third series. Piper loses her desire for Buddhist austerity, Lochlan awakes like a resurrected Christ from a near-death experience having seen the face of God, and the united family leaves the shores of Thailand, set for an all-American homecoming to the sound of Lo, How a Rose E’er Blooming, those coucals and koels replaced by a Christian carol.The complexity of our longstanding stereotypes of Thailand is that the country stands in the western imagination as both a site of magical eastern spiritualityand alsoa locale for sin, sex and drugs. This stranglehold on the western ability to openly embrace and engage with the rich complexities of Thai culture, coupled with Thailand’s complicity in representing itself in compliance with western tastes, lies at the crux of The White Lotus’sinevitable limitations.Rachel Harrison is professor of Thai cultural studies at Soas University of LondonThis article was amended on 8 April 2025 to refer to Asian spirituality rather than “Asian spiritualism”.Explore more on these topicsThe White LotusOpinionThailandBuddhismcommentShareReuse this content"

Facing the headwinds of the Donald Trump storm, Keir Starmer’s “we have your back” pledge yesterday at a car factory in Solihull heralded a welter of “further and faster” and “fight for the future” tomatch his apocalyptic“the world as we knew it has gone”. The psephology supremo Prof John Curtice says of the prime minister: “He’s brilliant at bad news.” Coping with catastrophe is his forte.Yet the planet-wide tremor didn’t feature on the doorsteps of voters last weekend, as I listened to their conversations withLabourcanvassers for the Runcorn and Helsby byelection next month. Fear of economic cataclysm as a result of Trump and his tariffs hadn’t arrived yet. But it is coming.A cheerful Labour voter who works at the Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) factory in Halewood shrugged off the risk with a smile. He reckoned the 25% tariff on exporting British cars to the US wouldn’t affect JLR: “These American millionaires buying our high-end cars won’t be bothered paying a bit more.” But just an hour later,news thundered inthat JLR was pausing all shipments to the US, sending shudders through the British car industry, which employs 200,000 people.Orange Juice? Keir Starmer is on the Kool-Aid | Stewart LeeRead moreThe bright sun and blue sky were not dispelling a pervasive sense of pessimism. Labour won with a mega-safe52.9% of the votehere last year, before the MP, Mike Amesbury,punched a man to the ground. Now Reform UK is snapping at Labour’s heelsin this seatby the Mersey, in which 54% of the electorate voted leave, 96% are white, incomes and employment are average, and home and car ownership are higher than average.Constituency polls are few and famously unreliable, but Curtice reckons Electoral Calculus may have it right calling 36.6% for Labour and 28% for Reform. Labour is far from confident. With news arriving at the speed of lightning, 1 May may be too far away to guess what might swing people’s votes by then.These brief encounters on voters’ doorsteps say nothing of the result, but they can shed some light on what is on people’s minds and what is not. For now, I heard disappointment from Labour voters, such as the woman who hugged a bug-eyed dog. “Not sure,” she said, when asked about her vote, though she was previously “Labour for ever” and works for a credit union. “I thought there’d be change,” she said. Immigration is high in her thoughts, so would she vote for Nigel Farage’s party? “Oh no, definitely no. We tear up their leaflets.”Down the road, another always-Labour voter, a retired woman in a glittery T-shirt, just might turn to Reform. Near her, she said, a hostel was filled with “illegals, all young men, who look at women, you know, scary”. She said she had nothing against non-white people, but these men were “threatening”. “And the prices, up, up, up, for council tax, the electric, water. I don’t know what Labour are doing.”But another lifelong Labour voter, hosing down his garden wall, definitely did know why he was not defecting. “Labour’s right on benefits. There are too many knowing how to work the system. Other parties? All fat cats. Give Labour a chance to get the country on track.”A woman who answered the door with a towel wrapped around her head asked where all the change promised during the election campaign was. “I don’t see it,” she said. Matthew Patrick, the Labour MP for Wirral West, stepped in offering good news: NHS waiting lists are at last falling, the minimum wage and pensions jumped up this month, breakfast clubs have just begun in local primaries, a new nursery is opening, there are new workers’ rights, a housebuilding boom is on the way. Lest she forget, she was handed a “What has Labour ever done for us?” leaflet. “I might be persuaded,” she said.Pollsters report nationally what it’s easy to hear: pessimism and disappointment. “They [Labour] are not getting the change they expected. The spring statement registered only negatively,” says Gideon Skinner of Ipsos. “Reform takes on that mantle of change now.” In byelections and local ballots in fraught times, voters like to throw a Mike Amesbury-style punch back at the government. A Farage success would be a huge credibility boost for Reform. “But,” says Skinner, “it would be hard to tell if that was a harbinger of a new trend. Many think Farage divisive, not a good change.”His supporters are “distinct”, adds Skinner. Half of Reform votershave little or no confidencein the Covid vaccine, against 14% to 18% of those backing other parties. There is, says Skinner, a definite ceiling of never-Farage voters. And as markets plunge, that Farage/Trump brotherhood is ageing badly: Trump is reviled byfour times as many Britonsas those who like him. Trump the world-wrecker may deter local voting for wild mavericks of the right.The top pitch in Reform’s leaflet is, of course, “freeze immigration and stop the boats”, and maybe that’s enough when 52% of Britonswant immigration cut. Yet if Farage hopes to copy the right’s success elsewhere, the UK is notably different, with some of the least anti-immigration views in Europe:last year 66% of those surveyed said immigrationhad a positive impacton the economy, and the UK scored highest when asked if “immigrants make the country a better place to live”, with 60% saying yes compared with France’s 30%. Nor can the far right thrive on social conservatism: Britain ranks among themost socially liberalof all nations.Starmer announces support for car and pharma industries in ‘age of insecurity’Read moreAs for the rest, Reform’s finger misses the pulse. The other three policies on its Runcorn leaflet include “reverse Labour’s winter fuel cuts”, yet public support formeans testing is evenly split. It also pledges to “scrap net zero to cut your energy bills”, but peoplesupport the net zero target, with 61% in favour and 22% against. Even Reform’s pledge to “cut your taxes” is backed by only a third: 52% wouldkeep them as they are or raise them. And Labour hammers at Farage’s praise for aninsurance-based NHS, surely poison.Reform success on 1 May would be a rough reminder, as if Labour needed one, of people’s general disenchantment. On Starmer’s fifth anniversary as Labour leader, only half who voted for his party last year now say they know what he stands for, though they do notedefence and securityas his strength. “To be in the centre is no longer comfortable in Britain,” Curtice says, pointing out that Labour and the Tories are equally squeezed from right and left.If Starmer means yesterday’s urgent words, then not just “the world we knew” but the overcautious Starmerism we knew may be gone, too. When he says “old assumptions can no longer be taken for granted”, does that mean his own, and his hypercautious No 10 team’s too? In an uncharacteristic burst of hyperbole,he promisesthat Labour is “creating wealth in every corner and delivering security for everyone, everywhere”, and “we simply cannot cling on to old sentiments when the world is turning this fast”. That has to mean escaping from fiscal and psychological handcuffs and unleashing his cabinet’s enthusiasms. Change is what people voted for.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionKeir StarmerReform UKNigel FarageByelectionscommentShareReuse this content"

As humanitarian workers, we are drowning in griefAmy NeilsonI write to bear witness to the incredible nature of these men – to their kindness, their gentleness and their goodnessMon 7 Apr 2025 21.46 EDTLast modified on Mon 7 Apr 2025 22.47 EDTShareWhen the initial news of the executions of eight paramedics from the Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) and the disappearance of one more broke on Eid al-Fitr, I stared for a long time at the pictures of the men the Israel Defense Forces had killed. I have stared more every day since.I knew some of these men.I scan photos of my time inGazalast year, looking for these men in my memories. I see them with patients, kneeling by the stretchers that acted as beds, dressing wounds, talking, reassuring. I see them loading patients into ambulances and driving off in the summer dust. I see them laughing, playing soccer on the tennis court.Eight Palestinian paramedics, working under the auspices of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and with the full protection of their emblem, were killed by the Israel Defense Forces, in blatant violation of international humanitarian law, and indeed of the most basic sense of being human. They were killed and buried alongside six first responders from Gaza’s civil defence unit and a United Nations employee.In April 2024 I was part of an emergency medical team delivering medical care in Gaza. At the request of the World Health Organization, our team worked with the PRCS at a trauma stabilisation point. What an honour that was. On a tennis court in Khan Younis, we worked from two tents – one for the PRCS and one for us – collaborating frequently and freely. We saw patients, treating those we could, and stabilising and referring elsewhere those we could not. Paramedics brought patients directly from places of frontline trauma and when stable they loaded them back in the ambulances and took them to where they hoped they could receive the care they needed. The PRCS clinicians I worked with in Khan Younis took far greater risks than any I have faced in a decade of work in conflict to provide life-saving medical care to their compatriots.Gaza paramedics shot in upper body ‘with intent to kill’, Red Crescent saysRead moreReturning home last yearI wrote in the Guardianthat “Israel poses a palpable, unprecedented risk to humanitarian and medical workers in Gaza”. The latest update from theUnited Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairsreports that since October 2023 at least 409 humanitarian workers have been killed in Gaza, and the number keeps rising. Australian aid worker Zomi Frankcom was one of them. The anniversary of her death passed just days ago, and indeed far too quietly.Medical humanitarian work, to me, is about both contributing to access to healthcare for people in areas of great need, as well as bearing witness to their suffering, in whatever is the manner required by the moment. In this moment I write to bear witness but not to the suffering of the Palestinian Red Crescent medical staff, for that you can read about yourself. Indeed, if you have not seen the egregious violence of Israel against healthcare workers and civilians in Gaza and the West Bank, you are not looking. No, I write to bear witness to the incredible nature of these men – to their love, their kindness, their gentleness and their goodness. We stop seeing people’s humanity very quickly in war of any description, and even more so in mass slaughter or indeed genocide. Erasure requires such forgetting.I watched the men of the PRCS work hard and effectively. I sat with them between patients, listening to lyrical conversation and wondering at their upbeat spirts. In more private candid moments they would explain, what choice did they have? They needed to stay positive enough to be upright each day, to continue the work. They were tired, they were scared, but they continued.We ate together. In the middle of a conflict zone with the austerity that resulted from Israel’s systematic blockades of supplies into Gaza, our colleagues in the PRCS fed us each day from their own kitchens. The people of the PRCS seem to give of an inexhaustible supply of goodness of their own selves.Many of us engaged in medical humanitarian work are currently drowning in grief, in anger and in concern for any possibility of work in conflict going forward.Experienced humanitarian workers know that the deaths of our colleagues are not collateral damage from the routine business of war. War might have been foggy in the 19th century, but I can assure you it is not in the 21st. Israel has demonstrated its exceptional capacity for precision targeting. None with any power among us can afford to wait for a belated international criminal court or International Court of Justice process to say what we see with our own eyes. States must acknowledge the violations of the laws of war that Israel continues to perpetrate, and they must act accordingly.A former-ICRC friend wrote on Instagram that “grief has lost its meaning”. We are all at a loss for words. Another wrote to me that “it is a huge challenge to honour their lives properly”. As I struggle to type, pulling words like teeth without anaesthetic, I feel the words of my friends with my soul and sinew. I can’t meet the challenge. Nothing I can say can ever adequately honour the men of the Palestinian Red Crescent Society. Instead, I write in sadness for the record.Amy Neilson is an Australian rural generalist emergency doctor and academic.

While most architects are used to selecting proprietary products from catalogues, often without knowing much about their origin or impact – pairing aluminium composite cladding panels with petrochemical insulation systems – this trio prefer to go back to the land and harvest their materials from the natural environment.The same qualities that protect trees from rain and forest fires could also protect buildings“Birch bark is like the original dampproof membrane,” says Massoud, as he rifles through a pile of woody material tests in the firm’s east London studio. Their samples library looks more like the contents of a lumberjack’s cabin than an architect’s office. “Bark has been used by indigenous groups for hundreds if not thousands of years, from roofing to canoes, harvested in ways that don’t damage the trees.” While the timber industry treats bark as a low-value waste product, generally shredding it into chippings or mulch, Material Cultures has been exploring how its natural properties could have useful applications in architecture.View image in fullscreenFluffy sequoia bark cladding board with insulation properties.Photograph: Material CulturesWorking withfabricator Erthly, the designers have tested layering and heating bark under pressure to create plywood-like sheets, bound with the trees’ natural resins instead of the usual chemical glues. Some of the results, such as a panel made from six layers of birch bark, have a dense, plasticky quality that could make for good exterior cladding. Others, like a thick sheet made from three layers of hairy redwood bark, are more voluminous and fluffy, lending it well to insulation, with natural fire-retardant properties to boot. “The same qualities that protect trees from rain and forest fires,” says Gormley, “could also protect buildings.”In the eyes of Material Cultures, the intrinsic link between architecture and agriculture must be reinstated if we are to reduce the carbon footprint of the built environment, which currently accounts formore than 40% of CO2emissionsin the UK. If supply chains are more transparent and local, they argue, then we will make more responsible choices. “There’s a culture of negligence built into our industrialised system,” says Gormley. “Buildings have become so detached from their consequences, that it’s easy to behave irresponsibly.” We must understand buildings as being “irrevocably linked to landscapes of extraction”, the designers argue, and work towardsa bio-regional approachthat prioritises plant-based materials and regenerative practices. It’s the architectural equivalent of shop local.The radical trio set out their stall in a powerful call-to-arms manifesto,Material Reform, co-authored with Amica Dall in 2022. Now, the first permanent built fruits of their approach are being realised. On a three-acre former council parks depot and nursery in Wood Green, north London, stand three barn-like sheds. One houses a community hall, another contains classrooms and offices, while the third will be home to a workshop and food packing facility. Designed in collaboration withStudio Gil, they are built with lightweight timber frames, infilled with bales of straw grown on the edge of London, and rendered with clay dug from the site itself and mixed with sand and chalk, protected by thin timber laths. Floors oflimecreteare cast on top of insulation made of foamed glass recycled from car windscreens, while internal walls are built of“strocks”– chunky blocks of unfired clay-rich earth mixed with chopped straw, developed by brick company HG Matthews.View image in fullscreenStrocks away … one of the three barns in Wood Green, London.Photograph: Henry Woide“Strocks save vast amounts of carbon because there’s no firing involved,” says Gormley. “They’re also good acoustically, provide great thermal mass, and they’re antimicrobial and hydroscopic, so they regulate the indoor temperature and humidity.” While other synthetic interior materials cangive off harmful VOC gases, like formaldehyde, the clay blocks actively sequester them. Budgetary constraints necessitated a corrugated steel roof, rather than a bio-based alternative, but at least it’s recyclable.The £2.8m project, funded by the Mayor of London and National Lottery, provides a newcommunity food growing hubrun by local grassroots organisations the Ubele Initiative and Organic Lea, who helped to build it in a collaborative effort.“We had our members involved in everything from making the straw bales to bricklaying and clay plastering,” says Yvonne Field, the founder of Ubele, a social enterprise dedicated to supporting black and minority-led community spaces. “It was great for building community cohesion, and giving people practical skills they can now go on to use elsewhere. It saved a significant amount of money too” – a boon when construction inflation saw costs almost double.View image in fullscreen‘Great for community cohesion’ … building the cabin in north London.Photograph: Henry WoideThe three barns stand alongside the council’s 1970s glasshouses, including a palm house complete with a koi pond and resident terrapins. One greenhouse is now used byBlack Rootz, a local growers’ collective, another to grow herbs for Yotam Ottolenghi’s Rovi restaurant, while a third is dedicated to cactuses. “We host Nopalera Sessions music nights,” says Mexican artist and chef Elki Guillen, as he lovingly tends to his collection of prickly pears. “The music is mainly for the benefit of the plants, but sometimes we invite humans too.” Guillen has also been experimenting with cactuses as a building material, mixing their fibres and mucilage into adobe and lime render as a binder and water repellent – a vernacular technique used in Mexico since Aztec times, which he thinks could have applications here too.A few streets away, Black Rootz and Organic Lea run another community growing site, the seven-acrePasteur Gardens, where Material Cultures has also been busy. Alongside beds planted with tall canes of sorghum, which can be pressed to make syrup, and callaloo, a plant used in Caribbean dishes, stands a handsome little pitch-roofed cabin. Built during participatory workshops last summer, the designers see it as a “demonstrator” project for ultra low-carbon homes.It features walls made of“light earth”– a loose mix of straw and clay packed into the timber frame, which is more insulating than rammed earth or adobe blocks; similar tohempcretebut without the embodied carbon of lime. The exterior has been wrapped with a shaggy coat of thatch, “like a giant duvet”, says Massoud, with offcuts left strewn on the ground where they will decompose – another benefit of using natural materials. Contrary to the build local philosophy, the reeds came from Romania, but Gormley is optimistic about more local supply chains in future, “when therewetting of the fenshappens”. The cabin serves as a shelter and seed library, but the practice has designed it to comply with domestic building regulations, and they intend to publish the plans and specifications, allowing other people to build one themselves. “It’s a module that can be extended and multiplied,” says Gormley, and it can be built – a bit likeWalter Segal’s 1970s timber-framed houses– with “zero to minimal skills”.View image in fullscreenBuilding with straw at Pasteur Gardens.Photograph: Noemi ReijnenTraining more people in natural building methods is one of the practice’s key priorities. Alongside its design and research (which includes a material strategy for Birmingham and the West Midlands, and a circular bio-based construction plan for Yorkshire and the north-east), it is ramping up its educational ambitions with plans for a school. On a 500-acre former farm near Broxbourne in Essex, just north of the M25, the rewilding organisation Nattergal has been working to take the land back to its former state as woodland pasture, funded bybiodiversity net gain paymentsfrom housing developments nearby. Material Cultures hopes to convert a group of huge barns here into a “land lab” for plant-based building.“It would be a permanent, dedicated place where we could both experiment and share knowledge,” says Gormley. “We’re trying to bring agricultural and building practices closer together, so you could come and do a course in regenerative farming, but also do some modules in straw bale construction.”Beyond training, the trio argue, deeper structural reform is needed to ween us off the current “oil vernacular”. From buildings insurance to mortgages, materials testing and regulatory standards, everything is influenced by the all-powerful petrochemical and cement lobby. “The building industry is inherently designed to favour business as usual,” says Massoud. “Natural materials are all about repair, whereas with oil-derived materials, you’re buying into a system. If the system fails, then you have to replace the whole system.” As theGrenfell inquiry so excoriatingly revealed, the current system has failed us – it is long past time to replace it.Material Cultures: Woodland Goods is at theV&A, London, until 31 OctoberExplore more on these topicsV&AMuseumsExhibitionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Blossom is on the trees, the air is warming up andDavid Hockneyhas a show.Five years ago,, Hockney spent lockdown in his garden in Normandy painting the spring, bud by bud, sharing his iPad pictures with whoever was in his address book, like the last artist on Earth sending out signals of hope. The slogan he coined then – “Do remember they can’t cancel the spring” – is now written over the entrance to the Fondation Louis Vuitton, as urgent as it was during Covid.His spring pictures are here too. As well as iPad paintings, there are actual oils and acrylics of Normandy, including ravishing trees in blossom that pay homage to Van Gogh. In his latest self-portrait, Hockney sits in his London garden and beside him sprout yellow daffodils.View image in fullscreenAbundant … Christopher Isherwood and Don Bachardy, 1968 by David Hockney.Photograph: David Hockney/David Hockney, © Fabrice GibertHockney is as reliable as those daffodils, returning at 87 as he did at 82 to show us how beautiful the world is in spite of those who try so hard to ruin it. His eye for nature is what links his art now with his early works. His 1968 portrait of Christopher Isherwood and Don Bachardy is a confident assertion of gay partnership and a meeting of generations as the 60s star Hockney depicts the 1930s author of Goodbye to Berlin. But I can’t take my eyes off the fruit bowl with its abundance of yellow and orange bulging natural forms. Hockney never undervalues the simple things – one captivating 1967 canvas is called Some Neat Cushions. Their neatness makes you happy. For the other thing that connects his art across nearly seven decades is, you realise in this gloriously unrepressed choice of his early works, the pleasure principle. A whole series of paintings of men in showers, alone or together, and a sweaty Berlin nightclub scene show how heroically yet unselfconsciously he depicted then-illegal gay life in the early 1960s. It was simply his experience, as he attests in his 1961 canvas We Two Boys Together Clinging. What else should he paint?But wait. Isn’t this exhibition setting itself up for a dying fall, even aesthetic embarrassment, in starting with such a superb selection of Hockney’s great 1960s and early 1970s paintings? They are magnetic yet only occupy two rooms. No sooner have you lost yourself in the frozen heat and enigmatically stilled passions of his LA swimming pools, tall straight palms and sprinkled lawns, than you are suddenly plunged into the rolling landscapes of East Yorkshire that Hockney painted early this century. All very well, a critic might sniff, but aren’t the works of his senior years that dominate this show a bit lacking in the genius of his youth?Shockingly, they are not. In a hang Hockney himself had final say over, the shift from California to Yorkshire and then Normandy, from sexy showers to rain showers, is gripping and compelling. Giant flossy white hawthorn blossoms spill over a Yorkshire road, patchwork emerald fields are laid out in the sun under candy floss clouds. Sharp yet subtle light and shadow move on the clouds and the villages below them. Hockney doesn’t need glamour or desire to gratify his eyes – just a blustery day in the country.View image in fullscreenVast … Bigger Trees Near Warter or/ou Peinture sur le Motif pour le Nouvel Age Post-Photographique, 2007, by David Hockney.Photograph: David Hockney, © Prudence Cuming AssociatesConveniently for Paris, his vast 2007 painting Bigger Trees Near Warter has always had a French subtitle: “ou Peinture sur le Motif pour le Nouvel Age Post-Photographique”. It’s a jokey reference to “painting on the Motif”, a 19th-century French term for taking your canvas out in the country to work from nature. That was Hockney’s thinking when he settled in Bridlington: he wanted to paint like the French impressionists yet with eyes remade by, or in recovery from, “the post-photographic age”. He pays tribute to impressionism again in one of the most recent paintings here, his own view of Monet’s garden, called Giverny by DH. Even as Hockney’s style has become rawer and simpler in the 21st century, his thinking has become more theoretical.You can learn a lot in this exhibition – not just about photography and the human eye but art history and perspective. At the start of the century, he published Secret Knowledge, in which he claims Renaissance artists made covert use of early camera-like devices. The montage of museum reproductions he made in 2000 to illustrate his thesis, called The Great Wall, is shown as an artwork in its own right. Did Van Eyck have a camera? I don’t know. But how many other contemporary artists find inspiration in the ways people saw things six centuries ago?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But this midday in white satin is above all a feast of looking: while Schlesinger looks into the water Hockney’s eye takes in more – Schlesinger’s pink jacket, the complex ripples and shimmers of the blue and white water, the misty limes and violets of the hills beyond. It’s as accurate and encompassing as a Renaissance painting, aerial perspective and all. Seeing it here, hypnotised, I realise the downcast gaze of Schlesinger has the modesty and mystery of a Piero della Francesca saint.The exhibition climaxes on a top floor where you feel you’ve ascended to in a joyous pilgrimage of colour and sincerity, with a blast of high emotion. It is almost valedictory. Hockney’s new self-portrait, fun but frail, hangs near two new paintings inspired by the visionary artists Munch and Blake that tell us: “Less Is Known than People Think”. Together with a sublime Nordic sun picture they feel like meditations on what comes next.Then you enter an immersive recreation of his opera designs, which engrossed him for years before deafness reduced his enjoyment of music. As you let his intense blues cascade over you to the strains of Wagner’s Tristan und Isolde, you realise how deep and sustaining a love for life this man feels and can communicate. By this time I had tears in my eyes. Life is a dream, I finally understood, and Hockney dreams it well.David Hockney 25 is atFondation Louis Vuitton, Paris, from 9 April to 31 August 2025Explore more on these topicsDavid HockneyExhibitionsPaintingreviewsShareReuse this content"

Here’s where it went wrongMichael HoganTue 8 Apr 2025 08.49 EDTLast modified on Tue 8 Apr 2025 12.18 EDTShareThis article contains spoilers for the final episode of the White Lotus season three. Do not read on if you have not seen episode eight.In the opening scene ofThe White Lotusfinale, a Buddhist monk warned: “There is no such thing as resolution.” Perhaps it was a warning ahead of a disappointing denouement.Grumbles have been growing louder over the past eight weeks that this third instalment of the HBO hit wasn’t a patch on its two predecessors. And a climatic episode full of loose threads, damp squib deaths and predictable plot twists won’t do much to silence the naysayers.‘A bitch move’: Mike White hits back at White Lotus composer over feud claimsRead moreSure, this series had its meme-able moments (mainly thanks to Aimee Lou Wood and Parker Posey) and standout scenes (the incest! The penis flash! Sam Rockwell’s speech!). However, it meandered rather than motored along, while its ideas often felt like retreads of the first two, superior seasons.So where did it all go wrong for the HBO wealth satire? Here are the 10 biggest disappointments …1. No reaction from the RatliffsView image in fullscreenHare-brained … Jason Isaacs as Timothy Ratliff.Photograph: HBO/Home Box Office, Inc. All rights reserved. HBO® and all related programs are the property of Home Box Office, Inc.A storm had been brewing for the Ratliff family. Why didn’t we get to see it break? On the verge of financial ruin, patriarch Timothy (Jason Isaacs) realised exactly how spoilt his brood were. He hatched a hare-brained scheme to harvest fruit from the “suicide tree” and poison everyone with spiked piña coladas, only to chicken out at the last moment. The next morning, hapless Lochlan (Sam Nivola) made a protein smoothie in the unwashed blender with leftover toxic mulch in the bottom – who wouldn’t rinse it out first? – before collapsing at poolside. His near-death experience was a further wake-up call for Tim.Yet when they got their phones back and discovered they were broke and disgraced, cameras cut away. The near fatal poisoning was never mentioned. Resident douche Saxon (Patrick Schwarzenegger) was given nothing to do, except read self-help books. We never saw anyone’s reaction to the scandal – especially Victoria’s, which surely would have been priceless (“Accountant, nooo!”). The script skipped straight past the juicy bit, leaving only a sense of anticlimax.2. The toxic trio’s truceView image in fullscreenBlond triumvirate … Kate, Jaclyn and Laurie on their girls’ trip.Photograph: HBOThe girls’ trip gone wrong was arguably the most fascinating subplot all series. Jealousies simmered. Resentments surfaced. Home truths were told. Forget whether the blond triumvirate would sit together on the flight home. Would they even make it to the departures lounge alive?Well, that Songkran festival where they were sprayed with water pistols didn’t turn out to be foreshadowing. Things between Jaclyn (Michelle Monaghan), Kate (Leslie Bibb) and Laurie (Carrie Coon) somehow came full circle. Despite Laurie’s verging-on-profound monologue at their last dinner, they bonded again. That smug #friendshipgoals pic was probably posted on Insta after all. To turn such a promising dynamic into a bland paean to female friendship felt unearned, rushed and a little lame. Side note: why did Victoria Ratliff awkwardly pretend not to recognise Kate from a baby shower? And why was this never mentioned again?3. Top talent wastedView image in fullscreenSadly underused … Lalisa Manobal (AKA Lisa from Blackpink) as Mook and Tayme Thapthimthong as Gaitok.Photograph: HBOPlaying health mentor Mook in her acting debut, Lalisa Manobal (AKA Lisa from Blackpink) was given laughably little to do. All series, her main job was telling lovelorn colleague Gaitok (Tayme Thapthimthong) to toughen up. He eventually obeyed but it was hardly a meaty role for the A-list K-popper.Similarly underutilised was Christian Friedel as ass-kissing resort manager Fabian. He’s worked with Michael Haneke and played Rudolf Höss in The Zone Of Interest. However, his main jobs here were simpering, bad singing and a pratfall into a pond.4. Predictable paternity twistRick Hatchett (Walton Goggins) returned from Bangkok a new man and was sweetly reunited with girlfriend Chelsea (Aimee Lou Wood). That is, until owner Jim Hollinger (Scott Glenn) arrived back at the hotel – criminal mastermind Rick was hardly lying low – and confronted him again. This time, he told Rick that his late mother had been “a slut, drunk and liar” and that his father was “no saint”.In a fit of rage – if only counsellor Amrita (Shalini Peiris) had been able to fit him in – Rick snatched the old git’s gun and shot him. Cue the revelation that Jim hadn’t killed Rick’s father. He actually was Rick’s father. It was the stuff of Greek tragedy (or The Empire Strikes Back) but might have been more impactful if everyone hadn’t seen it coming weeks ago.5. Gaitok went to the dark sideViolence can turn a good man bad but the narrative journey of sweet-natured Gaitok was still dispiriting to witness. His Buddhist faith meant he was reluctant to hurt people and was on the verge of quitting his security guard post. However, urged on by Mook and bloodthirsty Sritala Hollinger (Patravadi Mejudhon), he eventually took up arms and gunned down Rick.Not only did he shoot an unarmed man in the back but Rick was carrying an innocent victim who may well have still been alive. Gaitok was duly promoted to become Sritala’s bodyguard and seemingly won Mook’s heart. However, his “happy” ending came at the cost of his humanity. Sad to see.6. Pace was all over the placeThe debut season in Hawaii was a tight six episodes long. The Sicily-set sequel grew to a seven-parter. The third season was the biggest so far at eight episodes, with the longest finale – a feature-length 90 minutes. All that extra screen time only led to saggy plotting and pacing.The series dawdled and dragged. Several episodes seemed to keep the storylines in a holding pattern. We got repetitive scenes of a spaced-out Jason Isaacs, Aimee Lou Wood pleading with Walton Goggins, and the three women giving side eye. Compared with the first two, this season lacked drive. The narrative stumbled around like it had been slyly popping Victoria’s lorazepam.7. Chelsea’s death was hard to takeView image in fullscreenSubtle clues to her fate … Chelsea wearing her Stay Gold jewellery.Photograph: HBOWith her Mancunian bluntness, wide-eyed optimism and, yes, much talked-about teeth, Chelsea has been arguably the most likable character all series – and actor Aimee Lou Wood its breakout star. Hence it was devastating when the hippy-dippy dreamer got caught in the crossfire and flown home in a body bag.There have been subtle clues about her fate, from Stay Gold jewellery (Johnny Cade’s dying words inThe Outsiders) to recurring serpent symbolism. After being held at gunpoint and bitten by a snake, she predicted that “bad luck comes in threes”. But we still weren’t ready for it when she was struck by a stray bullet.She’d told Rick to “embrace their fate” (“Amor Fati” was the episode title) and said “if a bad thing happens to you, it happens to me”. They wanted to be together forever. Now they were. The cursed couple ended up among the water lilies, looking up at the sky, finally at peace. It’s just a shame Chelsea had to die, rather than one of the many more deserving hotel guests.8. Didoff-set tensions affect on-screen quality?News emerged last week of an alleged fallout between show runner Mike White and composer Cristóbal Tapia de Veer, along with other rumoured behind-the-scenes clashes. Did such tensions ultimately affect the quality of this third season?The Emmy-winning theme music, such a key component of the first two series, didn’t have nearly the same impact this time. De Veer hinted that unhappy compromises were made. Actor Jason Isaacs compared the intense seven-month shoot to Lord of the Flies after relations soured between some of the cast. You can’t help wondering if this discord made it on to the screen. Compared to its superlative predecessors, this season felt uneven and lacking joy.9. Villains got off scot-freeJennifer Coolidge’s legions of fans never got to see her killer get his comeuppance. Leathery lech Greg AKA Gary (Jon Gries) managed to hush up having his ex murdered. He was last seen watching girlfriend Chloe (Charlotte Le Bon) recruit a new young stud to fulfil his voyeuristic Freudian fantasies.Valentin (Arnas Fedaravičius) and his Russian accomplices also got away with armed robbery. We glimpsed them targeting a new group of gullible tourists to fleece. Nasty old Jim was the only one wrong ’un to be punished. Unjust and annoying.10. Belinda becoming Tanya was bittersweetView image in fullscreenAnyone has their price … Belinda (Natasha Rothwell) with her son Zion (Nicholas Duvernay).Photograph: HBO“Can’t I be rich for five fucking minutes?” She’s been the moral centre and fan favourite for two seasons. Now we saw that even saintly Belinda (Natasha Rothwell) has her price. Her savvy son Zion (Nicholas Duvernay) haggled up her hush money payout from a measly $100K to a whopping $5m. No wonder Belinda spat out her whisky in shock.There was a neat circularity to it when Belinda pulled the same trick on Pornchai (Dom Hetrakul) as Tanya McQuoid once did to her – saying her “circumstances had changed” and ruthlessly reneging on their business proposal. Yes, money corrupts but it was still heartbreaking to watch her wave goodbye as they sailed off into the sunset. Belinda deserves it. But perhaps poor Pornchai does too.

It's a bit muchRachel AroestiTue 8 Apr 2025 09.02 EDTLast modified on Tue 8 Apr 2025 09.47 EDTShareRemember the girl boss? She burst in to the zeitgeist in the 2010s, riding the era’s nebulous wave of female empowerment and proving that women could become incredibly rich by helming capitalist empires – just like men. Branding-wise, she had some issues: beginning with that infantile moniker and peaking with a series oftoxic workplace scandals. This – combined with the fact that celebrating corporate greed took on an even more nauseating hue post-pandemic – means we haven’t heard from her for quite a while.Yet this new podcast from Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, is alive with the spirit of the girl boss. Confessions of a Female Founder with Meghan sees the royal quiz ladies on how they made their fortunes: starting with Whitney Wolfe Herd, the founder and CEO of the dating app Bumble, who was once the world’s youngest self-made female billionaire. Meghan has a vested interest in such success stories – hot on the heels of herNetflix series, With Love, Meghan, the self-styled lifestyle guru is launching a business of her own.As eversells preserves, teas and those dried flowers she sprinkled on a vegetable frittata in the TV show, much to her guest Mindy Kaling’s amusement. But As ever is more than a money-making scheme: it is, as our host puts it on this podcast, “an extension of my essence”.Of course, one cannot extend one’s essence alone: Meghan – who, after that eye-watering “you know I’m Sussex now” retort to Kaling in her TV series, seems to be going fully mononymous – needs advice. She gets it from Wolfe Herd – one of her “closest friends” – who tells her not to sweat the small stuff (Meghan is very concerned about the packaging of her products) and that enormous amounts of money don’t make you happy.More important than advice, however, is flattery – and Confessions of a Female Founder is jam-packed with compliments. As per Wolfe Herd, Meghan’s observations are “beautiful” and she’s “an amazing hostess” whose home is filled with “love and cosiness and yumminess”. Meghan is equally well versed in the art of sycophancy. The day Bumble’s stock hit an all-time low, Wolfe Herd wrote a letter to herself about all the things she was grateful for. “I think it’s a really good reminder to people that you have to take stock of how you measure your happiness,” she concludes. “It’s amazing how evolved you are,” replies Meghan. If the love-in doesn’t turn your stomach, one of the richest women in the world telling us there’s more to life than our net worth may well do.The vibe is predictably fawning but, on a technical level, Meghan is a decent interviewer, especially compared with some celebrity podcasters: she keeps the conversation on track and is conscientious with her follow-up questions. Yet even when her guests do open up – here Wolfe Herd discusses the terrifying press attention that accompanied herdecision to file a lawsuitagainst her former employer Tinder for sexual harassment – Meghan very rarely reciprocates. You can understand why she’s guarded – but the problem is that personal disclosure fuels parasocial relationships, which are podcasting’s primary draw.While Meghan’s previous podcast, 2022’s Archetypes, was part-interview, part-explanatory lecture, there is far less narration here. This is a good thing, because it’s when Meghan starts addressing the listener directly that things get off-puttingly overwrought. Sentences tend to be laden with maximum emphasis. “Launching a business, it can be …sooverwhelming. Even with the best of teams – hoo!” she loudly exhales in mock anxiety. “It will keep you up at night!” Maybe this really is Meghan’s natural speaking style, but it’s one that to British ears soundsjust a taddisingenuous.Sitting in a podcast studio talking to wealthy women who worship her is clearly far more Meghan’s scene than enduring the remorselessly vicious press and strange, alienating traditions of these shores. And who can blame her? Confessions of a Female Founder is far from a gladiatorial grilling and it’s hardly a manual of specific, constructive business advice; it’s simply an effusive chinwag between two like-minded pals that may as well have taken place behind a deluxe set of closed doors.Explore more on these topicsPodcastsMeghan, the Duchess of SussexPodcastingreviewsShareReuse this content"

It made headlines because he was the guy who “could throw that speedball by you / Make you look like a fool, boy” in Bruce Springsteen’s 1984 hit Glory Days – one of the numerous ordinary people that have proved inspirational in pop.The old crowd from the Jersey Shore still make their way into Springsteen’s songs: the centrepiece of his huge stadium shows these last couple of years has been a solo acoustic number called Last Man Standing, which appeared in his 2020 album Letter to You. It was written following the death of George Theiss, in 2018. As a teenage boy, Theiss had been courting Springsteen’s sister Virginia, but ended up instead in a band with the young Bruce – the Castiles. When Theiss died, it left Springsteen the last living member of his high school band, and he composed a requiem for his friend: “Faded pictures in an old scrapbook / Faded pictures that somebody took / When you were hard and young and proud / Backed against the wall, running raw and loud.”The Beatles – Lovely Rita (traffic warden Meta Davies)It’s no fun being a traffic warden. In Liverpool they’ve been given bodycams; in Essex there is a campaign to raise awareness of the human cost of abuse for those who give out parking tickets. So Meta Davies got away lightly when she penalised Paul McCartney. “It was in the spring of 1967 that I ticketed Paul’s car,” she said. “He was on a meter showing excess, so I gave him a 10-shilling ticket.” After noting her unusual name, McCartney asked if he might use it in a song. When she heard the song – in which the singer “took her home and tried to make her” – Davies admitted, “it makes me blush.”The Knack – My Sharona (real estate agent Sharona Alperin)“For over 35 years, Sharona has held a coveted position in the upper echelon of Los Angeles area real estate,” observes Sharon Alperin’s website,mysharona.com. She gets to call it that because she was the Sharona written about by Doug Fieger of the Knack. He wrote the song about his infatuation with her – she was in her late teens, he nine years older – though they also had a relationship and she appears on the cover of the single. Fortunately, there were no recriminations – though they went their separate ways, they remained friends until his death in 2010.View image in fullscreen‘It’s eternal’ … Heloisa Eneida Menezes Paes Pinto on the song she inspired, The Girl From Ipanema.Photograph: ABACA/ShutterstockDe Moraes/Jobim – The Girl From Ipanema (local teen Heloísa Eneida Menezes Paes Pinto)Back in 1962 Vinicius de Moraes would see the same girl pass by the Veloso cafe on the Ipanema beachfront in Rio all the time. She was 17-year-old Heloísa Eneida Menezes Paes Pinto, and when De Moraes and Antonio Carlos Jobim were asked to write for a musical, she became one of their subjects. She was, De Moraes said, “a golden teenage girl, a mixture of flower and mermaid, full of light and grace, the sight of whom is also sad, in that she carries with her, on her route to the sea, the feeling of youth that fades, of the beauty that is not ours alone.” And what did she think? “It’s eternal. Whenever I listen, I remember my past, my younger days,”she told the Guardian in 2012. “Ipanema in 1962 was a great place. You never saw aggression. Everyone wanted to fall in love.”View image in fullscreenDelilah DiCrescenzo, who inspired the song Hey There Delilah arrives with Plain White T’s at the 50th Grammy awards.Photograph: Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagicPlain White Ts – Hey There Delilah (student Delilah DiCrescenzo)Tom Higgenson of Plain White Ts met Delilah DiCrescenzo when she was a student at Columbia University. Besotted, he told her would write a song about her – even though she had a boyfriend – which he did. Several years later, in 2007, Hey There Delilah became a huge hit. By that time, DiCrescenzo was a star in her own right as an international athlete. The experience didn’t seem to scar her: she attended the Grammys in 2008 as Higgenson’s guest. The irony is that these days Higgenson doesn’t have a Wikipedia page, but DiCrescenzo does. Fame is fickle.The Clash – Stay Free (bank robber Robin Crocker)At school in south London, Mick Jones had been friends and co-conspirators with a lad called Robin Crocker. One of them went on to join the Clash, and the other went on to rob banks. On the second Clash album, Jones wrote a nostalgic reverie for his pal, and his joy on hearing of his release from prison: “And if you’re in the Crown tonight / Have a drink on me / But go easy / Step lightly / Stay free.” Croker was moved. “Somebody once said to me it’s the most outstanding heterosexual male-on-male love song, and there is a lot of truth in that,”Crocker told the Guardian in 2008. “Unfortunately, I didn’t Stay Free. I did a wages snatch in Stockholm and got banged up again.”View image in fullscreen‘I’m flattered’ … Danny Nedelko, inspiration for Idles song of the same name.Photograph: Andy Catlin/AlamyIdles – Danny Nedelko (musical peer Danny Nedelko)Danny Nedelko moved to England from Ukraine, aged 15, ending up in Bristol and befriending Joe Talbot, who would co-foundIdles. When Idles released their second album, Joy As an Act of Resistance, they were still a cult band, and Nedelko was their mate in an another, less successful band. By the end of that album campaign, he was the subject of lines roared by thousands of people at every Idles gig: “My blood brother is an immigrant / A beautiful immigrant.” Fortunately, he was not disgruntled by being made a political poster boy, pronouncing himself “very flattered and humbled”.The Kinks – David Watts (promoter David Watts)Perhaps the most double-edged song about a real person – but that’s Ray Davies’ writing for you. The Kinks’ staple – later recorded by the Jam – was named for a promoter in Rutland with whom the Kinks had dealings, and who had a crush on Dave Davies. Hence David Watts being “so gay and fancy free”. But it’s also homoerotic in itself, and Ray later said it was also inspired by a real-life schoolfriend, whom he wouldn’t name because they were still in touch. And the envy, the desperation, to be that boy is palpable: “And when I lie on my pillow at night / I dream I could fight like David Watts / And lead the school team to victory / Take my exams and pass the lot.”Explore more on these topicsPop and rockThe BeatlesBruce SpringsteenJazzIdlesThe KinksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Taken together they build a miraculous lens through which to view human experience, both the truly disturbing and the achingly beautiful.”The shortlisted titles are slim, with four coming in at under 200 pages, including Latronico’s Perfection. The novel, about a millennial expat couple living in Berlin, “transcends its satire of 2010s hipsterdom through the depth of Latronico’s sociological observations”, writes Thomas McMullanin the Guardian. “This chronicle of contemporary Berlin is strongest in its articulation of how a certain kind of globalisation dislocates us from our surroundings.”Small Boatby Vincent Delecroix, translated from French by Helen Stevenson, was also selected. The book was written in three weeks, and is based on recordings from a real event in November 2021, when a dinghy carrying migrants from France to the UK capsized in the Channel, causing the death of 27 people on board.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

The film, adapted from the 2015 memoir by Tom Michell, uses the political turmoil of Argentina in 1976 as a backdrop for the personal transformation of an English teacher at a boys’ school. Michell (Steve Coogan) is an idle curmudgeon when he rescues an oil-drenched Magellan penguin from a beach in Uruguay in an attempt to impress an attractive woman. She leaves, but he is stuck with the bird, whom he duly names Juan Salvador, and who thaws him out sufficiently to bond with students and colleagues, process past trauma and rekindle a political idealism.Naturally, there are hurdles for Juan Salvador to clear before the interspecies friendship spreads its wings. Michell tries a range of methods to ditch his new buddy, only for him to waddle back so determinedly that Michell reluctantly transports the penguin across the Argentine border and installs him on the terrace at the college. A perception shift on the charms of his new roommate is aided by an influx of visitors of all ages. Staff and students alike delight in feeding him sprats and – more significantly – in quieter moments are drawn to unburden themselves.In his memoir, Michell mused on the magnetism of a silent yet sentient audience. “As with any good pastor or patrician, Juan Salvador was such a good listener, patiently absorbing everything that was said to him, from observations about the weather to secrets of the heart. He never once interrupted. He looked people straight in the eye and always paid such close attention to what was said that his guests were inclined to talk to him on equal terms.”The film is the latest in a remarkably long-legged subgenre: man in or approaching middle age experiences powerful emotional awakening thanks to an animal whom they initially kept at leash’s length. Unconventional riffs on the subgenre plunge us into the relationship once it has already hit its stride, but for those that start with teething troubles, their secret is stealth psychological power. While it is tempting to focus on the surface charms of, say, Channing Tatum as Jackson confronting the cost of his military service with the help of a hound in 2022’s Dog, or the ominous setup of Nicolas Cage as Robin retiring to the woods with a virtuoso truffle porker in Pig (2021), these films may reveal more about how men are taught to handle themselves than meets the eye.The Penguin Lessons review – Steve Coogan and feathered friend dip into 70s ArgentinaRead more“For some males, the world doesn’t feel really safe to connect to,” says Dr Chris Blazina, psychologist and co-author of a 2019 study,Do Men Underreport and Mask Their Emotional Attachment to Animal Companions? The Influence of Precarious Masculinity on Men’s Bonds with Their Dogs. Blazina believes many men find their attachment to their dog to be more secure than their closest human relationships, particularly in middle-age and beyond.He throws into relief how vital a relationship like this can be by saying thata lack of social connection has been found to be as dangerous as smoking 15 cigarettes a day. “We need connection not just to survive growing up but throughout our lives to flourish as whole human beings,” he says, advancing the theory that a loving relationship with a pet can be a lifeline to men otherwise inclined towards emotional detachment. “They can turn to animal companions as a friend or family member, and it helps. It’s not the complete package, but it sustains some men in a way where they don’t give up on connecting.” Men are susceptible to a close attachment with an animal, thinks Blazina, because it is a relationship that can blossom in private, while in public they can underplay its importance.View image in fullscreenPet rescue … Keanu Reeves as John Wick.Photograph: 87ELEVEN/AllstarBack in movieland, Tom, Jackson and Robin find that in the non-judgmental space provided by their pets of choice, suppressed feelings surface and they end up more fully inhabiting their emotions. This leads them to connect more authentically and deeply with the people around them. As Blazina says: “We’re hardwired to connect. Sometimes, as human beings, we do such a good job of putting up barriers that say we don’t need that. And with dogs, it can be a little cleaner.”The relationship between men and dogs has a special status in cinema and the wider culture, whether powering the entire John Wick franchise (2014-), exposing the true colours of humans in The Call of the Wild (1997) or showing a devotion that not even death can halt as in the tear-jerker Hachi: A Dog’s Tale (2009). It is not always the case that a canine outlives his master: indeed, their demise is so often weaponised to help a repressed hero confront grief that the website,Does the dog die?, was created to help sensitive viewers navigate the cinematic landscape. As Rudyard Kipling put it in his 1909 poem, The Power of the Dog, “Brothers and sisters, I bid you beware / Of giving your heart to a dog to tear.”Dogs tend to turn up in soulful dramas or family films. Primates, on the other hand, are infantilised as naughty children, as in Monkey Trouble (1994) and (to verge into TV) Friends (1994-2004), or have their humanoid features exploited to position them as a menace to civilisation, such as in King Kong (1933) or Planet of the Apes (1968) and their many spin-offs and reboots.Creature-features, like the above, may introduce the beasts as brutes but eventually come round to the idea that man is a greater menace and animals have overlooked depths. This chimes with a reflection expressed by Michell towards the end of his memoir. Having spent much time meeting people on his travels around South America, he realises: “I would never have opened my heart to them, as I had to Juan Salvador, and the same was true of all those who encountered him. How was it that a penguin brought such comfort and tranquility to the people whose lives he touched? Why did they go to his terrace and bare their souls to him as though they had known him for a lifetime, treating him like a real friend who could be relied upon in adversity?”While the mysteries of life-changing attachments to animals cannot be boiled down in one article, there is an infectious quality to this subgenre of cinema. Watching Coogan slowly stripping back his character’s protective plumage to expose a sincere and vulnerable man, creates emotional space for the viewer to feel as Michell does. It may occupy the opposite role to Juan Salvador (talking rather than listening) but, nonetheless, cinema can provide a safe, sounding board for our buried emotions.Explore more on these topicsFilmSteve CooganMenAnimalsPetsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

How did he bounce back?Tue 8 Apr 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 8 Apr 2025 10.45 EDTShareMark Hoppus is prodding at his phone, attempting to find a photograph of the swimming pool at his mid-century modernist home in Beverly Hills. “The house was built in 1962. It has this really cool circular design – the whole house is a semi-circle, built around the pool, and the pool kind of mimics the semi-circle of the house itself, then it goes out into a normal pool shape,” he says. “So it looks like a dick. I have a dick-shaped swimming pool,” he nods.There is more prodding. For a 53-year-old cancer survivor, he is oddly boyish – and not merely in his enthusiasm for swimming pools that look like genitalia: his skin is unlined; his hair stands up in a vertiginous, spiky quiff; he is wearing a pair of Vans skate shoes. “I’ll look it up on Google Maps so you can see it … let’s go to satellite view. It’s a dick that can be seen from outer space – here, see!” He hands me the phone triumphantly. “There’s the head and there’s the shaft.” He has a point – it does, indeed, look a bit like a crudely rendered penis and testicles.The whole business of the phallic swimming pool in Beverly Hills seems … well, very Mark Hoppus. A quick internet search reveals a home in his street would set you back the best part of $15m (£12m), which underlines just how successful his band Blink‑182 have been. They have sold something like 50m albums; Hoppus is in London not for promotional reasons, but because he is auctioning a Banksy from his modern art collection at Sotheby’s. (It sold last month for £4.3m, with some of the proceeds going to medical charities and the California Fire Foundation.)View image in fullscreenPop-punk art … Hoppus sold Banksy’s Crude Oil (Vettriano) last month.Photograph: Tristan Fewings/Getty Images for Sotheby’sThe fact that he noticed – and seems delighted – that his swimming pool looks a bit like a penis fits entirely with the band’s take on pop-punk, which amped up the pop quotient and the goofy sense of humour that, as he points out, underpinned American punk from the start. After all, its founding fathers weren’t the Sex Pistols, screaming about anarchy and abortion, but the wilfully cartoonish Ramones.Blink-182 seemed intent on taking everything a stage further. They titled their albums Enema of the State and Take Off Your Pants and Jacket; they had songs called Dick Lips, Fuck a Dog and Dysentery Gary. The video for their breakthrough hit,What’s My Age Again?, featured Hoppus and his bandmates, Tom DeLonge andTravis Barker, running through the streets of Los Angeles apparently naked, their genitals pixelated out. Even their peers on the punk scene decried them as sophomoric: “The more serious, political bands didn’t want to play shows with us because we were kind of like a joke.”Naked ambition … watch the video for What’s My Age Again?.In truth, there was always a more serious side toBlink-182. There were songs about suicide, depression and loneliness, about the psychological impact of divorce on children; they were just easy to miss amid the gross-out gags. Something similar is true of Hoppus’s book, Fahrenheit-182: A Memoir, co-authored by the journalist and writer Dan Ozzi. It’s hugely entertaining and very well written, in a wisecracking, smart-ass style – you certainly don’t want for tales of hijinks on the road – but there is a striking amount of darkness at its core, even before you get to Hoppus’s 2021 diagnosis with an aggressive form of lymphoma.He grew up in Ridgecrest, California, a small town in the Mojave desert near the air force base where his father worked as a rocket scientist. Ridgecrest sounds like hard work: so hot in summer that the water would evaporate out of the toilet in the family home; subjected to a constant, grit-laden wind that sandblasts the paint off houses. Nonetheless, Hoppus appears to have been happy enough – until his parents divorced, an event that seems to have lit the blue touchpaper on a series of chronic mental health problems, from depression and anxiety to a germophobia that became so pronounced that he took to holding his breath when meeting fans.He says it wasn’t just the upheaval of the divorce, or the fact that his mother subsequently took up with a physically abusive boyfriend; it was that his parents made no attempt to get on afterwards. “For decades, they didn’t speak to one another and it was awful growing up,” he says. “I always felt like I was put in between because they wouldn’t speak to one another and I had to argue both sides, protect my dad from my mom, protect my mom from my dad, protect my sister from both of them. I felt like I was put in that position – maybe I wasn’t, but I felt like I was.View image in fullscreenGodless miscreant skate rats … Mark Hoppus(centre)with Tom DeLonge(right)and Blink-182’s then drummer, Scott Raynor, backstage in 1996.Photograph: Jim Steinfeldt/Getty Images“My personality became the mediator, the guy who tries to make everyone happy and pull everything back and make everyone copacetic. That’s what I love about playing bass guitar – it’s that thing between the drums and the guitar that brings everything together. So that personality has been great and it’s been fucking terrible. I still feel like it falls to me to deal with things, to try and figure it out, when maybe I should let nature take its course. I worry that I insert myself into situations where I don’t necessarily have any business.”Salvation of a kind came when he discovered the local skateboarding and punk rock scenes. You don’t have to be an expert in psychology to work out that Hoppus wasn’t looking for a portal to alternative culture so much as an extended family. “A total sense of community,” he agrees. “I didn’t belong to any cliques in school, any sports teams or cool kids’ clubs, and then skateboarding came around. It was like: ‘Do your own shit, be part of us. We welcome all the outcasts, come be part of our little fucked-up crew.’ I loved that. Same with punk rock: ‘We are the haven for the outcasts and the downtrodden – bring us your losers, because we’re all in this together.’”He had been “a good kid” – although there is something telling about the fact that the one time he got in trouble was for singing “jingle bells, Batman smells” during a nativity play – but school swiftly went by the wayside, in favour of life as a “godless miscreant skate rat”. “We told every adult we encountered to fuck off. Overall, I’d say we were more shitheads than dicks, but I was one of the shitheads in question, so maybe I’m biased,” he says.View image in fullscreen‘We are the haven for the outcasts and the downtrodden’ … Hoppus, DeLonge and Travis Barker(on drums)in 2001.Photograph: MediaNews Group/Contra Costa Times/Getty ImagesHis mother seems to have had the patience of a saint, during his miscreant skate-rat years and when Blink-182 formed, after Hoppus unwillingly went to college in San Diego, met DeLonge on his first day and almost immediately dropped out. When she attended their gigs, Hoppus frequently pointed her out the crowd with the words: “That’s my mom – she gives great blowjobs.”He says he loved their penniless early days more than any other part of their career; in an era when artists talk about the deleterious effect of touring on their mental health, there is something uplifting about the glee with which he describes building an audience by touring grotty clubs in a knackered van, perpetually skint and unwashed. “Totally the most fun,” he says. “I mean, it’s the fucking worst, trying to find the next venue or a fucking shower – the quest for a shower is insane. We would go days with no shower and you’re in the gnarly heat, playing in the middle of the day in 92% humidity in some parking lot in New Jersey. But skateboarding, playing in a band, driving down freeways shooting fireworks at each other – what more could you hope for in your early 20s?”They grabbed the opportunity for wider success with both hands, committing punk’s cardinal sin of signing to a major label – one that didn’t seem to take them terribly seriously. When Blink-182 took their album to the record company’s offices to play it to the staff, Hoppus recalls, everyone except the band members quickly left.View image in fullscreen‘I thought: you know what? I’ve had a pretty awesome life.’Photograph: Scarlet Page/The GuardianBut, as it turned out, Blink-182 were the right band for the moment. They jumped at the chance to appear on the era’s biggest pop shows; they were never off MTV’s Total Request Live. “It was completely dominated by Britney Spears, ‘NSync, the Backstreet Boys, and we showed up looking like these people who should be kicked out the building, but they werestokedwe were there. It was fun, like all your dreams coming true. My mom would see us on TV, you know: that’s our band, holy shit! There were years that felt like that.”Then it all went wrong. Hoppus and DeLonge fell out. Increasingly uncomfortable with their image as “the naked band”, DeLonge kept leaving and rejoining: there were breakups, reformations; their records started selling hundreds of thousands, rather than millions. In contrast to the showerless years of penury, it reads like misery, until it’s thrown into sharp relief. In June 2021, towards the end of a Covid lockdown, Hoppus discovered a lump on his shoulder that turned out to be diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.The book pulls no punches about his terror of his diagnosis and of the horror of his ultimately successful treatment: at one point, he was injected with a chemotherapy drug so strong that his wife was advised not to use the same toilet as him for three days, lest a splash of it get on her skin. When I mention this, he reaches for his phone again and plays me a voice note he recorded at the time: him singing an improvised sea shanty that goes: ‘I don’t want to go to the place where they pump me full of poison / And then walk around for a week wishing I could die.”“I really thought I was going to die,” he says when it finishes. “And, in a way, it absolutely was so freeing. I’d spent my whole life hypervigilant, thinking: what’s the worst thing that could happen? And, oh, it’s here now, I’m dealing with it and it still sucks.All the small things: how Blink 182’s Travis Barker became the most influential person in musicRead more“The physical pain and exhaustion of the chemo, mixed with the steroids and all the other drugs, just crushed me for months on end. But it brought back friendships that I hadn’t had in years. It healed my friendship with Tom: from day one, he was like: ‘What do you need? I’m there.’ In that friendship and the love and support of people around me, I thought: you know what? I’ve had a pretty awesome life.”The wider world found out about his illness when Hoppus accidentally sent a photo of himself on a chemo drip to his Instagram. His brain fogged by medication, he had thought he was sending it to a family WhatsApp group. “The best mistake I’ve ever made, by far,” he says. “I suffered alone in silence for so long because I thought that, once it came out I had cancer, people’s opinions of me would change. Just generally in life, I felt that when people get sick or injured in some way they get left behind, like: ‘OK, you’re over here now in a different category.’ But I was wrong.”He was inundated with “gifts, kind thoughts, people sending whatever”. He says he was particularly moved by fans who had gone through cancer sending him videos of themselves singing old Blink-182 songs to him. “All these people who were fighters and winners, who overcame their cancer,” he marvels. “That helped. I was finally able to say: ‘Yeah. I’m fucking scared, but, you know, I try to put on a brave face.’”View image in fullscreen‘It’s not just dick jokes, it’s not just serious music, it’s not just lasers’ … Blink-182 headlining Coachella in 2023, after Hoppus recovered from cancer.Photograph: Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images for CoachellaThe book ends with Hoppus cancer-free and a reunited Blink‑182 unexpectedly headlining Coachella, a last-minute replacement for the R&B auteurFrank Ocean. On arrival at the site, Hoppus noted to his horror that the average age of the audience was “younger than I was when we started Blink”: he assumed that people who had bought tickets expecting see Frank Ocean wouldn’t hang around for a pop-punk band twice their age. Instead, 150,000 people turned up to see them. LikeOlivia Rodrigo, the former Disney star who has pursued a pop-punk direction on both her multiplatinum albums, they were twentysomethings who knew Blink-182 because they had watched them on Total Request Live as kids. It was a kind of vindication of their decision to jump at pop success 25 years ago.Perhaps, Hoppus suggests, these fans were also drawn by the fact they would get something unique. “It’s not just one thing. It’s not just dick jokes, it’s not just serious music, it’s not just lasers,” he says, happily. “What other band can have lasers and pyro and fireworks, songs about divorce that make people cry, and also talk about the way buttholes taste between songs?”Fahrenheit-182: A Memoir by Mark Hoppus with Dan Ozzi is published today (Sphere, £25).

Just 16% of ban attempts were made by parents, while 5% were brought forward by individual library users.“These demands to remove and restrict books and other library materials are not the result of any grassroots or popular sentiment,” read the ALA’s 2025 State of America’sLibrariesreport, published on Monday. “The majority of book censorship attempts are now originating from well-funded, organised groups and movements long dedicated to curbing access to information and ideas.”Many of the organisations leading the book censorship movement are so-called “parental rights” groups – most prominently Moms for Liberty. This group hasstrong tiesto the Republican Party and has been labelled “extremist”.“They aren’t always moms, they don’t always have kids, and they definitely don’t care about ‘liberty’ for everyone else,”wrote theAmerican Civil Liberties Union’s Paul Bowers in late 2023.The share of censorship attempts made by organised campaigns has risen drastically in recent years. Between 2001 and 2020, pressure groups, board members, administrators and elected officials challenged an average of 46 titles per year. In 2024, these groups challenged 4,190 titles.The most common reasons for challenges were claims of obscenity, the inclusion of LGBTQ+ themes or characters, and the discussion of race, racism and social justice.“The movement to ban books is not a movement of parents, but a movement of partisans who seek to limit our freedom to read,” said Deborah Caldwell-Stone, director of the ALA’s office for intellectual freedom.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

The most-challenged book was All Boys Aren’t Blue: A Memoir Manifesto by George M Johnson, about the author’s experience as a queer Black man growing up in New Jersey and Virginia.Last August, Moms for Libertyfiled a petitionto a court in New York seeking an injunction to remove All Boys Aren’t Blue from a school library. The book “contains numerous profanities and lewd content” and “several instances of pornography including sexual molestation”, read the petition.The second most-challenged title was Gender Queer: A Memoir by Maia Kobabe, while the tied third most-challenged were The Bluest Eye by Morrison and The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky. Other books on the top 10 list include Looking for Alaska by Green, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl by Jesse Andrews and Sold by Patricia McCormick.The number of attempts to censor library books and other materials fell between 2023 and 2024, from 1,247 to 821, resulting in a fall in the total number of books challenged from 9,021 to 5,813.The ALA said that the fall in documented censorship could be due to under-reporting or cases of “censorship by exclusion” which occurs when, for example, library workers place books in less accessible areas of the library due to fear of controversy.Documented censorship attempts may also have fallen because recent legislative restrictions on books containing “controversial themes” have resulted in those titles being removed from libraries, according to the ALA.Explore more on these topicsBooksLibrariesCensorshipnewsShareReuse this content"

The mural will now be preserved byHeritageof London Trust (Holt).Completed in 1958, it is thought to be the best kept example of Mitchell’s early work still in situ. It was made by combining 13 bespoke panels that Mitchell carved and filled in with resin.Holt will relocate the mural in a primary school within the Brooklands Park estate where the community centre stands.Nicola Stacey, the director of Holt, said: “The school is in the same estate and of the same period, so it’s an ideal transition for it. We’re really keen that it has maximum visibility and in a school the children will experience it every day. It will be a remarkable thing.”Brooklands Park was seen as a leading example of aspirational postwar housing, with green space and tasteful design. TheTwentieth Century Society, a preservation group, has backed local opposition to the plans to knock down the village hall and in 2022 launched an unsuccessful attempt to have the mural listed by Historic England.Edmund Hall, an architect and artist who creates banners, including for hislongtime collaborator Jeremy Deller, was part of the campaign to retain the mural. He said he was pleased it was being retained and felt its original home should be too.He said: “Locally there is some satisfaction that the mural is ‘saved’, but I still feel it is a bit like demolishing the Sistine Chapel and saving the Last Judgment.”Mitchell’s work has been threatened repeatedly in recent years but the Twentieth Century Society managed to get15 works added to the national register, making him “one of the most recognised and respected muralists of the period”, according to the organisation.He also created the facade of Liverpool’s Metropolitan Cathedral, and 30 April marks what would have been the artist’s 100th birthday.Mitchell, who trained at the Royal College of Art and worked forLondoncounty council as a design consultant, produced about 100 works of art throughout the capital, many of which were placed in postwar housing estates with the intention of brightening them up.Holt is restoringtwo other Mitchell murals, located in housing blocks in Lewisham, south London. Stacey said those responsible for contemporary building projects should take inspiration from the postwar period when Mitchell was active and include artworks, with commissions ideally going to local artists.She said: “The era Mitchell’s work emerged in was idealistic but also incredibly inspirational. Today the developers putting up residential blocks should be integrating art into their schemes, commissioning emerging artists and not doing it as an afterthought.“The legacy of people like Mitchell proves that not only are they wonderful for people living near them, but they also instil a sense of pride.”Explore more on these topicsArtHeritageLondonEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Then Lowry wrote back to him saying: ‘I think I’ve charged you too much. Can I give you another one as well?’ So Grandpa got two Lowrys for his £10.”Going to the Mill, the painting that caught Arthur Wallace’s eye, is now coming to auction for the first time since that generous exchange, after the Wallace family finally decided to part with it.The rare early work, which is to be sold by Lyon & Turnbull in London at the beginning of May, is a preliminary depiction of what would become Lowry’s classic subject, said Simon Hucker, a fine art specialist at the auctioneer.“That mill and the chimney behind, the domed roof and then the wall of windows – he will paint that view for the next three decades. This is his subject and the little figures all scurrying towards a door, like water pouring towards a drain.”What is especially rare is for a painting such as this to have had only one owner, Hucker added. A work of similar size and date sold from HSBC’s collection last year went for £1.2m, and the estimate for Going to the Mill is £700,000 to £1m.View image in fullscreenLS Lowry (pictured) remained in touch with the Guardian’s former literary editor, Arthur Wallace.Photograph: Robert Smithies/The GuardianAs a child, Keith Wallace ate family dinners overlooked by the Lowry. “By the time I was a lad of eight, we kept it in the dining room, so we’d see it every evening over dinner and it was probably a bit grubby by then.”It remained on his mother’s wall, “uninsured and unsecured”, until the family arranged a long-term loan to the Pallant House Gallery in Chichesterin 2013, allowing the public to view it for the first time in more than 80 years.Keith’s father sold the other work that Lowry gave to his grandfather “to pay for my two sisters’ weddings”, he said.Arthur and Lowry remained in touch in later years, and Arthur’s retirement book from the Guardian included “a nice letter from Lowry saying ‘so sorry to hear you’re retiring through ill health’,” said Keith.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was well before he was able to sell any work to any public gallery. He was very much struggling, and so we Wallaces like to think that at the very least [the sale to Arthur] gave him a bit of a boost and encouraged him to keep on painting.”Hucker said it was possible to trace the development of Lowry’s signature style from Going to the Mill. “As he went on it becomes a little bit more stylised – that famous white background with black figures on – but here you’ve still got the sooty grey background which is a little more impressionistic, a little more realistic.”The more you examine the work, the more you discover, he said. “Initially, you see this sweeping movement of the crowd and a great mass of people. But when you look more closely you see that they’re all individuals.“There’s the woman standing alone looking out at us, in the style ofSeurat, drawing the viewer into the lives of others, or the man carrying what seems like a large portfolio, who could be Lowry himself.”Lowry was immortalised in popular culture through the one-hit-wonder pop song Matchstalk Men and Matchstalk Cats and Dogs by the folk duo Brian and Michael, released in late 1977 as a tribute to the artist who had died the previous year.“But he’s much more sophisticated than that,” said Hucker. “This idea that he’s a naive painter who can’t paint any better … god, he can paint, he’s a proper impressionist. These people are not caricatures – he can give you the impression of a man with a couple of strokes at the brush. In these little tiny figures you get a lot of story, and that’s his genius.”Explore more on these topicsLS LowryPaintingArtManchesterNorth of EnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

By the end of 2011, 20,335 people diagnosed with HIV had died in the UK.The project took its inspiration from the US Aids Quilt, which was initiated in 1987 bythe American human rights activist, author and lecturer Cleve Jones. The Scottish activist Alistair Hume met Jones in San Francisco, saw the US quilt and decided to start a UK chapter, from his base in Edinburgh.After its initial outing in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the quilt was put into storage. It has been displayed since – in 2021 it was shown atthe European Aids conference at the ExCeL centre in London.View image in fullscreenThe giant quilt is made up of panels commemorating individuals who lost their lives to Aids during the 1980s and 1990s.Photograph: Jack Taylor/Getty ImagesBut it will make its first appearance at a major UK cultural institution when it is hung at Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall this summer, from 12-16 June.The fashion critic and author Charlie Porter, who helped arrange the Tate Modern exhibit, used images of the quilt in his novelNova Scotia House, and said being in its presence was a “humbling experience”.“There is a precedent of placing the quilt in iconic locations to really send the message home about HIV/Aids, and in the UK it was laid out in Hyde Park and there’s nowhere more iconic in the UK than the Turbine Hall,” he said.The US quilt was displayed for the first time on the National Mall in Washington DC, during the national march on Washington for lesbian and gay rights.Porter added: “It’s about sending a message about those lost to the Aids crisis but also to talk about HIV stigma that continues today.”The panels are all 6ft by 3ft, a size used because it represented the average size of a grave plot. Many of those who died were denied funerals: some undertakers refused to handle their bodies, while sometimes family members did not want a formal ceremony.The names on the quilt include Ray Petri, a stylist described by the Observer in 2000 as “the man who dressed a decade”. The panel in memory of Robert Fraser, an art dealer, known as “Groovy Bob”, was made by the fashion designer Bella Freud.Others are the writerBruce Chatwin, the actorDenholm Elliottand the Chariots of Fire star Ian Charleson, who wassubjected to homophobia in the theatre worldbefore his death in 1990.Siobhan Lanigan, a volunteer forthe UK Aids Memorial Quilt Partnership, said: “It’s about bringing back what the quilt was intended for; public viewing, a representation of the people who had died and an active visual voice of protest. Those people were the subject of hatred that should never be forgotten.”View image in fullscreenPeople carrying the memorial quilt at a Pride event in Whitehall, London, in 1994.Photograph: Steve Eason/Getty ImagesThe display comes at a time when warnings have been issued about US funding cuts that could exacerbate the rise of Aids in some countries.A former president of the International Aids Society voiced fears of “dramatic increases in infections, dramatic increases in death and a real loss of decades of advances” as a direct result of the decision by the US to cancel83% of its foreign aid contractsand dismantle USAID.Porter said the continuing Aids crisis and threats to funding meant things were about to “get very scary for people”. “There’s no better place to bring that to the public eye than the Turbine Hall,” he added.Karin Hindsbo, the director of Tate Modern, said: “It’s going to be an honour to show the UK Aids Memorial Quilt in the Turbine Hall. This feels like an apt place for the public to see it … The quilt is an incredible feat of creative human expression and I know our visitors are going to find it a deeply moving experience.”Explore more on these topicsAids and HIVTate ModernTurbine HallLondonHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

It is conceived in the robustly muscular style of Bourne and Mission: Impossible, and features Rami Malek as nerdy CIA intelligence analyst Charles Heller, whose wife is murdered by terrorists in London. Enraged at a lack of progress in the case and suspecting a cover-up, he blackmails his immediate superiors into training him to be an assassin (by threatening to reveal their black ops), so he can hunt his wife’s killers and whack them. His exasperated teacher is Colonel Henderson, played by Laurence Fishburne. It’s based on an 80s bestseller by Robert Littell,filmed once beforewith John Savage in the lead.There’s a bit of entertainment value: a big scene at the swimming-pool-in-the-sky bridging two skyscrapers, which the film imagines to be in Madrid rather thanits actual location in London, plus a wacky moment in which Charles has to get his smartphone out and watch a YouTube tutorial on how to pick a lock. But there is a fundamental problem concerning how ruthless Charles is supposed to be in killing his wife’s murderers in cold blood – which would compromise his relatable nice-guy status – and the final confrontation with the homicidal mastermind involves a very muddled exchange of views. Charles wishes to maintain his moral superiority, and his antagonist does not challenge him on the subject of the CIA’s own culpability over the years.As for Malek’s performance, his line readings and screen presence are very distinctive, but I have to say the moments when he has to present anguished emotion to the camera do not quite work, and feel eccentric. Holt McCallany gives an amusingly vigorous performance as the cynical agency honcho Moore.The Amateur is released on 10 April in Australia and 11 April in the UK and US.Explore more on these topicsAction and adventure filmsThrillersRami MalekLaurence FishburneFilm adaptationsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Not so forYunchan Lim, who turned 21 a couple of weeks ago in between giving concerts of the Goldbergs in the US. Maturity and youth collided intriguingly in this hot-ticket performance, his first of the work in the UK.He gave us the theme simply, if also relatively weightily, emphasising a few moments of left-hand countermelody, before springing into a first variation full of zingy trills. By Variation 5, the first real allegro, he was dazzling us, the notes rattling past but with all the internal phrasing crystal clear and none of the threads tangled. That early way of spotlighting fleeting left-hand phrases became an ongoing feature – as did a degree of playful licence, with some of the repeats played up or down an octave, sounding either music-box-like or grumbly.View image in fullscreenA kaleidoscope: Yunchan Lim performs Bach's Goldberg Variations at London's Wigmore Hall.Photograph: Darius Weinerg/Wigmore HallIt was a kaleidoscope, each variation taking a new colour and pattern formed from the possibilities of those that had gone before. It felt simultaneously spontaneous and impeccably thought through. But was he throwing a little too much at it? Especially in the later variations he seemed to be reminding us that he also loves playing Chopin and Rachmaninov; at times it felt as if he were signposting profundity. Lim certainly seems open to this work’s myriad possibilities; perhaps he will come to let the music own its subtleties a little more. He was due back for a second performance 16 hours after this one finished – it would be fascinating to know how alike they were.It didn’t really need an opener, or an encore, but we got both. First came Round and Velvety-Smooth Blend by the teenage Korean composerHanurij Lee, in which episodes of frenetic activity punctuated passages of mesmerising stillness, beautifully achieved. And, after all that Bach, it was Liszt’s Petrarch Sonnet 104 that Lim sent us out with. Frustratingly, the melody didn’t always sing to the very end of each phrase, but he had so much to say that it was riveting nonetheless.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

Featuring integrated BSL and a number of deaf actors in the cast, it’s a co-production between Polka, Hiccup theatre and Derby theatre who are collectively leading the way in creating inclusive family shows. My four-year old son, Benji, was charmed throughout, although it could do with a few more surprises – something to keep the children on their toes rather than snuggled in their seats.Writer and director Sarah Brigham hasn’t stretched the original folk story too much. It’s still about a young chick who grows convinced the sky is falling in after an acorn drops on her head. She gets all her farm friends in a bit of a panic. There’s a lot of anxious racing around, some cheerful songs led by actor and sound designer Ivan Stott and, eventually, a spot of bother with a very crafty and charming fox.The animals have been reimagined as eccentric humans, with Tim Heywood’s richly detailed costumes easily the most striking aspect of the production. Chicken Licken (Phillipa Russell) wears a bright yellow helmet with a few feathers poking out of it, Henny Penny (Laura Goulden) flutters about in a frilly apron and wash cap, and Turkey Lurkey (Stott) becomes a sleepy and forgetful old man, complete with a flat cap.View image in fullscreenSly delight … Chicken Licken.Photograph: Graeme BraidwoodThe story is told using a mixture of signing, narration and creative captions projected against some large screens dotted about Rachana Jadhav’s cardboard cut-out set. The storytelling is handled well but some of the visual elements feel a little undercooked. My son Benji spent a lot of time carefully listening to the story but not absorbing the whole show in that way that is so particular to the theatre.The puppetry is strong but fleeting. A lovely silhouette puppet show tells the story of Chicken Licken’s birth and frustrated attempts at flying. When the fox finally appears, it’s as if all the production’s theatrical magic has been channelled into a single character. The fox is represented by a puppet that is handled by two actors; one controlling his commanding hands and sly face; the other swishing his luxuriously long tale. Benji is gobsmacked and a little scared – held completely by the story for one gloriously intense, all consuming moment.AtPolka theatre, London, until 11 MayExplore more on these topicsChildren's theatrePlay timeTheatrePuppetryreviewsShareReuse this content"

As with classics of the genre such as Basic Instinct, Fatal Attraction and The Last Seduction, the plot is one that, if it offered psychological realism, would qualify as a freak tragedy. But since it’s an erotic thriller, it qualifies as a romp.Husband and wife Caleb and Celine are planning to have a child but, unbeknown to Celine, Caleb has a bit on the side, Fiona. Celine has the worst day of her life when she learns that not only is she herself infertile, but her husband has knocked up his mistress. Caleb subsequently divorces her and goes off to marry his mistress and become the perfect dad. And that’s the beginning of an incredible – in both senses – series of twists and turns too ludicrous and enjoyable to spoil here.The intriguing thing about this film is its slippery moral perspective. The film treats Caleb and Fiona as more or less the couple to root for, which is atypical; usually these films are keen to punish infidelity and reassert the primacy of the marriage bed. “I fell in love with a married man. God, it sounds terrible when I say it out loud,” Fiona muses to her gay best friend. Caleb abdicates all responsibility because the sex is so intense, marvelling: “I don’t know how to stop it.” Meanwhile Celine becomes the sorta-kinda villain of the piece, but only in the sense that she gets up to some crazy vengeance. The film doesn’t seem to judge her for going wildly off the deep end. It’s a little like the great tragic operas: why moralise when it’s so much more fun to watch the world burn?But directors these days just aren’t given the same sorts of budgets that the likes of Basic Instinct commanded during the bonkbuster’s 1990s heyday. This has its pros and cons. We don’t get the premium locations and glossy designer magazine sheen. Liz Fenning brings a splendidly unhinged vibe to Celine, but the daytime-TV soapiness of some of the other performances, while not inappropriate to some of the ripe plot, regularly lands us in so-bad-it’s-good territory. This applies most notably to the incredibly handsome Carlo Mendez as Caleb, who, upon figuring out one of many eye-rolling twists, recalls nothing so much as the ludicrous to-camera mugging of Friends’ Joey Tribbiani, as immortalised in many a gif. It might be fun to see what Estrada Lowe would do with a bigger budget and some marquee stars – and yet in all honesty, it could be the faintly bargain-basement nature of the enterprise that gives it its charm.Demise is on digital platforms from 14 April.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersSexreviewsShareReuse this content"

Unexpectedly the answer is yes. Here are just a few of the surprising facts that I learned from this revelatory book. The Belgian army in 1940 was twice the size of the British Expeditionary Force. (The US army in 1940 was smaller still, smaller than those of Portugal or Sweden.) Almost all the French troops evacuated at Dunkirk chose to be repatriated rather than join the Free French. In 1942 pro-Russian feeling in Britain was so strong thatWar and Peacebecame a bestseller. Even in January 1945 the Japanese still had 1 million troops in Manchuria. The Indian prophet of non-violence, Mahatma Gandhi, considered Hitler “not as bad as he is depicted”. And so on.Tim Bouverie has reverted to a traditional form to present the past afresh. His focus is not on the battlefield, nor on the Home Front, but on the relations between the allies who opposed Hitler. In the foreground are the leaders, especially Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin, of course; but there are also walk-on parts for the foreign ministers, the ambassadors, the emissaries and others who participated in their discussions. This is a work of old-fashioned diplomatic history, which provides new perspectives on subjects that seemed familiar. One of its merits is to present the choices that faced the allied leaders as they appeared at the time, rather than with the benefit of hindsight.The first such alliance was between Britain and France, which declared war on Germany in September 1939 to honour their joint guarantee to Poland, though neither did much to prevent Poland from being overrun. The Anglo-French strategy was to bring Germany to its knees by means of a blockade. Fearful of reprisals, the RAF dropped leaflets rather than bombs on the enemy. The “phoney war” ended when the Germans suddenly invaded France in the spring of 1940. Churchill had expected the front to stabilise, as it had done in 1914, but instead the GermanBlitzkriegsplit the allied armies in two. France was defeated, and Vichy France became neutral, indeed a potential enemy. Britain fought on alone against the axis powers of Germany and Italy, which had entered the war as France was collapsing. Bouverie stresses the moral authority that Britain gained from defying German hegemony, even when the struggle seemed hopeless, while not neglecting “the shame and guilt” felt by the British as they abandoned the Greeks to axis occupation. The painful decision to attack the French fleet at Mers-el-Kébir rather than allow it to fall into German hands convinced Roosevelt of Britain’s determination to continue.Bouverie makes the important point that then as now, the US public was isolationist in mood, wary of foreign entanglementsChurchill knew that Germany could not be defeated without US help. Early in 1941 the American, British and Canadian staffs met to agree plans for the US to enter the war. At the outset the British found their US allies “hopelessly disorganised”, but the creation of the Combined Chiefs of Staff provided the structural basis for “the most integrated and successful military alliance in history”. In August 1941, Churchill and Roosevelt met in Newfoundland to agree an “Atlantic Charter”. Although willing to provide succour, the US president was unwilling to commit himself further. Bouverie makes the important point that in the US, unlike in Britain, elections continued throughout the war. Then as now, the US public was isolationist in mood, wary of foreign entanglements. Only in December 1941, after the surprise Japanese attack at Pearl Harbor, was the US dragged into the conflict. Hitler helpfully declared war on the US in solidarity with its Japanese allies.By this time, Germany had invaded Russia, which became the third member of the “Grand Alliance”. The “Big Three” of Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin met for the first time in Tehran towards the end of 1943. This conference led to some incongruous exchanges, especially in the evening. When Churchill remarked that the political complexion of the world was changing and even Britain was becoming “a trifle pinker”, Stalin rejoined that this was “a sign of good health”. The old anti-Bolshevik crusader then drank a toast to the “proletarian masses”, prompting Stalin to raise his glass “to the Conservative party”.Churchill praised Roosevelt as “the truest friend… the greatest man I have ever known”. Nevertheless, differences between them remained, one being their contrasting attitudes to France. Churchill insisted that France should be restored to its position as a great power after the victory. He recognised from the start that Charles de Gaulle, though often exasperating, was “the man of destiny”; in contrast, the Americans continued to lend legitimacy to the collaborationist regime at Vichy until it collapsed, while treating De Gaulle and the Free French forces as “a band of nuisance rebels”. The Russians were able to exploit the divisions between the western powers. Roosevelt mistakenly believed he could handle Stalin, rather as the current president seems to believe that he can handle Putin. Sometimes he dealt with Stalin without consulting or even informing his closest ally.The British resented US criticism of their empire. Taxed by a New York hostess about the plight of the “wretched” Indians, Churchill asked, mischievously: “To which Indians do you refer? Do you by any chance refer to the second greatest nation on Earth, which under benign and beneficent British rule has multiplied and prospered exceedingly, or do you mean the unfortunate Indians of the North American continent, which under your administration are practically extinct?” Black American GIs, who had to endure a colour bar at home, were welcomed in Britain. Bouverie quotes a West Country farmer who, on being asked what he thought of the visitors, replied that he got on very well with Americans, “but had no time for the white men they had brought with them”.Bouverie’s commentary is fair and his judgments judicious. Though he has obviously undertaken a vast amount of research, he never becomes overwhelmed by his material. On the contrary, his book is enjoyable to read. He writes lucidly and lightens his weighty subject matter with well-chosen vignettes – for example, describing how, at a critical conference in June 1940, the British liaison officer Major-General Edward Louis Spears snapped his pencil in frustration at French expressions of defeatism.Bouverie’s first book,Appeasing Hitler: Chamberlain, Churchill and the Road to War, published in 2019, was a dazzling debut.Allies at Warfully confirms the promise shown by its predecessor.Adam Sisman’s most recent book is The Secret Life of John le Carré (Profile)Allies at War: The Politics of Defeating Hitlerby Tim Bouverie is published by Bodley Head (£25).

Unfortunately for this nuclear family, a demon has broken through on to this earthly realm, its first point of contact right in Bangkok and all hell has quite literally broken loose. Actually the film, which is an adaptation of a computer game (called Home Sweet Home) popular inThailand, rather dawdles with touristy scenes of Jake, Prang and Loo daytripping around the city, and one has to wonder if some of the production money was put up by a tourism board with its own agenda.Nevertheless, Jake tries to kill possessed bad guy Mek (Michele Morrone, rather a hoot) in a shopping mall and that’s when it all kicks off. Suddenly, half the population of Bangkok seem possessed and are trying to kill the other half, and Prang and Loo are separated from Jake and must cross the city on a municipal bus as they try to avoid being murdered by the marauding millions. Elsewhere, a ginormous demon made of fire and CGI pixels moves its slow thighs through the urban landscape, a rough beast whose 93 minutes has come round at last in time for the absurd apocalyptic conclusion.Directors Steffen Hacker and Alexander Kiesl (plus the uncredited screenwriters) throw just about every mythology into the mix, from paganism to Buddhism to a bit of Hollywood horror-movie lore. The end result isn’t pretty, but as genre fare it’s at least energetic and Sperbund contributes a credible performance as Prang, one the film deserves.Rebirth: Home Sweet Home is on digital platforms from 14 April, and on DVD and Blu-Ray from 21 April.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersScience fiction and fantasy filmsThailandGamesAsia PacificreviewsShareReuse this content"

A mere six years later, on 3 February 1967, Meek’s name entered the mainstream consciousness in the most darkly dramatic way imaginable, when the news broke that he had killed his landlady, the elderly Violet Shenton, before turning the shotgun on himself.In the time between, as Darryl Bullock notes with characteristic understatement in his richly detailed biographyLove and Fury, the producer’s chaotic, but hugely creative, life was “directed by his passions and obsessions”.Alongside music, they included spiritualism – he was convinced that he had once communed with his hero, the late Buddy Holly, using a Ouija board – and an abiding fascination with the extraterrestrial. His most famous single, the echoey, atmospheric Telstar by the Tornados, was inspired by the launch of the American satellite of the same name in 1962. It sold more than 5m copies, topping the charts in the UK and the US, and remains the record most associated with his often eccentric sonic signature. He also created one of the first electronic concept albums,I Hear a New World(1960), about life in outer space.Out of the chaos of his studio came a rare gift: the ability to balance experimentation and commercial successLike many musical outliers, Meek was a misfit who somehow channelled his otherness into commercial success. In a TV interview conducted in 1974, his older brothers, Arthur and Eric, recalled his childhood oddness. Aged 12, he strung microphones across the walls of the family house to record the dawn chorus and assembled his own library of ambient sound effects such as glass being smashed against a wall, a skidding bicycle and his own approximations of the ghostly creaks and howls that punctuated the schlocky horror movies he loved.Meek’s fondness for what Eric called “weird sounds” carried over into his musical career, which took off in the early 1960s, when he began his ascendancy as Britain’s first successful independent record producer. His studio-cum-sound laboratory was a converted room in a two-storey rented flat above a leather goods shop in north London’s Holloway Road. There, musicians had to negotiate their way across a floor strewn with electric cables and littered with stacked boxes of recording tape. Out of the chaos came a rare gift: the ability to balance experimentation and mainstream acceptance. Meek’s use of overdubbing, sampling, sound effects, echo and distortion was often derided as mere gimmickry by his peers, but is now lauded as visionary. It manifested itself in different ways on songs that ranged in tone from the futuristic pulse of Telstar to the upfront percussive thrust of Have I the Right? by the Honeycombs, which in 1964 became his third No 1 hit.The creation of that song and several other Meek productions, from the well known to the obscure, is described in some detail inLove and Fury, a work of deep pop cultural archaeology for which the term “exhaustive” barely does justice. Bullock, who died in December 2024, had previously written several authoritative books on the LGBTQ+ community’s influence on popular music, one of which,The Velvet Mafia:The Gay Men Who Ranthe SwingingSixties, provides a fascinating contextual backdrop to this one.In contrast to several other influential, but closeted, gay music business figures of the time, including the Beatles’ manager Brian Epstein, Meek was remarkably open about his homosexuality at a stage when it was still prohibited by law. In this book, several musicians recall their surprise at his tentative advances, which tended towards the hopeful rather than the harassing.He once fired a starting pistol at an astonished singer who had disobeyed his instruction not to stand so close to the microphoneThroughout his career, Meek was dogged by depression and often dramatic mood swings, his chummy affability giving way to volcanic explosions of rage when his methods, or his cavalier attitude to royalties, were questioned. In the lengthy index toLove and Fury, there are 39 references to Meek’s “temper”, one of which relates to a recording session that came to an abrupt halt when he fired a starting pistol at an astonished singer who had disobeyed his instruction not to stand so close to the microphone.In 1963, his life took a darker turn after he was arrested for “importuning for immoral purposes” in a public toilet and he was subsequently the target of several blackmail demands. The psychological fallout, writes Bullock, “saw him thrust back into the closet, a move that would have a disastrous effect on his already fragile psyche”.View image in fullscreenMeek, centre, with his house band the Tornados in 1962.Photograph: Keystone/Getty ImagesBy the mid-60s, when the Beatles had dramatically redrawn the parameters of pop, Meek suddenly found himself no longer in demand. His behaviour became increasingly extreme, exacerbated by his use of amphetamines, which soon spiralled into dependence.The killing rage that led to the death of his landlady, and the taking of his own life seconds afterwards, was precipitated, it later emerged, by an argument over his missing rent book. Bullock acknowledges, but gives scant credence, to the conspiracy theories that ensued, the most enduring being a belief that their deaths were the result of a botched gangland hit ordered by the Krays, with whom he sometimes kept company. Instead, he cites the pathologist’s report, which concluded that the amount of amphetamines in Meek’s system could have produced “symptoms of delusion” that caused him to perceive even those closest to him as potential threats.The following year, the contents of Meek’s home studio were sold at auction, including the clavioline synthesiser that featured on Telstar. With his characteristic eye for detail, Bullock notes that “most of the electrical items up for grabs, the amplifiers and mixers and tape decks he had created his life’s work with, had their power cables cut”. The dense tangle of wires and cables that covered the upper floors of his Holloway Road flat had defeated the removal men, who had “simply sawed though them”. It seems an oddly fitting metaphor for the brutal severance of a singular life, one touched by genius, but ultimately undone by the explosive volatility that attended it every step of the way. Read it and weep for the doomed Meek.

In this six-parter, they explore the best cold water spots across Scotland, starting with urban locations in Glasgow and Edinburgh. But first, they must “warm up” by plunging into an ice bath for something “colder than you’ve ever experienced” for more than 10 minutes.Hollie RichardsonStacey & Joe8pm, BBC OneBack from their holidays and back to normality for celebrity couple Stacey Solomon and Joe Swash. Or at least what passes for normality at Pickle Cottage, where Joe is looking to return to work and Stacey hopes to replace him as primary carer for the three youngest children. And two dogs. And four ducks.Ellen E JonesBen Fogle: New Lives in the Wild9pm, Channel 5“Academia meets the wild” is how botanist Arthur describes his family’s entirely off-grid setup in the dense forests of Canton, Maine. Fogle encounters a beguiling and complex blend of stone-age living (hunting with bow and arrows, foraging and wild rice-eating), tragedy, loss and gently understated wisdom.Ali CatterallJack the Ripper: Written in Blood9pm, Sky HistoryView image in fullscreenA different angle on the serial killer … Jack the Ripper: Written in Blood.Photograph: Hearst Networks EMEAA different angle on the serial killer: how did the Whitechapel murders fuel the rise of tabloid journalism? This documentary drama series focuses on the Star, which used the killings to boost circulation and profits. Journalists, former detectives, psychologists and others tell the less-told story.HRNeil & Martin’s Bon Voyage9pm, U&GoldNeil Morrissey and Martin Clunes conclude their pleasant if undemanding journey through southern France. Inevitably, it ends with a boozy party at Morrissey’s farmhouse. But first, to the Camargue for a spectacular horse ride and a visit to Arles where the pair pay questionable tribute to Vincent van Gogh.Phil HarrisonThe Change10pm, Channel 4Another gorgeous and hilarious series finale for the menopause comedy drama. The double bill starts with a witchy supper that terrifies the uneasy men of the Forest of Dean. Then, Linda (Bridget Christie) makes peace with recent discoveries about her family – and gives a beautiful lecture about life lessons learned from mushrooms.HRFilm choicePaddington in Peru (Dougal Wilson, 2024), NetflixView image in fullscreenEpic quest spoof … Paddington in Peru.Photograph: StudioCanal UKA South American immigrant in London has to return home. But this isn’t a Reform political broadcast, and the marmalade-addicted bear in question has a shiny new British passport. Aunt Lucy has gone missing from her Home for Retired Bears in the Peruvian rainforest, so Paddington and the Browns (with Emily Mortimer taking over as Mrs Brown) fly off to find her. Less a fish-out-of-water comedy than a fish-back-in-water quest, Dougal Wilson’s film gives Paddington a few slapstick pratfalls but it’s more of a spoof Indiana Jones tale, revolving round the myth of El Dorado, with Antonio Banderas as a boat captain and Olivia Colman as a nun joining the fun.Simon WardellLive sportChampions League Football: Arsenal v Real Madrid6.30pm, Prime Video.

The bridge was critical to creating a fast road link to the port of Holyhead and so improving communication links between London and Dublin.Map of Ynys MonToday, motoring tourists take advantage of Telford’s vision every day (albeit linking up with the A55 North Wales Expressway) as they head to Holyhead to board ferries to Ireland. But in doing so, they bypass the many meandering, slow lane charms that dot the coastline of Ynys Môn.Plas Newydd House and Garden (exit 8a)View image in fullscreenPlas Newydd sits on the banks of the Menai Strait.Photograph: Christopher Nicholson/AlamyThisNational Trust waterfront mansiondates back to the 16th century and sits amid 68 hectares (169 acres) of ornate gardens, woodland and parkland. It is perhaps most famous for one of its later owners, Henry Cyril Paget, fifth Marquess of Anglesey, whose flamboyant approach to life – including converting the family chapel into what he called the Gaiety theatre – was the stuff of scandal in stuffy Victorian Wales. His life will soon be brought to the big screen in anew film, Madfabulous.Just south of Plas Newydd is Tide cafe, located atHalen Môn – Anglesey Sea Salt. It is open for drinks and snacks year-round (10.30am-2.30pm). While there, you can pick up some of Halen Môn’s much lauded sea salt.Red Wharf Bay (exit 8)View image in fullscreenThe Ship Inn at Red Wharf Bay.Photograph: John Critchley/AlamyAbout 12 miles south of Amlwch lies Red Wharf Bay, a large sandy inlet that, at low tide, extends for 10 square miles. The Wales Coast Path hugs the bay, providing a panoramic view of the coast; it also offers the chance to explore Llanddona beach, which, in the 18th century was said to be controlled by a group of vicious outlaws known as the witches of Llanddona, who terrorised the local community. Returning to the top of the bay, theShip Inn,The Old BoathouseorThe Tavern on the Bayare good pit stops for a drink and food overlooking the sea.Penmon Point (exit 8)View image in fullscreenPenmon Point, Trwyn Du lighthouse and Ynys Seiriol or Puffin Island.Photograph: Andrew Kearton/AlamyPenmon Point is the eastern tip of Ynys Môn, and one of its oldest and most holy sites. It is a wild headland offering views of Trwyn Du lighthouse and Ynys Seiriol, an island that, in the fifth century, provided solitude and sanctuary for its namesake saint. Today it’s better known as Puffin Island because, up until the late 19th century, it was a breeding haven for the birds.Penmon Point is a favourite destination for walkers, birdwatchers and nature lovers, and offers views (on clear days) of Y Gogarth (the Great Orme headland). Two formidable white stone cottages face the sea at the tip of the point, while behind them sits thePilot House cafe, serving food, drinks and cocktails indoors and in a colourful garden. For a more formal dining experience, head to Beaumaris and eat atHarry’s Bistro, located in Henllys Hall golf club, or continue to Menai Bridge to explore the international cuisine ofFreckled Angelor the tasting menu atSosban & the Old Butchers– both located just a short distance from Telford’s famous suspension bridge.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, I’d recommend heading north a few miles, over the Malltraeth cob (a causeway built by Telford), and on to the village of Aberffraw. Here you walk down the banks of the Ffraw to Traeth Mawr, a stunning wide sandy beach fit for a king. Rightly so. In the late 13th century, Aberffraw was the most important place in all of Wales – the seat of power for the princes of Gwynedd, Wales’s dominant royal family.Venture a little farther north to Rhosneigr, an equally attractive stretch of coast once famed for both piracy and wreckers, who lured ships on to the jagged rocks near the Crigyll river. Today, Rhosneigr is better known for its culinary scene than its smuggling.The Oystercatcheris a restaurant and bar located in the dunes not far from the two main beaches.

This is Mynydd Parys, but its nickname is Copper Mountain because, for about 4,000 years, it was mined for valuable copper ore.In the 18th century, Mynydd Parys became the largest copper ore exporter in the world – much of it being sent by ship from the nearby port of Amlwch to copperworks in the Swansea valley. Today, the mines are closed and the scorched red, gold and brown alien landscape has been transformed into a series of dramatic and (dare I say) awe-inspiring walking trails.After a hike at Mynydd Parys, I like to head toSkye’s creperiein Amlwch Harbour for great pancakes, brunch and even sushi.Matthew Yeomans explored the coastal fringes of Ynys Môn for his new book, Seascape: Notes from a Changing Coastline (University of Wales Press, £18.99).

We all know that mashed potatoes can cause heated debate, with smooth and buttery making some folk purr, while others prefer a bit of texture, and this also affects what you do with any spares. “It can be difficult to use leftover mash, because many recipes depend on how creamy you like it to begin with,” says the author ofThe Potato Book, although she says one “surefire way” begins by putting a good splash of olive oil in a frying pan on a medium-low heat. “Fry two chopped spring onions [green bits and all] until soft, add the leftover mash, and fry until hot and almost caramelising.” Season, and you’ve got a great base for all sorts.Alternatively, O’Toole might mix her mash with a handful of crumbled feta, some cooked and squeezed spinach, a pinch of chilli flakes, a little grated nutmeg and lemon zest, plus salt and pepper. “Divide into pingpong ball-sized portions, then wrap in filo glued together with a touch of water. Shallow fry in oil until golden and crisp all over.” Perhaps the easiest solution of all, though, is to use excess mash to thicken soups: “Sweat some leeks, add the mash, season and cover with vegetable stock and 100ml whipping cream,” says O’Toole, who then cooks the lot for 30 minutes before tucking in with a good hunk of bread.The first job with leftover roasties, meanwhile, is to bring back their crispness. “Chop them and pan-fry in a drizzle of oil until golden and sizzling,” O’Toole says, then serve with a fried egg and thick-cut ham. “Or, if you’re feeling fancy, toss them in a spiced tomato sauce for a speedy take onpatatas bravas– simple but delicious.” Mind you, accessorising will always set you apart. “You don’t necessarily need to transform roast potatoes into something else,” says Stuart Andrew, head chef at64 Goodge Streetin London, “but you could freshen them up with a littlepersillade[chopped parsley and garlic] or, for something rougher around the edges, whack mayo and chilli oil on top.”Gratins are, of course, always a good idea, and they’re an excellent home for leftover boiled potatoes. Take a leaf out of Andrew’s book with a gratin Savoyard: “Rub a baking dish liberally with unsalted butter and garlic, then layer up the sliced boiled potatoes with salt and pepper, some grated gruyere, sliced onion, parsley and mushrooms, much as you would a lasagne.” Pour over cream, dot with butter and bake until golden. “Serve with afriséesalad dressed with a mustard vinaigrette, and it’s actually quite a light meal.”For O’Toole, however, excess boiled potatoes mean one thing: smashed spuds. “Grab a jar [or anything with a bit of weight], press down on the spuds to break them up a bit, then brush with oil and coat in plenty of spices [smoked paprika, fennel seeds, ground allspice, say].” Roast, turning halfway, until golden and crisp. That said, the exception to O’Toole’s rule is when she’s in “barbecue mode”, when she’d chop boiled potatoes to mix with a mayo dressing for a classic potato salad. When said mode can next be activated, though, is anyone’s guess.Got a culinary dilemma?

Just be sure to use perfectly ripe mangoesNigel SlaterTue 8 Apr 2025 07.00 EDTShareBlueberries actually have a pinch of acidity that helps lift this rather mild and soothing puréed mango.I like to use a thick, strained Greek-style yoghurt here, and only partially mix it into the purée to leave some attractive swirls of it marbled through the fool.Tip 150g ofblueberriesinto a saucepan, then add 2 tbsp ofsugarand 100ml ofwaterand bring to the boil.Lower the heat and wait until the berries start to burst and a purple juice forms. Then set aside to cool.Cut the flesh from 2 largemangoes, slicing it from the large, flat stones at their centres. (Discard the stones and skin.) Put the flesh into a blender together with the juice of half alemonand process to a thick, smooth purée.Stir in 200ml of thick Greek-styleyoghurt, taking care not to overmix it – ideally you’ll have ribbons of yoghurt still visible throughout the fool as you scoop into it.Pour the mixture into serving dishes, then swirl a little of the blueberry purée through each one with a spoon. Top with a few fresh berries, if you like.Serves 4. Ready in 30 minutesYou can always use other berries in place of the blueberries. A raspberry purée will work well, too, or even one of passion fruit. (If using passion fruit I like to keep the crunchy seeds in to contrast the smoothness of the mango.)For a softer flavour, use double cream that has been lightly whipped in place of the strained yoghurt.Use any variety of mango, just make sure they are truly ripe.Explore more on these topicsFoodNigel Slater's midweek dinnerfeaturesShareReuse this content"

If I don’t want anything too hearty, I’ll often serve it with greens or a salad, so it really is a quick turnaround. I love this simple brown butter caper dressing, because it doesn’t overpower the fish. However, if you want something a little punchier, add a spoonful of harissa to the mix.Fried sea bream with herby lemon and caper burnt butterPrep5 minCook20 minServes22 sea bream fillets(about 100g each)Sea salt andblack pepper40g unsalted butter2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely grated2 tbsp capersJuice of½ lemon½ bunchmixed soft herbs(ie, flat-leaf parsley, chives, mint)2 tbsp olive oilTake the fish out of the fridge, pat it dry with kitchen paper so there is no moisture on the fillets, and season generously. Make sure you have the rest of your ingredients ready, because this cooks so quickly.Put the butter in a large frying pan on a medium heat. As soon as it melts and starts to smell nutty, add the grated garlic and capers, and fry for a few minutes, until golden. Squeeze in the lemon juice and take off the heat. Stir in most of the chopped herbs, then pour into a small bowl and set aside.Drizzle the olive oil into the same frying pan over a medium heat, then lay in the fish skin side down and fry for four to five minutes, until the skin is crisp and golden. Turn up the heat a little, flip over the fish and fry for a couple of minutes more, until cooked through and golden all over.Pour the caper butter back into the pan for the last 30 seconds, then serve scattered with the remaining herbs.The Guardian aims to publish recipes for sustainable fish.
