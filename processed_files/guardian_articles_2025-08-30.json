In his youth, he published an anthology of poetry called Way Past Go, which caused barely a ripple and quickly slipped out of print. Then one day he is accosted outside his apartment by an NYU student, who explains that he stumbled across Way Past Go at a secondhand bookstore and was transported, blown away and could scarcely believe what he’d found. “You’re a man of letters,” the student tells Saxberger, which is undeniably true given that he spends his days sorting them.Hitchcock once said that nine-tenths of a film’s success is in the casting, by which measure Late Fame already qualifies as a hit. Saxberger is portrayed with a loose, warm-leather ease byWillem Dafoe, who makes the man look bemused but never once makes him foolish. It’s a performance so natural it barely looks like acting at all and it keeps the film honest when the plot shows its hand and the gears start to creak. When the postal worker is introduced to his band of new disciples, the students crowd around as if inspecting a piece of living history. “Of course that’s how you’d look,” purrs Gloria (Greta Lee), the group’s flamboyant queen bee. Gloria speaks for her friends but she speaks for the rest of us, too.Saxberger’s principal champion is Wilson Meyers (Edmund Donovan), a breathless wannabe writer, half-constricted by his tight white turtleneck and awkwardly living off his father’s money. Meyers runs a salon of sorts, the Enthusiasm Society, and cajoles his idol into writing a piece to be performed at the group’s first public show. Saxberger hasn’t written in decades, doesn’t even see himself as a writer, but he is flattered by the attention and faintly dazzled by Gloria, who is a club singer by night and a resting actor by day. Typically the man spends his evenings at the local billiard bar, where the jukebox plays Lou Reed’s Coney Island Baby as though it only came out last week. Now he’s running with a new crowd, toiling to write a fresh poem and casually neglecting his old blue-collar pals.Late Fame is adapted from a 19th-century novella by the Austrian author Arthur Schnitzler, although the tale is comfortably at home in modern-day Manhattan. Director Kent Jones is a former critic and a longtime director of the New York film festival, steeped in the specifics of the city’s arts scene. Jones wears his learning lightly but his film is at its most assured when it is navigating the vexed interplay between old and new Gotham, showing how the mystique of the past percolates through to the present. The members of the Enthusiasm Society style themselves as dandified retro beatniks, come to venerate, curate and cannibalise their ancestors. “Were you friends with Ginsberg?” they demand of Saxberger, and he sheepishly admits he was not. “Just tell them yes,” Gloria advises, sotto voce. She knows cultural cachet when she sees it and hates the thought of it being wasted.Once Saxberger has fallen in with his new gang of friends, Late Fame relaxes into its story just a little too much. The tale’s denouement is telegraphed, the moral lesson feels rote and the tension is largely dependent on Saxberger’s increasing pangs of self-doubt. All the same, this one has stayed with me. It’s a lovely slice of life, a heartfelt New York story – and judging from the brief burst of writing that we are permitted to hear, the postman can rest easy whether he is on stage or at work. Saxberger’s poetry is ecstatic and gritty in the style of Frank O’Hara, conjuring the sounds and flavours of the old New York, and the authentically voracious hunger of youth. The Enthusiasm Society is a joke; its members’ approach to art is all wrong. But they are right about Saxberger, which means there may be some hope for them yet.Late Fame screened at theVenice film festival.Explore more on these topicsVenice film festivalDrama filmsFilm adaptationsNew YorkWillem DafoeFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

If it’s a man about my age, it would normally be Alan Partridge. If it’s a man in his 30s, it might be Taskmaster or Veep. If it’s a woman, it’s harder to tell. Smack the Pony seems to be having a revival among women in their 20s but it could easily be Bridget Jones and Miranda. It’s starting to happen withAustin, too, which seems to be something that families watch together.You had a really strong Australian accent until you were 12. Can you do one now?Yeah, and I couldn’t hear it! My dad worked for British Airways and we lived in Sydney when I was growing up. I went to Queenwood, which is apparently very posh – thanks British Airways. I have really, really happy memories of that time. But I picked up an Australian accent and my family really teased me about it. It took me quite a long time to get rid of it. The weird thing is, for a while I was quite good at accents but the one I couldn’t do was Australian.Can you do an Australian accent now?[In an Australian accent]I don’t know. I think so?That’s pretty good. When you filmed season two of Austin, did you show Michael Theo around London?Lucinda Williams: ‘My singing is better now than it was before my stroke’Read moreYes I did! Michael came to stay with me. He had a list of things he wanted to do. I took him to the Science Museum and we saw the early steam engines. He was very excited by that. I don’t know why we went to Clapham Junction but we did and he was excited by that. We went round lots of cheese shops. Ben [Miller] took him to Aardman, which he loved.Michael wanted to see the Tower of London and I have a friend who is a Yeoman Warder – a Beefeater. His wife is a special needs mum and they live together in the tower. They are massive fans of Michael so they offered to give him a personal tour. I was like, I have aced this. And he didn’t like it! He knew he was supposed to like it. You go on a little conveyor belt past the crown jewels and he was going: “Why would anyone want to look at this stuff?” There’s some hilarious pictures of him standing on Anne Boleyn’s grave, which is in an area the public is not allowed in. And Michael was really deeply bored and couldn’t hide it. It was very funny – he laughs about it now.Before he came over, he said: “I’m looking forward to meeting English women because they’re gracious and classy.” And then he turned up and met us and at the end he was like: “I think I’m going to marry an Australian after all.”View image in fullscreenBen Miller, Michael Theo and Sally Phillips in AustinWhat’s been your most cringeworthy run-in with a celebrity?The first time I met Hugh Grant was on the set of Notting Hill – from which I was cut, but I am on the DVD extras! The third assistant director and I were walking to set and the third AD said: “Do you know Hugh?” And I turned around and there was Hugh Grant. And I screamed! I think it was a size thing. He’s not particularly small but I was surprised he was the size of a human, I suppose. That was pretty uncool.What is the most enduring lesson from your time at clown school?Jay Duplass: ‘Rocky is my favourite movie of all time. I’ve seen that film probably 20 times’Read moreI’ve been to lots of clown schools. They teach you that getting it wrong means you are getting it right. When you get something wrong, you seem vulnerable and people can connect with you. Showing your vulnerabilities is actually what everyone’s desperate for and you make it possible for other people to show their vulnerabilities. In jazz, they say if you just hold the wrong note it becomes right – I think we all need to hear that sometimes.I did a clown workshop recently and they applauded every time someone messed up. “This is how to live,” I thought. When you are rewarded with laughter and applause for how stupid you are – life would be much better if we could just do this.Do you have a nemesis?Do you mean an actor who gets jobs you’d like? Because I’ve engaged with parenting like a plough engages with a field – it’s been bumpy. My career choices sometimes haven’t been choices. So there’s not really people who got the thing that I think I should have got. But there are people who I wish I’d been a bit more like.I really admireSharon Horganbecause she had the balls to just do it and not take no for an answer. When I came into the industry you were told no in so many convincing forms that now we know were bollocks. It was just completely accepted that women weren’t as funny as men and that women weren’t as good on telly.I remember pitching a movie and saying: “So this woman is not that attractive –” and the guy said: “Can I stop you there – this is the movies. The least attractive I’m prepared to go is Kelly Macdonald.” And she’s the person who played the part! We were just told no all the time. I wish I’d had more courage. I wish I’d had more balls. That’s the wrong thing to say! I wish I’d been a bit more like Sharon Horgan.View image in fullscreenPhillips with Smack the Pony co-stars Fiona Allen and Doon Mackichan, circa 2002.Photograph: Channel 4Do you believe in extraterrestrial life?I believe there could be something. If there’s infinite galaxies it would be ridiculous to say no!What is the weirdest thing you have done for love?It was 29 February. My partner and I had been together about six months, not that long. It wasn’t a real proposal but I thought I’d frighten him with a proposal in the least romantic place possible. So I got a massive paperweight that looked like a diamond and some chicken wire and made a massive ring. I got a food compost bag full of jelly hearts and lots of photographs of us on a little washing line. We were on a train going north and, as we left Milton Keynes – one of the least romantic places in the UK – I said: “Please don’t marry me.” Probably a bit weird in retrospect. He was frightened but a bit touched. He kept the ring!If you could change the size of any animal to keep as a pet, what would it be?I’ve always wanted a monkey. My dad used to have a monkey before I was born – he rescued a monkey off the streets in Borneo. They shit orange – I remember once having one on my shoulder and it shit orange all the way down my back. So I think I’d shrink the monkey small, in terms of poo management. A palm-sized monkey.What are you secretly really good at?I was the most insanely accomplished 18-year-old – I spoke two languages fluently and I played three instruments really well. But I’m now 55 and I haven’t really done any of that since. I’ve just been to France and I can barely string a sentence together. I got the flute out the other day and it was sad. I used to be good at stuff – does that count?Austin seasons one and two are available to stream on ABC iView in Australia, and season one is on BBC iPlayer in the UK.Explore more on these topicsSally Phillips10 Chaotic QuestionsTelevisionAustralian televisionTV comedyClownsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Instead, he says, he began looking for physical challenges that offer more “bang-for-buck”.View image in fullscreenPlanting a tree a minute was ‘bloody hard’, Miles says.Photograph: Chris OrdThe project was inspired by a joy flight Miles was given for his 40th birthday.“I flew directly over my house, where I’ve grown up,” he says. “It was remarkable how green it was but it was a green rolling blanket, rather than a green rolling forest … when you see it from the air it’s so blank.”Noticing how bare it was, he set himself the goal of planting a tree a minute for 24 hours to turn it into bushland again.Sign up to get climate and environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a free newsletterThe little forest is on a nearby plot of land owned by his friend, otherwise used for farming.Working at that rate was “bloody hard”, Miles says. “I thought it would be hard but I didn’t think it would be that hard.“I got to about a thousand trees and then had a few hours’ sleep – I thought I was stuffed.” A second wind in the last hour allowed him to finish the job.He says the result four years on is “totally worth it”.In avideo posted last weekMiles returns to the land where he planted four years ago. There are trees big enough to climb, a resident wombat, a cockatoo feather.“It’s a good-looking little bit of forest,” he says in the video. “I planted it. So maybe I’m a bit biased.”View image in fullscreenBefore … a bare paddock.Photograph: Mitch DrummondView image in fullscreenAnd after … the young forest.Photograph: Mitch DrummondThe most rewarding moment, Miles says, was boiling a billy in the forest’s grassy understorey and enjoying a cup of tea.“I felt it was a really lovely, almost profound moment – like I’d just had another kid – in that I’d made an impact of some kind.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now Del Toro has written and directed a bombastic but watchable new version of Mary Shelley’s great novel and makes of it a stately melodrama, starring Oscar Isaac as the anatomist and passionate freethinker Victor Frankenstein and Jacob Elordi as his creature: no passé neck-bolts or big fringey forehead, of course, and if you compare him with portrayals by other actors – Boris Karloff, Peter Boyle, Robert De Niro – he is, for all the picturesque prosthetic scars, the nearest this iconic figure has come to being a bit of a hottie.It’s an epic bromance between scientist and monster, both of whom speak with plummy British accents, the monster’s one having a touch of John Hurt in The Elephant Man. The visual style of the movie is utterly distinctive and unmistakably that of Del Toro: a series of lovely, intricate images, filigreed with infinitesimally exact cod-period detail; deep focus but also strangely depthless, like hi-tech stained glass or illustrated plates in a Victorian tome; pictures whose luxurious beauty underscores the film’s reverence for the source material and for itself, but which for me impedes the energy of horror. For all the guignol, this movie is not going to risk actual bad taste, unlike the brilliant and far more interesting film on the Frankensteinian theme: Yorgos Lanthimos’sPoor Things.Heartsinkingly, Del Toro will insist on making his monster more of a supernatural daemon, resistant to bullets. Although I have to concede the ingenuity and verve with which Del Toro pulls off a storytelling switch to the creature’s own point of view, allowing him to narrate his own experiences after escaping Frankenstein’s lab: absurd, and yet that shift is the lightning-flash that jolts the movie into some semblance of life.As a boy, highly strung Victor is abused by his cruel disciplinarian father (Charles Dance), a renowned physician whose choleric temper inspires Victor to surpass the old man – to rise up against his creator, in fact. As a brilliant young physician himself, Frankenstein scandalises Edinburgh’s medical establishment with his godless post-galvanic belief that a human being can be created (and death cheated) by applying an electric charge to a gruesome assemblage of scavenged body parts.Hothead Victor is tolerated by his affectionate younger brother William (Felix Kammerer), to whose fiancee Elizabeth (Mia Goth) Victor is attracted, but who sees through Victor’s arrogance and essential coldness. It is Elizabeth’s wealthy arms manufacturer uncle Harlander (Christoph Waltz) who offers to bankroll Frankenstein’s artificial man project, which in fact is to be a single dead body salvaged from the field of battle, a gentle giant who is at first transfixed by this brave new world that Frankenstein has brought him into, but then hurt by Frankenstein’s cold impatience.View image in fullscreen‘Filigreed with infinitesimally exact cod-period detail’ … Frankenstein.Photograph: Martin Crowdy/AlamyAs for Waltz’s mysterious, sinister, twinkle-eyed gentleman, he says airily that in return for paying for all this, he might possibly require “a favour of some sort”. Uh, oh …I wish that Mia Goth’s character had been given more to do here: her presence was like Mia Wasikowska’s in Del Toro’s very interesting and underrated Du Maurier-esque fantasyCrimson Peak. She has one rather excellent scene, atypical in its playful comedy, in which Frankenstein secretly follows Elizabeth to church, impishly ducks into a confession box on the priest’s side and grinningly hears her whispered confession: the sin of anger, it seems, as she resents this arrogant man Dr Victor Frankenstein who goads her in conversation … and yet she is clearly affected by him. A more comically minded film-maker might have spun that scene out a little longer: Del Toro ends it almost immediately. Goth’s contribution ventilates the drama.Finally, inevitably, at the end of the protracted tale, we get to the question of which of the two is the “real” monster. The answer, in this high-minded and eventually rather sanctified romance, would appear to be – neither of them.Frankenstein screened at theVenice film festival.Explore more on these topicsVenice film festivalGuillermo del ToroOscar IsaacJacob ElordiChristoph WaltzMary ShelleyHorror filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s also alarmingly retrogradeJ Oliver Conroywith photographs by Celeste SlomanSat 30 Aug 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 30 Aug 2025 19.21 EDTShareView image in fullscreenMike and Jenny Thomas with their daughters, Edith, five, and Astrid, 13.A cool evening air was descending on the 25-acre farmstead, blowing across the pond, around the barn, through the apple orchard and into the windows of Mike and Jenny Thomas’s two-century-old red-brick farmhouse.The dinner hour had come. Edith, five, and George, three, enthusiastically rang a bell hanging near the kitchen door, sending metallic peals back into the early dusk.Mike sat down at the head of a wooden table, his wife at the other end, their four children along the benches between. He recited a prayer in Latin, then led a short grace: “Bless us, O Lord, and these thy gifts, which we are about to receive …” Everyone crossed themselves, and Jenny began serving homemade pizzas.A decade earlier, Jenny and Mike had been urban Democrats of a progressive and granola bent: the sort of people who shop at farmers’ markets, read about psychoanalysis, volunteer at community gardens. But they felt some frustration – some lack. They fantasized about leaving the city behind for a simpler, purer life in the countryside, and 11 years ago they finally took the plunge.Running a farmstead in the mountains of central New York state turned out to be hard work, but it suited them. As Mike worked on the farm, he began to feel an almost spiritual connection to the land and to nature itself. He immersed himself in the writings of Thomas Aquinas and other philosophers.A man should be able to earn a single wage that allows him to own property ... and pay for his family so his wife doesn’t have to workMike ThomasOne day, while staring at an oak tree, he felt a visceral awareness of the tree as a living thing – and of Jesus Christ, not just as a historical figure or Christian symbol, but as a presence emanating from everything around him. He emerged from the experiencea believer in God’s existence.Jenny pointed out that being Christian meant more than just a vague spiritual identification. Shouldn’t they start going regularly to mass? Shouldn’t they try to actually abide by the sacraments?As they did, she and Mike began to wonder whether many of the secular liberal assumptions they had long held were true. Did technological progress really make people happier? Had greater gender equality actually worked out for women and families? They discovered other people with the same doubts – and a similar yearning for an America that no longer exists, and perhaps in some regards never did.A couple years ago, Jenny went through her books to remove some final remnants of her left-leaning 20s: the Frankfurt school, the situationists, Žižek.She burned them.View image in fullscreenJenny Thomas is expecting her fifth child.Although Mike and Jenny arenothing but warm and welcoming in person, on social media they casually speak of revoking women’s suffrage and make insinuating references to throwing Marxists from helicopters. (During their rightwing dictatorships, the Argentine and Chilean militaries executed thousands of people–enemy guerrillas as well as leftwing trade unionists, students and journalists –by drugging them and dropping them from aircraft into the sea.)Today, Jenny and Mike still believe in respecting the environment and buying local. But they are ardently conservative by common definitions, devoutly Catholic and part of a counterculture where describing someone as “reactionary” is high praise.They are part of a small movement of Americans who believe that the modern world is broken – and that the solution lies not in economic equality or social progressivism, but in an older, stricter family order. For families like these, a house is not just a home, but a castle against a decadent and dysfunctional world. They believe that they have figured out something about modern life that the rest of us have not, or are in denial about.And they may find some sympathetic ears at high levels of the Trump administration: the “trad” (traditionalist) movement coincides with a time of extraordinary political assault on women’s rights in the US and a cultural backlash against decades of feminist consensus. At its most militant, it is intertwined with far-right political projects.“A man should be able to earn a single wage,” Mike said, “that allows him to own property, be productive on that property and pay for his family so his wife doesn’t have to work. This is the way that our society should be oriented. What I have here shouldn’t be so uncommon. This shouldbethe common.”My hours-long drive to the Thomases’ farmstead was almost cut short in the final stretch when I felt the sickening shudder of a flat tire. It was almost too on the nose: of course a New York City journalist would get a flat tire on the way to interview a man who chops his own wood for heat.I called Mike and, with some embarrassment, asked for assistance. Minutes later, a friendly bearded man in a checkered shirt pulled up in a pickup truck and introduced himself. Soon, we were on our way.Sundresses and rugged self-sufficiency: ‘tradwives’ tout a conservative American past ... that didn’t existRead moreI had become interested in the trad movement as a reporter who covers the culture of the right. Before my visit to the farm, I had spent weeks reading about families like theirs: men and women leaving cities behind to live as modern-day yeoman farmers. I had heard ofsocial media tradwives, but less about trad husbands, and even less about the realities of embodying this life.What I encountered intrigued me. In contrast with Christian fundamentalists, the Amish or other conservative religious communities, many of the trads were converts who had chosen their lifestyles as adults, sometimes after years of spiritual seeking. Some seemed eminently reasonable and simply wished to be left alone to co-exist with mainstream society, others to inhabit a different and unsettling planet.All, however, seemed to share similar frustrations with the modern age.I had contacted Mike because he is the director of theCatholic Land Movement, an organization that advocates for conservative Catholic families to form rural homesteads. (Thomas is not his actual surname, but the name by which people in the movement know him.)Mike has a day job as a manager at a construction company. He was frank about the fact that his farm is more of a project than a primary source of food or income. The rambling compound was, nevertheless, teeming with animals: two dogs, four cats, a dozen chickens and 17 sheep. He said not to stand near the driveway gate because their sheepdog was known to nip bottleneckers.Families like his see themselves as part of a growing subculture. In 2002, the conservative writer Rod Dreher published an article,Crunchy Cons, arguing that some rightwing Americans valued environmental conservation and were skeptical of globalized capitalism: stances often dismissed as leftwing. In a subsequent book, Dreher urged conservatives to protect what is “small, local, old, and particular” rather than “big, global, new, and abstract”.Left: a girl holds a baby chick in her hands outside; right: a colander of red berries nestled in the grass.Left: Astrid and Edith play with chicks. Right: Astrid picks berries on the family property.That idea spread online through outlets such asFront Porch Republic, which advocates for a localism that promotes family life deeply rooted in small communities. It stands in contrast with the free-market absolutism historically associated with the Republican party, and might be said to have predicted, in a small way, the tectonic rise of Donald Trump’s anti-free-trade populism, as well as Robert F Kennedy Jr’s “Make America Healthy Again” strain of anti-corporate, anti-vaccine politics.Mike, who voted for Trump, supports his use of tariffs and other means to try to “reshore” American jobs and promote national economic self-sufficiency, although he hopes that Trump officials will do more to promote small businesses and local agriculture. He also supports paid parental leave for both parents.The pandemic has also been “a departure point”, Mike said, which increased interest in the trad lifestyle. Covid-19, he said, exposed the fragility of economic supply chains, the public school system and other institutions in a way that made families want to be more self-sufficient and rely on neighbors and churchmates rather than the government.Since then,he and Jenny have to explain their odd lifestyle choices less.Inside the house, Jenny, five months pregnant, was working in the kitchen. She had just picked up their 13-year-old, Astrid, from an Irish dance class. The large, rustic room was adorned with Christian icons and crafts projects.“This is Mr Conroy,” Mike told the children. To Jenny, he said: “How can I help, Mom?”“There’s not much,” she said. “Dinner’s almost ready.”Over dinner – with occasional babbling interruptions from George, the toddler, who had recently learned the phrase “excuse me” – Jenny described her experience as a home school teacher.Home schooling has sharplyrisenin the US in recent years, particularly during Covid school shutdowns, and many students maynever returnto the formal school system. Among religious conservatives, home schooling has long been popular; for trads, it can also be, like breastfeeding, home birthing,big familiesand cooking from scratch, somewhat of a status symbol.Jenny said they began home schooling simply because good local schools were scarce. She had also wrestled with a sense that the strictures of formal schooling tended to “crush the spark of bright-eyed, bushy-tailed, enthusiastic children”.It is hard work. “I’m not the best home school teacher,” she laughed. “Some people love it, and are really good at it. I have friends that are like that and then, thankfully, I have friends who are kind of like: ‘Are you failing miserably at this too?’” Even so, she felt, her children were doing at least as well, socially and academically, as their formally schooled peers.View image in fullscreenChildren’s books on the Thomas family windowsill.“I would say,” Mike said, “that there’s something about the education system that is technocratic in its nature, and more about managerial philosophies than encountering a genuine and whole person and educating them. I think we wanted to create an environment where our kids were actually ‘encountered’, whether it was with literature, or history, or philosophy or … ”“EXCUSE ME,” George said.We paused to let George speak. He had recently encountered a version of The Iliad for children, and it had made a deep impression. “I like it,” he explained. “I like it when people are blooded.” Everyone chuckled.After dinner, Mike showed me around the farm. George was keen to join, but fell out of a tree, became blooded and was crying.A willful acceptance of poverty or hardship is not something that’s baked into our cultural conditioning right nowMike ThomasMike paused at an apple tree infested with caterpillars, which he pulled off and dumped in the chickens’ yard. The farm draws on principles partly similar to those of permaculture, a holistic philosophy that has long been popular among hippyish leftwing agriculturalists.The animals and orchard form a closed loop: chickens eat insects and lay eggs, sheep graze and provide meat and apples are pressed into cider that Mike trades with neighbors.A sublime sunset had begun to glow on the horizon. The farm would be photography catnip to a social media influencer. Yet the property, though attractive, was hardly curated. The house was cluttered with semi-contained chaos and half-completed projects. The mud in the fields was very real.“This isn’t easy,” Mike said. Tradlife also means going against the grain of an economy oriented toward two-income households, he said: “A willful acceptance of poverty or hardship is not something that’s, like, baked into our cultural conditioning right now.” Butchering animals does not leave a lot of time to watch Netflix.Secular liberals who experiment with agrarian life often wash out, he believes, because they do not have a religious or philosophical anchor: “I read these ridiculously hysterical things of like, ‘my six-month foray into homesteading’. I’m like, six months? You barely parked the car.”View image in fullscreenMike Thomas sweeps an outbuilding on his farm.Each weekday, Edward Phillips wakes at 4am, works out, takes a cold shower and says his daily prayers. On his way to work, where he is a mechanic for trucks and heavy machinery, he also prays a rosary.His wife, Emily, gets up around 6.30, sometimes earlier, to nurse their one-year-old. She exercises and prays, and spends the day home schooling, doing chores, paying bills, cooking and taking the children to appointments. By the time Edward gets home, she usually has a list of repairs for him to do while she preps school lessons for the next day.Emily and Edward are 31 and 33. They are raising six children on a small hobby farm in rural Illinois. The couple’s days are so full, so disciplined, that when I first read Emily’s description of her life in an onlineessay, I found it a bit hard to believe.Speaking by video call, she and Edward were friendly and unassuming. Describing one’s home life can feel like “you’re flashing people”, Emily said, laughing and miming the motion.She said: “I often ask my husband: ‘Does anybody even want to read this?’ And he’s like: ‘Emily, not everybody lives this way – you’re forgetting that.’ Conversely, I do enjoy reading about women living in the city, what they’re doing, so I think it goes both ways.”Emily and Edward met as adolescents, reconnected later and got married when Emily was 19 and Edward was 21. Both had been raised Catholic and drifted away – “I dabbled in, like, leftist, progressivist ideas and I was living very differently for a while,” Emily said – beforedeciding to give religion an earnest second try.They started attending a church that offers the Latin mass; the old-fashioned liturgy has risen in popularity in recent years as aninfluxof conservative young adults have converted to Catholicism, or “reverted” after abandoning religion in high school or college. (JD Vance converted in 2019. Five of the US supreme court’s six right-leaning justices are also Catholic.)Edward does not feel that his politics map neatly onto either major political party, though “my religious beliefs put me on certain sides of issues, kind of as a non-negotiable”, he said, referring especially to abortion, “and, you know, that’s that”.“I agree,” Emily said.She and Edward knew they wanted children – “though we didn’t know we would havethismany, this fast” – and liked the idea of raising kids on some land. Their lifestyle is not accessible toeveryone, the couple acknowledge: they live in an inexpensive area, bought their house when interest rates were low and have family nearby to help.As for home schooling, “I don’t disrespect parents that send their kids to school”, Emily said. “But I really enjoy getting to choose what my children are learning, knowing their particular personalities [and] strengths, and getting to cater to the things that they enjoy.”On Substack, Emily is part of a small community of women who blog about their lives as Christian mothers, though many of the writers view the famous tradwife influencers with about as much distance as the average secular urbanite does. MentioningBallerina Farm– the social media brand of theNeelemans, a wealthy Utah ranching family whose carefully curated life has drawn millions of Instagram followers – often prompts an eye roll.Similarly, the community tends to view with bafflement the fantastical – andsometimessexualized – perception that outsiders have of their life. When Evie Magazine, apublicationlaunched in 2019 as a conservativealternativeto Cosmopolitan, touted a low-cut “raw milkmaid dress”, real-life trads mocked it. “That, to us, is kind of a disgusting dress to wear in public,” a trad told me. “I would hate to see my wife wear it, and I don’t think she would, except maybe as a nightgown.”View image in fullscreenSheep on the Thomas family property.Not all the writers are particularly political, but a common thread is pride in being different – in making choices that other Americans regard as weird. In their view, true counterculture is not Woodstock, but rejecting the permissive society that Woodstock ushered in. It means trading relaxed “boomer”Christianityfor a stricter, more primeval faith, and embracing a household where women raise children and men earn.The historical reality, though, is complicated. The single-breadwinner home that trad families idealize was never the rigidnorm in American history. It was largely a mid-20th-century anomaly, made possible by an unprecedented postwar economic boom combined with generous government housing and education subsidies for veterans.In her bookThe Way We Never Were: American Families and the Nostalgia Trap, the historian Stephanie Coontz also notes that married women in earlier eras – when they did not have independent incomes, could not have their own bank accounts and had difficulty obtaining divorces – were easily trapped in abusive marriages.View image in fullscreenAstrid, Jenny and Edith.At its worst, according to former adherents, the current trad movement can replicate the ugliest tendencies of those earlier eras. In aninterviewlast year with the journalist Anne Helen Petersen, Tia Levings, a self-described former Christian fundamentalist “tradwife”, said she felt an intense pressure to project picture-perfect domesticity to the outside world even as her husband was privately spanking her and subjecting her and their children to “high control and abuse”.Some of the couples I interviewed acknowledged that the trad world, in its eagerness to set itself apart from secular liberal society, is not free of its own forms of conformity, one-upmanship, and virtue signaling. Young mothers in particular can feel pressure – often from other women – to model a certain kind of crunchy conservative purism.Would I like to go off [and] be Pa Ingalls or whatever? Maybe. But that’s not availableEdward PhillipsThere is also a fairly broad spectrum of tradness. I asked Emily where she fits.“I mean, I’m wearing pants right now, if that answers your question,” she said. She and Edward giggled. “In some circles,” she explained, “women don’t wear pants.”Emily writes in snatches, at night or while nursing, and Edward said that it is important to him that he supports her ability to write. There isan obvious tension between trying to live at a remove from modernity and documenting one’s life online, as they and others acknowledge.When it comes to the “return-to-the-land stuff”, Edward said, “we take what works, and we’re really practical about what doesn’t”. They limit their children’s screen time, and grow some of their own food, but otherwise have no aversion to technology.“Would I like to go off [and] be Pa Ingalls or whatever?” he said. “Maybe. But that’s not available.”“We’re not trying to getbackto anything,” Emily said.Joelle and Jim Kurczodyna are not necessarily trying to return to anything, either, though they know plenty of people who are. One of their friends, a trad farmer, is fond of saying that he is “going backwards as fast as I can”.The Kurczodynas are in their late 30s and live on a farmstead in Illinois. The couple are observant nondenominational Protestants, and Joelle is currently expecting their fifth child.Joelle and Jim bothgrew up in the suburbs. Jim’s family was conservative in a commonplace way; Joelle’s family less so: her baby boomer mother was a career woman who had chosen, on feminist grounds, to work in a male-dominated field.“I kind of went the opposite way,” Joelle said. “Where she chose to do computer science and engineering, I said: ‘Well, I’m going to stay home with my kids, because that feels like bucking the system a little bit to what I grew up with.’”For the most part, however, Joelle and Jim began their marriage living a mundane suburban life not too different from their parents’. That changed when Joelle encountered fertility problems. Those sent her on a nutrition and alternative health “rabbit hole”, she said, that led her and Jim to become interested in growing their own organic food and renegotiating their relationship with the modern world. (The US health department, under Robert F Kennedy Jr, recently expressed interest in promoting “holistic” alternatives to IVF, though medical professionals havecriticizedthese treatments as a misleading rebranding of common fertility practices.)Jim and Joelle’s Christian faith had also become increasingly important to them, and they became uneasy with what progressive public schools might be teaching children.When they decided, in 2019, that Jim would quit his stable job so they could move to a dilapidated country property, “it was scary, and it was a difficult thing to explain to a lot of people at the time”, Joelle said.Familyand friends were shocked and, at the time, less than supportive.Jim and Joelle turned their experimental lifestyle change into a popularblogand social media account that they eventually monetized. That business now provides a full-time income to supplement their farming, but they still live with extreme frugality. They also still find themselves feeling like they need to defend some of their decisions.Joelle had always been excited about her pregnancies, but when she became pregnant with their fifth child she was suddenly self-conscious. “For whatever reason, it just felt like up to four children feels pretty ‘normal’, but when we had the fifth one, it felt like that’s pushing it,” she said. She had heard people make remarks about “family size” that made her worry that her pregnancy might “not be seen as a positive”.Both are wary of pressing their views on others and keep their web presence mostly focused on the practical aspects of homesteading – which “isn’t for everyone”, either, Joelle emphasized. Yet they have found a large audience, including a lot of people “living in the city, living in the suburbs, whatever”, she said.Left: religious iconography in the Thomas home: Right: Flowers on the family propertyThey get a steady stream of messages, Jim said, from “people that have kind of followed our story, and then followed a similar path. Which is really scary on our end, because they’re thanking us for our inspiration, and leaving their house and jobs and cutting out to the country and buying a milk cow or something.”He chuckled nervously: “And we’re like, hope it works out for you.”Keturah and Andy Hickman feel that cars and airplanes are unnatural and avoid them whenever possible. To get around their small village in upstate New York, the couple walk or bicycle; for longer distances, they take trains or buses.“People sometimes wonder if [we’re] mentally ill,” Andy said.Andy also objects to full-time employment, which he considers a recent civilizational development, and Keturah, whobelievesthat men should be attracted to “women as God made them”, doesn’t shave her legs. Although she tries to avoid judging “individual women for how they dress”, she also finds the idea of women wearing trousers “to be very perverse”, she admitted when I spoke to her and Andy.Keturah, 29, and Andy, 31, are about to welcome their first child. The couple are eachprolificwriters on Substack, where their arguments for intentional anachronism – for choosing to inhabit, as Keturah has put in, a “third-world bubble” inside the 21st-century US – are read by thousands.Keturah grew up in Missouri in a family of Christians so fundamentalist that they considered most Protestant denominations suspiciously Romish. She is fourth-generation home schooled – her family started decades before it was legal – and has no social security number because her great-grandfather was opposed to registering with the state. To this day she is, she said, an “undocumented American citizen”.Andy speaks in a slight drawl that sounds almost southern, though he grew up in upstate New York, in a “bucolic country town that is very depressed, is very irrelevant and obscure, but looks like a Norman Rockwell painting”. His family were cultural Catholics, not particularly devout. He was an only child, and his father was not present in his life; he spent long periods of time in nature.The man leads spiritually, he leads financially, and the woman followsKeturah HickmanAs a young adult, he hitchhiked across the US and immersed himself in anarchist and environmentalist writing, even finding the critique by Ted Kaczynski (better known as the Unabomber) of industrial society formative. Over time, his search for the roots of modernity’s problems led him into conservative Christian critiques. He now describes himself as a graduate of the “anarcho-primitivist to traditionalist Catholic pipeline” and believes the US should be a Catholic monarchy.The couple met in 2023 through a mutual online friend who enjoyed playing matchmaker to young trads. “She had me fill out a questionnaire about things I wanted in a man,” Keturah said. “One of the things I said was: ‘I do not want to marry someone who has a nine-to-five job.’”A recurring theme of their writing is that young Americans can still access an affordable and fulfilling life,ifthey are willing to make certain lifestyle sacrifices.“The first job of anybody living like we’re living is to lower your expenses,” Andy said. “And that sounds like a cheeky thing to say, but it’s actually true. I’m not pulling your leg; we could thrive on $600 a month, maybe $700.”In a recent essay, hearguedthat a young couple can live on $432 a month in some rural and downtrodden places; by buying from Amish farms, cooking from scratch and supplementing their groceries with hunting, gardening and fishing, he claims that he and Keturah spend only $300 a month on food.Keturah once ran a “living room academy”, teaching sewing, canning and cooking from scratch to visiting young women. Most enjoyed it – except one, who bristled at the emphasis on women’s self-sacrifice.Keturah –who once wrote that she “loves burning books” but draws the line at the government doing it – holds two beliefs that outsiders might see as contradictory. Women, she insists, should be strong (she praised other trad women as anything but the “demure doormats” of stereotype), yet also voluntarily submit to their husband’s authority.A phrase that often crops up among trads is “headship”. According to the theory, a husband may cede to his wife control over many day-to-day household decisions, but holds ultimate authority.Keturah said: “I think of [Andy] as the head of the household, yes, but I think of the woman as the queen of the kitchen and the children. The man leads spiritually, he leads financially, and the woman follows that. And the man’s like: ‘OK, this is where the house is going to be,’ and the woman’s like: ‘OK, I’ll make this house into a home.’ And they both trust each other in that domain. Of course, there’s still this hierarchy where he’s the head of it all. But I also have my authority under that.”She and Andy also emphasized that they are opposed to a man exerting violence or coercion against a spouse.Yet headship can also lead to toxic dynamics. In 2019, a former Mormon mommy blogger,describingthe causes of her divorce, said that she suspected that traditionalist gender roles were one of the factors that strained her marriage to its breaking point.“He was treating me as an extension of himself,” she said. “So it didn’t seem inappropriate to be hard on me because I was a reflection of him.”View image in fullscreenMike Thomas holds two chicks.Some couples I spoke with emphasized that gender roles in their homes were partly pragmatic, not rigid. Male headship, they also argued, is a double-edged sword.“When there are successes,” Emily Phillips argued, “it’s clear who is to own for those, and when there are failures, it’s clear who is to own for those. That’s the hardship of being the leader.”The “paradox of choice” is the theory that humans, when offered too many options, become overwhelmed and unhappy. If liberal consumer capitalism is underpinned by the belief that individual autonomy and choice should be society’s highest values, then perhaps the trad movement is one response to the decision paralysis of modern liberal life.Faced with a dizzying barrage of technological, social and consumer choices, some people prefer fewer options: duties rather than rights, constraints rather than freedoms, defined roles rather than elastic identities.That narrowing is part of a largerreactionagainst modernity, a frustrated feeling that our secular technological age promised progress and instead brought loneliness, worsening material prospects and a numbing onslaught of social media, spam, porn, gambling, gaming and AI slop, with the cold hand of capitalism – or Satan, or both – extending further into our lives with every chime, buzz and click.Why I quit my homestead dream just as farmer tradwives became mainstreamRead moreMike argued that families like his have retreated to timeless values and institutions that can withstand the buffeting cultural winds. “It’s like, OK, we’ve seen these storms before,” he said. “Family’s important. Land is important. God is important. And those are the cores, and with them we can weather whatever is going on out there.” The pronouncement carried a gentle hint of challenge. Everyone feels this too, he seemed to be saying, even if they are scared to admit it.For some, this rebellion is very much a political project – one that is at times theocratic, even fascistic.As a community, trads are overwhelmingly white, probably in part because non-white families find it harder to feel enthusiastic about reconstructing the past. In her bookMomfluenced, the writer Sara Petersen suggests that “nostalgia for the good old days and the romanticization of traditional values [are] inherently tied to whiteness”. She speaks to Koritha Mitchell, a literary historian who argues that trad life tends to “reflect the pleasure to be found in a particular kind of escape: insularity”.Trad women sometimes seem more radical, moremilitant, than the men. A frequent theme in sometrad circles is that motherhood is a political act – and that conservative Christians are going to win the long game against liberals by the simple fact of having more children.Earlier this year, Emily Phillips, the writer and mother of six, published a thoughtful essay entitledCrunchy Lies. When she had her first child, she writes, she was subjected to a barrage of intense “crunchy” and trad messaging about parenting, often involving questionable holistic health claims.As an earnest young parent and a type A sort of person, she tried to follow all of it. She worked to keep her home pure of mold, plastics, polyester and chemicals. She breastfed her first child until he was two-and-a-half.View image in fullscreenEdith and George play on their family’s property.None of it prevented her son from developing a chronic health condition. “One of the universal principles of parenting I’ve learned,” she writes, “is that there is no choice you can make as a parent which guarantees a specific outcome in your child.”Yet the urge to try to control those outcomes is all too human and relatable; so is the appeal of turning your back on much of the current world. Technology has made our lives easier, but at real costs. The anthropologist Kristen Ghodsee hasarguedthat some American conservatives haveembracedtrad messaging because they are trying to get women out of the workforce in order to pre-empt looming job losses caused by AI.When I visited him, Mike Thomas expressed a larger revulsion at the capitalist techno-futurism of Peter Thiel and Elon Musk, and a particular anxiety about the world that Silicon Valley is bringing into being.“AI is a reduction of humanity, of our idea of intelligence and existence and consciousness, into a technical system,” he said. “But the full human cannot be reduced to a sum of parts.”Jenny had taken the children to bed. Darkness had fallen; crickets were chirping. “We bleed into the mysterious, into eternity,” he said. “I want my kids to know that they have asoul.”"

At a bare minimum, they should be far more heavily regulated.”The sites have a duty to report evidence of trafficking and exploitation to the police, but campaign groups have warned that police often fail to spot victims of exploitation.“There’s a really inconsistent approach by law enforcement around the country; there’s often a real nervousness when it comes to interacting with women in those environments. Many of these women have a naturaldistrust of law enforcement and authorities, and they have often been told to have that distrust by the people that are exploiting them,” Lyons said.Signs of potential trafficking might be seeing the same women advertised multiple times at different locations, or when the same phone number is used for different women, suggesting that someone is controlling their work.“I find it shocking that there are websites where women are openly being advertised and they are so unregulated. I think the lack of awareness about adult service websites is alarming, particularly when we know there’s a high correlation between women and girls who are sexually exploited and sexually trafficked who appear on these websites,” Lyons said. “The online world has massively facilitated the sexual exploitation of women.”A Vivastreet spokesperson said: “Vivastreet is regulated by Ofcom under the Online Safety Act and takes safety extremely seriously.

All our adverts are screened via a range of indicators informed by police advice, with suspicious content referred proactively to a central policing unit.”Some women working in the sex industry argue that the transition to advertising their services online has allowed them to work more safely and independently, enabling them to screen clients before meeting them. But Lyons said the shift had also made it harder for organisations to support exploited women.“Previously, charity workers would have been able to walk around areas where they knew that they may come across women and girls who were being sexually exploited on the street and reach out to them directly, to provide them with care and offer them support. The internet means that a lot of this has gone online and is now happening behind closed doors, in rented Airbnbs, in flats, in a much less visible form, so it’s easier for traffickers to move victims around.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, further arrests will be made if we need to tackle disorder.”In Essex, police have put in place a section 60AA order giving the force the power to order the removal of face coverings and a dispersal order before a planned protest in Epping on Saturday evening.The section 60AA order will run for 24 hours and the dispersal order, which covers the main high street and the area surrounding the Bell hotel, will be in place until 4am on Sunday.Glen Pavelin, an assistant chief constable with Essex police, said: “We never take the decision to impose restrictions on members of the public lightly.“However, we must guard against the impact of antisocial behaviour on our community and these orders will give us extra powers to deal with that should it become necessary to do so.”The prime minister, Keir Starmer, wrote on X: “I am clear: we will not reward illegal entry. If you cross the Channel unlawfully, you will be detained and sent back.”In Falkirk, activists who descended on a hotel were met by hundreds of counter-protesters.Two separate demonstrations were called by the Save Our Future and Our Kids Futures group in the town on Saturday over concerns about alleged crimes linked to those housed at the Cladhan hotel.Hundreds gather outside the office of the local Scottish Labour MP, Euan Stainbank.More than 200 people later assembled outside the nearby Cladhan hotel, which is believed to house asylum seekers waiting for their claims to be processed.Stainbank said: “We must fix the broken asylum system which has not worked for years – for communities such as Falkirk, and for those seeking refuge from persecution.“The Labour government’s actions, within days of entering office, to end the Tories’ Rwanda scheme, focus resources on processing claims and ending needless processing pauses will allow us to close all the Tory-created asylum hotels during this parliament.”The protest is the second in as many weeks outside the Cladhan hotel. Another demonstration took place outside a facility in Perth last week.Explore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The matter was reported to police the same day.“The sexual assault by penetration charge relates to an incident on Monday 5 May in Warbleton, East Sussex.“The victim is being supported by specialist officers.”Brocket finished fourth in the 2004 series of I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here! when Kerry Katona, the former pop singer, was declared the winner.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

That is why I am calling time on this unilateral act of economic disarmament and Labour’s impossible ideology of net zero by 2050.“So, a future Conservative government will scrap all mandates for the North Sea beyond maximising extraction.“It is time that common sense, economic growth and our national interest came first, and only theConservativeswill deliver that. We are going to get all our oil and gas out of the North Sea.”Last month, the energy and net zero secretary,Ed Miliband, accused the Conservatives of being “anti-science”by abandoning a political consensus on net zero.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In half of them, their high blood pressure is uncontrolled or resistant to existing treatments. They face a much higher risk of heart attack, stroke, kidney disease and early death.Now a blockbuster new drug – baxdrostat – has been shown in trials to significantly lower blood pressure in those people whose levels remain dangerously high despite taking several medicines.The results of the BaxHTN study, which involved 796 patients from 214 clinics worldwide, showed that after 12 weeks, patients taking baxdrostat saw their blood pressure fall by about 9-10 mmHg (millimetres of mercury, the unit of measurement of blood pressure) more than placebo – a reduction large enough to cut cardiovascular risk.About four in 10 patients taking the drug – 1mg (39.4%) or 2mg (40%) once daily in tablet form – reached healthy blood pressure levels, compared with fewer than two in 10 (18.7%) on placebo.Details of the breakthrough against stubbornly high blood pressure were revealed at the European Society of Cardiology congress in Madrid, the world’s largest heart conference. Results from the trial, which was sponsored by AstraZeneca, were simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine.Principal investigator Prof Bryan Williams, chair of medicine at UCL, said: “I’ve never seen blood pressure reductions of this magnitude with a drug. Achieving a nearly 10 mmHg reduction in systolic blood pressure with baxdrostat in the BaxHTN phase-3 trial is exciting, as this level of reduction is linked to substantially lower risk of heart attack, stroke, heart failure and kidney disease.“I think this could be a gamechanger in the way we approach difficult to control or hard to control blood pressure. The results suggest that this drug could help up to half a billion people globally.”The breakthrough has taken decades of research to achieve.Blood pressure is strongly influenced by a hormone called aldosterone, which helps the kidneys regulate salt and water balance. Some people produce too much aldosterone, causing the body to hold on to salt and water. This aldosterone dysregulation pushes blood pressure up and makes it very difficult to control.Tackling aldosterone dysregulation has been a key target of research over many years, but until now it has been impossible to achieve. Baxdrostat works by blocking aldosterone production, directly addressing this driver of high blood pressure.“This drug development is really a triumph of scientific discovery,” Williams told reporters at the conference in Madrid.“Aldosterone is a well-known driver of hypertension, but for decades, scientists have struggled to block its production in a precise way. Baxdrostat is one of the first therapies to do so selectively, showing meaningful BP [blood pressure] reductions in uncontrolled or resistant hypertension.”Historically, wealthier western countries were reported to have greatly increased levels of high blood pressure. However, largely due to changing diets, the numbers of people living with hypertension is now far higher in eastern and lower-income countries. More thanhalf of those affected live in Asia, including 226 million people in China and 199 million in India.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This helps ensure the findings are relevant to the range of patients we see with blood pressure problems.”Separately, doctors in Madrid were told that a cholesterol-busting jab administered twice a year has the potential to transform heart care.New trial data presented at the conference suggestedLeqvio, also known as inclisiranand made by Novartis, helped patients meet their cholesterol goals faster than other therapies. Patients also experienced less muscle pain, a common side-effect of statins, the cholesterol-lowering medication.Explore more on these topicsHigh blood pressureHeart diseaseStrokeHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Here is an extraordinary work of art, a wholly unique historical document, an artefact without equivalent anywhere – and which expert opinion agrees, overwhelmingly, cannot travel. It’s not complicated.”‘Momentous occasion’: how Bayeux Museum finally said yes to tapestry loanRead moreMacron first suggestedlending the Bayeux tapestryto the UK – as previously requested by London, and rejected by Paris, for the coronation of Elizabeth II in 1953 and, in 1966, for the 900th anniversary of the Battle of Hastings – in 2018.Conceived as the sort of momentous cultural offer that might help sustain British ties to the continent even as it was preparing to quit the EU, the plan foundered ascross-Channel relations souredduring the bitter Brexit negotiations and their aftermath.The idea was resurrected as relations gradually improved after Boris Johnson and Liz Truss left Downing St, and accelerated with Keir Starmer’s EU “reset”. French officials say King Charles was also instrumental and personally “very supportive” of the plan.But the loan agreement to celebrate cross-Channel reconciliation – which will also involve French museums displaying artefacts from the Anglo-Saxon burial site Sutton Hoo, andthe Lewis Chessmen– ignores decades of warnings about the state of the tapestry.View image in fullscreenThe fabric has been weakened by being suspended from a rail for display, experts say.Photograph: Hemis/AlamyHoused since 1983 in a purpose-built museum in Bayeux due to close next month for a major two-year renovation, the fabric has been severely weakened by age but also, experts say, by being displayed suspended from a rail, rather than laid out flat.Some of the most damning arguments against the plan have come from curators and restorers who have worked or are working on the tapestry, five of whom have told Rykner – on condition of anonymity – of their disbelief and concern.Precisely because the tapestry was considered too fragile to move far, complexplans were already under wayto remove it from display and store it during the museum’s rebuilding work, with a full restoration to follow once it was returned.“We fell off our chairs when we heard,” said one conservator. “It’s the opposite of all we had prepared for.”Any movement at all of the canvas, in a state of “absolute fragility”, was “fraught with risk, an incredibly delicate operation”, said another.Now the embroidery is set to be carried over a distance of possibly more than 500km (310 miles) “in its most fragile state, with its stabilising lining already removed, and before its restoration”, said a third.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As early as 2018, Antoine Verney, the chief curator at the Bayeux Museum, said he “could not conceive” of it being moved far.A report by eight antique textile experts in 2020 recommended a full restoration, identifying 24,204 stains, 16,445 creases, 9,646 deficiencies and 30 “non-stabilised” tears, and a pre-restoration study in 2021 “advised strongly against transporting the tapestry over a long distance (for more than an hour)”.That study added: “The longer the timeframe for micro-alterations to occur, the greater the risk that visible and irreversible alterations will appear”, especially since “no vibration-absorption system currently exists that can eliminate all risk during transportation”.View image in fullscreenA full restoration of the tapestry was recommended in 2020.Photograph: Ville de Bayeux/APYet another analysis the following year reached much the same conclusion,according to Le Monde– but remains confidential except to companies submitting tenders for a full feasibility study into the tapestry’s proposed removal to London, Rykner said.So far, the French government has barely acknowledged the experts’ concerns. Macron went out of his way to dismiss them, saying in July thatFrancehad “found the best experts of the world to explain in perfect detail” why the loan “was impossible”, but “we decided” otherwise.Philippe Bélaval, the president’s special adviser on the project, has insisted the tapestry is “absolutely not untransportable”, referring to an “extremely precise” – but confidential – report from early this year detailing what precautions must be taken.“Playing with words,” said Rykner. “The transport had already been decided, soit was not the job of this report– about which we know strictly nothing – to argue against it. Any artwork is transportable. The question is, in what condition will it arrive?”The fact of the matter, Rykner said, was that Macron, famously enamoured of both the grand theatrical gesture and making his own decisions, had placed politics over the conservation of an exceptionally vulnerable piece of cultural heritage.One of thetender documents related to the loan, Rykner said, contained what was probably a mistake, but a revealing one: “The loan of the Bayeux tapestry has been granted”, it reads, “by the President of the Republic, owner of the work …”In the 17th century, Louis XIV, the Sun King, apocryphally said: ‘“L’état, c’est moi” (“I am the state.”) This, Rykner said, was a case of “‘La tapisserie, c’est moi.’ It’s outrageous, and people are starting to see why it must be stopped.”Explore more on these topicsBayeux tapestryEmmanuel MacronBritish MuseumFranceLondonEuropeMuseumsnewsShareReuse this content"

A murder investigation has been launched and the president,Volodymyr Zelenskyy, condemned the killing as a “horrific murder”.Europe’s foreign ministers met in Copenhagen to discuss possible measures to force Moscow to the negotiating table. Speaking at a press conference after the meeting, the EU foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said that Russia was “clearly not preparing for peace”.“TheEuropean Unionand all the member states support the diplomatic efforts to achieve peace and the end of Russia’s war. But it’s clear that Russia is not preparing for peace. It is the opposite: they are preparing for more war,” she said. Ministers also discussed the war in Gaza and the deepening humanitarian crisis there.The summit, which was an informal meeting and as such did not involve ministers committing to any concrete steps, took place at the end of a violent week. Russia launched a large airstrike on Kyiv,killing at least 21 peopleon Thursday. There was also an overnight strike on a five-storey residential building that killed one person and injured 24 others in Zaporizhzhia, and the Dnipropetrovsk region faced a “massive attack” early on Saturday, its governor said, with strikes in Dnipro and Pavlograd.View image in fullscreenThe aftermath of Russia’s overnight strike on Zaporizhzhia, which hit a five-storey building killing one person and injuring 24 others.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesSince the invasion of Ukraine, the EU has imposed 18 packages of sanctions againstRussia, with the latest adopted in July. Ministers on Saturday discussed options for a fresh package, with measures floated including import bans and tariffs; secondary sanctions, which would affect third parties trading with the country; and stepping up efforts against Russian shadow fleet ships, which have been used to evade western sanctions on its oil exports.The question of using Russia’s frozen assets for Ukraine’s reconstruction was also discussed. “Ministers acknowledged the need to address Ukraine’s financing gap and to hold Russia accountable for war damages. To achieve this, it is crucial to explore all avenues while minimising the potential risks,” Kallas said, underlining that financial markets “did not react when the assets were frozen”.“One thing is clear: given the devastation Russia has caused and is causing, it is unthinkable that Russia will ever see this money again unless it fully compensates Ukraine for damages caused,” she said. The cost of Ukraine’s reconstruction has beenestimated at €506bn (£438bn) over the next decade.Ministers will propose next steps in the coming week, the EU foreign policy chief said, noting that any action taken “would be stronger if matched by our transatlantic partners”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Assessing 100 days of Reform-led councilsSome are happy to see new faces in the chambers but many are frustrated with a lack of improvements on the ground since party’s sweeping victoriesMark BrownNorth of England correspondentSat 30 Aug 2025 03.45 EDTFirst published on Sat 30 Aug 2025 01.00 EDTShare“This motion is bizarre to say the least,” said a bemusedDoncasterLabour councillor as Reform proposed that the council fly no flags apart from the union flag from its buildings.It would not just mean no Pride flag on Pride Day,a debate heard. It would mean no white rose flag on Yorkshire Day, no Rovers flag celebrating the football teamwinning the league, no St George’s flag marking England’s Lionesses’ Euros triumph, and no green flags celebrating municipal park management achievements in the city’s green spaces. The motion was “a waste of time and a waste of resources”, one councillor said.Meanwhile, atNottinghamshirecounty council, climate change was being discussed. Bert Bingham is the Reform councillor now responsible for the council’s environmental policies. He does not believe human-made climate change exists, saying it is a “hoax” and that declaring a climate emergency is “ridiculous and nonsensical”. The media had brainwashed the public about the whole subject, he said.In Kent, a Reform councillorboastedabout ensuring the removal of “trans-ideological material and books” from the children’s section of the county’s libraries. It later emerged the books were not there in the first place.In Durham, the Reform deputy council leader, a gay man,pledgedthat Durham Pride “won’t get a single penny from this council next year”. It received less than £10,000 from the council this year.Welcome to the world of local government inEnglandafter the success of Nigel Farage’s Reform party on 1 May this year. The party recently celebrated 100 days in power in local councils with an extensive press release trumpeting its work, including “rolling back the net zero agenda” and “flying patriotic flags”. It boasted of Staffordshire county council’s attempt to stop all solar, wind or battery farms, and Kent council cancelling climate-friendly property modifications, as well as other decisions including not upgrading buses to electric vehicles and scrapping EV charging points.Farage has been front and centre on the summer front pages, which aides said was part of a desire to look more prime ministerial, holding a press conference every Monday of the parliamentary recess. Here, he has announced a slew of defections, not only of former Tory MPs but a number of key local politicians, including a Tory police and crime commissioner and a member of the Scottish parliament.Though much of the national party focus has been on small boats and asylum hotels – particularly the controversy over the Bell hotel in Essex – Farage has begun to turn the national spotlight on to houses in multiple occupation (HMOs) used to accommodate asylum seekers. Reform councils are also beginning to emphasise these, setting up another potential national flashpoint. Durham and West Northamptonshire councils have begun crackdowns on the use and conversion of HMOs.View image in fullscreenReform-supporting protesters holding placards opposing houses in multiple occupation outside county hall in Durham in July.Photograph: Mark Pinder/The GuardianReform is on a high but how effective is it in power? Has anything changed for residents? Why did people vote for the party and what do they expect?Reform won outright majorities inKent, Durham, Derbyshire, Lancashire, Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire, Staffordshire, North Northamptonshire, West Northamptonshire and Doncaster. In the Hull and East Yorkshire combined authority, Luke Campbell, a former Olympic boxer, was elected as its first mayor.The party was mostly wresting control from the Conservatives but election night was also terrible for Labour. In Durham, Reform succeeded a coalition of Liberal Democrats, independents and Conservatives in what was once a solid Labour stronghold. This year, Labour won four seats compared with Reform’s 65. To put that into perspective, in 2017 Labour had 94 of the council’s then 126 seats. It now has four of 98 seats.‘Telling us like it is’On the streets of Consett, once a proud, thriving steel town inCounty Durham, it is easy to find people who voted Reform. It is easy to find people who voted Labour at the general election. It is hard to find anyone who says they would vote for Keir Starmer’s Labour today.View image in fullscreenCorey Barron.Photograph: Mark Pinder/The GuardianCorey Barron, 27, who was recently made redundant, said he used to vote Labour like all of his family. “Up here, all of us were Labour but look what has been done to the country in the past year,” he said.“Reform are the only ones telling us like it is. Labour have told us about a load of policies but haven’t stuck to them. Reform are the only ones being honest. People can see we need someone different.”Yvonne Hillier, a McDonald’s worker, said she was “Lib Dem through and through” but understood why so many people were voting Reform.View image in fullscreenYvonne Hillier.Photograph: Mark Pinder/The GuardianHer two children, in their 20s, still live with her. “They just can’t afford to get on the housing ladder,” she said. “There are so many problems, so I can see why people voted Reform … but I couldn’t vote for them. I liked Nigel Farage in the jungle. I don’t like him the way he is now.”View image in fullscreenJohn Gardner.Photograph: Mark Pinder/The GuardianIt is market day in Consett and there are just two stalls, including that of John Gardiner selling fruit, veg and flowers. “I’ve been coming 20 years and seen this street full, but not now,” he said.The farmer had always voted Conservative until May, when he voted Reform. “I think they [the Tories] are in a bit of a muddle at the moment, they need to sort themselves out. You just want anyone who gets in to do a good job.”View image in fullscreenJulie Walker.Photograph: Mark Pinder/The GuardianJulie Walker, a receptionist and former Labour voter, ticked Reform for the first time at the council elections. “I just think we need somebody fresh and new,” she said. “I’m not a fan of Starmer, I just don’t think he cares what the average person thinks … immigration is a massive issue.”Many people the Guardian approached either said they had no interest or thought every party was as bad as the other.Of course, not everyone had voted Reform. “Are you fucking kidding me,” said Peter Wood when asked. “I blame the BBC for bringing Farage into the limelight.”His partner, Sheila Johnson, said she could not believe so many Reform councillors had been elected in Durham. “None of them have any experience. They don’t know what they are doing. God knows what’s going to happen.”View image in fullscreenSheila Johnson and Peter Wood.Photograph: Mark Pinder/The GuardianNeither liked Starmer and both were thinking of supporting Jeremy Corbyn’s new party. As was Peter Monroe, a retired secondhand book dealer.“I disagree with all [Reform’s] policies,” he said. “I’m disheartened. The fact that Reform got in is terrible and it saddens me that it would happen in this strong, working-class area.“One of the first things they did when they got in at County Durham was ban flying the flag in solidarity with Ukraine at county hall. It was just wrong.”View image in fullscreenPeter Monroe.Photograph: Mark Pinder/The GuardianIf an alien were to land in England this summer they would assume the English had an obsession with flags.Opposition councillors say flag policies have taken up an inordinate amount of debating time, and as how life has changed for residents, the answer is “not much”, they say.Some Reform councillors also acknowledge that. It will take time, they say.At the most recent full meeting of Warwickshire council, the Lib Dem councillor Sarah Boad complained of “stagnation … no ideas, no plans, except for silly, silly things that get press coverage but don’t actually help the residents of Warwickshire”.A clearly exasperated Reform councillor, Michael Bannister, replied: “We’ve been here two months and they want policy, policy, policy, policy.”The leader of Warwickshire council, an authority with a £2bn budget, is George Finch, a 19-year-old who still lives at home and cannot drive.Wits have invoked Pitt the Younger, or“young snotty” from Blackadder the Third, when writing about Finch, providing an excuse to repeat some of the character’s best lines: “My three main policy priorities are: one, war with France; two, tougher sentences for geography teachers; and three, a right royal kick of the prince’s backside!”Finch has called critics of his lack of experience “ageist”. Hetold the BBC: “All I see is age … I don’t care about my age. Would people be questioning if there was a 70-year-old at the helm? Probably not. Joe Biden, Donald Trump, presidents that are older – no one questions it. But they’re questioning someone who is 19.”At West Northamptonshire, the Conservatives laid out a formal motion addressing the lack of a corporate plan from Reform. There was “no vision, no manifesto, no plan” from Reform, said the Conservative councillor Daniel Lister.But the council’s Reform leader, Mark Arnull, toldthe BBC: “The danger when we write manifestos is that sometimes you have to keep to them.”‘Doge’ unitsThe “give us time” plea is one that has been expressed by a number of Reform councillors. Political observers say it is a message that comes from not having had firm plans in the first place.Colin Talbot, an emeritus professor of politics at the University of Manchester, said: “I went through Reform’s national policy statements and they had no policies whatsoever on local government. Nothing at all. They really haven’t thought about local government and what they want to do with it.”In speeches before the election, Farage spoke of fixing a broken Britain, which included “broken councils”. On 2 May, he warned that council staff working on diversity or climate change initiatives should be “seeking alternative careers”.The party has pledged to save money by sending in an Elon Musk-style “department of government efficiency” (Doge) unit to examine all council spending in the areas it controls. It would use artificial intelligence, advanced data analysis tools and forensic auditing techniques to “identify wasteful spending and recommend actionable solutions”.Talbot said he believed there was little scope for any major savings because councils had already gone through more than a decade of austerity. “There is nothing left to cut, basically.”He said the 10 councils Reform had control of had already agreed to savings totalling £500m because of the extreme financial pressure on local government.And even if they find possible savings, Reform’s “Doge units” might find it tricky to force through cuts. “These units are not part of the council,” Talbot said. “They’ve not been authorised by the council. They are Reform entities and they’ve got no legal standing with the council. I suspect council officials will put up roadblocks to them getting access to data and so on, unless they’re instructed to by Reform councillors.“Even then, I suspect they’ll be open to legal challenge if it involves handing over things like people’s personal data about their council taxes and so on. So they’re pretty hemmed in.”If anything, Reform has been accused of costing taxpayers money because of several byelections being held since May after its councillors stepped down for various reasons. Each byelection is estimated to cost councils £25,000.In Nottinghamshire, a Reform councillor quit after six days because, a full council meeting heard, “he realised he wasn’t up for the job”. A Conservative won the byelection. In Durham, a Reform councillor resigned after a week forfailing to declarehe worked for the council. ALib Dem councillorwas elected in his place.That is not to say the Reform bandwagon has stopped. Its candidates have won other byelections caused by resignations and the party also gained its first council seat at the polls in London – Alan Cook won aBromley byelectionfrom a turnout of 28%.‘Wrong side of the tide’Reform continues to perform strongly in opinion polls, and many on the left and centre are worried.Talbot, who has experience of many elections over the decades, said Reform’s May victories needed to be treated with caution.“They have established quite a strong beachhead in local government,” he said. “However, beachhead is probably the right word because they’re on the wrong side of the tide. More than half of the councils they’ve taken over are top-tier county councils, which are due to disappear under the local government reorganisation.”Talbot said Reform’s success came from protest votes. “They only do well when they are standing for impotent levels of government, so Ukip did well when they stood for the European parliament. But when it comes to central government, actual elections not polls, they tend to do not very well at all.“Also, there aren’t any local charismatic leaders coming out of any of this. Reform isn’t the sort of party which would encourage that anyway … it’s Farage’s party. You can’t imagine anyone challenging him, whereas you can in the Lib Dems, Tories or Labour.”View image in fullscreenClimate protesters rally outside county hall in Durham.Photograph: Mark Pinder/The GuardianMore than 100 days into their tenure, Reform councils have faced hundreds of protesters outside full meetings. In Durham, they were casually dismissed by the deputy leader, Darren Grimes, as “the jobless masses”.Inside council chambers, Reform councillors are going out of their way to present a united front. In Durham, they posed for anawkward group photowearing “Make Durham Great Again” baseball caps.How long can they stay united? Will Reform councils go the way of theonly Ukip-led council, Thanet, where in 2015 the party lost its majority after less than five months because of splits.“They are, by nature, a bunch of mavericks and protesters and dissidents,” Talbot said. “They very quickly fall out with each other usually … there is no cultural cohesion to them as a party. They tend to fall apart very quickly.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

We have to get our heads around how we’re going to make that transition from the old world to the new world.”Earlier this week, figures from the Office for National Statistics showed the fertility rate for England and Wales hadfallen for the third year in a rowto reach a record low of 1.41. The rate represents the average number of live children women can expect to have in their child-bearing life.The global fertility crisis: are fewer babies a good or a bad thing? Experts are dividedRead moreThe figures are part of a long-term trend of declining fertility ratesacross much of the globe– and experts are still working out exactly what the repercussions will be for our society and economy.“We’re going to have an ageing population, so we need to think about the ages we start work, the ages we finish work, and how we organise the life course,” said Falkingham. “These are a lot of big policy challenges and we’ll have to think through what the solutions will be.”Some of the effects are already being felt, with schools in some parts of the UKclosing or mergingdue to declining pupil numbers, and the sector expected to lose £1bn in funding by 2030. In June it was announced that five primary schools in Westminster, central London, would be merged to two, after they reported declining pupil numbers, put down to housing costs and falling birthrates.Fertility rate graph for England and WalesPaul Morland, a demographer and the author ofNo One Left: Why the World Needs More Children, said the sharp decline in fertility rates meant that “instead of just steadily building up the problem for the future, we’re dramatically building up the problem for the future”.“You’ll start seeing that in schools closing. And what that means is in 20 years’ time, we will have a smaller and smaller number of people of working age. That’s going to make the public finances impossible, and the welfare state unsustainable,” he said.View image in fullscreenThere is concern about who will care for our ageing population.Photograph: Daniel Balakov/Getty ImagesDr Rebecca Montacute, the research director at theSocial Market Foundation, a cross-party thinktank, said declining fertility rates caused “major economic challenge” in the long term.“You simply will have fewer people of working age who are able to pay taxes and then actually pay for all of the goods and services that we need in the wider economy. At the same time, you have more ageing people, and they have obviously a heavy cost to the state in terms of the health and social care they need,” she said.This would leave government with a “stark choice” between reducing public services or bringing in younger workers from abroad, both of which were politically challenging, she said.However, there are many who say a declining fertility rate is no cause for alarm, and will actually bring environmental and economic benefits due to less consumption and demand for resources.Dr Joshua Hill, the chief research and operations officer at the charityPopulation Matters, said: “Tackling biodiversity loss, like rewilding, is easier to do with a lower population, and it also leads to a reduction in pollution and waste.“For the UK, having a smaller population makes everything easier. It increases our food security. Health crises become lower. We are a small nation with a high population density. Everything is scarce, relatively.”The UK population is predicted to grow to 86 million by 2100, fuelled by net migration (without migration, it is modelled to fall to 48 million), so Hill argues there is little concern about a declining workforce in the short term. He said the advent of artificial intelligence could lead to a reduced demand for workers anyway.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Japan, for instance, is starting to roll outhome-care robotsto help look after its ageing population.But Japan should also act a warning for what could come in the future, Morland said. “People say Japan is not falling to pieces, and that’s true. But it has got massive debt and its innovation and creativity has gone down and down. So it definitely suggests long-term decline, whether that’s government debt or the number of patents,” he said.Japan has also seen anepidemic of lonely deaths, with 68,000 people expected to die alone and unnoticed this year, the majority of them over 65.“There is a risk that a lot of older people will be left uncared for,” Morland said. “There’s a lot of dependence of older people on their children, and they just won’t be there to do it.

In Poland and theNetherlands, vigilantes thronged along the German border, ready to turn back any asylum seekers they came across. In Belfast, they roamed after sunset, demanding to see the identity documents of migrants and people of colour.Each of the groups, who are part of a renewed wave of anti-migrant vigilantes that have sprung up in recent months acrossEurope, have sought to cast themselves as a sort of protective force. But those who have studied vigilantes warn that their actions often exacerbate security concerns, sow fear and fuel the far right.“Most of this is symbolic. They don’t stop migration. They don’t create more safety in the streets,” said Tore Bjørgo, a professor at the University of Oslo and former director of the university’s Centre for Research on Extremism. “It’s a show for media and often for political purposes because, quite often, the extreme-right and far-right organisations use this as a way to get publicity and recruit new members.”View image in fullscreenMen wearing masks and balaclavas hold chains, sticks and baseball bats during a fourth night of anti-migrant riots in Torre-Pacheco, in the province of Murcia, Spain, last month.Photograph: Olmo Blanco/Getty ImagesEurope has long seen waves of anti-migrant vigilantes, often springing up as the discourse around migration hardens. This summer has been no exception: Spain had days of turbulence in the south-eastern province of Murcia after dozens of baton-wielding individuals took to the streets to“hunt” peoplewith foreign origins, while Belfast, in Northern Ireland,has grappledwith a campaign of intimidation targeting people of colour. In Poland, self-declared “citizen patrols”, at times numbering in the hundreds,gathered alongthe border with Germany earlier this summer, insisting their presence was needed to prevent asylum seekers from moving between the two countries.The Netherlands had a similar movement, with a dozen or so people heading to the German border near the villages of Ter Apel and Sellingen in June. Sporting high-visibility vests and lamps, theyreportedlyspent one night flagging down vehicles, asking people to show identification.View image in fullscreenProtesters clash with police in Torre-Pacheco, in Murcia, Spain, where a crowd reportedly chased people they suspected to be immigrants.Photograph: Olmo Blanco/Getty ImagesRights campaigners andgovernmentshave described the actions as being grounded in fear and supercharged by misinformation. In the lead-up to the unrest in Spain, racist messaging on social media rocketed by 1,500%,according totracking by the central government, while the Warsaw-basedHelsinki Foundation for Human Rightslinked the actions in Poland to “a radicalising political narrative that portrays migration as a threat, fuelling social fears and distrust of state institutions”.‘In 14 years, never anything like this’: Ballymena’s foreigners describe fear after riotingRead moreWhile the vigilantes may be acting out of fear, they often also provoke it among those they purport to protect. “There’s very little evidence that they make people feel that their streets are more secure – quite the opposite,” said Bjørgo, who noted that while they rarely used physical violence, their militant style displayed a capacity for violence that was quite frightening, particularly to minorities. “Quite a few of the participants are well-known criminals and violent people, so they are generally causing more fear than they are creating a sense of safety.”For some, vigilantism offers a means of rebranding themselves. Research carried out on one group inNorwayin 2016 found that manymembers had a criminal history, ranging from domestic violence to drug dealing and burglary. “This is a way to improve their standing in the community,” said Bjørgo. “It’s a show of masculinity and protecting women.”Recent reportsfrom Icelandand Northern Ireland suggest that convicted criminals remain a mainstay of these movements. In Iceland, the chair of the national police union, Fjölnir Seæmundsson, said police had been told that the vigilantes,who have suggested that their goal is to protect Icelanders from migrants, had made threats against people who had criticised them, including telling women that they needed to be “silenced for good”.The idea of people thinking they could take the law into their own hands was a cause for concern, hetold the local news site Vísir. “There are numerous examples that suggest this only ends badly.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And then the tabloids and other media started to pay attention.”This attention was swiftly parlayed into influence. “They were using the patrols, the vigilantism, the security measures, to show refugees – who have fled wars, who have nothing, who are waiting to cross – not as people who fall within the field of humanitarian concern, but within the fields of security concerns. And that may have a big influence on public opinion,” he said.View image in fullscreenAbout 300 people gathered for a ‘citizen patrol’ on the Polish-German border in Lubieszyn, Poland, in June.Photograph: Marcin Bielecki/EPAIn this way, vigilantes have become part of a wider ecosystem, helping to build the case for those who insist migration must be addressed solely through border walls and fences. “This process started before these groups existed,” said Gardenier. “But I think they strengthen that process and feed into the factions who want borders to act as a massive security device.”Ultimately, as groups marched through streets across Europe, creating content and capturing headlines, it was the far-right who stood to gain the most, Gardenier said. “Their patrols, their activities, all that they do, are producing spectacular images, a visual show for social media,” he said. “Then this framing plays a role to shape public opinions and to push people to vote for the far right.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

It showed Trump, his cabinet and other officials giving a thumbs-up. Of the 24 people in the Oval Office, only one was Black.For those who have studied the US president’s long and troubling history of racism, the two events were more than mere coincidence. They were indicative of a man who has recently brought white nationalist perspectives from the margins back to the mainstream.Trump has vehemently denied that he is a racist, pointing toa modest increase in supportamong African American voters in last year’s election, when his opponent was a Black woman. But critics suggest that his effort to oust Cook fits a pattern of purging diverse voices from the higher ranks of leadership.“He chose to fire her out of all the governors because she’s a Black woman,” saidLaTosha Brown, co-founder of the organisation Black Voters Matter. “His goal is to get control of the Federal Reserve and for that to no longer be an autonomous, independent body. But what he does recognise is that in America everything is about race. It is as lethal as a nuclear bomb.”RFK Jr continues to make dubious health claims as CDC roils under his leadershipRead moreCooktaught economics and international relations at Michigan State University, and was previously on the faculty of Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government. She was a Marshall scholar who received degrees from Oxford University and Spelman College, a historically Black women’s college in Atlanta.Cook dedicated much of her scholarship to examining how racial discrimination and targeted violence created barriers to economic advancement for African Americans. She also advised the Nigerian and Rwandan governments on banking reforms and economic development.In 2022 she was confirmed to the Fed’s board of governors by the Senate in a party-line vote. Republicans argued that she was unqualified and found her research overly focused on race; Democrats brushed off such critiques as unfounded.On Monday, Trump said he fired Cook after the director of a housing regulatory agency, whom the president appointed, alleged that she committed mortgage fraud. She refused to resign andfiled a lawsuitclaiming that Trump has no power to remove her from office.Trump’s order aligned with his effort to expand his power across once independent parts of the federal government and broader economy andculture. It also marked another potential high-profile removal of a Black leader from the federal government amid Trump’s broader crusade against diversity and inclusion policies.Brown observed: “He knows that racism and sexism is a very effective tool to cast doubt and that’s the pathway. Lisa Cook isn’t even the chair of the board. So why would you pick her?“He picked her because he is betting that, in an industry that is probably 90% or more white male, his odds of removing her are greater than the odds for removing others from the board. That in itself is rooted in the history and how insidious racism is built into the fabric of how we see people of colour in this country.”Over the past seven months Trump has targeted other prominent Black leaders. He firedGen Charles Q Brown Jr, chair of the joint chiefs of staff, the second Black man to serve in the position. Brown had delivered speeches about racial discrimination and issued policies that promoted diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programmes in the military.The president dismissedCarla Hayden, the first Black person to serve as librarian of Congress, after a conservative advocacy organisation accused her of being a “radical”. He ousted Gwynne Wilcox, the first Black woman to sit on the National Labor Relations Board, which hears private-sector labour disputes.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump’s cabinet meets on Tuesday. In contrast to Joe Biden’s historically diverse cabinet, Trump’s has only one Black member.Photograph: Abaca/ShutterstockTrump’s critics argue that his life and career have given succour to white supremacists. In 1973 he and his father were sued for housing discrimination in New York; in 1989he took out full-page adsin several newspapers calling for the death penalty for the Central Park Five, Black and Latino youths who were later exonerated.Trump broke through in national politics with the “birther” conspiracy theory, falsely claiming that Barack Obama was not born in the US and therefore ineligible to be president. After a 2017white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, Trump said there were “very fine people on both sides”.He has reportedly described Haiti and African nations as “shithole countries”, has called Covid-19 the“Chinese virus”and“kung flu”, and, on the campaign trail last year,saidimmigrants were “poisoning the blood of our country”, echoing the rhetoric of Adolf Hitler.Since returning to the White House, Trump has imposed a travel ban on many of the world’s poorest countries even as the USgranted refugee statusto about 50 white South Africans, claiming they were victims of racial persecution and “white genocide”.He issued executive orders to curb DEI initiatives in the federal government and even sought to blame DEI for an air crash. He is seeking to purge “divisive, race-centered ideology” fromSmithsonian Institution museums, suggesting that there is too much focus on “how bad Slavery was”.The attempt to fire Cook is the most dubious move yet, prompting an outcry from Democrats and civil rights groups, who pointed to her gender and race as vital factors.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Fire or drive out smart, competent women, in particular women of color, from high ranking positions and fill many of these positions with white men.”Derrick Johnson, president and chief executive of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), said: “Dr Cook’s credentials outshine Trump’s entire cabinet. This president simply cannot stomach Black excellence when it reveals his failures, particularly those in positions of power. In reality, this is about bending theFederal Reserveto Trump’s will, and he’s using racism as a tool to do it.”But Trump’s actions are being cheered on by white nationalists. Far-right groups such as the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys have beenquoted as sayingthat they no longer need to take to the streets to demonstrate because the president has so comprehensively adopted their talking points and embraced their agenda.Antjuan Seawright, a Democratic strategist, observed: “When you have white supremacists who are holding key roles in government and you have leaders in this country who come and play footsie to their drumbeat they don’t have to resist because what they want is laid out for them in the form of a buffet.”Trump has been quick to point to Black allies when politically expedient, such as Tim Scott, the South Carolina senator, the representative Byron Donalds of Florida and Alveda King, a niece of the civil rights leader Martin Luther King. But critics note there is no guarantee this will translate to policies that address racial injustice.Nor has it manifested in significant representation at the heart of government. Towards the end of the first Trump presidency, the Washington Postidentified 59 peoplewho had held cabinet positions or served in top White House jobs. Only seven were people of colour and only one – the housing secretary, Ben Carson – was Black.In his second term, Trump has picked only one Black person to serve in his cabinet:Scott Turner, the secretary of housing and urban development. Joe Biden, by contrast, appointed the most diverse cabinet in history with more women and people of colour than any that had come before.Seawright said:“We went from generational progress to generational rollback, and what this president and this administration has done in seven months could take 70 years at least to replenish. It should be a friendly reminder for all people, but particularly African Americans, that all progress is not permanent.”Trump’s cabinet includes Pete Hegseth, a former Fox News host with no experience of running a major organisation, at the Pentagon; Robert F Kennedy Jr, a vaccine sceptic, at the health department; and Linda McMahon, a former professional wrestling executive, at the education department. The White House deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, has associated with white nationalist thinkers and groups and is the architect of his hardline immigration policy.Rashad Robinson, a civil rights leader and former president of the group Color of Change, added: “We live in a very diverse country, a country with many different types of people that come from many different backgrounds, and the president exhibits his values by who he puts in office.“This is not simply thatDonald Trumphas put only one Black person in his cabinet. It’s that Donald Trump has gone out of his way to find some of the most unqualified and ill-equipped people to put in those jobs as a way to actually avoid having to put Black people in his cabinet.”For Brown, the voting rights activist, Trump’s cabinet picks demonstrate that he is “as racist as hell”. She added: “Quite frankly, I’m glad he doesn’t have a whole lot of Black people in his cabinet because that would be deeply embarrassing to me. Who would work in that mess?”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Now there is Below the Clouds, in luminous black-and-white. It’s another of his brilliantly composed docu-mosaic assemblages of scenes and tableaux, shot from fixed camera positions without any camera narration.The title is taken from Jean Cocteau: “Vesuvius makes all the clouds in the world.” Rosi reports from Naples, a city uneasily preoccupied with the earthquakes and volcanic eruptions for which it is famed, and with the great catastrophe of AD79 that buried nearby Pompeii. We see the archaeological digs that are still disinterring vital material – and clips fromRossellini’s Journey to Italyon the subject, playing in an eerily deserted cinema (which would appear to be Rosi’s one “fictional” contrivance, but which chimes with genuine scenes of firefighters grimly clearing charred debris from a burnt-out cinema).We see long-suffering emergency line call centre workers taking calls from people all over Naples: some people just asking the time, some terrified women who are being beaten by their husbands, some reporting arsonists and wildfires, some asking if there has been an earthquake.We also see a grim expedition into the many hundreds of illicit tunnels dug underneath Naples by tomb robbers and antiquity thieves – an entire room has been looted of its frescoes, leaving behind bare walls, a grotesque monument to greed where art and beauty used to be. Meanwhile, in Naples’s port, a vast container ship has arrived bringing thousands of tonnes of Ukrainian grain (the relaxation of trade restrictions once offered by Putin as a kind of emollient gesture) and Syrian workers on the ship are shown talking about their lives.There is a real end-of-days quality to this film: it is about war, violence, cynicism and the climate crisis. Perhaps that is why Rosi has chosen to shoot in monochrome, giving the city an alien, unearthly look. This is not the traditional sun-drenched southernItaly, not the raucous place of life and love and wine: it is as if the city has been covered in clouds of grey ash – and Naples (and the whole world) is preparing its own Pompeii destiny. Rosi is revealing these figures the way a future archeologist might dig them out: they are the ghosts of the future. It is an intensely disquieting, utterly distinctive film and a superb final panel to his triptych.Below the Clouds screened at theVenice film festival.Explore more on these topicsVenice film festivalDocumentary filmsItalyreviewsShareReuse this content"

I could tell we had a lot of immediate connections. He had worked for human rights organisations, travelled a lot and even had interesting profile pictures. I swiped right.Later that day, we met at a small bar close to my work in Melbourne for a drink. Even though it was a good first date, I decided I didn’t have the energy for more dates straight away and cancelled our second one. I think he thought I was a bit of a time waster.A month later, I was visiting family in Perth and my mum asked if I was seeing anyone. I expressed frustration that it’s so hard to sort through all the garbage on dating apps – but there was one guy I’d met who seemed lovely and had a beautiful smile. So when I got back to Melbourne we met again for dumplings, and it was on.The moment I knew: crying over my ex, he comforted me without jealousy or judgmentRead moreAfter just six months together we moved into his one-bedroom bachelor pad. That was a massive mistake. We did it way too fast and immediately started squabbling. It was just too soon for two very independent people who had spent a lot of time building up their own lives to be suddenly trying to mesh them together.By March 2020, our bickering was at an all-time high. We decided to see a couples counsellor before going on a one-month trip to South America – we didn’t want to ruin the trip for ourselves. I remember immediately disliking the counsellor, which I think was more about what she revealed about us. At the end of the first session she just looked at us and said she didn’t think she could help because we were too far apart as individuals for things to work out. We were like, that’s really bad!Before we left Australia we’d heard murmurings about this new virus emerging but we were feeling smug that we were escaping. After five incredible days hiking across Patagonia, we found ourselves bunkering down in a small hotel room in Punta Arenas as the news of Covid spread across the world.View image in fullscreenSashi and Charlie unaware of the pandemic unfolding in March 2020Flights were cancelled, borders were closing, we had desperate messages from friends and family. We were freaking out. It went from a complete state of relaxation and wonder at the world to OMFG the world is melting down.Charlie was way more relaxed about it than me. He was like, we’ll be OK. It just wasn’t in his realm of possibility that we wouldn’t get home. So while I was contacting embassies, trying to change flights and reaching out to friends and family to figure out our way home, Charlie was happily imagining our new life in Chile. “Babe, imagine how good we’ll get at Spanish,” he said. A line I’ll always remember.In the hotel room in Punta Arenas I knew that if the world was ending, as it felt like it was, it was him I wanted to be next to. Charlie was making us go on walks, making up songs and cracking jokes the whole time. He was bringing me out of my anxiety loop. We balanced each other out perfectly in that crisis, on opposite ends of the scale.View image in fullscreenCharlie and Sashi at the airport trying to get back to AustraliaEventually, we got seats on one of the last flights back from Chile before the borders closed. We were waiting on standby at the airport, and we only got seats on the flight because two temporary residents were booted off when the rules changed and only permanent residents could get back into Australia. It really was the most bonkers time.Charlie proposed in July 2020 and we eloped in December 2020.I thought our time in Chile was going to be the worst thing we would go through – but we have faced many difficulties together since then.Through it all, I’m always so grateful to have him by my side.

Midway through his Friday-night DJ set for his Britpop 25 tour, the producer and moptopped dungeon master of the hyperpop universe has put on his Von Dutch remix, a standout single from last summer’sBrat invasionthat brought pop princessesCharli xcxand Addison Rae together for some prima donna repartee atop a distorted, industrial production. When the bridge’s thumping hydraulic bass drops and opens up its warped wormhole of sound, the packed room suddenly fills with skilled (too skilled) impressions of Rae’s piercing six-second shriek. Cook, who has been bopping behind the DJ booth up until now, collapses to his knees at the center of the stage, bowled over by the sheer energy in the room.‘People think I hate pop’: super-producer AG Cook on working with Beyoncé and honouring his friend SophieRead moreSuch are the demands of Cook’s delirious brand of pop: like a black hole, it must suck you into its vortex. Cook emerged on the scene in 2013 with his London-based experimental pop music label PC Music, and his supersized exaggerations of mainstream pop cliches – think Auto-Tuned voices pitch-shifted to a pip-squeak chipmunk register, cartoonboing-splat-zapsound effects on steroids, and glossy, hyper-artificial production – invited intensely polarized responses. Depending on whom you asked at the time, PC Music was either the piss-take creation of a deeply unsatisfied art school student with some personal, unresolved vendetta against pop music, or an explosive collective of rabble-rousers redefining electronic music and bringing a much-needed dash ofgirly playfulnessto the UK’s mostly macho house revival scene. Yet, love it or hate it, Cook’s brand of pop maximalism ultimately proved here to stay: by the end of the label’s decade-long run, Cook was working with megastars such as Lady Gaga and Beyoncé, and artists of the extended PC Music-verse – including frequent Cook collaborator Charli xcx and the lateSophie– were rightful stars of their own.Yet in Cook’s roving mind, the horizons of pop are constantly shifting. When PC Music shuttered in 2023, it appeared to be the end of an era; but by the following year, Cook had launched a new record label, New Alias, released his third full-length solo album, Britpop, and executive-produced Charli xcx’s career-definingBrat.Part of the immense pleasure of a Cook set is the feeling that you might be witnessing an early draft of pop’s future. In a Paul Valéry-esque fashion, no song ever appears complete in Cook’s hands; he’s constantly taking apart his masterpieces, stretching and re-molding them like silly putty. It’s astounding to see how expansive Cook’s world is, and the set cycles through numerous eras, from a 2015 Cook and Sophie remix of French electronic group Yelle’s Moteur Action to last year’s biggest Brat hits.At their best, Cook’s reinventions can feel absolutely ecstatic. Out of Time, Britpop’s seven-minute-long closing opus, melds a chest-obliterating bass that keeps one hammered to the floor with airy, celestial synths that pull one heavenward; the two contrasting sounds stretch one’s mind-body out like a Slinky. When Cook finally mashes Xcxoplex up in the mix and Charli xcx’s voice beams down, singing “I close my eyes and elevate”, it feels like one of those divine drug-fueled revelations that are simultaneously hyper-literal and hyper-surreal.Cook has always looked a bit more like a slack rocker than a hyperpop artist, eschewing the grungy club-rat memo for what PC Music artist GFOTY has characterized as a “normcore” style. (Essentially: baggy shirt and pants, plus the aforementioned shaggy moptop.) So Cook delivers on this front: a few times throughout the night, Cook leaves the DJ booth to perform some of his fuzz rock, midwest emo-flavored tracks. He strums his guitar and moans out the wistful, melancholic lyrics for Being Harsh (“I tried so hard to learn to say ‘get out of my way’”) from his 2020 debut solo album 7G, before dovetailing into surprising acoustic renditions of some of his most aggressively synthetic songs, including Superstar, Silver and, most delightfully, Lucifer, a moody pop girl track originally sung by Charli xcx and Rae.Of course, the booth is still his bread and butter. And the party must go on. Near the end of the night, after more tracks of the sugar-high cartoons-on-acid variety, Cook plays Brat’s Everything Is Romantic, chopping up Charli’s vocals to a trance-inducing repetition of “Everything, everything, everything, everything is” and sending them careening down a zip line of synths and drums. The open suggestiveness of “everything is” – its elision hanging over our nodding and bouncing heads like some forever-tantalizing dot-dot-dot – feels prophetic. A euphoric, optimistic blueprint for our type of pop.Explore more on these topicsPop and rockDance musicBrooklynreviewsShareReuse this content"

She absorbs their alarm calmly, prompting them with questions, making sympathetic noises into her headset as she digests the situation. “Are these images sexual in nature?” she asks the last woman she speaks to before lunch. “Do you want to tell me a bit about what happened?” She begins compiling a tidy set of bullet points in ballpoint pen. “It’s all right. Take your time.”Intimate image abuse is a crisis in the UK. Amelia Gentleman met staff from this specialist service, demand for which has grown fortyfold since it opened in 2015.Read more3.‘There’s something very interesting about boring’: Martin Parr on his life in picturesView image in fullscreenBenidorm 1997.

I’ve often taken pictures without permission; being thrown out by a faintly embarrassed duty manager gives a certain satisfaction.”Read more4.What connects six disappearances in a picturesque New Zealand town? ‘Everyone has a theory’View image in fullscreenThe beach at Piha, an hour west of Auckland.Photograph: Fiona Goodall/The GuardianOn a squally winter night 21 years ago, 25-year-old Iraena Asher vanished from an isolated beach community, one hour west of New Zealand’s largest city, Auckland. Asher’s story is one of New Zealand’s most enduring mysteries and has left a deep wound in Piha, but it is not the only one haunting the community. Five others have disappeared in the region over the past three decades. Now a true-crime documentary is asking questions – and ruffling feathers, as Eva Corlett, the Guardian’s New Zealand correspondent, reported.Read more5.Arundhati Roy on her fugitive childhood: ‘My knees were full of scars and cuts – a sign of my wild, imperfect, fatherless life’View image in fullscreenArundhati Roy at a friend’s house near Aymanam, Kerala.Photograph: ✎Sreejith Sreekumar/The GuardianWhen war broke out between India and China, the author and her brother were taken by their mother on a chaotic journey from hill station squat to an eccentric household in Kerala.

Olivia Colman and Benedict Cumberbatch star as the wealthy couple whose divorce turns increasingly ugly, with darkly comic consequences.Young MothersOut nowBelgian brothers the Dardennes are noted for their humane, realist approach to telling ordinary people’s stories.

Kander’s recent pictures dwell on the dark side of the Thames estuary and other landscapes in deep blues and blacks, greys and bronzes.

Her portraits of shepherd, and Crowe’s neighbour, Jenny Armstrong record a way of being that doesn’t seem contemporary at all, yet they were made in the 70s and 80s.

The cast is certainly promising: Domhnall Gleeson stars alongside standup Alex Edelman and the always tremendous Tim Key.The InheritanceChannel 4,31 August,9pmThe post-Traitors frenzy for machiavellian yet classy reality formats has been more miss than hit thus far (sorry, Destination X). Will The Inheritance – which sees 12 strangers attempt to convince each other that they alone deserve the fortune left by a glam benefactor (played by Elizabeth Hurley) – be dastardly enough to change that?The GuestBBC One & iPlayer,1 September, 9pmWhen businesswoman Fran takes new cleaner Ria under her wing, her advice leads to a life-changing event for the younger woman.

It’s full of immaculately crafted vignettes that take big themes – politics, self-worth, the oversaturation of Jamie Oliver – and turn them into festival-ready anthems.Blood Orange – Essex HoneyOut nowInspired by a period of intense grief, this fifth album from musical polymath Dev Hynes focuses on the more indie-leaning feel of his early work. The Field is a beautiful guitar-lead hymn augmented by Caroline Polachek’s ghostly harmonies, while Lorde crops up on the folksy Mind Loaded.Sabrina Carpenter – Man’s Best FriendOut nowA year after going stratospheric with the Grammy-winning Short n’ Sweet, Sabrina Carpenter returns with a dozen more tongue-in-cheek bops. Lead single Manchild, the country-tinged evisceration of an ex, has already gone to No 1 on both sides of the Atlantic.Wolf Alice – The ClearingOut nowWritten in London and recorded in LA with super-producer Greg Kurstin (Beck, Adele), The Clearing marks another sonic shift for the Mercury prize-winning quartet.

You win the league then add nearly £300m of talent and it doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll win it again, doesn’t necessarily make you better, even if you’re not doing something as obviously likely to cause imbalance as adding Kylian Mbappé to a Real Madrid team already stacked with left-sided attackers.Liverpool go into Sunday’s home game against Arsenal having won two out of two in the Premier League and scored a healthy seven goals. But those aren’t the statistics that tell the whole story. If you include the Community Shield,Liverpoolhave conceded two goals in each of their three games so far. The defensive problems are obvious and the return of Ryan Gravenberch at Newcastle on Monday did not magically solve them.Szoboszlai’s sublime dummy something more than a cog in Liverpool’s red machine | Barney RonayRead moreJust as telling, perhaps, is that Liverpool, despite letting in those six goals, are yet to go behind this season. That is remarkable for a team who last season made the uneventful 2-0 win a trademark. In fact, the largest single factor in their title success was their capacity to control a game having taken the lead, winning without drama, but also allowing players to get through games without expending absolutely all their energy, to remain fresh for longer, a factor – surely – in Liverpool’s positive injury record last season.But Liverpoolcouldn’t hold Crystal Palaceat arm’s length, and thenagainst Bournemouthand Newcastlelet the opposition back into the game having gone 2-0 up early in the second half, in both cases needing late strikes to regain the initiative. In both cases individual errors played their part, but the Newcastle game was striking for the way Liverpool simply couldn’t get the game under control – even against 10 men.Perhaps it was simply the case that in an atmosphere so fevered, composure was impossible; with nothing to lose, Newcastle hurled themselves into a frenzied series of attacks that might have brought a draw but instead led to that oddest of things, a Pyrrhic defeat, a game from which they took great credit but no points, and also lost three players to injury and one to suspension.View image in fullscreenLiverpool’s defence has looked shaky, conceding two goals in every one of their three games, including the Community Shield defeat.Photograph: Lee Smith/Action Images/ReutersThe individual errors are a concern, but in a sense are less of a worry than structural problems in that they should be easier to put right. Milos Kerkez has had a difficult start to life at Liverpool. Ismaïla Sarr kept dragging him out of position in the Community Shield. He never got to grips with Antoine Semenyo in the Bournemouth game. And other than taking an inordinate amount of time over throw-ins, his main contribution to the game at Newcastle was to stoop out of the way as Bruno Guimarães outjumped him to head in a left-wing cross.Although Slot has not lost his knack of facing opponents at just the right time – Kai Havertz, Bukayo Saka and Martin Ødegaard will all miss Sunday’s game through injury – Noni Madueke’s performances against Kerkez for Chelsea last season suggest he may relish coming in on theArsenalright.Kerkez may be the player most obviously struggling, but he’s not the only one. Ibrahima Konaté has looked shaky in all three games so far, although the fact he was outjumped by Dan Burn to flick on for William Osula to equalise on Monday was less to do with him than with a bafflingly high defensive line that allowed the free-kick to be clipped into vast meadows of attacking possibility. With Konaté backtracking and Burn moving on to the ball, there was only likely to be one winner.Slot played down the issue, saying it had happened at only one free-kick, but the sense remains of a back four ill at ease with itself. To an extent that’s natural with changes in both full-back positions, and perhaps especially given the injury to Jeremie Frimpong that meant Dominik Szoboszlai having to fill in at right-back until Conor Bradley’s arrival from the bench.View image in fullscreenLiverpool have relied on late goals, including Rio Ngumoha’s at Newcastle, to win their two Premier League games to date.Photograph: Scott Heppell/ReutersBut football teams are not made up of discrete units; at least part of the Liverpool defence’s discomfort has been changes in midfield. Perhaps it will settle down. Perhaps once Gravenberch has got a run of games together, playing alongside Alexis Mac Allister again at the back of midfield, they will adjust to functioning as a deep-lying two in a 4-2-3-1 rather than as two-thirds of a midfield three. Certainly they did not leave Virgil van Dijk and Konaté as WataruEndo and Curtis Jones did for Bournemouth’s equaliser. But they are not comfortable yet.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But equally it felt telling that he didn’t make a change at St James’ Park until the 80th minute, and that so much of their play, from the first whistle, seemed intended to preserve energy.This was not the ferocious pressing of the Jürgen Klopp years, but it wasn’t even like last season, when Liverpool were very effective at applying periods of intense pressure. It may be that represents Slot’s unease with the depth of his squad – and it seems he would like at least two more signings before the window closes on Monday. Or more to do with an anxiety about how open the midfield appears in its new shape. Either way, it’s clear that Liverpool are vulnerable in a way they weren’t last season.There was derision in certain quarters when Jamie Carragher suggested last season, asLiverpool cruised to the title, that they needed half a dozen new signings, but the past few weeks have highlighted just what an odd side they were, simultaneously highly effective and in need of refurbishment, largely Klopp with a dash of Slot.The process of rejuvenation and conversion into a more Slot-oriented squad has now begun but inevitably, when so many new elements are introduced into a system which itself needs to be tweaked to accommodate them, there is a process of bedding in.And then, of course, there is the shock of thedeath of Diogo Jotain July, the impact of which is unpredictable and continuing.Arsenal’s injuries mean Liverpool may feel they are getting them at the right time, but Liverpool’s uncertainty could just as easily lead Arsenal to the same conclusion.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolInside footballArne SlotArsenalFootball tacticscommentShareReuse this content"

The head coach had admitted on Friday he “sometimes hates” his players but their hard work on Saturday was rewarded with affection, having recovered from Wednesday’sCarabao Cup embarrassment at Grimsby.Manchester United squeeze past Burnley with controversial Fernandes penaltyRead moreUnited should have won more easily, instead being reliant on a controversial intervention from the video assistant referee in second-half injury time when the referee, Sam Barrott, wandered over to the pitchside monitor and decided Jaidon Anthony pulling back Amad Diallo’s shirt, which started outside the area, was worthy of a penalty. United had led twice through a Josh Cullen own goal and Bryan Mbeumo’s first Old Trafford strike but Lyle Foster and Anthony equalised asBurnleylooked set for a point until Fernandes intervened.“When they put the effort in, I always love them,” Amorim said. “Even when Amad is missing that kind of goal, I love Amad if he’s giving everything. And I think we need to understand that we should always be on this level of effort. Because even in the game, we played well in the beginning. I think we struggled when we changed the characteristics of the players because the match is not so perfect and you can feel that the team struggled a little bit, especially in the second half. But the effort was always there. It ended well, I think we deserved to win the game, I think we created a lot of chances, we should go to the half-time with a bigger advantage.”View image in fullscreenManchester United manager Ruben Amorim still had a difficult day in parts with Matheus Cunha leaving the game with an injury in the first half.Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Action Images/ReutersMatheus Cunha had to be taken off in the first half after pulling up when sprinting for the ball. Instead of sending on the new signing Benjamin Sesko, who was the final United outfield player to take a penalty at Grimsby, Amorim elected to replace the Brazilian with Joshua Zirkzee. When Mason Mount was unable to continue, Kobbie Mainoo replaced him, leaving Sesko to wait until the 72nd minute to come on.“Everything is connected,” Amorim said. “He finished the game [against Grimsby] with cramps, really at the limit. That’s why we protected Ben from the penalties. Today was that reason also because Zirkzee is also a striker, he’s an international striker. But I was thinking that Ben, during the pre-season, he didn’t do 90 minutes.”Burnley were also left confused by Foster having a goal ruled out for offside before the late call from the referee and video officials. “The ref didn’t give it, the linesman didn’t give it, he’s 10 metres away,” Scott Parker, the Clarets’ manager, said. “The guy 100 miles away has decided that it’s a clear and obvious error from the ref, and then, obviously, it’s a penalty.“That’s the way the game is, the game’s going that way. It’s going to become the most sterile game there is really. The linesmen and referees are slowly becoming redundant. We live in a world of perfection and when everyone wants perfection. Social media brings that, I think we want perfection in a game of football, which I just don’t agree with.”Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedRuben AmorimBurnleynewsShareReuse this content"

Half of Samoa’s squad had to fundraise to be able to attend this Rugby World Cup with no contracts in place, and some have taken unpaid leave from their jobs to represent their country. England, on the other hand, have been a professional outfit for more than five years and have now swept aside their opponents in 59 of their last 60 matches, that one loss coming in the last World Cup final.Among the try scorers as England reached the quarter-finals was the hat-trick heroine Jess Breach, and the first try was a special one for the 27-year-old as it was her 50th for her country. Breach is only the fifth Red Roses player to score 50 tries, after Sue Day, Nicky Crawford, Emily Scarratt and Marlie Packer. The centre Meg Jones got on the board twice, and had not been in the starting XV at the beginning of this week, but an injury to Scarratt led to her promotion. The Cardiff-born centre’s contributions across the pitch were outstanding as her prowess in an England shirt only grows.England 92-3 Samoa: Women’s Rugby World Cup 2025 – as it happenedRead moreAnother bright spark for England was player-of-the-match Helena Rowland’s kicking from the tee. From the tries she missed only three, but slotted kicks from every angle, with her performance potentially leading fans to want her to be starting in the No 10 shirt for the rest of this tournament; Zoe Harrison and Holly Aitchison are also vying for the place, but Rowland’s versatility across the backline is likely to mean she will operate at 23 to cover any potential injuries or tactical changes.There was an air of unfamiliarity between the two teams, the last time they faced one another coming in 2014. None of the Samoan players had competed against England before, while Natasha Hunt and Packer were the only Red Roses in the matchday 23 in thatteam 11 years ago, which led Abi Burton to say in the build-up England were expecting Samoa “to throw the kitchen sink” at them, which was definitely the case. Samoa’s physicality was their biggest strength, with huge hits throughout the encounter.View image in fullscreenHelena Rowland kicked 11 conversions and missed only three in England’s 92-3 victory against Samoa.Photograph: David Rogers/Getty ImagesHalf an hour before kick-off the rain started, and was off and on all match, perhaps adding to the amount of handling errors. Despite play not being the cleanest at times, it took less than three minutes for England to score, and Jones ran a great line to go over. The wing Breach scored next, with the prop Sarah Bern and Jones again having the bonus point wrapped up in the 16th minute.For the fifth try England’s scrum pack demolished Samoa’s before the No 8 Maddie Feaunati pounced on the rolling ball. The hooker Lark Atkin-Davies then got in on the action and the scrum-half Lucy Packer was next over. The hairs on the back of everyone’s neck in Northampton stood up as the stands came alive when Samoa entered their 22 for the first time in the closing moments of the first half, but England managed to turn them over with the half-time score 47-0. BBC viewers were treated to an interview with Lioness legend Chloe Kelly, who was in attendance supporting England.The second half began with Samoa winning a scrum penalty and they opted to kick for the posts. The fly-half Harmony Vatau slotted the kick to score their first World Cup points in 11 years. Samoa didn’t qualify in 2017, withdrew from qualification for the 2021 tournament because of the pandemic, and drew a blank against Australia last week. It was arguably the moment of the match with the entire team having their hands in the air and roaring in celebration, among the loudest cheers of the afternoon.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Red Roses were their own worst enemies for the next period with fumbled lineouts and knock-ons thwarting more tries, but they scored again through the replacement prop Mackenzie Carson before the fly-half Rowland, the captain Packer, Breach for her hat-trick and the wing Claudia Moloney-MacDonald rounded off the scores. Another benefit for England is that it seemed the team came through the 80 minutes without injury, though Jones and Feaunati needed on-pitch treatment.Women’s rugby is no doubt growing, as evidenced by the 13,615 fans in the stands, but this game once again shows the huge gap that needs to be closed between nations.

Moments after one of the biggest wins of his career, the German unwittingly found himself on the receiving end of Stefanos Tsitsipas’s ire during their handshake at the net. Before Tsitsipas could finish, though, Altmaier had walked away from the net and he refused to engage in the Greek’s attempts to argue with him.Altmaier shrugs at the first mention of the incident: “Even if I would have lost, I would not enter discussions because it’s just like heat of the moment. You need to cool down; let’s see if he reacts to it or he sticks to his opinion while cooling down on an exercise bike in the player gym late at night.”Although Altmaier had the wherewithal to think clearly in the heat of battle, the same cannot be said for many other players in New York over the past week, a tournament that has been dominated by outbursts of anger and frustration from players. “Lots of drama,” says Jessica Pegula, laughing. “I don’t know. My matches have been pretty no drama, so I’m not really sure what’s going on with everybody else. I don’t know. It’s just that New York City tends to bring out just a lot of drama, I guess.”Coco Gauff settles serve and nerves to book Osaka clash in US Open last 16Read moreIn hindsight, theDaniil Medvedev show on the first night of the tournamentwas a sign of things to come as he lambasted the umpire before inciting the Louis Armstrong Stadium audience into a six-minute protest while Benjamin Bonzi held match point in their first round match. Although that incident sparked a dramatic comeback, Medvedev lost in five unforgettable sets.Then, after crashing out of the tournament in a second round loss to Taylor Townsend, Jelena Ostapenko crashed out on the court. Townsend later said Ostapenko’s heated comments towards her had included the Latvian accusing her of having “no education” and “no class”. Tsitsipas, who was apparently frustrated by Altmaier’s successful underarm serve in their second round match, tried to send his opponent a message after the match: “Next time, don’t wonder why I hit you, OK? No, I’m just saying if you serve underarm…” he said, his voice trailing off. By that time, Altmaier had removed himself from the conversation.These events, and many others, seem to be reflective of this particular moment of the tennis season. Stress runs high across on the tour, particularly at the major tournaments, but the US Open is positioned at a particularly fraught period towards the end of a long, gruelling season. Most players are tired, tightly strung and emotions are running high. They are, of course, also in New York, one of the most frantic cities in the world.View image in fullscreenDaniil Medvedev breaks his racket after losing his match against Benjamin Bonzi.Photograph: Charly Triballeau/AFP/Getty ImagesAccording to Pegula, the forceful New York crowds play a role in player behaviour on the court: “I feel like the crowds, they’re pretty crazy. They kind of get everyone riled up. Everyone is tense. It’s the last slam of the season. Your last chance to go deep at a slam for a while. I think people maybe just get stressed out, and you’re out there competing and fighting and trying to win. I think it just gets emotional. Adrenaline starts flowing.”Coco Gauff agrees: “I think it’s, (a) end of the year; (b) we’re in New York, and the fans here – I love them – but [if] you’re on the wrong side of things, can … They’re into the match. They’re passionate tennis fans. They know what’s going on, and they’re used to other events I think, like major events, happening in the city that aren’t tennis.”Not everyone believes the location of the US Open has a role in player behaviour: “Hey, don’t blame New York!” says a smiling Naomi Osaka, who grew up in the city.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionMost of the angry players in New York this week also have lengthy rap sheets. Medvedev, for example, has long been one of the most volatile players on the tour. Osaka says: “Not calling everyone out name by name, but Medvedev’s had a couple of moments here that are kind of iconic. I feel like the people here might enjoy a show, but I think people everywhere enjoy a show.”Ostapenko’s criticisms of Townsend, meanwhile, showed a lack of self-awareness considering she is notorious, and even admired by many, for her lack of sportsmanship. They are all also in poor form and this tournament represented their last opportunity to salvage their grand slam years, another potential source of tension.For Gauff, it is not at all surprising to see these players involved: “To be honest, with some of the drama, I feel like it happens frequently on tour, but because it’s here, it gets more social media clicks,” she says. “Some of the players, these are recurring things that us in the tennis world, it’s not surprising. It’s like: ‘OK, whatever.’ But because it’s here in New York and maybe not as many tennis fans or things like that, it gets blown up on social media.”Before offering her opinion, Osaka jokingly makes it clear that she has not been part of any drama this week: “I don’t know if it’s just the part of the season where everyone is, like, tired and irritated or something,” she says, smiling. “But for me I think New York brings out my best behaviour, so I don’t know what everyone else is doing.”Explore more on these topicsUS Open Tennis 2025US Open tennisDaniil MedvedevCoco GauffTennisUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They thought they were ahead when King scored in the 21st minute but the 18-year-old’s goal was ruled out after Michael Salisbury, the VAR, instructed the referee, Rob Jones, to view the pitchside monitor to assess whether Rodrigo Muniz had fouled Trevoh Chalobah during the buildup.Manchester United v Burnley, Tottenham v Bournemouth: Premier League, EFL and more – liveRead moreJones ruled against Fulham, even though Muniz was in possession of the ball when he caught Chalobah inadvertently. Jones later awardedChelseaa penalty for handball by Ryan Sessegnon but only after dismissing appeals for a foul by João Pedro during the buildup.“In the first half I saw my team playing outstanding football,” Silva said. “Playing football – not trying to be fake, not parking the bus or something like that. All the decisions from the VAR and the referee made a massive impact on the game.“To disallow a goal like that is unbelievable. Unbelievable. We have all the meetings with the people in charge; we try to see their direction. One of the main things was: ‘VAR is not here to referee the game.’ I would prefer to say nothing more as I will be punished. I want to be on the bench for the next game, I don’t want to pay fines. But it has been difficult with so many decisions against us at the start of the season.” Manchester United took the lead inFulham’s 1-1 draw at Craven Cottagelast Sunday that stood despite Leny Yoro pushing Calvin Bassey before the header that led to Muniz’s own goal.Silva was also unhappy with Chelsea being given time to take the lead at the end of the first half. A minimum of eight minutes were added on. Fulham thought that the half-time whistle should have blown before Enzo Fernández delivered a corner for João Pedro to open the scoring in the ninth added minute.“There were eight minutes of added time, they score in the ninth,” Silva added. “He has to stop the game, it’s the rules. I asked the referee, he told me that we lost time because he was talking to a player. I checked the video – the game didn’t stop one second. What can I say? Chelsea won the game and we move on.”Silva fumed about the buildup to Fernández giving Chelsea a 2-0 lead from the spot after Ryan Sessegnon handled Chalobah’s cross. “It’s handball,” the head coach said. “But before that moment you can see easily two, three or four fouls for ourselves. There was a stamp on Alex Iwobi, handball by João Pedro, push on Joachim Andersen. They saw the penalty after three moments at least that they have to see for us.“It’s the same VAR that found something unbelievable: a stamp from Rodrigo. The same people didn’t find a stamp on Alex Iwobi before the penalty. I can’t tell you anything more, but I don’t understand it.”Explore more on these topicsFulhamVideo assistant referees (VARs)RefereesLaws of footballChelseanewsShareReuse this content"

It wasOscar Piastriwho took a slender advantage over his McLaren teammate Lando Norris, in what remains an absolutely nip-and-tuck contest as the title run-in begins.Max Verstappen in the Red Bull did his best to push theMcLarenduo but really this was another startling demonstration of their complete stranglehold on the season. The pair have been on top all weekend, with Norris quickest in all three practice sessions. When it mattered, though, it was Piastri who had the edge, pipping his teammate to pole by 12 thousandths of a second, barely a breath between them.Such margins may yet decide this championship. Piastri leads Norris by nine points, they have five poles apiece, with the Australian on six wins to Norris’s five. With ten meetings remaining, every edge counts now and Piastri has his nose in front for Sunday on a circuit where making up places is tricky indeed.“The hardest guy to normally overtake is your teammate,” said Norris. “Especially when in a quali like today we’re split by one hundredth of a second. It’s going to take some magic.”That is especially true given how evenly the two drivers are matched in a field of their own at the front. Indeed, even with Verstappen wrestling far more than might reasonably be expected from his recalcitrant Red Bull, still struggling with the grip and balance problems which have beset it all season, he was more than two tenths back in third, while Racing Bulls’ Isack Hadjar was half a second back in fourth.

The pairs’ times were all but interchangeable as they charged round the short, testing challenge in Zandvoort, which requires absolute precision for a quick time.Piastri had the better of the first sector, Norris the second, and choosing between them was all but impossible until the clock stopped. The Australian held the edge over the line on his first hot run with a time of 1min 08.662sec and, while both pushed for their second runs, neither could improve.Piastri was as composed as ever, pleased with what was some clinical execution, and Norris conceded he had been well beaten, admitting he had not reached the limit quite consistently enough but emphasised that the margins had been tiny.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At Spa, wherethe Australian went on to win, he passed Norris for the lead on the opening lap, making the most of his slipstream from second on the grid, but he was then disappointed when Norris pulled off a strategic coup in Hungary to win before the summer break. The momentum has certainly been with Norris, with three wins from the last four races, and Piastri will want to exploit pole and stamp his authority on the title fight once more.Quick GuideDutch F1 GP qualifying timesShow1.Oscra Piastri(McLaren) 1:08.6622.Lando Norris(McLaren) 1:08.6743.Max Verstappen(Red Bull) 1:09.9254.Isack Hadjar(Racing Bulls) 1:09.2085.George Russell(Mercedes) 1:09.2556.Charles Leclerc(Ferrari) 1:09.3407.Lewis Hamilton(Ferrari) 1:09.3908.Liam Lawson(Racings Bulls) 1:09.5009.Carlos Sainz Jr(Williams) 1:09.50510.Fernando Alonso(Aston Martin) 1:09.63011.Kimi Antonelli(Mercedes) 1:09.49312.Yuki Tsunoda(Red Bulls) 1:09.62213.Gabriel Bortoleto(Sauber) 1:09.62214.Pierre Gasly(Alpine) 1:09.63715.Alex Albon(Williams) 1:09.65216.Franco Colapinto(Alpine) 1:10.10417.Nico Hülkenberg(Sauber) 1:10.19518.Esteban Ocon(Haas) 1:10.19719.Oliver Bearman(Haas) 1:10.26220.Lance Stroll(Aston Martin) (no time set)Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“It felt good and like a good improvement from pretty much every other lap I did this weekend,” he said. “So it was nice to be able to pull it out but it took a lot of hard work, some patience in trying to find the time, and eventually I got there.”George Russell was in fifth for Mercedes, with Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc in sixth, the Monegasque driver surprised by an adventurous fox dashing by his Ferrari during one of his laps.View image in fullscreenLewis Hamilton felt like he had made progress after steering his Ferrari to seventh in qualifying.Photograph: Eric Alonso/DPPI/ShutterstockLewis Hamilton took seventh for Ferrari in what he had hoped to be something of a reset to his season after the summer break.

Perrin became only the second woman after Tammy Beaumont in 2023 to reach three figures in the 100-ball tournament with a stunning 101 off 43 balls, which included 15 fours and five sixes at the Oval.It was the fastest ton in the women’s competition and second quickest overall, with only Harry Brook’s 41-ball hundred for the Superchargers against Welsh Fire in 2023 eclipsing this salvo from Perrin. When that was put to her, Perrin, who was run out at the non-striker’s end, laughed and told Sky Sports: “One ball? Damn, I better hit the gym so I can send those sixes a bit further!“It felt pretty brilliant. It’s not every day you get to find yourself in that state of flow and in the zone and it’s when you’re there, stay in the present and take every ball as they come.”Watched by about 20 family and friends, Perrin clubbed an attack featuring the England players Issy Wong, Charlie Dean and Sarah Glenn to all parts to underpin the Superchargers’ 214 for five. It was the highest total by a woman’s team by far – the previous best was 181 for three by Welsh Fire when Beaumont made a century – and it was too many for the Spirit.Grace Ballinger and Annabel Sutherland claimed three wickets apiece to leave last year’s winners short on 172 for nine as Superchargers set up a showdown with unbeaten Southern Brave in Sunday’s final.Meanwhile, Trent Rockets progressed into the men’s final after their eliminator against Northern Superchargers was abandoned due to rain.

Why weren’t our voices enough?Sat 30 Aug 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 30 Aug 2025 17.04 EDTShareToday I watched those children again, the ones who stood before the cameras at al-Shifa hospital on 7 November 2023. Theyspokein English, not their mother tongue, but the language of those who they thought might save them.“We want to live, we want peace, we want to judge the killers of children,” one boy said. “We want medicine, foodand education. We want to live as the other children live.”Even then, the children pleaded. They had no clean drinking water, no food, no medicine.Now, 21 months later, as 60,000confirmedPalestinian corpses pile higher, or in mass graves, andindependentestimates show over 100,000 dead, something has happened. Suddenly, the same institutions that spent months debating, or more actively denying, whetherPalestiniantestimony deserved credence are finding their voices.Western academics speak of “genocide” with newfound authority. TwoIsraelihuman rights organizations issuedreportsdeclaring what Palestinians have screamed from under rubble since October. They say they are “experts”, but it took them two years to see what was always before them: that a sky that delivers bombs was never looking for hostages.Why weren’t our corpses enough? What renders Palestinian death so consistently unconvincing to those who witness our slaughter in real time? What is it about our breath, our blood, our bodies, that makes them so easy to doubt, so easy to dismiss, so easy to destroy?It is not the eyes that are blind, but the hearts.The answer lies not in our deaths but in how we are constructed as less than human from the moment we draw breath. Palestinian dehumanization is philosophical, deliberate, essential to the colonial project. We must be made into something other than human so that our elimination becomes necessary violence. The colonizer requires the colonized to be beasts so that caging us appears humane and killing us appears justified.This same dehumanization allows the media to place the genocide of Palestinians within the context of7 October 2023, to act as if history started two years ago, but never place 7 October in the context of 77 years ofcolonial dispossessionand 17 years of completesiege. When Palestinian experts appeared on television saying this was genocide, they were berated, attacked, dismissed. Now it seems only non-Palestinians can declare it genocide, as if they are being brave, as if Palestinians haven’t beenfired, doxed andimprisonedfor describing our killers as evil.Perhaps they wanted eulogies for the soldiers who murdered our children?Christiane Amanpour, and those like her,speaksof her epiphany about genocide only after the Israeli writer David Grossman comes to his sadrealizationthat Israel is committing genocide. Palestinians can only narrate if accompanied by authority. But I don’t recognize an authority that can’t feel 22,000lb bombs that have killed aclassroom of childrenevery day for 670 days.How holy their concern now sounds, rising over a land emptied of the living.These newfound experts, the same voices that spent 21 months debating whether witnessing mass slaughter constituted evidence of mass slaughter, now speak with such authority about our suffering. But even Israeli validation comes with escape hatches built in. When B’Tselem finally published their report, calling itOur Genocide, they spent 88 pages dancing around the legal definition they claimed to embrace. They acknowledged genocidal acts while avoiding the question of genocidal intent, the very element that makes genocide legally prosecutable.Did they forget Netanyahu compared us to Amalek? That he called for our biblical death?View image in fullscreen‘Skeletal children evoke sympathy that crushed bodies never will. They can mourn our corpses without confronting the systems that created them.’Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesThe media enabled this genocide from the start. When Israeli officials announced they had seen “40 beheaded babies” and the world moved to war, there were no photos required, no verification needed. Former US president Joe Biden repeated this blood libel multiple times, even after his own staff admitted he never saw such images. The White House walked back his statements twice. Haaretzinvestigatedand found only one infant died on 7 October, shot, not beheaded. But the lie had already traveled around the world while Palestinian truth was still begging for a hearing.When Israelkilledseven aid workers from World Central Kitchen in April 2024, precision-striking their clearly marked vehicles in three separate hits, they called it an “unintentional mistake”. When they systematicallymurderedover 200 journalists, more than in any war in recorded history, each death was labeled an unfortunate accident. When they created the highestconcentrationof child amputees in the world, this too is presented as an unintended consequence.The pattern never changes. Israel commits a war crime, promises to investigate itself, and quietly concludes months later that procedures were followed correctly. Yet, the world expects us to forgive and forget.Until recently, Piers Morgan paraded Palestinian advocates across his stage, a courtroom where the oppressed are always on trial. Rehearsed, he asked each guest the same question:“Do you condemn Hamas?”In that moment, every Palestinian was stripped of grief and forced into a posture of apology.The follow-up question is just as predictable:“Does Israel have a right to defend itself?”The occupier, we are told, has a sacred right to violence. The occupied must earn the right to grieve. Israel’s so-called “defense” is never interrogated, even though international law grants no such right to an occupying power against the people it occupies.International law is unambiguous, when it chooses to remember its own language. It affirms the right of all peoples to self-determination, and in UN Resolution 3236, it enshrines the right to resist occupationby “any means necessary”. Apparently these laws do not apply to Palestinian flesh.Israel has violated every principle of international law: the prohibition onapartheid, the crime offorcible transfer, the destruction ofcultural property, the targeting of civilians, the use of starvation as a weapon of war. And nowgenocide, the highest crime of all. Western regimes expect us not to recognize this reality, perhaps because they have seen how the world has not moved swiftly to stop this genocide, they know they can commit it again.The Intercept’sanalysisof over 1,000 articles from major newspapers during the first six weeks after 7 October 2023 reveals the systematic nature of dehumanization. Humanizing language was reserved almost exclusively for Israeli suffering: “slaughter” appeared in a 60:1 ratio favoring Israeli over Palestinian deaths, “massacre” at 125:2, and “horrific” at 36:4. This was systematic preparation for genocide, the deliberate murder of language itself.Edward Said understood this decades ago. InPermission to Narrate, he showed how Palestinians are robbed of the right to tell our own story, how our voices are filtered through the lens of those who wish us gone. Said knew that the question was never whether Palestinians could speak, we always spoke. The question was who would be allowed to listen, and under what conditions our words would be deemed credible.But I understand now why the discourse shifts, why genocide suddenly becomes speakable after so much death. It’s not because Palestinian voices gained credibility, it’s because Palestinian death reached a form western consciences can process. Starvation photographs better than bombs or asniper’s bulletin a child’s chest. Skeletal children evoke sympathy that crushed bodies never will. They can mourn our corpses without confronting the systems that created them. So, western nations can acceptably feign concern over famine in Gaza as if Palestinian mothers hadn’t been carrying their dying children to hospitals for over a year. And, suddenly politicians can offerconditional recognitionof Palestinian statehood, but only if we promise to remain defenseless forever.They prefer us as martyrs because martyrs make no demands for liberation.This performative shift comes not from moral awakening but from calculated safety. Famine sounds like misfortune; genocide sounds like guilt. Famine lets them send aid without admitting harm, grieve publicly without calling out the inflictors. They can express horror while avoiding the truth that western bombs destroyed almost all ofGaza.Even when evidence becomes undeniable, they adapt. When photographs of 18-month-old Mohammed al-Mutawaq, skeletal from malnutrition, went viral, pro-Israeli voices found new ways to dismiss Palestinian suffering. Once it was revealed the child has cerebral palsy, columnists declared the starvation narrative “a lie”, calling such images “propaganda”.As if starving a child pre-disposed to death makes the violence more justified?But the New York Times, quick to factcheck a starving Palestinian child for having a pre-existing condition, let their Screams Without Words report go uncorrected for over 500 days, helping launch popular support for genocide.But Palestinian voices break through not despite the repression, but because of our refusal to accept that some stories cannot be told, some deaths cannot be mourned, some truths cannot be spoken. Those who remain breathing will speak the truth others died trying to tell: that Palestinian blood waters the earth of our homeland, that our resistance grows from every grave they dig, that our liberation cannot be delayed by their comfort with finishing the Nakba.

Will it change the NFL or lift the stock market? The left-field claims are everywhereSat 30 Aug 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 30 Aug 2025 17.58 EDTShareThe secret meanings behind Taylor Swift’s engagementBreaking news alerts were pinged to phones around the world; Swifties screamed in the street; the Prince and Princess of Wales delivered their royal approval; Donald Trumpwished them luck. By now it will not have escaped your attention that Taylor Swift, the reigning queen of pop, is engaged to Travis Kelce, a podcaster who also plays football.What does this engagement mean? It’s possible you naively think it simply means an extremely famous woman and a somewhat famous man enjoy each other’s company and want to settle down together to start a big, beautiful brand partnership. Wrong! When it comes to Swift, Occam’s razor rarely applies. The megastar is known for hiding Easter eggs and hidden meaning in her musical output; she has driven a lot of otherwise normal people on quixotic missions into the deep, dark depths of her lyrics to validate their left-field theories about their idol.Who can forget, for example, the5,000-word essaypublished in the New York Times last year arguing that Swift is secretly part of the LGBTQ+ community and communicating that fact via coded lyrics? A surprisingly large number of “Gaylors” seem invested in this theory: a Gaylorsubreddithas more than 50,000 members. Following news of the proposal, it went private to avoid trolling from outsiders.While the engagement has sent some Gaylors into mourning, various conservatives are celebrating the idea that Swift might be on her way from being an independent career woman to a tradwife. On his podcast, the rightwing activist Charlie Kirk mused that getting married and having kids changes a person, and he hopes that it will “deradicalize” the billionaire – who is, it must be said, not widely known for having any radical ideas.“Taylor Swift might go from a cat lady to a JD Vance supporter,”Kirk said. “I think that if she ends up having children, she’ll stop this kind of liberal endorsing Joe Biden nonsense.” (Well, I mean, she’s not going to be endorsing Biden any more, that’s for sure.) Kirk added: “Reject feminism. Submit to your husband, Taylor. You’re not in charge.” Oh, I think she is.While Vance himself hasn’t weighed in on whether he thinks the Kelce effect will mean Swift suddenly has aMar-a-Lagomakeover and starts fangirling over Maga politics, he has aired his thoughts on the news. More specifically, he used the Swift-Kelce engagement to float theconspiracy theorythat NFL games could be rigged for Kelce’s team, the Chiefs. “I hope that the NFL does not put a thumb on the scale for the Kansas City Chiefs just because Travis Kelce is now getting married to maybe the most famous woman in the world,” Vance told USA Today in an interview on Wednesday.It’s not just the right projecting their hopes, dreams and weird Super Bowl fantasies on to Kelce-Swift. Some Swifties have beengushing overwhat a great guy Kelce is because “he has no issue with Swift being successful”. While Kelce may well be supportive of his megastar fiancee, let’s not get carried away and frame him as some sort of feminist. The football star has called women “breeders” in the past and defended his Kansas City Chiefs teammate Harrison Butker after Butker delivered a bigotedcommencement speechlast year, calling Pride month a “deadly sin” and telling women they should be more excited about getting married and having kids than having a successful career. Kelcemade clear thathe doesn’t agree with the majority of Butker’s views, but said it wasn’t his place to criticize them. Kind of a slap in the face to all of Swift’s queer fans for her husband-to-be to let the Pride comments slide, just because Butker has always been nice to him.Various other hot takes about the engagement abound. The business press have been talking about how the engagement mightboost stocksand marketing trade journals have been looking atbrand reactions. No doubt even defence industry publications (which have previouslyput out bangerslike What Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift Can Teach Veterans About Federal Resumes) will find an angle.If you can’t beat them, join them: since it’s the Swift Hot Take Super Bowl, I’ll quickly get mine in. I think the singer is very talented, and I’m glad she makes a lot of people very happy, but I do wish she would do aMs Racheland use her unmatched influence to shame politicians into action on Gaza.

Doctors are coming back from Gaza withharrowingstories about Israeli soldierstargeting kidswith shots to the head and deliberately shooting teenage boys in thetesticles. You can argue all day about whether celebrities have an obligation to speak out about injustice or not but, ultimately, having so much influence and choosing not to use it in the face of a genocide your government is helping to perpetuate, and your engagement knocks from the front page, is not “neutrality”. It is a deliberate choice.Amnesty calls for end of investigation into Polish doctor who performed abortionLast year, Dr Gizela Jagielska was targeted byanti-abortion extremistsafter she provided a legal late-term abortion to a woman in a hospital in southern Poland after her unborn baby was diagnosed with a fatal foetal anomaly. Poland has some of the most restrictive abortion laws in Europe. Jagielska is being investigated by authorities and faces possible imprisonment of up to eight years. “Instead of investigating Dr Jagielska’s conduct, the Polish authorities must look into the attacks she has faced since the investigation was announced,” Amnesty Internationalsaid in a statementthis week.Now I ain’t saying she’s a gold digger… but she is trademarking the termWhat first attracted the 24-year-old former cheerleader Jordon Hudson to the 73-year-old multimillionaire Bill Belichick, I wonder? We may never know. But do we know thatHudson’s companyhas filed a trademark application for the term “gold digger”, to be used on jewellery or keychains. Instead of getting huffy about the jokes about her being attracted to Belichick’s big bank account, she’s monetizing them.Italian police investigating porn site with doctored pictures of prominent womenIf you are a woman in the public eye, it’s almost inevitable that insecure men will use technology tohumiliate you online.

History will damn much of the UK media for failing to do thatSat 30 Aug 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 30 Aug 2025 11.44 EDTShareAt the end of August the Sun put a picture of a pink poodle-shaped balloon on its front page, not to illustrate the last dog days of summer but the latest migrant hotel scandal, a story that has dominated the UK news agenda for weeks. In this case,the “balloonacy” of teaching hobbies to asylum seekers.The silly season, in which the press seeks to entertain readers with lighter news during the summer, is cancelled this year.Anti-migrant papers such as the Sun, the Mail, the Express and the Telegraph have, predictably, delivered most of the 1,571 stories mentioning “migrant” and “hotel” over the past month, but according to the media archive siteNexis, reporting about the issue has shifted in many other parts of the media. The plight of refugees is now consistently framed as a threat to “locals”, with even the broadsheet Times reporting a court case citing legal obligations under the inflammatory print headline: “Hotel migrant rights outweigh those of locals, ministers argue”.Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, tells me of toxic coverage with real-life consequences. “The mainstream media and political opinion is in a very different place than it was a year ago. Now there’s an idea that everyone coming here is a potential sexual predator, a potential criminal.”Sections of the press have long delighted in stories of division and outrage rather than nuance and debate. But now – and this may be crucial – they have the added difficulty of having to compete with social media as to which is best placed to speak for “the people’.View image in fullscreenWe see a symbiotic relationship – with politicians jumping on populist bandwagons and using the rightwing media to do so, who then flood their websites with the resulting outrage. This circular obscenity has seen shadow cabinet ministers such as Robert Jenrick playing to the media galleryoutside migrant hotels this summer. Conservative party leader Kemi Badenoch joined the unvirtuous circle with her claim that “Women are afraid to go for runs in the park as men lurk in bushes”, echoing a Telegraph story last month quoting “Sophie”, who lives near a migrant hotel and said she would never walk home alone at night as “You just don’t know who is hiding in a bush.” It’s rabble rousing 360 degrees.Standing in the middle of the circle now is Nigel Farage, whose policy of holding weekly press conferences during parliamentary recess has allowed him – with conspicuous help from media devotees – to dominate the headlines. This week, he was buoyed by journalists asking not whether his plan toreturn 600,000 migrantswas the right thing to do, but rather if it is workable.He then passed his torch to the Mail: “Finally, a politician who gets it”, said its front-page splash. “Other political parties can snipe all they like,but Mr Farage is in tune with Middle Britain”.The Sun, in an editorial headlined “plans for Nigel”, agreed that Farage understood “ordinary Britons” and understands their “total despair”. The Telegraph on its front page welcomed the fact that the Taliban would give Farage “a deal”.Only the leftwing Mirror, in a front-page story by veteran journalist Paul Routledge, broke ranks with a headline: “Britain is better than this – forget Farage, we need more decency and humanity”.Outside the circle, the Financial Times,shared a warningfrom the world’s leading central bankers, including the Bank of England’s Andrew Bailey, that the biggest economies faced an “acute challenge” of ageing populations and needed immigrants.But that sort of thing struggles to break through. It is the circle that holds sway.It’s hard to be completely sure what is dictating the tone of the rightwing media coverage. Is it that the outlets and their proprietors want to see Farage in No 10 – on the basis that would be best for the country – or do they merely believe potential audiences want that and seek to reflect them? Any consideration of that question must also considerfalling newspaper circulations. The race to be the voice of “the people” may also be about survival.It seems unlikely that the warmer tone of Rupert Murdoch and his News UK titles yet adds up to wholehearted support for Farage, but they are a sign that they are restless. And anger, grievance and radical plans do sell news.What of the BBC? Can it be and remain an honest broker? Can it reflect the views of those living in the country’s poorest neighbourhoods, who feel ignored by the media and politicians alike, and the concerns of refugees and those who support them? It’s a debate mired in political opportunism and submerged in mendacity, so that’s a big ask of the BBC, but it must deliver.Journalism is often described asthe “first draft of history”, but can anyone, looking at today’s newsstands, reviewing today’s output, really think that history will be anything but damning?First, do no harm. Punch up, not down. Shed more light than heat. These sentiments, in different ways, used to mean something in our media. They still could. They still should. And if they did, perhaps migration – its effect on people, its effect on our country and its effect on our communities – would get the debate it deserves.Jane Martinson is professor of financial journalism at City St George’s and a member of the board of the Scott Trust, which owns the Guardian Media GroupExplore more on these topicsMediaOpinionImmigration and asylumcommentShareReuse this content"

But few in the west know the multicultural, unusual Dubai that I’ve seen up closeSat 30 Aug 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 30 Aug 2025 09.32 EDTShareDubai is on everyone’s lips. One side of social media salivates over its curated opulence. The other sneers at a city that has become a byword for excess. Barely a week goes by without the British press telling the story of somebodymoving to Dubaifor lower taxes or, conversely, that the “Dubai dream is dead”.The city-state benefits from this discourse-fuelled soft power. It strikes both the haves and have-notes. Dubai fever is democratic. The city is an El Dorado of the east for remittance-sending strivers, sun-seeking expats and scammers. For many, it represents an unsettling post-western horizon. A version of the future that is already here. Rows of supercars overlooking glittering marinas. Toothy-grinned influencers, crypto bros and aspiring entrepreneurs crowding the same clubs.Labubusdangling from designer handbags. We’re enamoured of this cliche of Dubai, a historyless slab of a place, where the right price can buy you anything and anyone. But behind this binary view is another way of looking at Dubai – a place that is much more interesting and unusual than is often understood.The city’s past and present is often reduced to the 2 sq km of downtownDubai, where visitors congregate. This is the centre of luxury, where records are made to be broken. It is a panorama of lavish hotels and flashy restaurants, with the Burj Khalifa, the world’s tallest building, providing an apt backdrop. This image may be a defining one, but it says very little about the mundane joys and pains of life in Dubai.I remember visiting an industrial district to attend a poetryreading organised by a collective of young Dubai-based Filipinos. Their work grappled with the oddities of second-generation life. What does belonging mean when it isn’t enshrined by citizenship? How do you build a foundation on shifting sands? These locals spoke from within an intensely stratified society in which identities are both fixed and surprisingly porous. Dubai is the natural habitat of the “third culture kid”. Everywhere, you overhear the chameleonic lilt of international school accents. As a Londoner, I speak to Dubai-raised Somalis and recognise the bruised tenderness with which they describe their city. You don’t get to choose your home town. The heart is ungovernable.View image in fullscreenPeople at the Global Village shopping complex in Dubai, 2 November 2024.Photograph: Fadel Senna/AFP/Getty ImagesToday expats make up85% of Dubai’s population. Through their businesses, schools, cultural centres and social clubs, various diasporas assert their presence. The city hosts the largest Malayali community outside India. Iranian art dealers rub shoulders with Afghan handymen. A Lebanese property developer shares little more than a language with the underpaid north African waiter taking their order. A decade-deep, Sudanese middle class thrives inthe very country that is inflamingSudan’s continuing civil war. Dubai is home to generations of immigrants who have sought shelter and opportunity. Their children face the challenge of reclamation.It has also long been a transit hub, connecting travellers to motherlands that weren’t properly served by European or North American airlines. (Emirates, the flag-carrier airline, savvily capitalised on this, furiouslyexpanding throughout the 1990s and 2000s.) For many, Dubai came to represent hazy layovers and family reunions. Sheer necessity introduced outsiders to the city. Others, including me, visited extended family members who resided in the emirate. The Dubai we encountered was one of polyglot haggling, stuffed suitcases and relentless change. Each layover, each summer, revealed a dramatically transformed city, with towering additions to its skyline. This was the city as pure id, a glittering “urban spectacle” as the scholar Yasser Elsheshtawy put it. Coining the term “Dubaization”, Elsheshtawy named the hyperreal extravagance of the city’s urban landscape, an aggressive, cash-flush development model that has become a global blueprint. Dubai leads, often to where we would rather not follow.Later, as an adult, my trips to the city were defined by work. For a brief spell I lived in Al Raffa, a bustling old neighbourhood. The Dubai I found this time embraced its jostling contradictions. In the Deira district, I shared a platter of Tamil food with a Nigerian film-maker, who recommended a local Ethiopian hairdresser. At a rooftop bar crammed with rowdy South Africans, I met a Somali-American flight attendant recovering from a nervous breakdown. We laughed at the absurdity of seeking stability in a place as transient as Dubai.On another trip, an Ethiopian millennial detailed the humiliations she endured when renewing her residency visa. She had lived in Dubai for most of her life, and had no intention of leaving. I had been aware of the other Dubai, the metropolis behind the myth, but these conversations still disarmed me. The city is attracting a different class of newcomers, those who had never expected to settle there.View image in fullscreenPassengers at Dubai international airport, 24 June 2025.Photograph: ReutersDubai has always been a cosmopolitan place – Baloch traders have settled there for centuries, seafaring Emiratis spoke Hindi and the Indian rupee was a local currency well into the 1960s. And there’s nothing new about Britons flocking to a part of the world, the Persian Gulf, that was shaped by British imperialism. As a sheikhdom, Dubai was one of the Trucial States, part of Britain’s informal empire in the Persian Gulf from the early 19th century to 1971.No amount of historical amnesia will change that. The British expat is a stock character of the 20th-century oil boom, with British people working as engineers, administrators, technicians and educators. The “Jumeirah Jane” stereotype was born in that era, a term referring to the leisurely wives of expats who spent their afternoons by the pool. Repelled by Britain’s broken social contract, many of today’s young professionals idealise the tax-free plushness of Dubai life. (It’s worth noting that the confectionery crazeDubai chocolatewas invented by a British-Egyptian woman based in the city.) In my own circles, Dubai became a refuge for working-class graduates who felt disproportionately victimised by years of austerity. Their careers flourished in the Gulf, and their passports guarded them against the worst forms of exploitation. For once, they had the upper hand.But the west has a habit of hoarding complexity for itself. The rest of the world is rendered one-dimensional, a vulgar composite of tropes. This lack of curiosity extends even to the migrant labourer, the quintessential symbol of abjection in the Gulf. We live in a time where domestic workers in the United Arab Emirates chronicle their daily lives on TikTok, responding to the comments of interested viewers. For those who are looking, there has never been greater access to the hopes and struggles of low-wage migrants.Contemporary Gulf literature breathes life into stories often reduced to statistics. The children of the city’s labourers are now writing about their parents’ struggles. Dubai Puzha by Krishnadas, Tania Malik’s Hope You Are Satisfied and Deepak Unnikrishnan’s Temporary People depict the modern Gulf metropolis with humanity and humour. Dubai-set Malayalam dramas and films portray migrants scrimping and saving, finding camaraderie along the way. Cinema continues to take a sweeping view of the migrant experience, with films such as Deira Diaries (2021) tracing four decades in the life of a Keralan expat. Such narratives peel away the person from the occupation. Migrant workers become more than objects of pity. Prickly, lovelorn, shrewd, pragmatic; we are increasingly exposed to their inner lives.When it comes to the Singapores, Dubais and Shenzhens of the world, a certain kind of inattentiveness plagues those opiningfrom the west. It’s easier to tell half the story, to bat away complexity. Peer into the crush of glass and sweat, dreams and desperation. Dubai is a funhouse mirror.

If we reject their humanity, how can we be proud of ourselves?Sat 30 Aug 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 30 Aug 2025 08.14 EDTShareNo one in their right mind thinks accommodating asylum seekers in hotels is a good idea. No one in their right mind thinks we should just live with undocumented, life-threatening migration routes into the UK. And no one in their right mind thinks the experiences endured by most migrants could be a rational choice for anyone. Forget for a moment the ludicrous, inflammatory posturing of many who should know better; we ought to be able to begin from these shared acknowledgments.Using hotels for housing vulnerable migrants is the equivalent of what prison reform campaigners have long called warehousing – make sure a problematic group is simply corralled somewhere more or less secure, and hope their issues will somehow sort themselves out. The chaos and under-resourcing of the legal processes involved and the shocking levels of delay mean that the conditions are created for maximal insecurity and rootlessness – at worst, resentment and criminality. And we have to face the fact that, so long as safe and legal routes for asylum seekers are inadequate, we are colluding in the flourishing industry of lethal and illegal systems whose effect is to create communities for whose safety and integration government is unable to plan, and who are trapped in a situation both dehumanising for them and challenging for localities where they are placed.Not a new issue: I have vivid memories of meetings more than 25 years ago in the post-industrial town in south Wales where I then worked, trying to broker discussion between local groups from socially deprived areas and various community and religious organisations, in the wake of what came across as a casual announcement from the government of a new initiative to settle significant numbers of asylum seekers in the town. Anger and bewilderment, yes, and an element of real hostility – but also a plaintive sense that yet again local voices had been completely ignored in a way that was all too familiar.But here’s the point of contact. We have become used to the insidious language of the “migrant crisis” as a matter of the interests of “ordinary people” over a consolidated mass of threatening, predatory, incomprehensible strangers – typically the young, foreign (and usually minority ethnic) male. Thehorrors of Southport last year, which had nothing to do with the immigration system, instantly produced a reinforcement of this perception that has grown stronger and stronger. But the truth is that the migrant, too, is an ordinary person. Anyone who has spent time with refugees – in Ukraine, in Syria, in Sudan, in Kent or Swansea – knows the conversations that are likely to happen. I never thought I could find myself here. I only want to make sure my children are safe. I miss my garden. I don’t know where my parents are. I don’t know how I can continue my education. To speak as though these people are anything other than ordinary is to reinforce the violence they have already experienced, the refusal to see them humanly.People in hotels, hostels, detention centres, are not there as a lifestyle choice – which is why it is not only unjust but absurd to punish them for being there. And to threaten such people as a way of pressurising the government to do something different is simple blackmail. Collective blame and indiscriminate violence are always the beginning of real moral corruption. A lot more work needs to be done to make audible the voices of actual individuals in the system, a lot more listening to the ordinariness of what they want and what they are afraid of. And at the moment, thanks to the rhetoric of both the nationalist right and some voices in or near government, what causes most fear among settled and newly arrived migrants is that they are assumed without argument to be criminal, morally alien, actively hostile to the communities around them. Can we stop talking about such people as not ordinary? Can we stop assuming that “ordinary people” are on one side of a zero-sum war?Much has been written about the failure of government and others to produce a counter-narrative around migration. But this needs to be not only a matter of generalisations about the benefits of diversity or whatever, but a story about the kind of vulnerabilities that people in the streets in the UK can identify with – something that amplifies the voice of the ordinary migrant and helps it to be recognisable. And this is most effective when grounded in local, face-to-face encounters, not only “official” exhortation. As with so many issues, facilitating proper deliberative and reflective opportunities within local communities is an urgent priority – perhaps the only thing that just might be able to challenge the standoff between the ordinary and the alien, and help each to recognise in the other some of the shared experience of being silenced and vulnerable.Still, the real counter-narrative issues goes deeper.The flags running up all around usare supposed to declare a pride in our identity and heritage. But what is it that we are proud of? What is it that we are defending? It is always moving when you hear, say, a student from a refugee background tearfully proclaiming their debt to Britain and their abiding loyalty to a country that has given them what they hardly dared hope for. We have good reason to be proud in the face of this. Internment camps,Ice-style snatch squads, payments to homicidal regimes for receiving returned migrants – none of this adds up to much in the way of “values”.It is natural and proper to be loyal to your neighbours and your history. But if this loyalty is no more than a sullen self-congratulation for just being where you are, it is not a project in which it is possible to take much pride. If we listen a bit harder to some of our migrant voices, we might be clearer about what others think we might have cause to be proud of. And we might start some proper cross-party conversation about what an immigration regime might look like that was committed to the safety and dignity of all the “ordinary” people involved in it.Rowan Williams is a former archbishop of CanterburyDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Now I think she was longing for a fairytale endingToni JordanMy mother gambled fast, ferociously, without any sense of fun. It was as though she hated money and couldn’t wait to get rid of itSat 30 Aug 2025 16.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 30 Aug 2025 20.57 EDTShareMy mother, Margaret, died in 2018 at 75. It was a good death, all things considered. The very end was savage, as endings often are, but she was in her own home and on her own two feet until the final week. For a woman who’d smoked two packs a day all her adult life, who’d never exercised or even walked to the shops, who refused to drink water (“I’d spew!”) and lived on Coca-Cola, paté on toast, jubes and green olives from a jar – considering all that, she did OK.During my mother’s final days, I had it easy. My sister, Lee, lived closer and is, to be honest, a more nurturing person. She’s caring. Patient. Lee is also better with money than me but I thought I should at least attempt to help – so at the end I took charge of Mum’s bank accounts. She lived on the pension and died with a run-down brick veneer villa unit in an over-50s complex, an old car worth close to nothing, and a small amount of cash.We were surprised she’d left that much. Yes, she’d worked full-time for 50 years, six days a week, and through much of the 70s and early 80s made close to $40,000 a year – or almost $250,000 in today’s money. Once she owned a beautiful home in Brisbane, on a huge block, in a tree-lined street. She took three holidays that I can recall: twice to Melbourne to visit me, and once to Cairns. She never held a passport. Her best dress came from Myer; everything else was from Kmart. She never went to the theatre or even the movies; she didn’t eat in restaurants or drink alcohol. She left no expensive jewellery or furniture, she gave nothing to charity, she wore no makeup, she had no fancy tastes in anything.Thea Astley’s writing was convoluted and obtuse – and it made me fall in love with words | Toni JordanRead moreSo where did all the money go?She gambled it.When we were children, this meant the track, mostly at the Gabba dogs on Thursday nights or at the TAB where she worked, or, on her rare days off, via telephone betting. She knew the name of almost every dog and horse, every trainer, every jockey. I remember when my sister and I were little, she would drive us to the library at Carina and wait in the car, listening to the trots, while we chose our books.Then, in the early 90s when pokies were legalised in Queensland, she fell hard. She would spend most Saturdays and Sundays by herself in those dingy rooms, sitting on a stool, chain smoking and pressing the buttons for hours, watching the lights, praying for the bells to ring and for coins to tinkle from the slot. Hours would pass. She wouldn’t eat or drink much, in case someone took her machine while she went to the toilet and it paid out.It was more than a hobby. This was before mandated limits, and my mother gambled fast, ferociously, without any sign of fun. She grumbled. She swore and grimaced and cursed her luck and whatever club she was in and the way life was stacked against her. Watching her, I always felt she was hard at work at a job both difficult and unpleasant, as though she hated money and couldn’t wait to get rid of it.Making money from gambling didn’t require her to speak differently or act differently or look differentlyI understand that addiction is a complex pathology, but as a teenager I judged her. I sometimes wondered if, were she ever prevented from gambling for some reason, she would have emptied the contents of her purse into the sink and set fire to it.With the passage of time, I think about my mother’s gambling more generously. She was a woman of sharp intelligence and a poor education, someone who could calculate complex sums in her head, who left school in year 10 once she had enough typing and shorthand under her belt to make a living. That was what mattered: making a living. Your own money gave you a little power. My mother wasn’t consciously trying to become middle class. She despised anything stuck-up or fancy and was especially critical of people acting “above their station”. She wore thongs everywhere, she swore loudly in public, she bunged on ockerisms in a performative way. Many times – such as when I published my first novel – she said to me: “Don’t forget your place.”All this working-class pride strikes me as the lady who doth protest too much. I think my mother was looking for something to distinguish herself, some kind of marker of her individuality, without the kind of striving she saw as being “up yourself”.“Self-actualisation” is a term tossed around, but in practical terms, what does that mean to a woman like my mother? She had never been exposed to music or literature or any kind of artistic pursuit; the idea of travel was beyond her imagination. She thought people who did volunteer work were utter mugs. Now I think she was perpetually bored and frustrated, and longed for a fairytale ending where someone waved a wand and – lo! – revealed her as a powerful queen.When people talk about working women in this country, they always mention the 1960s as the decade when everything changed – and that’s true, for middle-class women at least. Working-class women, like the women in my family, always worked. They worked in shops or on farms or factories or, like my grandmother, cleaning other people’s houses. There was no feminist revolution for them. Life continued as it always had.View image in fullscreenMy theory is this: my mother saw the windfall riches that came from luck as the only way to distinguish herself without needing her to pretend to be someone else. Making money from gambling didn’t require her to speak differently or act differently or look differently. She could still swear, still wear her thongs, still smoke two packs a day. She could dream of a bigger, richer life while remaining authentically herself.Of course, she never won big.Gambling, at its heart, is about poor people making donations to rich people. My mother wasn’t lazy, and she wasn’t greedy. She spent all that time and energy and money. So what would she have done with all that imaginary money, had she ever won it big? I have no doubt what she would have done. She would have spent none of it on herself, of that I’m certain. She would have spent all of it on a car, or even a house, for my sister and me.Tenderfoot by Toni Jordan (Hachette Australia, $33) is out nowExplore more on these topicsGamblingAustralian booksFamilyAustralian lifestylecommentShareReuse this content"

The council is planning to extend the Palantir system to processes for providing support to children with special educational needs.The council’s chief executive, Julie Nugent, said it aimed to “improve internal data integration and service delivery” and “explore the transformative opportunities of artificial intelligence”.Palantir already has a number of public sector contracts in the UK, including providing AI to help tackle organised crime in Leicestershire andbuilding the new NHS federated data platform. Keir Starmer toured the company’s Washington office in February with its chief executive and co-founder, Alex Karp. Palantir was also co-founded by Peter Thiel, the PayPal billionaire who helped fund Trump’s 2016 election camapign.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer touring Palantir’s office in Washington DC in February.Photograph: Carl Court/PATrade unions representing teachers and other council workers have said the deal raises “serious ethical questions”, and the independent councillor Grace Lewis called for the council to cancel the contract immediately “and ensure the £500,000 is spent right here in our community”.“It is indefensible that the council entered into a contract with Palantir, a company infamous for its role in providing weapons and surveillance to the IDF and its role in NHS privatisation, at a time when the council has made cuts to the public and voluntary sector,” Lewis said.Coventry recently started using Palantir’s AI to screen applications for household support funds. One senior official told a meeting of councillors in June: “There are very few areas that would not benefit from artificial intelligence.” A councillor at the meeting responded: “Sounds a bit like Big Brother to me.”In a letter to Nugent, the joint secretary of the Coventry branch of the National Education Union, Nicky Downes, highlighted Palantir’s use of AI in surveillance and weapons systems, and raised concerns about its collection and storing of data on citizens, in particular with respect to its provision of predictive policing systems.“There are some serious ethical questions regarding the business practices of Palantir Foundry, which is a subsidiary of Palantir,” Downes said. “There are also questions relating to its use of, and sourcing of, personal data. We would question the procurement process, particularly regarding ethical considerations and accompanying risk assessments, that led to the decision to spend £500,000 on an AI package from Palantir Foundry.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This will build our business case for further future investment and our overall approach to AI. We understand that the ethical implications of AI procurement are of paramount importance. Please be assured that the council has undertaken a thorough and robust due diligence process in line with our procurement policies.”A spokesperson for Palantir said: “We are excited to help Coventry city council harness AI to improve the services that they provide to the public. The technology offers huge potential, such as enabling social workers and special educational needs professionals to spend less time on paperwork and more time directly supporting children who are vulnerable or have special needs. The early signs are extremely promising, showing the potential for a significant reduction in the admin burden.”They said Palantir was non-partisan and had engaged with a number of US government administrations since it began working with the Department of Homeland Security in 2010.A spokesperson for the council said it was exploring how AI could help improve services and make them more efficient. “As part of this initiative, we are evaluating a range of AI solutions and technology partners, including Palantir, to support our AI objectives … As we continue to assess the value of AI for future investment, maintaining robust data protection and governance standards will remain our top priority.”It said the contract was awarded in line with standard procurement procedures and met its “rigorous security and compliance requirements”.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

That’s a great slogan. I agree with it. The problem is that since coming into office President Trump and Mr Kennedy have done exactly the opposite,” Sanders wrote.RFK Jr continues to make dubious health claims as CDC roils under his leadershipRead moreSanders pointed to the White House’s firing of Susan Monarez, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as four other top CDC officials who resigned in protest this week after Monarez “refused to act as a rubber stamp” for Kennedy’s “dangerous policies”.“Despite the overwhelming opposition of the medical community, secretary Kennedy has continued his longstanding crusade against vaccines and his advocacy of conspiracy theories that have been rejected repeatedly by scientific experts,” Sanders wrote.“Against the overwhelming body of evidence within medicine and science, what are secretary Kennedy’s views? … He has absurdly claimed that ‘there’s no vaccine that is safe and effective’ … Who supports secretary Kennedy’s views? Not credible scientists and doctors. One of his leading ‘experts’ that he cites to back up his bogus claims on autism and vaccines had his medical license revoked and his study retracted from the medical journal that published it.”Sanders went on: “The reality is that secretary Kennedy has profited from and built a career on sowing mistrust in vaccines. Now, as head of [the Department ofHealthand Human Services] he is using his authority to launch a full-blown war on science, on public health and on truth itself.”Pointing to what he described as “our broken health care system”, Sanders said that Kennedy’s repeated attacks against science and vaccines will make it more difficult for Americans to obtain lifesaving vaccines.“Already, the Trump administration has effectively taken away Covid vaccines from many healthy younger adults and kids, unless they fight their way through our broken health care system. This means more doctor’s visits, more bureaucracy and more people paying higher out-of-pocket costs – if they can manage to get a vaccine at all,” he wrote.The senator warned that Kennedy’s next target may be the childhood immunization schedule, which involves a list of recommended vaccines for children to protect them from diseases including measles, chickenpox and polio.“The danger here is that diseases that have been virtually wiped out because of safe and effective vaccines will resurface and cause enormous harm,” Sanders said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Last week, more than 750 current and former employees at US health agenciessigned a letterin which they criticized Kennedy as an “existential threat to public health”.The health agency workers went on to accuse the health secretary of being “complicit in dismantling America’s public health infrastructure and endangering the nation’s health by repeatedly spreading inaccurate health information”.The letter comes after adeadly shootingat the CDC headquarters in Atlanta earlier this month, when a 30-year-old gunman fired more than 180 rounds into the buildings, killing a police officer before dying from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The shooter had been struggling with mental health issues and was influenced by misinformation that led him to believe the Covid-19 vaccine was making him sick, according to the gunman’s father.Explore more on these topicsBernie SandersRobert F Kennedy JrTrump administrationUS SenateUS CongressDonald TrumpRepublicansnewsShareReuse this content"

Police have taken two men and a woman into custody.“Unfortunately, the toll is very heavy,” Rémi Coutin, the local prosecutor, said. Of the five people who were injured, two were in critical condition.The attack took place after an altercation between a young woman and several men, Coutin said, with staff escorting the wine bar’s customers outside.The prosecutors said the altercation had “escalated and ended in a terrible tragedy” after a man entered a vehicle and “deliberately reversed at high speed into the crowd outside the establishment”.Guy Lefrand, the mayor of Évreux, said in a statement posted on social media: “This morning I was informed of a serious incident that occurred in front of La Winery on Winston Churchill avenue. A fight broke out, causing a crowd to erupt, and a vehicle struck several people.”Lefrand noted that one person had been killed and five others injured, and offered his condolences: “I would like to express my deepest sympathy and solidarity with the victims, their families and loved ones.”Commending the emergency services and police for their response, the mayor added: “The situation has now returned to calm.

A decision on the target is expected before Anthony Albanese attends the UN general assembly in New York in late September.A consultation paper by the authority last year – based on an initial assessment of scientific, economic, technological and social evidence – suggested a 2035 target of between 65% and 75% below 2005 levels “would be ambitious and could be achievableif additional action is taken by governments, business, investors and households”. Since then, the government has been lobbied about what target it should set.Figueres said setting a target of a 75% or more reduction would be “not a burden”, but instead be “Australia’s ticket into the prosperity of the future”. She suggested the ambitious goal would increase Australia’s chance to win the rights to host a major UN climate summit in Adelaide in November 2026.Australia continues to vie with Turkeyfor the right to host the Cop31 summit and it is unclear when that will be resolved under the UN’s consensus decision-making process.UN climate chief warns Australia not to pick a ‘bog standard’ 2035 carbon emissions targetRead more“The new global economy is rising, powered by clean energy and green industry,” Figueres said. Australia can be at its heart, with unrivalled sun and wind, critical minerals and skilled labour ready to lead.“Prime minister Albanese now has the chance to show the Pacific and the world that Australia is ready to lead at Cop31 and beyond.”Sign up to get climate and environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a free newsletterA report last week, commissioned by the Business for 75% group, which is backed by Future Group, Fortescue, Atlassian, Canva, Ikea and Unilever, suggested a 75% reduction target could lead to national GDP being $370bn greater by 2035 compared with current projections. It said the economic benefits of the more ambitious goal would be much greater than under a 65% target.A separate report to be released on Monday by the research thinktank Climate Analytics suggests Australia should set a reduction target of about 81%, within a range of 76% to 89%, to align with the Paris agreement goal of attempting to limit global heating since preindustrial times to 1.5C.The Climate Analytics chief executive and senior scientist, Bill Hare, agreed with Figueres that other countries would be watching where Australia landed as they considered the government’s case that it should co-host Cop31 with Pacific Island countries.Hare said multiple studies had found Australia could “get into the 75% range in terms of what is technically and economically feasible”.

They have argued it meant Australia should set a target of reaching net zero emissions by 2035 – a goal that many experts say it would not be logistically possible to meet.What is happening with Australia’s emissions? Electricity is improving. Transport is notRead moreFrank Jotzo, the director of the Australian National University’s Centre for Climate andEnergyPolicy and a government adviser on climate policy, said that even a reduction target in the 60s would be ambitious. He said the government should be ambitious but the policies to drive change were more important than the number.Jotzo said Australia’s emissions reductions had been slow to date, and reaching a 65% reduction goal would require pollution levels to be halved in a decade. That was possible, he said, but would require substantial policies in areas where emissions have been rising or going sideways – particularly industry, transport and agriculture – and faster reductions than were happening in electricity.“Whatever target gets adopted should have a path to implementation and should have a good chance of being perceived as possible,” he said.Jotzo backed a suggestion by the climate change minister, Chris Bowen, that the government may set a target range, rather than a single number.Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisChristiana FigueresEnergy (Environment)Greenhouse gas emissionsGlobal climate talksEnergy (Australia news)Australian politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The Pickett fire, a blaze that had started about 10 miles (16km) away near the town of Calistoga, was moving toward their vineyards on Howell Mountain.Knowing that the Glass fire – a 2020 blazethat damaged numerous wineriesandspoileda year’s harvest – had burned along the same path, Slone hoped no fuel remained for this new fire. “But that was not the case,” he said. Within the week, the winery’s Candlestick Vineyard would become “a sacrificial lamb for the town of Angwin” when firefighters lit a controlled burn on their property to control the larger fire.Vineyards can make excellent fire breaks because they are typically clear of burnable plant matter, and grape vines themselves are moist enough to be nonflammable. But heat damage and smoke can still destroy a crop.The Robert Craig Winery lost the entire crop of their Candlestick Vineyard, which would have generated $4.5m in revenue. Slone estimates about 10% of the vines will need to be replanted – a process that will cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and take a decade to see new bottles of wine ready for market. The team will test grapes on another one of their vineyards closer to harvest to see whether the smoke affected them.View image in fullscreenThe Pickett fire burns on a ridge above a vineyard in Pope valley, California, on 22 August 2025.Photograph: San Francisco Chronicle/Hearst Newspapers/Getty ImagesThe loss comes at the end of the growing season – after Slone’s vineyard had sunk nearly $1m into farming costs – and is made even more devastating because it’s happened before. The memories of the 2020 Glass fire and 2018 Camp fire, which burned farther east but still sent smoke to blanket Napa’s grapevines, are still fresh. “It’s financially a devastating situation,” said Slone.The still-burningPickett fire, which began on 21 August in northern Napa county, quickly burned through 6,800 acres (2,750 hectares), making it the San Francisco Bay Area’slargest wildfirethis year. Preliminary estimates show that it caused$65m in agricultural losses, largely to wine grape growers, affecting about 1,500 acres (610 hectares) of agricultural land.Although that damage is significantly less than that wrought by the Glass fire – which burned through 67,000 acres (27,000 hectares) and racked up $3.7bn in losses – the growing threat of wildfires in aridCaliforniahas still shaken the wine industry.“Northern California wine country is one of the treasures of the United States,” said Slone. “It’s something that I think all Americans should be concerned about because it’s a uniquely American thing.”‘Tastes like a campfire’Along the west coast, wine grape growers have implemented many strategies to prepare for wildfires – with the support of scientists at the US Department of Agriculture and local universities.Ben Montpetit, chair of the University of California, Davis’s viticulture and enology department, said in an emailed statement that the industry has employed “barrier sprays to reduce smoke uptake, annual testing to establish baseline smoke marker levels in grapes, and small-lot fermentations after smoke events to assess potential wine impact”.“Researchers are also investigating which grape cultivars are more sensitive or tolerant to smoke exposure,” he added.“We’ve made a lot of progress in the preparedness realm,” said Natalie Collins, president of the California Association of Winegrape Growers, who noted the industry establisheda smoke exposure taskforceafter the losses in 2018 to aid growers after wildfires.View image in fullscreenA firefighting helicopter drops water on the Pickett fire in the hills near a vineyard on 21 August 2025 in Calistoga, California.Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesThe existence of that taskforce hints at a perennial problem for vineyards: though they can often keep wildfire off their acres, there’s little that can keep smoke at bay. And if smoke sits in an area for too long, it can leave grapes tasting ashy, like a campfire.“Smoke taint issues are kind of fickle,” said Heather Griffin, a partner at Summit Lake Vineyards and Winery. “It depends on the varietal, depends on your ripeness level and depends on how long the exposure was.”Griffin’s family’s vineyards were saved from the Pickett fire – “They stopped the fire at the end of our ridge up on Howell Mountain,” she said – but they’ll need to send grapes out for testing before harvest to be sure the smoke didn’t taint it.Protecting the industryFor the first year ever, crop insurers are offering a new coverage option called the fire insurance protection smoke index endorsement, which would insure vineyards for losses due to smoke exposure.But some growers say the cost of crop insurance has become unattainable after repeated wildfires.“Our insurance went up so much after the fires of 2020. It literally went from $40,000 a year for really great coverage for all of our properties and inventory, and now it’s $300,000 a year and covers nothing,” said Slone.For the 95% of Napa valley’s wineries that are family-owned, that cost can be “catastrophic”, he adds.The wine industry has historically relied on federal funding to support USDA and university research into wildfire preparedness. Although those levels have remained steady despite widespread federal cuts, eight federal wine grape research scientists – including a smoke exposure specialist – werefired and then rehiredearly in the Trump administration’s Doge-era cuts.“We want to make sure that an industry like ours continues to be protected,” said Collins, as “we continue to see the writing on the wall in California that wildfires likely will continue to be an issue here”.It’s possible that some federal disaster relief funding may work its way to affected vineyards, but Griffin says buying wine from those wineries “helps everybody that’s up here”.“Shoot them an email and buy some of their wine,” added Slone. “They will be the most appreciative people on the planet Earth.”Explore more on these topicsCalifornia wildfiresWineWildfiresUS wildfiresCaliforniaWest CoastfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This is more than treble the number for the same point in 2024 (45). The data covers the 400 sq km freshwater lough, its tributaries, and smaller peripheral bodies of water, including Portmore Lough and Lough Gullion.At the central water body within this vast lough, rivers and wetlands system that drains nearly half of all land inNorthern Ireland, along with parts of two counties in the Irish republic, the number of detections was slightly lower than 2024’s tally. As of 25 August, there had been 35 confirmed reports, compared with 42 during the same period in 2024, according to the devolved Department of Agriculture, the Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA).Lough Neagh’s recurrent algal blooms, which choke aquatic life, are caused by an overload of phosphorus and nitrogen entering the lough system. Sixty two percent of these derive from agricultural sources – including farm runoff, fertilisers and animal waste, while 24% comes from creaking wastewater treatment facilities and 12% from septic tank leakage. The remaining 3-4% is thought to come from a range of industrial and household sources around the lough.The data from Northern Ireland’s devolved government at Stormont comes as local people say this year’s blooms have been the “worst ever” within their lifetimes.View image in fullscreenPhoto issued by Lough Neagh Partnership of Lough Neagh at Ballyronan on 18 August.Photograph: Lough Neagh Partnership/PA MediaDr Les Gornall, a slurry expert who worked at Lough Neagh’s last major laboratory, told the Guardian 2025’s algal blooms had been “much worse than last year’s – significantly worse”, both in terms of the extent of the blooms’ coverage and the “intensity of smell” they produced. These details are not measured by Stormont’s detections, Gornall added.Researchers are still trying to pinpoint theimpactof this photosynthesising bacteria on the lough’s complex ecology. But Gornall highlights that the pollution’s secondary effects, including proliferatingaquatic weeds, which feed on the excess nutrients, are now visible.Stormont has not released official statistics on phosphorus loads entering the lough system over the past 12 months, but Gornall believes a further 16,000 tonnes have gone into Lough Neagh since last year, with about 10,000 tonnes having been retained in the water column.Despite numerous promises of action from politicians, Northern Ireland’s devolved government has struggled to make progress on tackling the reasons behind the lough’s pollution amid pushback from some farming groups – with the sector contributing more than 60% of overall phosphorus pressures – and the continued underfunding of the public wastewater system. Human sewage, from the public network and domestic septic tanks, is responsible for about 36% of phosphorus inputs.Andrew Muir, the minister at DAERA, hasurged his colleaguesat Northern Ireland’s power-sharing executive to “match their words with action” and give the promised backing to measures aimed at limiting pollution inputs. Safeguarding Lough Neagh has been made a key strand of the executive’sprogramme for government.“I feel like in recent months my hands have been tied behind my back because I have not had the support needed,” Muir told the Republic of Ireland’s state broadcaster, RTÉ.Executive approval wassecured belatedlylast summer for an “action plan” designed to address pollution at Lough Neagh. However, 23 of the plan’s 37 points have not yet been implemented.View image in fullscreenAn eel struggling on the surface of a blue-green algae bloom at Battery Harbour, Cookstown, Northern Ireland.Photograph: Charles McQuillan/Getty ImagesSome of the proposals in theNutrients Action Programme(NAP), such as placing phosphorus limits on thousands of farms and introducing uncultivated “buffer strips”, have encountered significant political opposition at Stormont. A campaign toscrap the NAP, supported by the three major unionist parties and some Sinn Féin politicians, has prolongedconsultationover the plans, which are due to be reconsidered when MLAs return from their summer recess next month.Meanwhile, the fallout from Lough Neagh’s recurrent pollution crisis is deepening. Earlier this summer, a key fishery at the lough announced it would beextending a banon the commercial fishing of eels – the water body’s most lucrative export catch – for the entire 2025 season. AStormont committeeheard in May that fishers’ incomes had fallen by about 60% since 2023, with no financial recompense or support package made available.Discussions have continued with Nicholas Ashley-Cooper, the 12th Earl of Shaftesbury, who owns Lough Neagh’s bed and banks, and a number of proposals for the lough’s future management are being considered. Ashley-Cooper spoke at an event hosted by theLough Neagh Development Trustin June in favour of a “sustainable funding” model, amid apparent interest in natural capital and green finance proposals for the lough from groups including the National Trust. “We are no longer speaking about theoretical concern,” he said. “The environmental crisis at Lough Neagh is there for all to see.”However, local campaigners, who staged ademonstration in Antrimon Monday, argue Lough Neagh is worth more to some private interests “dead than alive”.One attender, Patsy O’Malley Boyd, 59, said the lake was “way down the priority list” despite promises having been made by lough stakeholders. “But we’re looking at it for our children and our children’s children. I feel so sad about it. It’s like a choice – to go swimming here, to go walking – is being taken away from us.”Explore more on these topicsPollutionFishingNorthern IrelandConservationnewsShareReuse this content"

The site istechnically still onlinebut has been intentionally buried by the team of political appointees who now run the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.Now, a team of climate communication experts – including many members of the former climate.gov team – is working to resurrect its content into a new organization with an expanded mission.Their effort’s new website,climate.us, would not only offer public-facing interpretations of climate science, but could also begin to directly offer climate-related services, such as assisting local governments with mapping increased flooding risk due to climate change.The effort is being led by climate.gov’s former managing editor, Rebecca Lindsey, who, although now unemployed, has recruited several of her former colleagues to volunteer their time in an attempt to build climate.us into a thriving non-profit organization.“A lot of federal employees are grieving over the sense that they’ve not just lost a job, but a vocation,” said Lindsey. “None of us were ready to let go of climate.gov and the mission.”In the first few weeks after theTrump administrationended their work, Lindsey’s new team has received a steady flow of outside support, including legal support, and a short-term grant that has helped them develop a vision for what they’d like to do next.“The things that were most popular on climate.gov were things that basically just taught people about climate, both natural climate and climate change,” said Lindsey. “There is a need for content that helps people achieve basic climate literacy independent of an agency.”As multiyear veterans of the federal bureaucracy, at times they’ve been surprised by the possibilities that the new effort might offer.“We’re allowed to use TikTok now,” said Lindsey. “We’re allowed to have a little bit of fun. We have a group chat. We’re diving into things that are not part of our wheelhouse.”The climate.us team is also in the process of soft-launchinga crowdsourced fundraising drivethat Lindsey hopes they can leverage into more permanent support from a major foundation. Lindsey also set up an email address tocontact the teamto offer in-kind support.“Someone bought our domain name for us,” she said. “And we have somebody that’s volunteered web-hosting space for this phase. But we do not yet have the sort of large operational funding that we will need if we’re going to actually transition climate.gov operations to the non-profit space.”In the meantime, Lindsey and her team have found themselves spending the summer knee-deep in the logistics of building a major non-profit from scratch.“We’ve all had to let go of the 9-5 mentality and basically try to do things as quickly as possible,” said one member of Lindsey’s new team who previously worked with her at climate.gov but asked not to be named for fear of retribution.“By carrying on the legacy of climate.gov and actually trying to republish the most vital parts of climate.gov, we hope that we can be a cornerstone,” said Lindsey. “We hope that it will provide a critical mass that will attract other partners who want to be part of the effort.”Given the context of why Lindsey is doing this work at this time and in this way, it has been an emotional summer. The effort has the sheen of equal parts science journalism and a cathartic personal vendetta against an administrationthat has all but declared waron federal science efforts.“We’ve been optimistic and alternating between being energized and feeling like this is a good thing and we’re on the right path and then, of course, being terrified that we’re not going to be able to pull it off and six months is going to have passed and we all should have been looking for new jobs and we didn’t,” said Lindsey.“What’s happening can feel so overwhelming that it’s easy to feel like you’re powerless to do anything about it,” said Lindsey’s team member. “But sometimes you have to just look out and see what’s within your reach. And this problem is within our reach, so we just see it as sort of doing our part.”Lindsey also told the Guardian that all the content for climate.gov is still upif you know where to look, which, when she found that out, made her even more upset.“This is information that the taxpayers have already paid for,” said Lindsey. “This administration is trying to hide it and take it away from us. It’s an abuse of government. It’s a waste of resources. People should be indignant. That’s not the way the government should work.”“I think it’s important for this initiative to persist even past this crowdfunding phase,” said another part-time contributor to the project, who also wished to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation.“Whether people realize it or not, climate change impacts everyone, regardless of the current political environment. And climate science is the only way to understand and adapt to what is happening on our big beautiful planet.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

But doctors now believe it can be treatedAndrew GregoryHealth editor in MadridSat 30 Aug 2025 03.03 EDTLast modified on Sat 30 Aug 2025 04.03 EDTShareDoctors may have discovered the secret to mending a broken heart in a world-first clinical trial.Hundreds of thousands of people worldwide are living with takotsubo cardiomyopathy, known as broken heart syndrome, which causes the heart muscle to change shape and suddenly weaken. It is usually triggered by severe emotional or physical stress, such as losing a loved one.Patients may experience symptoms similar to a heart attack and face twice the risk of dying early compared with the general population. Some experience heart failure, resulting in debilitating symptoms such as fatigue, as well as a shorter life expectancy. There is no cure.But now, doctors may have the answer. The world’s first randomised controlled trial for broken heart syndrome has found that 12 weeks of tailored cognitive behavioural therapy, or a heart recovery exercise programme involving swimming, cycling and aerobics, helped patients’ hearts recover.Details of the breakthrough were revealed at the European Society of Cardiology annual congress in Madrid, the world’s largest heart conference.Dr David Gamble, a clinical lecturer in cardiology at theUniversity of Aberdeen, who presented the research, said: “In takotsubo syndrome, there are serious effects on the heart, which may not return to normal. We know that patients can be affected for the rest of their lives and that their long-term heart health is similar to people who have survived a heart attack.”The trial data highlighted the importance of “the brain-heart axis”, Gamble said.“It shows that cognitive behavioural therapy or exercise could help patients along the road to recovery. Both are very cost-effective interventions, and we hope that further studies could lead to them being used to help this underserved group.”The study involved 76 patients with takotsubo syndrome, 91% of whom were women and the average age was 66. Patients were randomly assigned to receive CBT, the exercise programme, or standard care. All received all other care and treatment recommended by their cardiologist.The CBT group had 12 one-to-one weekly sessions, adapted specifically to their condition by the researchers, as well as daily support if needed.The exercise group went through a 12-week exercise course, which included cycling machines, treadmills, aerobics and swimming, gradually increasing in number of sessions and intensity each week.Researchers used a sophisticated imaging technique called 31Pmagnetic resonance spectroscopy, which allowed them to study how patients’ hearts were producing, storing and using energy. In the CBT and exercise groups, there was a significant increase in the amount of fuel available to patients’ hearts to allow them to pump, which was not seen in people who had usual care.The average distance that patients that had CBT could walk in six minutes increased from 402 metres to 458 metres. People who completed the exercise programme were able to walk an average of 528 metres in six minutes, compared with 457 metres at the start.There was also an increase in patients’ VO2 max – their body’s maximum oxygen consumption at peak exercise – of 15% in the CBT group and 18% in the exercise group. Increases in walking distance and VO2 max are signs of improvement in health.The findings suggest the treatments could produce long-term benefits such as reducing symptoms and the risk of dying for those with broken heart syndrome, experts said.Dr Sonya Babu-Narayan, a clinical director at the British Heart Foundation, which funded the trial, said: “Takotsubo syndrome can be a devastating condition that can affect you at a really vulnerable time if triggered by a major life event.“People may not be as surprised that an exercise programme helped heart patients, but it is intriguing that this study also showed that cognitive behavioural therapy improved heart function and patients’ fitness. More research is needed to find out whether these approaches improve survival or symptoms over the long term.”Explore more on these topicsHealthResearchHeart diseaseHealth & wellbeingUniversity of AberdeenCounselling and therapynewsShareReuse this content"

Yetclandestine salons have continued to operatewithin communities across the country.Now, theTalibanhave said that they intend to root out and eliminate these underground businesses, issuing orders to community leaders and elders across the country that they must identify clandestine beauty salons and report those running them to the “vice and virtue” police.Frestha, a 38-year-old mother of three young children, said she had been operating her beauty salon business in secret since they were banned in 2023 because she had no choice but to work and no other way of earning money.Jobless, homeless and helpless without a man: Afghan women expelled by Iran into hands of the TalibanRead more“When the Taliban closed our salons, I was the only breadwinner in my family; my husband was sick, and I had three children whose expenses I had to cover,” she said.“But also I kept working because I feel so good when I could bring beauty back to a woman.

She subsequently predicted that Kamala Harris would become California governor. Harrisannounced in Julyshe would not seek the office.The lawsuit, seen by the Guardian, claims the pair met on the dating app Bumble in April 2024 when Tata was seeking advice for a book he was writing with astrological elements. It said Tata “was having trouble in his marriage” at the time – and frames their subsequent trysts as “a casual sexual relationship as well as a professional relationship regarding the astrology business”.The affair ended, it said, shortly before Tata was confirmed by the US Senate to his new role on 15 July. The lawsuit identifies the plaintiff only as “John Doe”, but Tata’s was the only defense department confirmation on that date, and the document also makes reference to his work as a novelist.Tripp, it said, took the breakup badly and began a campaign of harassment that featured hundreds of calls and text messages to Tata and his wife. “During these conversations, Ms Tripp threatened that she would ‘beat the shit’ out of John Doe’s wife, that she was going to ruin both of John Doe and John Doe’s wife’s lives, and that they needed to ‘watch our backs’,” the lawsuit said.In another message, after Tata’s wife pleaded to be left alone, Tripp is said to have told Tata in a message: “If your wife texts me again she’s going to be picking her teeth up. Pass it on.”The document alleges Tripp wanted $25,000 to keep the affair quiet, and threatened to accuse him publicly of an unspecified crime.“She threatened his marriage, threatened to and did publicly defame him to his new employer and high-ranking Senate officials, and intentionally caused him emotional distress by putting him in the Hobson’s choice between his reputation or career and his marriage,” the lawsuit states.The Guardian has contacted the defense department for comment. Lawyers for the plaintiff, contacted by The Cut, said they would not confirm or deny whether Tata was their client.A representative for the defendant told the outlet: “Ms Tripp strenuously denies the allegations in the complaint and trusts that the process will fully vindicate her.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The videos in question have been under indefinite court seal ever since the trio’s encounter made international news headlines in 2020.Clark’s attorneys, Marc Hoerner and Michael Kennedy, said that Creel on 4 August signed an order authorizing law enforcement officials to return cellphones, tablets, computers, gaming consoles, flash drives and memory cards they had seized from Clark while he was under investigation.Even though Hoerner said that he does not believe any of the sealed videos are on Clark’s electronics, the former clergyman was still awaiting his property’s return on Friday while officials wiped them clean of all data.Hoerner added that he does not believe the dominatrices – who ultimately pleaded guilty to misdemeanors – have ever sought the return of electronics seized from them during the case. Yet, if they ever did get them back, officials would wipe those electronics of all data, too, Hoerner said.Kennedy and Hoerner declined further comment. But the Guardian has learned from multiple sources with knowledge of the case that – among other things – the videos depicted a communion wine chalice being urinated in.The videos also depict Clark wearing a style of underwear typically worn by women as well as engaging in a sex act in a dormitory on the grounds of the church where he once served as pastor in Pearl River, Louisiana, about 40 miles (64km) north ofNew Orleans, the numerous sources said.Clark, Lady Vi and Empress Ming all fell under authorities’ scrutiny after a passerby peering through a window saw the three evidently filming themselves having sex on the sanctuary altar at Sts Peter and Paul church on 30 September 2020.Police responded to the church after they were called by the passerby, who took a cellphone video of what he could see. Besidearrestingthe group, officers confiscated stage lights, recording devices and sex toys.New Orleans archbishop Gregory Aymond – whose archdiocese had filed for federal bankruptcy protection months earlier amid the fallout of a decades-old clergy child molestation scandal – had the altar burned and consecrated a replacement.Hoerner has previously maintained that Clark’s actions may have offended Catholics but were legal, consensual acts among adults. Nonetheless, Hoener has said, for his client to move on with his life, Clark pleaded guilty to obscenity in 2022.The women, who traveled to Pearl River,Louisiana, from out of state, pleaded guilty that same year to institutional vandalism, and like Clark they were sentenced to probation.Clark ended up serving some jail time after he was found to have violated his probation terms by giving an interview to New Orleans’sNBC affiliatein which he explained the episode from his perspective.He told the NBC station, WDSU, that the celibate life Catholic priests promise to lead along with the social-distancing practices implemented during the Covid-19 pandemic at the time left him facing “issues of loneliness and wanting human interaction”.“Struggling and falling, sinning, too – priests sin as well,” said Clark, who voluntarily left the priesthood. He went on to say that he still believes in God and continued considering “mercy and forgiveness very important”.Lady Vi gave an interview in October’s issue of Hustler magazine in which she said she had been “invited to film porn”, and the shoot location was at the church.“Unfortunately, trespassers filmed us without our consent,” Lady Vi told the publication. She referred to the group’s subsequent prosecution, criticized the media’s coverage of the case, alluded to remarks from Aymond that the altar sex was “demonic” and asserted: “What matters is that we were consenting adults filming porn in a private location.“But because we were in the [southern US region known as the] Bible Belt and the building had mythical significance, it was deemed a crime.”Explore more on these topicsLouisianaNew OrleansCatholicismReligionPornographynewsShareReuse this content"

Then a shock diagnosis pitched them into an intense love affair ...Elizabeth GilbertSat 30 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTShareSometime in the summer of 2017 I wrote in my journal, “Jesus fucking Christ, please save me.” I was trapped in hell, and I could see no way out. Our beautiful, sunny, two-bedroom penthouse apartment in the East Village – which I had rented for Rayya to make her happy in the last months of her life – had become a dungeon of misery, danger, degradation, drugs. Rayya kept the shades drawn at all hours of the day, not only because the light hurt her eyes but also because she had become intensely paranoid that she was being watched by the police, and that they were coming for her.And, to be honest, the police might very well have come for her (for both of us, actually), because our apartment now contained thousands and thousands of dollars’ worth of cocaine – some of which Rayya was cooking down and shooting into whatever veins she could find upon her beaten-down, disease-ridden body, some of which she was freebasing, some of which she was snorting up her now constantly bloodied nose. But most of the coke, as of this moment, she had chopped up and laid out in thick rails on the coffee table, next to an overflowing ashtray, a bottle of whiskey, several bottles of morphine and trazodone and Xanax, a stack of fentanyl patches and a cluster of empty beer bottles. And these heaping lines of cocaine she counted, weighed and studied all day long.“What the fuck are you looking at?” she demanded, glancing up for a moment from her cherished cocaine heaps and peering at me through a blue haze of cigarette smoke – staring me down with hostile eyes that had not, as far as I could remember, blinked in days.Good question.What was I looking at?I was looking at somebody who was supposed to be dead by now – who had been given six months to live over 15 months earlier – but who simply refused to die. I was looking at somebody who had recently gotten kicked out of hospice (who gets kicked out of hospice, by the way?) for being aggressive and uncooperative to the kind, generous nurses and support staff who had been trying to help my beloved partner prepare her body and mind for a “death with dignity” – a death that, at this point, Rayya had utterly rejected in favour of plan B, which was to do enough drugs that she could feel immortal, that she could feel nothing.I was looking at somebody who had once been the only person on Earth who could make me feel completely safe and loved, but who now verbally abused me all day long, telling me that I was “a fucking shit show of a failure” when it came to taking care of her; that everything I was doing to try to help her was wrong; that I was a “needy little fucking crybaby” who had to “grow the fuck up”.Ifirst met Rayya Elias in the spring of 2000. I was 31 years old at the time, and married. I was on a certain path back then. Husband, nice house, good job, about to start a family. Except there was a problem with my hair, which was a frizzy mess. One day a friend told me I resembled a youngArt Garfunkel, and said I needed to do something about it. She suggested I go see this person named Rayya, who was cutting hair out of a walk-up apartment on Avenue C.I was dressed that day like a sales clerk at Banana Republic, which is how I always dressed back then. All khakis and cardigans. I remember my outfit clearly, because I looked and felt so different from Rayya, who was wearing black leather pants, a white tank top and motorcycle boots. I have fallen in love with many people at first sight, but I did not fall in love with Rayya Elias that day. In fact, I didn’t fall in love with her for another eight or nine years. But I did like her. She was funny and interesting and exotic.I remember asking Rayya about the strange coins that were piled up on her windowsill. She said they were her sobriety chips. I’d never seen one before, and she let me handle them. She had a coin for every milestone of her recovery – one day clean, 90 days clean, six months, one year, two years, three years.I knew I was messed up in terms of relationships but I didn’t know I’d become as addicted to Rayya as she was to drugsShe told me she’d been addicted to cocaine and heroin for most of her adult life, but had been clean for three years now. She showed me the scars on her arms from where she used to shoot speedballs. I remember how comfortable she seemed when talking about her former drug use, and how she used the wordjunkiewith a relaxed pride I’d never before encountered. How at home she appeared in her own battered survivor’s body!“It’s a fucking miracle I’m alive,” Rayya said. She was ablaze with the exuberant gratitude that I now recognize as being common in early recovery. This is the phase some people call “the pink cloud” – when the newly sober addict is high on the joy of simply being free at last from the grime and slavery of their dependency. They don’t need anything more than what they’ve got in the present moment, because they can’t believe they get to evenhavea present moment. Life feels simple, bright, limitlessly possible.Rayya didn’t fall in love with me that day, either. I was nothing like her other friends. I wasn’t punk, cool, tough, edgy. There was nothing street about me. Still, she was impressed that I was making a living as a writer and had a relatively untormented relationship with creativity. Whywasn’tI more tormented? she wanted to know. My life seemed like a curiosity to Rayya – just as curious as her life was to me.If this were a 12-step meeting in the recovery fellowship that I attend on a regular basis, and if I were speaking about my own addiction, this is how I would begin: “Hi, my name is Lizzy and I’m a sex and love addict.” If I wanted to get more specific about the matter, I might add: “I’m also a romantic obsessive, a fantasy and adrenaline addict, a world-class enabler, and a blackout codependent.”My addiction manifests as a sincere yet deeply misguided belief that somebody outside of myself will miraculously be able to heal me on the inside – thereby making me feel safe, cherished and whole at last. I have spent my entire life searching for that magical person who will see me and save me.As with many addictions, it can be fun at first, but then it quickly becomes hell. Because here’s how the story always ends up, whenever I fall into desire and obsession to this degree: as my addict brain becomes increasingly tolerant of these abnormally elevated levels of hormones, I will eventually need to score bigger and bigger hits of “reward” to experience the same high I felt at the beginning of the romantic encounter. I will do anything to get that release and relief again.Gilbert and Elias in Melbourne, Australia, in 2013.Photograph: courtesy of Elizabeth GilbertSoon I am neglecting my own life as I increasingly fixate upon the person who has become my source. My behaviour becomes more dangerous, more desperate, more clinging, more demanding, as I insist that the object of my infatuation keep stimulating the release of the hormones that my brain is now telling me I need in order to survive. If the person cannot or will not deliver the goods any more, I can’t get my craving satisfied. And when I can’t get my craving satisfied, my adrenals will crash. After the crash comes withdrawal. And when I go into withdrawal, I want to die.The whole time I was getting involved with Rayya – becoming her friend, falling in love with her, being driven to the edge of madness by her awful relapse into active drug addiction – I didn’t know that I was suffering from a dangerous addiction, too, which was leading both of our hearts into treacherous territory. I mean, I knew I was plenty messed up, in terms of my romantic relationships, but I didn’t know I was anaddict. And I certainly did not know that, over time, I would become just as addicted to Rayya as she was to drugs.Iran away from my first husband and toward another guy. We got high as hell off each other for a while, and then we crashed – hard. After my breakup, I quit my job, sold everything and travelled the world, searching for something – anything – that would heal my heart and restore meaning to my life. I met a charismatic Brazilian man who poured love, attention, validation and approval upon me with lavish abundance. We moved back to America and got married.I wrote a book about my travels. That book becameEat Pray Love. Suddenly I had a shit ton of money. When those big, fat Eat Pray Love royalty checks started rolling in, my distorted thinking informed me that I was undeserving of all this abundance: why was I so blessed when others still struggled? A solution arose in my imagination: I must give all my money away!For codependents, fostering dependency in others makes us feel safe, valuable and in control. And pretty soon I was hurling cash at people exactly the way I used to hurl my body at them. I paid off the credit card bills and school loans of my family members and friends; I bought them clothes and jewelry and houses; I invested in their businesses; I supported their artistic projects; I paid for their weddings; I sent them on dream vacations, subsidized their therapy, financed their home renovations and covered tuition for their children. I paid the medical bills of strangers, and I bought cars for neighbours who were going through tough times. I invented endless work projects around my home in order to give jobs to various local craftspeople.I tithed to churches I did not even attend.I was somewhat out of my mind back then is what I’m saying.During this time, I kept driving into the city to get monthly haircuts from Rayya – coming to know her better as time went by. When some of her friends let me know her marriage to her partner Gigi had ended and she was struggling financially, I said she could move into a converted church I’d bought in New Jersey if she just covered the utilities – and stay as long as she liked.After she moved in we became closer by the day. She called me whenever she was in trouble, just as I called her when I was in trouble. But it wasn’t only problem-solving that brought us together; it was also delight in each other’s company. Very soon, Rayya became my plus-­one for social events and professional engagements. She flew to London to do my hair and makeup for the British premiere of the Eat Pray Love movie – and she also walked the red carpet with me. We went to Mexico together, to Detroit, to Los Angeles, to Austin, to Australia, to New Zealand, to Miami. We went to the movies, to weddings, to Target, to McDonald’s, to Thanksgiving, to Beyoncé concerts, to karaoke, to the Jersey Shore. We met Oprah together.We tried on bras together, shopped for shoes together, ate Korean barbecue together, made tacos together, watched football games together, got Botox together. We were almost always out there in public now as “Rayya and Liz”. You might wonder how this impacted my marriage, but I convinced myself that there was absolutely no problem here. The way I saw it, I now had a platonic partner who enjoyed attending the sorts of social events with me that my husband disliked, and who also helped to stabilize my mental health.View image in fullscreenIn 2013, the year both had books published …View image in fullscreen… and at a party in 2015 to mark Gilbert’s next book, Big Magic. Photographs: courtesy of Elizabeth GilbertIn March 2013 Rayya publishedHarley Loco. In October of that year I publishedThe Signature of All Things. For both of us, these books were proving grounds and personal triumphs. Rayya’s memoir was evidence to herself, to her family and to her community that she had the discipline to complete a creative project, and that she – an immigrant kid who’d scarcely been able to finish high school – could really write.My novel was evidence to a legion of professional and amateur critics that, despite the wild commercial success of Eat Pray Love – a book that had shunted me straight into the chick-lit dungeon of many people’s imaginations – I could still deliver a novel that announced me as an important literary figure.I travelled all over the globe to promote it, and Rayya often came with me. We were interviewed together quite often, because people were becoming interested in our unlikely-seeming friendship: how had the Eat Pray Love lady and this street-smart Syrian ex-con become so close? My passionate devotion to Rayya – which I thought I was keeping so well hidden – was blazingly obvious in every story. Also, people kept snapping pictures of me gazing adoringly at my “friend” and I would cringe whenever I saw the results.But I can see now that Rayya and I were both at our most gleaming that year. Me, a happily married internationally famous author. She, a radiant example of the miracles of sobriety. Both of us out there selling our stories.On 25 April 2016, I got a phone call from Rayya. “Are you sitting down?” she asked, just like people do in the movies. I sat down. “They found tumours,” she said. “Lots of them. Not just in my liver. In my pancreas, too.” The breath left my body and for a long moment did not come back.I’d known that Rayya was getting a liver ultrasound that day, but I had assumed – as had she – that the results would be not only good but also cause for celebration. Rayya had recently learned that there was an amazing new treatment available for hepatitis C, a disease that had dogged her body for years. Hepatitis C had always been classified as incurable, but recently new medication had been shown to eradicate the virus completely from the liver when taken in intense doses over a period of six months to a year. Before, though, she had to get a liver ultrasound to find out whether she was a good candidate for the cure.Rayya explained that when the technician had looked at the images on his screen, he had suddenly gone quiet. He’d left the room and called for a doctor, who came in and looked at the images, too. The doctor also went quiet. “I swear, the temperature dropped by about 10 degrees,” she told me later. “Nobody was talking. And right then I knew I was gonna die.”After we hung up the phone, I lay down on my bed, and I wept and wept and wept. I knew then that I had to go to Rayya and be with her until her death. Everything would have to change. I told my husband the truth at last, about my feelings. And we agreed to end our marriage.View image in fullscreen‘After I confessed my love to her, I asked, “Do you like me that way?” Do you like methat way?’Photograph: Deborah LopezNow I had to tell Rayya. It was a simple conversation. After I confessed my love to her, I asked, “Do you like me that way?” Do you like methat way? I might as well have passed her a note after gym class reading “Check box, yes or no.”After a long silence, she opened her eyes and smiled. Then she gathered me up in her arms and said, “Baby, my baby. My beautiful baby, why did you take so long to come to me?”I don’t know whether it’s a normal reaction for somebody to experience a sense of euphoria after receiving a death sentence, but Rayya certainly did. “Everyone spends their lives wondering how they’re gonna die,” she said, “and now I get to know? That’s amazing! It’s done, it’s settled. Why do I feel like this is such great news? It just makes everything so easy.”Maybe it was because Rayya had already “died” so many times as a drug addict – flatlining in one overdose after another – that the news of her impending mortality did not much frighten her at first.“Let’s just blaze out,” she said, her eyes brilliant with an elation I had never before witnessed in her. “Let’s just live balls to the wall until I die!” Enthusiastically, fervently, grandly, I agreed to it all.Of course, I should also probably mention that we were high as hell at the time. If you ever want to see two people go on a wild bender, have them fall desperately in love with each other, make them suppress that love for about eight years, and then suddenly allow them to release their true feelings for each other – and do it against a compelling backdrop of imminent death, where there are literally no more consequences. If at least one of those people (but probably both of them, to be honest) is a sex and love addict, then the ride will become even more outrageous. That was the trip we were on, man, and we were flying.View image in fullscreen‘“Never leave me,” she would beg. “Never let me wake and not find you here.” I promised.’Photograph: courtesy of Elizabeth GilbertI began toreallypour myself into Rayya – showering her not only with love and care but also with money and resources. I completely took over her life from a financial standpoint, not only paying for her medical expenses and her rent and her bucket-list experiences but also buying her things. So many things! Anything Rayya had ever wanted I insisted she must now have. Had she specifically asked me for these things? I cannot now remember. But I desiredher. So I gave it all to her, and fuck the expense: I didn’t care if it bankrupted me.Do you want a Range Rover? Here is your Range Rover.Do you want a brand-new piano?

And boy, did we have fun.We were able to completely forget about the past, the future, mortality, life itself. They were the most iridescent and heightened few months of my life, and – I believe – of hers. But then, of course, it ended. Eventually somebody has to get out of bed and open the blinds and notice that there are 90 voice messages on their phone and stacks of mail piling up outside their door. There was still a world out there, goddamn it – and that world was trying hard to get Rayya’s attention.Rayya might have wanted to flame out in a blaze of glory, but a lot of people wanted her to stay. In the end, she caved to her family’s wishes that she fight the cancer and agreed to try chemo. “I’ll do it just to make everyone happy,” she said, “but I know I’m gonna hate it, and it’s not gonna work. So after three months, I’m gonna quit and do whatever the fuck I want again.”Chemotherapy turned out to be a dark and powerful sorcerer – effective but vengeful. It was brutal. But also, a great trust and tenderness grew between us. As the autumn progressed, our days had become more difficult, but my life’s purpose was radically simplified: I existed for no reason, I truly believed, except to serve Rayya’s needs.“Never leave me,” she would beg me at night, when she was in pain. “Never go anywhere without me. Never let me wake up in this bed and not find you here by my side.” I promised her again and again that I would never leave her.“Absolutely not,” was my constant reply. “I’m not going anywhere. I won’t ever leave your side, not even for a moment.” I’d heard of people who got overwhelmed by the job of caretaking a sick loved one, but those people obviously didn’t know how to love people as hard or as powerfully as I knew how to love people. Others might crack or have needs of their own – but not me. Never me! I had no need for rests and breaks, no need for outside assistance. I had the whole situation handled. I hadlove; I didn’t need any help!The truth was, though, I was starting to crack.We spent Thanksgiving and Christmas with her family, and both occasions were precious, boisterous and sweet. We spent New Year’s Eve together in New York City. We got drunk that night, knowing without a doubt that 2017 would be Rayya’s final year on Earth.On new year’s morning I went for a walk to the East River, to make my new year’s wishes by the water, as I always do. When I reached the water, I wept. Rayya was getting sick again, I knew it. I had noticed that her abdominal swelling and episodes of pain and vomiting were increasing. The cancer was growing again.As the first weeks of the new year went by, Rayya was often in such deep pain that she could not sleep for more than an hour or two a day. There were some good days during that time. Friends threw Rayya an exquisite birthday party, and she and I had a commitment ceremony in front of our loved ones, complete with flowers and rings and beautiful wedding clothes. But most of the time, we were in torment. Rayya could not bear to be alone in her anguish, and because she didn’t sleep, I didn’t sleep. If I dozed off while she was talking to me, she would become furious, and I would wake up to hear her sobbing, accusing me of abandoning her. Or she would wake me up to tell me, “I just want to go back to bed and cover my head and sleep.”During Elias’s cancer treatment in 2016: ‘“I’ll do it to make everyone happy,” she said, “but I know I’m gonna hate it, and it’s not gonna work.”’Photograph: courtesy of Elizabeth Gilbert“OK, baby,” I would say. “Let’s see if we can tuck you back in, then.”“You just want me to die. You just want to get rid of me.”Soon we were both shredded – she from physical pain and fear of death, both of us from sadness, exhaustion and lack of sleep. Something clearly needed to be done. That’s when morphine was recommended. And whyever not? Everyone knew that Rayya had once been an opioid addict, but nobody was worried about addiction now – because she was a terminal cancer patient on a death watch.“Let the dragon roll one more time,” she said when she finally put that first morphine pill in her mouth. And indeed the dragon rolled itself awake. The dragon opened its yellow eyes and lifted its leathery, powerful wings and flew on silent gusts through Rayya’s bloodstream. And instantly, magically, my beloved’s suffering was erased – just as her suffering hadalwaysbeen erased by opioids.How swiftly that moment of peace came to an end, after the first morphine pill disappeared into Rayya’s system. How quickly the dragon of addiction began to roar through Rayya’s blood, demanding what it always demands –more, more, more.Addiction: a disease Rayya and I were both powerless over, in our own awful ways. Love addiction, drug addiction, dependency, codependency – it’s all the same thing: a disease so tireless and dirty and dignity-consuming that it will never rest until you’re ruined.Addiction. A disease so insidious and vile that – I swear to God – it makes terminal cancer look like a day at the beach.I came up with a good idea for what would save me from the nightmare I was now trapped in with Rayya. I would kill herIt was in July of 2017 that I came up with a really good idea for what would save me from the nightmare that I was now trapped in with Rayya.I decided I would kill her.I am not talking here about a mercy killing, or euthanasia, or helping someone who is in great suffering to have a death with dignity. Rayya, at that point, most certainly did not want to die, and she no longer gave a shit about her dignity. All she wanted to do was consume as much cocaine, alcohol, prescription drugs and cigarettes as she could get her hands on; to monologue about how amazing and powerful she was for defying all the doctors’ prognoses about her “expiration date”; to doze off while smoking cigarettes in bed, until the sheets and pillowcases smoldered from her dropped embers; to pick hallucinated worms and bugs off her hot, itching skin; and to tell me what a total fucking failure I was as a human being for not taking better care of her.And because she would not sleep, I could not sleep. Every time I shut my eyes, she shook me awake and demanded that I pay attention to her, or bring her something she needed, or listen to speeches about how great she was and how terrible I was.She wasn’t even really experiencing physical suffering any more, because she was so incredibly altered that she couldn’t feel anything. So, no – Rayya did not want to die. ButIwanted her to die.I came up with the plan late one night when she had been awake for many hours, staring into a mirror with her eye only one inch away from the reflective surface, yelling at the demon that she swore she could see in her eye’s reflection – a demon who, she kept insisting, “lives all the way down there at the bottom of my brain”.I decided I would do it the next day. I went back to sleep that night in peace, knowing that liberation was finally in sight. I want to make something extremely clear here: when I say that I once planned to murder Rayya, I don’t mean that the idea simply crossed my mind that my life would be easier if she were gone. I mean that I fully intended to kill her. And I tell this story in all its raw honesty, because I want people to understand how insane codependency can make a person become. I mean, I’m the nice lady who wrote Eat Pray Love. And I came very close to premeditatedly and cold-bloodedly murdering my partner because she had taken her affection away from me, and because I was extremely tired.View image in fullscreen‘For a long, long time, we held each other’s gazes in silence. In that moment, it felt as if there were a break in the universe.’Photograph: Deborah LopezThe next morning, while Rayya nodded off in front of the TV, I stole some of her sleeping pills and morphine pills and took them to the park with me. While my fellow New Yorkers went about their business in the beautiful summer light, I sat on a bench, studying and comparing the two medications in the palm of my hand, trying to figure out how I could make the sleeping pills look like the morphine pills so I could trick her into taking a bunch of them.I would have to be careful about this murder, I knew – not because I was afraid of the police (I wasn’t even thinking about the police, I was so out of my mind) but because I was really, really afraid of Rayya. If she woke up and realized I was trying to murder her, I’d be dead. If I didn’t kill her, she would kill me. So I had only one chance to do the job right.When I returned to the apartment, my mood was strangely buoyant. I walked in cheerfully, saying, “Hi, honey! I’m back!” Rayya looked up at me from her seat by the coffee table – which was, as always, covered with cocaine and pills and booze.Without even blinking, and in a voice that was dead calm and sober, she said, “Don’t you start plotting against me now, Liz.” For a long, long time, we held each other’s gazes in silence. In that moment, it felt as if there were a break in the universe.“Think carefully about what you’re about to do,” Rayya said, in a voice that could not have been more lucid. Then her eyes glazed over once more, and she returned her attention to the coffee table covered with drugs, booze, cigarettes.Who did I think I was kidding, that I could kill her? Nobody could kill her. Cancer couldn’t even fucking kill her.Eat,  pray,  cash inRead moreWithout saying another word, I gathered myself up again and walked back out of the apartment. I wandered through the East Village for the next several hours in a daze, not knowing where to go or what to do now. Then suddenly I had a really brilliant inspiration! Maybe I should take the sleeping pills and the morphine! Wouldn’t that solve everything, with ease and efficacy?I mean, my life was already destroyed, so why not finish the job? The pills were right there in my pocket; the deed could be easily done. The only question was where to do it. I didn’t want to die on the streets and bother anyone, or make them have to deal with my corpse. Maybe I should walk to the river and throw myself in …Then I heard a voice in my head – a voice that pierced my confusion so cleanly and swiftly that it could only have come from God. The voice said this:If you have arrived at a point in your life where youare seriously considering murdering yourself or another human being,there is a strong possibility that you have reached the end of your power.I stopped walking.I listened harder.I leaned into the sound of God, offering me wisdom and guidance.That being the case, continued the voice,perhaps it’s time you called somebody and asked for help.I was sobbing and full of shame and anger as I called these people – tears and snot running down my face right there in public – but I called them anyway. I remember one of them said: “What they say about the stages of grief is true – denial, anger, negotiation –all those things do happen. But they don’t happen in tidy order. They sometimes happen all at once. That’s what’s happening to you and Rayya right now. You two tried to cram an entire lifetime together into a few months, so everything is condensed and super intense. All the joy, all the sorrow. You’re experiencing everything all at once.”Someone else said: “Here’s what you need to understand about other people’s addictions: you didn’t cause it, you can’t control it, and you can’t cure it. There’s nothing you can do to manage Rayya at this point, and the more you try to control the situation, the more you will lose. When it comes to other people’s addictions, whatever you try to control ends up controlling you.”Life doesn’t fall apart all at once, and it doesn’t get healed all at once, either. Sometimes a spiritual awakening takes a minute to sink in, or a few months, or a few years. But something started happening within me, after my day of sobbing conversations in the park with all my wisest friends. Something started turning toward the dim and distant light of comprehension.Rayya Elias died on 4 Jan 2018. She was 57 years old. As of this writing, I’ve been clean and sober for almost exactly five years. Today, I live alone in my church in New Jersey.This is an edited extract from All the Way to the River by Elizabeth Gilbert, published by Bloomsbury on 9 September at £22.

Set in a fishing village, it explores the intimate presence of death and the disquieting claustrophobia of family and community – qualities often assumed to be eternal virtues.Maybe a film of just this kind was always what Jenkin’s distinct film language was waiting for. His technique and his quasi-primitivist aesthetic favour the eerie and the uncanny; his films have the texture of early cinema updated to the present day, shot on 16mm, developed by hand in such a way as to create scratches on the print, with dialogue and ambient sound overdubbed. It all creates a drama that feels like a remembered dream, and when there are actual dream sequences the gap between the illusion and reality is very slight. The movie itself feels to me like a kind of found object, and in this digital age it is vanishingly rare to encounter something that makes you think of the lost physical reality of celluloid whirring through a projector’s old-fashioned metal sprockets.Jenkin is returning here to the world of his2019 debut feature Bait: people who make a tough and precarious living from going out on fish trawlers. (Bait was in blackand white, but this is in the rich and vivid colour more reminiscent of Super 8 home movies.) A local fisher in a depressed fishing town, played by Edward Rowe, is astonished one morning to see a certain trawler bobbing innocuously in the harbour: the Rose of Nevada. This was a boat that was lost 30 years before in a heavy storm. The boat has returned from the dead. How on earth has this happened?Stunned, he approaches the widow of one of the drowned fishers (Rosalind Eleazar), a woman with two grownup daughters, and simply tells her the boat is back, and she responds with the same woozy, suppressed dread as him. But soon he feels that the boat should be put to work; a grizzled captain (Francis Magee) is recruited, along with two young crew members from the town: thoughtful Nick (George MacKay) and boozy drifter Liam (Callum Turner). The latter flirts with the lost fisher’s daughter in a pub; she gives him a present of her late dad’s old red cap, which he wears on board.Nick is disturbed to see the words “Get off the boat now” scratched into the ghost ship’s woodwork below deck, and once they arrive back, their craft bulging with fish, they find something even stranger; the town seems fuller, livelier, the pub looks in better shape and allows smoking indoors. The awful truth is that they have gone back in time to 1993, three years before Nick’s birth, and everyone in town thinks that Nick and Liam are the two men who vanished. Have they somehow cosmically contrived a happier future for the two men than the one that actually happened? Or was it their reality that was in fact unreal: a premonition of disaster and gloom from 30 years ago?Either way, Nick is deeply disturbed to find Liam simply accepting the situation, and blandly accepting what appears to be an agreeable new reality of living with the widow – that is, the mother of the woman he had been flirting with – as a husband and father. For him, it is an outcome rather better than any he had been imagining. Nick is horrified by this existential imprisonment, and perhaps it is emblematic of these young men’s ambivalent attitudes to the livelihoods and existences of their parents’ generation: going out to sea, in discomfort and even danger, for something that may not provide a stable income. And he feels oppressed by what the captain is telling him: that people on shore are relying on them.In the hands of a conventional film-maker, this would be a conventional scary movie, like one of Roald Dahl’s Tales of the Unexpected, crossing all the “t”s and dotting all the “i”s of scariness. Jenkin makes of it something more elusive and complex, with a strangeness and enigma present from the beginning; the film appears to be saying that there is something unknowable here even without the time slip. It’s another really bold and distinct statement from Jenkin.Rose of Nevada screened at the Venice film festivalExplore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsCornwallHorror filmsVenice film festivalFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

A noticeable trickle, like a leak from the upstairs bathroom dribbling down the living room wall, but nothing existentialyet. The five notable bands who have left Spotify in the past month – shoegazersHotline TNT last week, joining Deerhoof, Xiu Xiu, Godspeed You! Black Emperor (GY!BE) and King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard – are well liked in indie circles, but aren’t the sorts to rack up billions of listens. Still, it feels significant if only because, well, this sort of thing wasn’t really supposed to happen any more.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Plenty of bands and artists refused to play ball with Spotify in its early years, when the streamer still had work to do before achieving total ubiquity. But at some point there seemed to a collective recognition that resistance was futile, that Spotify had won and those bands would haveto bend to its less-than-appealing model. That realisation was best summed up by the Black Keys, a legitimately big rock band at the time of Spotify’s emergence who refused to put the albums they released around then – 2011’s El Camino and 2014’s Turn Blue – on the platform. They relented two years later andsay nowthat “taking a stand definitely hurt us in the long run”.This artist acquiescence happened in tandem – surely not coincidentally – with a closer relationship between Spotify and the record labels that once viewed it as their destroyer. Some of the bigger labels have found a way to make a lot of money from streaming: Spotify paid out $10bn in royalties last year – though many artists would point out thatonly a small fraction of that reaches themafter their label takes its share.View image in fullscreen“It does not align with the band’s values in any way.” Hotline TNT.Photograph: Charlie BossDespite those conditions, for artists dealing with Spotify,it has long seemed unavoidable. So why have those five bands departed in quick succession? The trigger was the announcement that Spotify founder Daniel Ek had led a€6oom fundraising pushinto a German defence company specialising in AI weapons technology. That was enough to prompt Deerhoof, the veteran San Francisco oddball noise pop band, to jump. “We don’t want our music killing people,” was how they bluntly explained their move on Instagram. That seems to havealso been the animating factor for the rest of the departed, though GY!BE, who aren’t on any social media platforms, removed their music from Spotify – and indeed all other platforms aside from Bandcamp – without issuing a statement, while Hotline TNT’s statement seemed to frame it asone big element in a broader ideological schism. “The company that bills itself as the steward of all recorded music has proven beyond the shadow of a doubt that it does not align with the band’s values in any way,” the statement read.That speaks to a wider artist discontent in a company that has, even by its own standards, had a controversial couple of years. There was of course the publication of Liz Pelly’s marmalade-dropper of a bookMood Machine, with its blow-by-blow explanation of why Spotify’s model is so deleterious to musicians, including allegations that the streamer is filling its playlists with “ghost artists” to further push down the number of streams, and thus royalty payments, to real artists (Spotify denies this). The streamer continues to amend its model in ways that have caused frustration – demonetising artists with fewer than 1,000 streams, or by introducinga new bundling strategyresulting in lower royalty fees. Meanwhile, the company – along with other streamers – has struggled to police a steady flow ofAI-generated tracksandartistson to the platform.So it’s understandable that some bands might have decided that the trade-off is no longer worth it. Of course, it should be noted that the five bands mentioned feel they are established enough to weather a departure fromSpotify, and have the backing from their labels to leave. Not everyone will be in the same position. And removing yourself from such an important platform is highly risky. But if they can pull it off, the sacrifice might just be worth it. “A cooler world is possible,” as Hotline TNT put it in their statement.If that’s true for artists it’s surely true for listeners too – though I have to say I find it really hard to shake the idea of Spotify as anything other than the default mode of listening to music, having been using it since 2009. It remains a remarkable site of discovery and I’ve encountered bands and genres, across decades and continents, that I probably wouldn’t have found without it. But while it’s broadened my music consumption, it’s also unquestionably flattened it and I don’t give new albums and tracks as many listens as I should.Saying that,this year I’ve definitely found myself spending less and less time on Spotify. I don’t think that’s down to ethics, necessarily, it just doesn’t seem as enticing a prospect as it once did, with the endless lovebombing of artificially generated playlists and moods. I’ve been using Bandcamp more, even – gasp – buying albums (though equally a lot of the time I previously spent listening to music is now being taken up by podcasts instead).Other options are, of course, available – the Guardian has provideda helpful guide– but they have their own ethical quagmires attached. And ultimately, they are replicating the same broad but shallow model as Spotify (with the exception of Bandcamp, of course). Maybe weaning ourselves off not just Spotify, but the way that Spotify has convinced us to consume music is the only answer. Then a cooler world might be possible.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Her new book, Indignity, reconstructs the life of her grandmother, who arrived in Tirana from Salonica as a young woman and became closely involved with the country’s political life. She currently holds the Ralph Miliband chair in politics and philosophy at the London School of Economics. The Turkish writer Elif Shafak is author of more than 20 books, both nonfiction and fiction, including the Booker-shortlisted novel 10 Minutes 38 Seconds in This Strange World and, most recently, There Are Rivers in the Sky. When the pair talked over videocall, Ypi travelling in India and Shafak at home in London, their conversation ranged over the threats of censorship and the rise of populism, the challenges of being writers with multiple identities and the importance of representing complex historical events in their work.Elif ShafakIt’s the age of angst. There’s so much anxiety, east and west, young and old, so many people are anxious right now, it’s quite palpable. And I think in many ways, it’s the golden era for demagoguery, for the populist demagogue to enter the stage and say: “Just leave it with me. I’m going to make things simple for you.”Lea YpiWhat’s striking for me is the contrast between this really rich life that you find in literature and in academia, and the platitudes of politics. In literature there is an experimentation with genres and with cultures and with languages, and so you get this sense of complexity. You have almost the exact opposite happening in the political realm, where it’s all about simplicity. It’s all about being on message, not making it too complex. It has to be short. It has to be very simple, on the verge of banality. And increasingly, it’s also exclusionary. So there is this tendency in contemporary political discourse to say: OK, let’s drive out the migrants – a sense that you can only get a just society if you have homogeneous societies.It’s a golden era for the populist demagogue to enter the stage and say: Just leave it with meElif ShafakESIt’s important to talk about censorship as well. Not just the pressures that come from outside or above, but also from within: self-censorship. How do we overcome that? I come from a land in which words are heavy. Anything you write about, from sexuality to gender to memory to history, can offend the authorities. I had a taste of that when one of my novels, The Bastard of Istanbul, was put on trial: it tells the story of an Armenian American family and a Turkish family through the eyes of women, but it deals with memory, amnesia and the biggest taboo still to this day in Turkey, which is the Armenian genocide. When the novel was published, the prosecutor asked for three years in prison. The words of fictional characters were brought to court as evidence. And during that time, there were people burning EU flags, spitting at my picture, burning my picture, calling me a traitor.Years later two of my books were investigated for the crime of obscenity: 10 Minutes 38 Seconds in This Strange World because it has a sex worker in it, and The Gaze because it deals with subjects like child abuse, in a country where we have child brides, which, in my opinion, means child abuse. The reason I mention this is because these are the realities of the societies where we come from. We have to carve a space for ourselves in which we forget about all of that. Because if we start thinking, will people get offended? Will the authorities get upset? Then we cannot produce a single line.LYWhat has been important for me about growing up in Albania and then navigating the transition from communism to the post-communist period is that living in a totalitarian society makes you very, very sensitive to propaganda of all kinds, all the time. And so there was never actually this break where first I lived in an unfree world and then I became part of the free world, it was always about remaining vigilant to see where there is censorship and ideological manipulation and propaganda – even coming from places that seem completely innocuous and innocent at first.You’re always thinking about what is critically missing in a society in which you live: where is the gap in democracy? There is all this praise of freedom, and yet we live with politicians and people who make decisions that are so obviously constraining the freedom of other people everywhere.We have this expression in Albania: “Istanbul is burning and the old woman is combing her hair.” You worry that in some ways, what you’re doing is completely irrelevant, but you say to yourself: my job is just to be critical and to put pressure and to remember, to try and make people think about how the past shapes the future, how these ideas repeat themselves, and how these political conflicts in the present all have a history and all come from some unresolved trauma in the past.ESWe have so much in common: the subjects, the themes that we deal with, the geographies that we come from, but also the silences that we dig into. I think for both of us, memory is important, not in order to get stuck in the past, but because without remembering we cannot repair.LYIt starts by understanding how every voice out there is always a result of some power relation or other. This was my experience with writing Indignity, which was about my grandmother, and going into the archives. It turned out it was really hard to research a woman who lived in the 1920s and 30s in particular. She lived in Salonica, which was still very much culturally Ottoman when she was growing up. It had just become part of the Greek state, and they completely shaped the discourse of what they wanted to be told and how it was told.If you’re relying on official authority sources, they all have their own agenda, and by the way in which they construct the archive, by the way they write history, even by the way they shape literary traditions, they always have an agenda that is usually the agenda of the people in power. So how do you challenge that? I think it’s only when literature becomes resistance that it can challenge that, but it needs to explicitly want to do that.View image in fullscreen‘Being a writer is a bit like being a linguistic archaeologist: you have to dig through layers of stories’ … Elif Shafak.Photograph: Marc Sethi/The GuardianESI think being a writer is a bit like being a linguistic archaeologist: you have to dig through layers of stories, but also layers of forgettings. Of course, with the Ottoman empire, we’re talking about a multi-ethnic, multilingual, multi-religious empire that lasted for more than 600 years. It’s incredibly complex, and the story changes depending on who is telling it, but also what we are mindful of is who is not allowed to tell the story. That’s what we want to get at.So the way, for instance, Ottoman history is being taught in schools, and I went to Turkish schools: there’s a void, and that empty space is almost always filled by ultra-nationalistic, sometimes ultra-religious, imperial nostalgia that talks about what a great empire we were. Wherever we went, we brought justice and civilisation. The moment you start asking: OK, what about the stories of women? What was the Ottoman empire like for a prostitute, for a concubine in the harem, for a peasant woman who had no access to power or authority? Then there’s a huge silence. Or the moment you start asking about minorities, maybe a Jewish miller, a Kurdish peasant, an Arab farmer, a Greek sailor. What was the Ottoman empire like for them? Or an Armenian silversmith? Again, big silence.Literature has a democratic function only because it doesn’t preach – if you preach then you become authoritarianLea YpiBut if I may quickly add this, I don’t like it when writers try to preach or teach or lecture, and I think that’s something that we need to be very careful about.LYLiterature has this democratic function only because it doesn’t preach. If it were to preach, it would lose it. If you were to tell the reader: “This is how you should see the world, this is what’s right, and this is what’s wrong”, then you become authoritarian.And then, actually, literature loses this power that it has to continue with the reader. I don’t think the book is finished when the writer writes it: it continues to write itself in its reception, in the way people discuss it, in the way its themes feed into societal and cultural debates more broadly.When Free came out, people kept sending me this photo of [Turkish president] Erdoğan with the book during a summit to discuss the Armenia-Azerbaijan peace treaty. It’s kind of unpleasant at one level, because you see this book, and you know how you wrote it, and you know what you wanted to write, and it was all about freedom, and then suddenly you see these very authoritarian characters with it. In every society some politicians appropriate art of all kinds but my inclination is to just say: “Yeah, but that’s also part of the book’s story.”It’s a place of ambiguity, and I also have an ambiguous attitude to it; I don’t like the fact that I’m the writer who writes about Albania, or about communism, or what it’s like to live in totalitarianism and then in capitalism. What makes it special for me, and I’m sure this is the same for you, is that it’s a small place from which you can really reconstruct the world. Albania is a country that was under the Ottoman empire, but my home city, Durrës, was a Roman city. It has one of the largest amphitheatres in the Balkans. It was before that a Hellenic city. After that, it was a centre for Byzantium. It was occupied by Venice. So in this 100 sq metres in the centre of the city, you have millennia of European history.I always laugh when I hear discussions about joining the EU, because I think, when have we not been touched by the EU? When were we ever left alone by Europe?ESIt’s a heavy experience to be a Turkish novelist, and for a female novelist, I think it’s a bit heavier, because you need to deal with additional layers of misogyny and patriarchy. I don’t want to paint a completely bleak picture, but I also want to be truthful: you are slapped on one cheek, and there’s always that hurt, but simultaneously kissed on the other cheek, because readers read. Stories do matter, particularly in countries where democracy is diminishing: if a country is going backwards, ironically literature and the arts become all the more important. So there’s this very divided existence.LYI don’t know if it’s a depressing sign of the times that we have all these really interesting debates in the world of culture, which are not really reflected in anything going on in political world, where it’s actually, if anything, the opposite, where you have simplicity and reduction and exclusion. How is it possible that we’re not yet managing to find a way of bridging the two?ESI cannot ever forget the fact that I’m an immigrant in the UK. But equally, I’m someone who genuinely believes in multiple belongings. So of course, being Turkish is a big part of my work and who I am, but Britain also gave me so much. The English language gave me so much, and I’ve been writing in this language for more than 20 years now. How can I deny that it gave me a sense of home? But I would like to think of myself as a citizen of humanity, as a citizen of the world, which is something that has been belittled so much in this time of populist demagoguery. We’ve been told that if you’re a citizen of the world, you’re a citizen of nowhere, and that’s something that I want to challenge. I think that is wrong. We are living in a very complex era. We have massive global challenges ahead of us, and everything from the climate crisis to the possibility of another pandemic to deepening and widening inequalities, shows how deeply interconnected we are.Interview by Alex Clark.Indignity: A Life reimagined by Lea Ypi is published by Allen Lane on 4thSeptember.

There were even rumours of aresident cat.“I’ve always loved this old building with all its levels,” said Philipp Wittwer, a 34-year-old engineer out with friends. “It’s like a haunted house – there are so many rooms I’ve never seen, even after coming for years.”But in late December the bash will be over. And for several other clubs making up the city’s unique nightlife, the writing is on the wall.Many cities including London, Paris and New York have experienced a rash of late-night venue closures, creating depressing“night-time deserts”where there once was a vibrant scene.View image in fullscreenBerghain is probably the most famous club in Berlin.Photograph: Dpa Picture Alliance/AlamyBut for a European capital that like no other built its reputation on fun and decadence, the pain is especially palpable in Berlin. Before the pandemic, the industrycontributed, directly and indirectly, about €1.5bn (£1.3bn) to the chronically cash-strapped economyeach year.According to the left-leaning daily Tageszeitung,Clubsterben(the death of clubs) will fuel “the march of commercialisation” in Berlin. It said: “When they only open for snot-nosed brats, solvent tourists or company events, you’ll hardly be able to speak of ‘Berlin club culture’.”Nightlife veterans at Renate also saw the ground shifting beneath their feet.Berliner Rouven Kelling, 30, said: “If the alternative places all die out then all you’ll have are the mainstream clubs where you hear the same music everywhere and only drink Aperol Spritzes. Then we’ll get the kind of tourists we don’t want – it’ll be all Instagram models and TikTok people.”As low-tempo techno with French pop samples drifted from the speakers, Rodrigo Lobos, 29, a warehouse manager from Sweden, said the “chill atmosphere” had lured him and his girlfriend, Emily Solis, 25, into Renate.“In Stockholm the clubs close at 3am but here you can go non-stop,” he said, sipping a beer he said would cost him twice as much back home.View image in fullscreenPeople walk past a mural reading ‘Clubs instead of climate crisis’ on a wall next to the About Blank club in Ostkreuz, Berlin.Photograph: Odd Andersen/AFP/Getty ImagesSolis, a receptionist, said she’d see little point in making the trip if Berlin’s fabled clubs vanished: “I’m here for the party.”The reasons for Renate’s looming demise are multifaceted.The owner of the site, a major local property developer, reportedly wants to build on the site of Renate’s cherished garden.Unlike Berghain, the techno temple and hedonist attraction that helped put the city on the global party map in the 2000s, Renate does not own its own premises and its lease will run out at the end of the year. The club did not respond to requests for comment.Popular spots Mensch Meier and Re:mise both closed in 2023, while institutions such as About Blank, Club Ost, OXI, VOID and Else have all appeared on the endangered list due in part to theplanned expansion of an autobahn.Laura Gülcker, 34, a product developer, said she came from a rural western German town once a year for clubbing.She said that compared with “more corporate” discos with bottle service in cities like Düsseldorf, Berlin had spots that were “really relaxed, diverse – beautiful”. Gülcker likened Renate’s garden to an “enchanted forest” with its mature trees and rickety gazebos festooned with antique chandeliers.Her friend Verena Tekaat, a 31-year-old working in the textile industry, said for two women heading into the night together, it was a big plus that Berlin’s nightclubs were not marooned in remote districts.View image in fullscreenRenate is a ramshackle garden leading to a maze-like block of derelict flats playing EDM, house and techno.Photograph: Timothy Shoot/AlamyEmiko Gejic, spokesperson for the Clubcommission Berlin, representing the sector’s interests, said rising rents, soaring energy costs and the pressures of gentrification on the once-cheap and abundant real estate market have put the pinch on the nightclub scene, which traces itsfreewheeling origins to the Weimar republica century ago.Germany’s “oldest and biggest” gay disco, SchwuZ, this monthdeclared itself bankrupt after nearly half a century in business, falling victim to inflation, management troubles and the existence of dating apps, among other factors.Gejic said noise complaints had also driven many popular spots out of the city centre, as has the financial squeeze on people of peak clubbing age due to surging rents.Thedrop in alcohol consumption among younger peoplehas also sapped clubs of crucial income, leading many to hike prices at the door. Party nights now routinely cost €20 and upwards.View image in fullscreenWatergate closed down after 22 years.Photograph: travelstock44/AlamyLow-cost airlines once delivered party people from acrossEuropeto Berlin for a weekend bacchanalia, with many visitors forgoing a hotel in favour of a two-night dance marathon before collapsing into sleep on the return flight.However, high taxes and airport fees at the little-loved new international hub BER havepushed budget carriers out of Berlin.Today, a common fixture of the local party scene is a cluster of revellers gathered on benches outside a Späti (late-night convenience shop) with canned drinks and a playlist blasting from a mobile phone.Gejic insisted all was not lost, noting the pioneer spirit that gave rise to clubs in abandoned industrial spaces after the Berlin Wall fell could be found in “young, community-based collectives”organising parties in unexpected places around town.“I’m rather hopeful when I look at the scene creating new formats, getting involved, showing great solidarity and being politically active,” she said. “That’s the scene that I think will also break new ground in future.”Explore more on these topicsGermanyClubbingEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now, at the age of 92, one of the last of the great, glamorous movie stars of Hollywood’s golden era is back in the spotlight. She is being honoured with a lifetime achievement award at theVenice film festival, where a documentary about her life and career, Kim Novak’s Vertigo, is premiering.For Novak, it is a tribute not just to her acting but to her lifelong refusal to be controlled and manipulated by Hollywood, or anyone else.“It’s incredible to feel appreciated and to receive this gift before the end of my life,” she says in her unmistakable husky voice when we meet on Zoom. “I think I’m being honoured as much for being authentic as for my acting. It has sort of come full circle.”View image in fullscreenThe actor James Stewart flanked by two Kim Novaks, in her roles as Madeleine and Judy in the 1958 film Vertigo.Photograph: Collection Christophel/AlamyNovak’s haunting performance in Vertigo – as both Madeleine, an enigmatic society wife, and Judy, the ordinary shopgirl hired to impersonate her – is at the heart of what makes the film thegreatest of all time. The fragile presence she brought to the parts was only possible because the story felt personal.“I identified so much with Judy and Madeleine because they were both being told to change who they really were,” she recalls. “They had to become something that didn’t represent them.”The actor’s devotion to preserving her identity can be traced back to her shy, introspective childhood and her early years in Hollywood.View image in fullscreenNovak in the Alfred Hitchcock film, considered one of the greatest of all time.Photograph: Album/AlamyBorn Marilyn Novak in Chicago to a railway dispatcher and a factory worker (both Czech immigrants), she grew up in a rough neighbourhood where she endured bullying for being different. She found refuge in art, studying at the Chicago Art Institute and supporting herself with modelling jobs. It was during a trip to Los Angeles that she was spotted by Columbia Pictures, who signed her in 1954.That’s when the transformation began. Harry Cohn, who infamously ruled the film production company with an iron fist, demanded that she change her name because there could be only one Marilyn in Hollywood, and “nobody’s gonna go see a girl with a Polack name” (she won a battle to keep her surname). He also shamed her into losing weight and had her teeth capped and her hair bleached.“They hired you because they thought you have something special, and then the first thing they’d do is try to give you a new face,” Novak recalls. “They’d want the mouth of Joan Crawford, the hair of Jean Harlow. So by the time you left the makeup chair, it wasn’t even you any more. I needed to fight to keep my own sense of who I was.”Novak is lively and energetic, with a remarkable memory and a ready sense of humour. It’s easy to understand why audiences were quickly mesmerised by her. Her breakthrough came with Picnic in 1955, which won her a Golden Globe, and she followed that with acclaimed roles opposite Frank Sinatra in The Man with the Golden Arm and Pal Joey – on which she performedMy Funny Valentine.View image in fullscreenThe glamorous Hollywood star is joined by Frank Sinatra at the premiere of The Desperate Hours in 1955.Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty ImagesWhenVertigocame along in 1958, Novak was 25 and at the height of her fame. On set, she found a rare creative freedom. “The thing I absolutely adored about Hitchcock was he allowed you to become the character in the way you saw fit. More insecure directors want to think for you, act for you, and therefore you have nothing to offer.”It also helped that her co-star, James Stewart, matched her emotional vulnerability, in an era when showy, theatrical performances were common. “Working with Jimmy was the greatest thing that could have happened to me. He was a reactor, not an actor, just like me. We bounced off each other.”By contrast, she found other actors difficult. Kirk Douglas, for example, was “constantly using moves and looks … he’d say: ‘I’ll show you the rhythm of the scene.’ It threw me. It was unnatural,” she recalls.View image in fullscreenKim Novak enjoyed the creative freedom she was given on the set of Alfred Hitchcock’s Vertigo.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyNovak’s struggle to maintain her sense of self extended into her personal life, too. With Sinatra, work blurred into a romance that was heavily covered in the gossip pages. As was her clandestine love affair with Sammy Davis Jr, which ended after Cohn threatened Davis with mob violence, insisting it would be “bad for business” if Novak were involved with a Black man. Nearly 70 years later, a new film, Scandalous!, directed by Colman Domingo, will dramatise that relationship, with Sydney Sweeney playing Novak.Novak does take issue with the title. “I don’t think the relationship was scandalous,” she says. “He’s somebody I really cared about. We had so much in common, including that need to be accepted for who we are and what we do, rather than how we look. But I’m concerned they’re going to make it all sexual reasons.”Despite Cohn’s coerciveness, or because of it, Novak feels the Columbia boss played a crucial role in Hollywood dynamism at the time. After his death in 1958, she began receiving substandard scripts, which she describes as “painful and humiliating”.She made a few more quality films, including Bell Book and Candle, and Strangers When We Meet, but by the mid-1960s she had grown weary of the industry’s relentless pressures. “I feared becoming ‘Kim Novak’. Every time I played a role, I took on part of it. I was beginning to lose myself and what I stood for.”View image in fullscreenNovak starring as Madge Owens in Picnic, the 1955 film directed by Joshua Logan.Photograph: Silver Screen Collection/Getty ImagesWhen her home in Big Sur was ravaged by fire and later destroyed in a mudslide, she took it as a sign that it was time to step away entirely. She relocated to Oregon, where she met and married Robert Malloy, an equine veterinarian, in 1976. “He was very authentic,” she says. “My mother said: ‘You should marry this man, he could ground you.’ And that was true.”Away from the glare of cameras and gossip, Novak also finally returned to her first love: painting. It became a lifeline during bouts of depression (Novak was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in the early 2000s) and after the death of Malloy in 2020.View image in fullscreenThe actor attends an LA event with her husband, Robert Malloy, in 1976.Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images“Art is the thing that saved me, I paint at least eight hours a day,” she says. “I miss Robert a lot. But living alone is satisfying for me. I learned from my mom that I had to be the captain of my own ship.”She has also found solace in her animals. “They could tell me more about me than I could. Like my goat: if I would dare wear a scent, he’d take his horns out and want to bite me, because he felt that it wasn’t me.”She has largely stayed out of the public eye, except for a rare appearance at the Oscars in 2014 when she presented two awards. But the experience was a painful reminder of why she had left Hollywood. For the event, Novak had fat injections in her cheeks, and the online reaction to her appearance was swift and cruel. Donald Trump joined the onslaught, tweeting that Novak should sue her cosmetic surgeon. (Coincidentally, the US president recently hailed Sweeney after it emerged she was a registered Republican).Novak was devastated by the criticism, but instead of shrinking shespoke openly about bullying and mental health. How does she feel about all of that now?“I’ve always had a strong feeling against bullies,” she says. “How I feel about the president has got nothing to do with what he said about me at the Academy Awards. I didn’t like what he said, and that’s when I spoke up about bullies. But since then he has become way more than just a bully. While I tolerated what he said and didn’t speak back to him on that, I will not tolerate what he’s telling me and everyone else to do.”View image in fullscreenThe acting legend in Venice, where a documentary about her life will premiere.Photograph: Daniele Venturelli/WireImage“Dictatorships are taking over the world, including in the US,” she adds. “Too many people are not standing up for their rights and for what matters in life, like truth and honour and decency. For our democracy and freedoms.“I cannot tell you how strongly I feel about this. People are afraid to speak out, and I understand. But we’ve got to stand together and make ourselves heard.”Jay Kelly review – even a George Clooney sizzle reel can’t save this dire Noah Baumbach effortRead moreThat instinct that drives Novak to speak out now was present in the ways she challenged the system at the height of her career – including creating her own production company and going on strike over a salary that was lower than that of her male co-stars. Announcing her award, the Venice film festival director Alberto Barbera called her “a rebel at the heart of Hollywood”.Does she believe progress has been made for women in the industry today? “We make progress, but unfortunately then we always go back,” she says. “It inevitably always goes back to sex appeal. It still matters too much how we look. Social media and AI are able to show all kinds of stuff that isn’t real. They’re today’s bad directors, trying to remake women.”View image in fullscreenThe actor with Hitchcock, with whom she enjoyed working for the creative freedom he allowed the performers.Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty ImagesIn Alexandre O Philippe’s new documentary, Novak revisits the shadows of her past. If her life has been one long journey of self-discovery, I wonder if it’s safe to say she has finally found herself. “Yes,” she says firmly. “I’m proud that I held on to what’s important. Of course there are many things I wish I had done differently, but they’re little things God and everyone else can forgive me for.”And how would she like to be remembered? She pauses. “I would like them to think that I was true to myself. That I kept my standards high and lived by them.”Explore more on these topicsVenice film festivalVertigoAlfred HitchcockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But even after their arrest, there was something about her 15 months at the house that she could never tell anyone – until nowSimon HattenstoneSat 30 Aug 2025 02.00 EDTShareKathleen Richards knows how lucky she is to be alive. In 1979, she woke up in bed to find the serial killer Fred West on top of her. It was by no means the first time West had assaulted the 17-year-old, but it was the last. This time, she managed to escape from the room she was renting at 25 Cromwell Street, perhaps Britain’s most notorious address, where Fred and Rose West raped, tortured and murdered so many girls and young women. Fred West took his own life in January 1995 while on remand, charged with 12 murders. Rose West was convicted of 10 murders later that year and is serving awhole-life sentence.In her own way, Richards has also been serving a life sentence. Today, she is a youthful, likable and traumatised 65-year-old. How could she not be damaged by all she experienced? Although she gave vital evidence at Rose West’s trial that helped get her convicted, she never told the police what Fred had subjected her to. Nor did she tell her nearest and dearest. She couldn’t. She didn’t know how to. Now, almost half a century later, she has written a memoir, Under Their Roof, that does so much more than chronicle her time living with the Wests. It’s a desperately sad insight into what makes someone vulnerable to abusers, and why victims are often abused multiple times by different people. But ultimately, this is a book about the triumph – however painful and even fluky – of good over evil.We meet at the London office of her publisher. She is with her daughter Hannah, here for support. Richards speaks with a broad Irish accent despite having spent most of her life in England. She is immaculate in an understated way – smart long shaggy bob, pristine white shirt. Not surprisingly, she is nervous.Richards’ story starts in 1960, when she was born in Dublin to poor, uneducated, ferociously strict parents. Her father, who sold scrap and firewood from a horse and cart, spent what little money he had on himself, while his children were underfed, underloved and regularly beaten. She was the fourth of 10 and grew up sharing a bed with her siblings. At school her nickname was Smelly because of the urine-soaked clothes she wore. She kept the family home meticulously clean, but was never thanked for it. The only present she received from her parents was a naked, one-legged dolly her father had picked up at the dump that she called Polly and adored.One day in the summer holidays, hungrier than ever without the daily currant bun and glass of milk they got at school, she and her older sister Deirdre nicked some apples and ran for it. They found themselves in the grounds of a local factory, whose middle-aged caretaker told her he had a bag of sweets and would like to give her one. He took her into the hut and said she just had to do one little thing before getting the sweet. He put her hand in his trousers and made her masturbate him, and said next time he would give her a penny. After that, she returned time and again for her penny.People said he’s a friendly, funny, nice guy. He’d help anybody. That’s what he was known forA year later, her maternal grandfather, who lived by himself after her grandmother’s death, took Richards’ hand and asked her to do the same thing for him. He also paid her a penny. With it she bought the sweets her parents denied her – Black Jacks, Fruit Salads, Catherine Wheels, Refreshers. But she hated what she was doing, and began to hate herself. “I told myself I was worth a penny. That’s all. A penny. Or a potato.” On one occasion, her grandfather didn’t have a penny so he paid her with a boiled potato. What made it worse, she says, is that neither man was overtly intimidating. “If they had shouted or threatened me not to tell anybody, I would have felt better about it; that I had no choice. But I did have a choice, didn’t I? I went round there.”One day, she told her mother what her grandfather had been doing. “I said, ‘Mammy, Grandda’s doing things to me. And I don’t like it, Ma.’ I didn’t know how to say it, I didn’t have the words. She just turned around, so angry with me, and said, ‘Get out, you!’ I just ran out of that flat.” She never mentioned it to her mother again.The family moved from Dublin to a council house in Derby, then Gloucester. Even though they had far more room than before, Richards’ mother told her when she was 17 that there was no space for her or 18-year-old Deirdre, who had just had a baby. That’s when they moved into the home of Fred and Rose West, who were known for renting out cheap rooms. “People said he’s a friendly, funny, nice guy. He’d help anybody. That’s what he was known for. He’d give you a lift everywhere.” The Wests picked up a number of their victims in the car when they were hitching.View image in fullscreenRose and Fred West.Photograph: South West News Service/ShutterstockRichards will never forget the first time she met the family. “We thought we’d be safe because there were loads of kids. He brought us in and he stood there and said, ‘This is my wife, Rose, this is my lover, Shirley, and these are all the kids.’ And my first thought was, yeah right, you wish she was your lover, because she was a young girl, really nice looking. She was 17, the same age as me.” Shirley Robinson later confirmed to Richards she was Fred’s lover and that she was carrying his baby, but still she didn’t believe her. How could a girl her own age be with somebody Richards regarded as an old man, and how could his wife have accepted it? The more she discovered about Rose West, the less she believed it possible. Richards says Rose was usually screaming at her husband or children. She found her terrifying.Richards soon learned there were multiple versions of Rose. One was simpering and prissy. When Richards’ mother visited, Rose would address her in a sugary voice verging on the infantile. Another was boisterous, over-friendly and inebriated. Then there was the Rose that most horrified Richards. One night, Shirley led Richards into the living room and Rose was lying on a sofa in a see-through nightie and garish makeup, watching hardcore pornography and smiling silently at her.Richards and Shirley became friends. She says Shirley seemed sad and confused. She didn’t appear to have a bedroom and would hang about on the landing. Late one night, she saw her going into the Wests’ bedroom. This was her routine; she shared their bed.On their first day at Cromwell Street, Richards, Deirdre and her baby were taken by Fred to their shared room. There were large holes in the wall. They stuffed them with paper, but when they woke up, the paper had been pushed through the holes and was scattered on the floor. This happened every night. They wondered whether Fred was a dirty old man, but preferred to tell themselves it was a game the children played. He appeared inoffensive, comic almost. He walked with a fake limp and constantly forgot which leg he was limping on. He made daft jokes, and worked on his own in the cellar or outside, digging up the patio. Most of the day and night he appeared to be hammering and drilling. “There was definitely something a little odd about Fred, but he seemed harmless enough, like a real-life clown,” Richards writes in Under Their Roof.She soon discovered a darker side. In the corridor, Fred would stand in her way, tell her there was no room to pass, press himself against her and pinch her bottom. “Lovely arse, girlie,” he would say. The pinches became more violent and left her badly bruised. He would wait for Richards, lunge at her and demand kisses. She says he smelled of “dead animals” and it made her nauseous.On one occasion, Fred attacked her when she walked through the front door, shoving her into the wall and banging her head against it. His elbow was pressed into her throat, choking her. When she managed to scream, Shirley emerged from the living room and told him to leave her alone. Richards told Deirdre she was terrified of Fred. He never assaulted Deirdre, Richards believes, because her sister was a stronger character. They thought about leaving Cromwell Street but had nowhere to go.Richards decided to tell the police, but when she got to the station she couldn’t bring herself to go in. She sat outside crying, asking herself what she could accuse him of, telling herself she wouldn’t be believed and she deserved it anyway because she had allowed herself to be abused all those years ago. Fred was a married man with children, he was popular, he probably had friends in the police. “I wanted to say he’s doing things to me, grabbing me, and I thought they’d just say, ‘Is he? OK.’” Instead of going in, she returned to Cromwell Street.View image in fullscreenShirley Robinson, who disappeared from the house a few months after Kathleen Richards moved in.Photograph: PA NewsShe and Shirley bonded over ice lollies. Richards was working at Wall’s and Shirley loved red ice lollies. On Fridays, she would bring a little box home and they would hang out together eating them. Richards didn’t understand Shirley, but she liked her. “Lovely, she was. Real gentle. She must have had some kind of life before she went there, God help her. See, there’s always someone worse off than yourself, that’s what I say. No matter what I went through, there’s people worse.”Does she still think about Shirley? Richards swallows and struggles for words. “Yeah.” She starts to cry. “Yeah.”Her daughter asks if she wants to stop, and passes her a tissue. “D’you want to go outside or are you OK?”Richards blinks away her tears. “No, I’m OK.”After Richards had been with the Wests for a few months, Shirley disappeared. When she asked Fred where she was, he told her she had gone back to family in Germany. Richards and Deirdre thought it was strange. She was just about to have his baby, why would she leave then? Why wouldn’t she have said goodbye? How could she have afforded the flight?The assaults on Richards grew more regular and brutal after Shirley left. When Deirdre went to visit friends overnight, she dragged the chest of drawers against her door as protection. But it didn’t deter Fred. Another day, when Deirdre and the baby were away, she unlocked her bedroom door to find him lying in wait for her on the bed (he had a spare key). This time, she was saved by one of his friends calling. “Fred West had pushed me on the bed. His hand was over my mouth.” She refers to him as Fred West rather than Fred. She says it creates more distance between her and him.Once when she tried to escape, Fred and Rose grabbed a hand each and bundled her back inside. A neighbour saw it but did nothing. Another time, when Fred was attacking Richards, her mother dropped by just in time.All this culminated in the most shocking assault, again when Deirdre and the baby were away. In February 1979, Richards woke up to find Fred in bed with her, his hands all over her. She begged him to let her go. He told her he would so long as she agreed to watch a “special video” with him and Rose, and then he said, “We will have some fun. You get my meaning?” She promised she would, and told him she needed five minutes to clean herself up. After he left her room, she crept to the front door, barefoot and in her pyjamas, nudged it open and bolted to the bus station to wait for Deirdre and the baby to return. When her sister’s bus finally got in, she told her what had happened and said she could never return to Cromwell Street. Deirdre told her they would go back to collect their things and leave first thing in the morning. Richards stood guard all night. The next day, Deirdre moved to Derby to stay with her boyfriend and Richards moved in with her brother Danny.I thought about Shirley a hell of a lot after they found her. I’d dream of her knocking on my door with a baby in her armsAfter she left Cromwell Street, she met a man she liked. He became her first boyfriend and she got pregnant. Richards thought she was too young and messed up to have the baby, so she had an abortion, which led to the end of what had been a happy relationship. Soon after, at 19, she took an overdose. “It was still all in my head. I felt dirty. Ashamed. Worthless.” She thought of all the abuse: the caretaker, her grandfather, West. “I felt as low as anybody could feel. I felt the walls were closing in. What have I got to live for? It was just horrible. All I could see was Fred West’s face. I was hallucinating and his face was there in my face staring, saying,‘Come on, come on, come on!’” Her brother discovered Richards after she overdosed, and she was taken to hospital.Richards recovered and moved back to Dublin. She went on to marry and have two children, John and Jess, with her first husband, Callum. When Jess was three, Richards and Callum separated. She says a contributory factor was her problems with intimacy – in bed, she was haunted by images of her abusers. She associated sex with control, pain and shame.Now a single mother, she moved back to Gloucester; despite the memories of Cromwell Street, most of her family and friends still lived in the city. She and the children quickly settled down. John was at school, Jess was in nursery, and she was peeling onions for a chicken curry when the news bulletin came on the radio. It was early February 1994. The lead story was about a search for human remains in a house in Gloucester. The newsreader said, “Frederick West, aged 52, and his 40-year-old wife, Rosemary, of 25 Cromwell Street, have been arrested on suspicion of multiple murders.”How did she feel when she heard that? “Absolutely horrific. Complete shock.” She’s welling up. “There weren’t any words. I rang Deirdre, said hello and she said, ‘I know.’ We didn’t speak, just held the phone. I could hear her breathing. She could hear me. I was ill for a long time after that. Stomachaches, headaches. The shock affected my whole body.” She and Deirdre, who died last year, never spoke about West again.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

How come I didn’t see that, why did I not know? A million questions.” She pauses. “I might have had that survivor’s guilt,” she says with typical understatement.Had she thought of Shirley in the intervening years? “Yes, I used to dream of her. She’d be knocking on my door with a baby in her arms.” She sniffs back her tears.After the discovery of the remains, she saw her past life through a different lens. It became apparent that the Wests had been grooming her as Shirley’s successor. “That’s the scary bit,” Richards says. “I know that now, but obviously then I didn’t.”She thought about the endless drilling and digging. “We thought he was building a swimming pool. We really did. I remember looking out of the window thinking, it’s not going to be very big. To think what was actually happening, and we were laughing. It’s sick.” She remembered how he had smelt of dead animals, and realised it was probably the stench of his victims.View image in fullscreen25 Cromwell Street, where Kathleen Richards lived for 15 months and where the bodies of nine of the Wests’ victims were found.Photograph: Avalon/Getty ImagesDid she have nightmares? “I didn’t have dreams. I didn’t sleep much when it all came out.” For how long? “A long, long time.” She thought about it constantly when she was awake. When friends who knew she had lived there asked about it, she’d tell them she’d only been there a few days and seen nothing. But she had lived there about 15 months and seen too much.The police asked for a witness statement. Richards didn’t say she had been abused, but she told them all she knew about Shirley. Her son overheard some of the conversation and she had to admit to him she had lived in the house. “He ran in saying, ‘So you were living there?’ I hadn’t wanted the children to know.”It’s amazing to have gone through all that and not burdened your family with it, I say. “That’s the last thing you want to do, isn’t it?” Well, plenty of people would, and it’s incredible you didn’t. Richards smiles. “Is that a compliment?” she asks. “Thank you.” What impact has experiencing such horror had on her life? Again she smiles. “I’m a very busy person. The house is sparkling.”Richards went into the caring professions, working with elderly people in a home and fostering children. She says fostering in particular has been shaped by her life experience. “I thought I could help these children because I’ve been abused, I’ve been through a lot, maybe I can understand them. And I think I did. At Christmas, one of the social workers came round and saw the tree with all the presents and said, ‘I’m moving in here!’”“She downplays herself all the time,” Hannah says. “I’ve just never wanted for anything, and nor did the foster children. I was given a perfect childhood.”Richards looks at her tenderly. “D’you feel loved?”“Every day!” Hannah says. “Everyday! Of course I do.”‘These murders still live with me’: the show that goes inside Fred and Rose West’s ‘house of horrors’Read moreRichards says she never felt loved as a child. The opposite. Her mother died a couple of years ago. Did she soften towards the end? “No. And my dad was worse.”Yet she believes her mother probably saved her life. The Wests picked the most vulnerable people to be their victims – young women who weren’t in touch with their families or were remote from them (as well as their own 16-year-old daughter Heather, Fred’s first wife Catherine Costello and her eight-year-old daughter Charmaine). Only six of the 12 known murder victims had been reported missing. But the Wests knew Richards’ mother was likely to ask questions. “I think if it wasn’t for her coming every now and again, I would have been gone.”On 1 January 1995, after 11 months in custody awaiting trial, Fred West took his own life. How did Richards feel about that? “At first I was delighted. I thought: great, he’s gone off the planet, he can’t hurt anyone else. Horrible, evil man, you don’t deserve to breathe the same air as us. Then a bit later it was, like, what about all those families? They’re not going to get any justice now.”In November 1995, Rose West was convicted of 10 murders. She had claimed never to have met some of the victims buried at 25 Cromwell Street, including Shirley Robinson. Richards gave evidence for the prosecution contradicting that. “She sat there saying she didn’t know Shirley, but she did. I knew that. So that helped convict her. When I was in the court, I kept looking over and thinking, I wonder if she remembers me. Then I was terrified in case she did remember and she’d go, ‘Yes, and this happened and this happened.’” Richards was so scared because she still hadn’t told the police she had been abused by Fred.Helping to secure Rose West’s conviction gave Richards some comfort. But she continued to torment herself about the day she had not been brave enough to report Fred to the police. Even today she still seems to be doing so. “Someone might have listened to me in that police station. Someone might have checked it.”After the trial, Richards continued with life as before – a great mum, always on the go, a much-loved carer and foster parent. She buried her memories as best she could. But abusers were still not done with her. By 2013, she and her second husband, Mike (Hannah’s father), had grown apart, and they divorced. A few months later, friends encouraged her to go on dating websites. After two dates with one man, he started stalking her. This time, she did report it to the police. Two officers came to take a statement. The male officer, PC Darren Heath, returned to her house by himself the next morning. She thought he must have information, but he didn’t. He started to turn up every day, making inappropriate sexual suggestions. Richards was now in her 50s and yet another man seemed bent on ruining her life. She hid when she saw him outside, and put her house up for sale. When he saw the sign, he uprooted it.View image in fullscreen‘I was able to say something I’ve never been able to say, today.’Photograph: Lydia Goldblatt/The GuardianSix weeks after she reported the stalker, three officers turned up at her home. By now, she had lost all trust in the police. But this time it was different. They asked if she’d had any bad experiences with Heath, and told her he’d been reported for harassing vulnerable women who had sought police protection. This time she told them the whole story. In 2015, he pleaded guilty to misconduct in public office by engaging in sexual relationships with three women he had met while on duty; he was sentenced to 45 months in prison. Another narrow escape.Thankfully, there is a happy ending to Richards’ story. After Heath’s conviction, she was offered therapy by the police, and for the first time she spoke about the guilt she felt that she was still alive and Shirley wasn’t. She still didn’t dare broach the subject of the abuse she had suffered. Meanwhile, she and Mike were becoming closer again. She told him she’d never stopped loving him and he reciprocated. In 2022, they remarried.She confided to Mike what had really happened to her at 25 Cromwell Street. Richards was still blaming herself. “When I told Mike the first time, I was in a bad way. I said, ‘If I’d only gone into the police station that day … ’ and Mike was, like, ‘Well they wouldn’t have listened to you. Another girl had gone to the police, and they didn’t listen to her.’” This is true:Caroline Owens, one of the Wests’ nannies, was abducted, raped and abused by the pair in 1973. She reported the crimes to the police, but the Wests inexplicably got off with a £50 fine. “It was only when he told me that that I thought, OK, maybe they wouldn’t have listened to me.”She told friends about what she had suffered at the hands of Fred and Rose West. All were supportive. They told Richards her story could help others who have been abused. She began to understand why she’d been unable to talk about it. On the one hand, she was ashamed of what she had been through; on the other, she felt she hadn’t suffered enough to consider herself a victim.But writing the book has been cathartic. “I was able to say something I’ve never been able to say today.” She looks so proud, but at the same time so diffident. What was it, I ask? “I was able to say I was sexually assaulted by him. I just said it out loud.” She comes to a stop. “I haven’t healed yet, have I?” she asks quietly.Under Their Roof by Kathleen Richards with Ann Cusack is published by Sphere, an imprint of Little, Brown, at £22.

Nor was the choreographed nature of the engagement shoot.The series of five photographs, posted on Instagram and now liked 35m times, feature the couple in various acts of staged proposal within a landscaped garden festooned with roses and urns.The happy couple – or as they refer to themselves in the post, “your English teacher and your gym teacher” – both wore Ralph Lauren. Kelce, a navy cable-knit polo shirt and tailored shorts, and Swift a smocked white sundress which sold out moments after the post appeared. The images appear to be a peek into a private moment, yet every bloom, Cartier bracelet and rock had been stage-managed. Swift may be the world’s biggest pop star, but she’s even better at art-directing her own fairytale.Staged engagement photos have become one of the wedding industry’s freshest traditions, a way for couples to mark the moment – or at least a curated version of it.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Taylor Swift/Instagram/ReutersIn the past few years,Alline Beatricihas been photographing proposals and engagements alongside weddings. “This is very much a proposal shoot rather than an engagement shoot,” says Beatrici, who prefers a more naturalistic pose-free style. “Sometimes I’ll be hiding in a bush waiting for the proposal,” she says, “after which I’ll let things settle for half an hour, then go back for the engagement photos.”“It’s not out of the question that the [Swift/Kelce] proposal was a surprise, but these are celebrities so I suspect not. It’s a [giveaway] when people have their nails done.”Capturing these milestones, or moments of “micro-commitment”, began as an add-on for wedding photographers and a way of practising being in front of the camera before the big day. “I usually photograph them a few months after the engagement, but 80% of them won’t have a wedding date,” Beatrici says. The growth of the phenomenon in recent years is largely down to Instagram and TikTok, a symptom of how much social media feeds into marriage tradition. Beatrici encourages her couples to pick a meaningful venue rather than a photogenic one, but admits that the demands of social media tend to influence.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Taylor Swift/Instagram/ReutersSwift’s ability to emit sincerity, however orchestrated the situation, has been a crucial exercise in her image-building as a pop star, especially online. “It’s an easy way to communicate with a fanbase by showing an intimate glimpse into their life,” says Kadian Pow, a lecturer in sociology at Birmingham City University.“NothingTaylor Swiftdoes is just a simple celebration,” says Pow. “Last week she was on a podcast about her new album, now she’s announcing her engagement? It’s a nicely done tie-in … a way to have the fans and the media preoccupied with her narrative,” she says. It’s also a way to control that narrative, while galvanising the all-important parasocial relationships with fans. “There is an idea firmly entrenched that she was the nerdy girl lusting after a football player. In some ways it sends the message that she was able to manifest this. It’s part of her crafting of a persona.”‘I’m the one to beat’: is Taylor Swift’s Showgirl era set to take her to even greater heights?Read moreFor celebrities, engagement shoots now rival the pregnancy shoot, a well-worn trope in the fame-fashion alliance ever since Demi Moore appeared on the cover of Vanity Fair in 1991. Flowers tend to feature, as seen in Beyoncé’s Botticelli-esque pregnancy shoot from 2017, as does what you might call “relatable” styling, says Pow.At £230, her dress is relatively cheap for a high-end label. “You’re not supposed to look too dressed up for an engagement – lest you were expecting it – nor would they want to come across as anything other than clean and put-together,” says Avery Trufelman, of the critically acclaimed fashion podcast Articles of Interest. “The preppy look is casual, and yet has a degree of formality to it.”It helps, too, that it was on sale when the images dropped. Swift usually avoids luxury fashion in order to underscore her relatable image. But as a designer, Ralph Lauren is the sartorial embodiment of the wholesome American dream. “They, like Ralph himself, were very aware of the fairytale aspirational imagery they were making, and costumed themselves for the part,” says Trufelman. It also “aligns with the times that we’re in: the trad wife aesthetic”, adds Pow.View image in fullscreenRyan O’Neal and Ali MacGraw in Love Story.Photograph: Entertainment Pictures/AlamyThe styling is also evocative of the 1970 film Love Story, which coined the term “preppy’ while using fashion to denote class. Even Kelce’s sockless loafers are a code straight from 1980s’The Preppy Handbook, which advised “loafers worn at the country club, never with socks”.Kelce’s shorts may seem informal, but there is a grand tradition for men to hide rings inside their short pockets, which only furthers the calculated spontaneity behind the images – as if he really did just propose.Relatability has been “par for the course forever”, says Pow. It’s just the flowers that betray them, says floristJulia Campbell-Gillieswho thinks, given the season, the roses “would have been flown over from Ecuador and Colombia – I really hope they weren’t just for the photo-op”. And of course the bezel-cut Artifex diamond ring – which, according to Brides magazine, cost half a million dollars.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Taylor Swift InstagramExplore more on these topicsTaylor SwiftTravis KelcefeaturesShareReuse this content"

How to survive the school WhatsApp groupWith the new school year starting next week, parents’ WhatsApp groups are pinging back into action. Here are the rules you must follow to avoid disasterStuart HeritageSat 30 Aug 2025 07.00 EDTShareBecoming a parent can be one of the richest, most rewarding things you can ever experience. That said, it’s a qualified reward, because to be a parent is often to be forced into joining the schoolWhatsAppgroup. In theory, it’s a community of like-minded peers who understand that it takes a village to raise a child. In reality, the school WhatsApp group is a vortex of petty drama, pointless competition and outright hostility.Navigating a mess like this can often leave a parent feeling bruised and overwhelmed. It is a task that requires diplomacy, patience and – sometimes, because everyone’s human – locking your phone away in a drawer until your blood pressure recovers. With that in mind, using real-life stories collected from friends and acquaintances, here are the top 10 rules of school WhatsApp group engagement.The group is not GoogleIf there’s a gap in your understanding when it comes to the machinations of your child’s school – maybe you want to know when the next non-uniform day or bake sale is – always check your email first. Answer not there? Have a look on the school website. Once you’ve done that, then (and only then) ask the group. Because to ask the group anything is to receive an answer from everyone. Do you really want to receive 28 messages reading “Next Friday x”, and another two saying “Don’t know hun”? More importantly, do you want to be the person responsible for ensuring that everyone else in the group suddenly receives 30 unsolicited messages? No, you do not, because you are not a psychopath. The only thing worse than treating the group like Google, from my research, is passive-aggressively responding to these messages with screenshots from the school website. If you do that, I can guarantee that there’s a breakout group devoted to slagging you off. But we’ll come to that.No external ideologiesA successful group is one that remains on-message. To invite any other subject into the conversation is to plunge the whole endeavour into chaos. Proof? See the friend of mine who forwarded me several long and impassioned screenshots from a group member who was desperately trying to get everyone else to care about the local council’s plans for a roundabout. Another sent a message from a parent who kept asking everyone to sign a petition to deport migrants.My favourite story of this ilk, however, is as follows: “We have one mum lecturing us not to use sun cream on our kids because of ‘chemicals’. She says that sunburn is just the skin shedding toxins.” Yikes.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Stephen Collins/The GuardianBe the same person in the group as you are at the gatesThis is a general rule for all WhatsApp groups. However, in a school setting – where many parents don’t know each other particularly well – it seems to be exacerbated. The rule is this: if you’re nice to someone in the group and then see them in real life, also be nice. Don’t, as seems to be the case in several schools, act like everyone’s best friend online and then blank them at the gates. This is the fastest way to foster hostility. Actually, no, the second fastest.Don’t let the chat spill out into real lifeIt isn’t unheard of for conflict that started on WhatsApp to reach its conclusion at the school gates. One friend told me about a squabble that had erupted on WhatsApp, with one parent accusing another of dinging their car on the school run. “It kicked off the next morning with a full-on fight that had to be split up by one of the teachers,” she said. Another told me about a case of bullying at school that ended up with one dad offering to lay out the other child’s dad in the playground the following morning.This works both ways; sometimes a real-life dispute can leak into the chat, which only serves to amplify the drama. “One mum said in the playground that if she’d had a ginger-haired child, she would kill it,” said a friend. “Another parent heard her and reported it to the school. Now the mum who said it is kicking off on WhatsApp and calling everyone twats.”Beware the breakout groupOn paper, a breakout group seems sensible to keep the peace – if you’re feeling aggrieved, you have a place to vent in confidence to a smaller group. But in practice this never works, thanks to the overwhelming likelihood that you’ll end up accidentally sending something contentious to the main group.I was sent a screenshot of a long and admittedly quite boring message from a dad that was instantly followed by a mum describing him as a “moaning douche”. This was then followed by a panicked “Haha, sorry, I meant to send that to my mum.” Someone else mentioned an escalating passive-aggressive feud on WhatsApp that culminated in one of them accidentally posting a mocking picture of the other’s Facebook page to the main group. “It sent everyone silent,” my friend said. “Collective intake of group chat breath. She exited the group shortly afterwards.”View image in fullscreenIllustration: Stephen Collins/The GuardianBe grateful you’re not DutchThis may not be what anyone wants to hear, especially if their phone is buzzing with 30 “Happy birthday” messages directed at a six-year-old who isn’t even on WhatsApp, but we apparently have it relatively easy.A Dutch friend recently spent a few years in the UK. To my incredulity, she claims she actually enjoyed the WhatsApp experience here. “We were overjoyed at the low level of parent participation in the school system,” she told me. “In Holland, all the groups have zero hierarchy, and everyone needs to be heard and taken seriously. I participated in a group about sex education, in which our discussions had to result in educational goals that we could all agree on. The group included me, a gay father and a few very strict Muslim mothers. The only thing we could agree on was the phrase ‘homosexuality exists’.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

A handful of teachers got in touch, describing all the times group threads had made their way back to them. One told me of an incident where a mum had accused her of violating her daughter’s human rights for not letting her play in part of a classroom that hadn’t been tidied yet.Another said that when a male teacher left the school, word quickly (and falsely) spread that it was because he was a paedophile. A third said that after her pupils read a book about a child with two fathers, such a long and angry fight ensued on WhatsApp that she was forced to intervene by meeting everyone at the school gates wearing a rainbow lanyard.Be very, very, very careful with your nudesWhen I asked people for their worst school WhatsApp stories, I wasn’t expecting to receive any responses about nudity. Silly me. On the least terrifying end of the spectrum, a friend told me that: “One of the dads sent everyone a picture of what looked like a half-naked woman, but we were all too panicked and British to say anything.”More drastically, from someone else: “During Covid, a mum sent a nude picture to the entire class WhatsApp group. She was clearly having an affair. She quickly deleted it, but not before several screenshots were taken.” And from a different person: “I woke up one day to a closeup pic of a mum’s genitals. Her story was that her phone was stolen and the person sent it to the group, but I’m pretty sure her husband caught her in an affair and did it out of rage.”Don’t forget the legal repercussionsWhatsApp groups can become so toxic that schools have begun to intervene, hiring lawyers to write rules dictating parents’ conduct in the chat, and making it clear that personal and abusive comments about staff and pupils will not be tolerated.And this year the law got involved. In January, six Hertfordshire police officers were sent to arrest Maxie Allen and his partner Rosalind Levinefor messages they wrote on their school WhatsApp group. Although they weren’t charged, they were investigated for harassment and malicious communications. According to the school, the messages sent were inflammatory, defamatory and concerned their daughter’s new headteacher. So really, it’s probably just safer to stick to vagina pics.And finally: no flouncing offRegrettably, I must draw on my own experience here. Compared with many of the horror stories I received, the WhatsApp group of my children’s school was actually quite tame. There were no fistfights or anti-vax propaganda, and almost definitely no unsolicited nudes. However, it was incessant, and I am apparently too short‑tempered for that.For the few weeks that I was a member, my phone would buzz at three-second intervals day and night with people asking if anyone had seen their kid’s jumper or when PE was. And one day something snapped.I had put my phone on airplane mode while I did an important interview for work. When I switched it back on, it started madly buzzing in my hand. In less than an hour, the group had messaged each other about 70 times. So I left. This was my big mistake.Officially, only the group admins are informed when a member leaves. Unofficially, what happens next is that the admins then tell everyone else that the only dad in the group has flounced off like a diva. My point here is this: if you’re ever going to have a furious Elton John-style meltdown in front of people, it’s really important that they aren’t people who you’re going to have to see twice a day for the next seven years.Explore more on these topicsParents and parentingFamilySocial mediaSchoolsWhatsAppfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Legally, it has to contain a minimum level of sugar, so when manufacturers use fruit juice concentrate instead of sugar, they often fall below that threshold and have to call their product a fruit spread instead.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I tasted 10 jams straight from the jar, much to my teeth’s dismay, and then again spread on warm buttered baguette. Every product was delicious in its own right, but some really stood out as exceptional, with serious complexity and depth, and not overpowered by the sugar.Strawberries are amongthe most heavily sprayed cropsin the UK, according toPesticide Action Network’s “dirty dozen”, so I always look for organic strawberry products, especially in a concentrated one such as jam. Where the sugar content is notably high or low, I’ve also included the percentage of sugars. Sugar is integral to jam – it’s what preserves the fruit, after all – but in today’s health-conscious world, it’s worth knowing what you’re spreading. It’s also worth noting that there’s a trade-off for lower-sugar jams in that, once opened, they have a shorter shelf life.It’s also remarkable how many of these brands are steeped in history: Wilkin & Sons started Tiptree jam back in 1885; Hartley’s was founded in Lancashire in 1871; St Dalfour was established in rural France at the turn of the 19th century; and Bonne Maman arrived in 1971. These are more than just spreads – they’re edible heritage.The best supermarket strawberry jamBestoverall:Duchy Organic strawberry extra jam preserveView image in fullscreen£2 for 340g at Waitrose (59p/100g)★★★★★Mahogany red with deep flavour and a pleasantly sour twang, making it my favourite for both flavour and texture. Has a high sugar content of 65%, though. It contains perfect whole candied strawberries alongside others that have broken down into a jammy jelly. Really good value and organic, too!Best bargain:Morrisons the Best strawberry conserveView image in fullscreen£2.55 for 340g at Morrisons (75p/100g)★★★★☆A dark, vermilion hue with an archetypal strawberry flavour and good depth. Very sweet, with 59.3g carbohydrates per 100g, of which 57.5g are sugars. It has delicious bits and pieces of strawberries still half intact, giving a more textural finish. Overall, a great conserve for your money.And the rest …Fearne & Rosie strawberry preserveView image in fullscreen£3.20 for 310g at Tesco (£1.03/100g)£3.20 for 310g at Ocado (£1.03/100g)★★★★★The colour of stewed forced rhubarb with a lovely clean berry flavour and balanced sourness. Much less sweet than most, it has an interesting, stewed fruit-like texture. Fearne & Rosie is B Corp certified, and its strawberry preserve is manufactured in Belgium from EU produce. It has a high (70%) fruitcontentand low sugar (35%). Good quality for a natural-tasting fruit spread.St Dalfour strawberry spreadView image in fullscreen£3.25 for 284g at Sainsbury’s (£1.14/100g)£3.40 for 284g at Waitrose (£1.20/100g)★★★★☆Crimson red with a familiar, candied strawberry flavour and decent texture, featuring nice pieces of strawberry. Less sweet than some, while still retaining a traditional taste. Made in Marmande, France, it uses regional fruit and natural sweeteners such asgrape must(a waste product from the wine industry). Notably, the brand shares its sustainability efforts online. With a simple formula and slightly lower sugar content (48%) than many, this is a great buy.Clearspring organic strawberry fruit spreadView image in fullscreen£3.50 for 280g at Ocado (£1.25/100g)★★★★☆Garnet red with a delicious strawberry flavour and just a hint of apple butter. Much less sweet than most, making this a great choice for family use. Sweetened naturally with apple juice concentrate and puree, it has very low sugar (29%). Despite being the most expensive in the test group, it’s still pretty good value, especially as an organic product.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

Very sweet (59% sugar), too. A smooth, jelly-like texture dotted with seeds. That said, this has good heritage and is a fair price, too.Stute no sugar strawberry extra jamView image in fullscreen£2.65 for 430g at Sainsbury’s (62p/100g)£2.65 for 430g at Morrisons (62p/100g)★★☆☆☆Candy red, with a traditional, sweet strawberry taste that has some sourness to balance things out. This sorbitol-sweetened jam (meaning it’s suitable for people with diabetes) has a smooth, jelly texture with some lumps and seeds. Based in Bristol since 1969, the brand is actively reducing emissions and producing 18% of its own electricity. With almost no sugar content (2.4%), it’s definitely a healthier option, although some consumers may be concerned about the use of sweetener.Mackays Scottish strawberry preserveView image in fullscreen£2.30 for 340g at Ocado (68p/100g)£2.30 for 340g at Tesco (68p/100g)★★☆☆☆Ruby red with a familiar strawberry flavour that’s delicious, though not outstanding; very sweet, too, with a notably high sugar content of 66.9%. The texture is very sticky, though the inclusion of whole strawberries adds some interest. Founded in 1938, Mackays is one of the few products tested that states the fruit’s provenance, using Scottish-grown berries boiled in copper pans.Explore more on these topicsFoodThe FilterPickling, fermenting and preservingVegan food and drinkVegetarian food and drinkFruitfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Melbourne-born LondonerRose Johnstoneassembles a group of UK-based Australians to try itGet our weekend culture and lifestyle emailRose JohnstoneFri 29 Aug 2025 22.03 EDTLast modified on Sat 30 Aug 2025 02.36 EDTShare“Sorry, did you saylemingtons?Are they like, tropical fruits?”Not the response I was expecting when I excitedly told my colleagues thatM&S Food was about to launch two versions of lamingtons to the UK public. As an Australian living in London, I’m used to navigating minor cultural differences in the workplace. Case in point: Brits eat their sausage rolls cold, with no sauce. And if you ask for sauce, they’d ask: “What kind?” But to learn that they hadn’t heard oflamingtons– the treat I’d scoff at my Grandma’s house, the major player at any cake stall, the bakery stalwart, neighbour to the trusty snot block – felt downright wrong. Like I’d slipped through a wormhole into a tragic parallel universe.To fix this feeling, I bought both kinds of the British-made lamingtons and arranged a taste test with a group of fellow Australia-born immigrants.What defines a classic lamington? As the legend goes, the cake was created in Queensland in the 1890s, when Lord Lamington’s chef whipped up a batch for unexpected guests using leftover sponge cake, dipped in chocolate and rolled in coconut. The first known printed recipe for them appeared in the Queensland Country Life newspaper in December 1900.View image in fullscreenM&S lamingtons.Photograph: Tom Regester/M&S/PAThese days, they vary in complexity, but the key ingredients remain. Radio Lamington, a lamington business by UK-based Australian restaurant group Daisy Green, says: “The classic should be fluffy vanilla sponge, layered with jam and then dipped in a chocolate and coconut dusting”.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningFor me, the classic lamington is a cushiony wodge on a paper plate at your cousin’s sixth birthday party. It’s the sticky residue of chocolate on your fingers. It’s finding bits of sweet, nutty coconut on your school collar. It’s served in plastic supermarket sleeves, and crinkly bakery bags. Am I too blinded by nostalgia to accurately assess the efforts of the M&SFoodbakers? Perhaps. But I’ll give it my best shot, along with four willing taste-testers.M&S Chocolate & Coconut Lamingtons, £4 for twoM&S Food says: Cubes of buttermilk-enriched chocolate sponge coated in rich chocolate sauce, rolled in coconut flakes and topped with hand-piped buttercream and jam.Score: 6/10This lamington is a beautiful thing to behold. Sure, the artfully piped buttercream and jam on top is unconventional, but looks a treat. The familiar smell – borderline-overpowering coconut and subtler chocolate – is just right. But I was genuinely shocked when I sank my teeth into it. Instead of a light white sponge, it’s a dense chocolate cake!skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s the sticky residue of chocolate on your fingers.’Photograph: Rose JohnstoneI can’t fully convey just howwrongthis made us feel; like shucking an oyster to reveal a piece of popcorn instead of a pearl. All the taste testers agreed that this fundamental difference places it firmly into “lamington-inspired” territory, with one rightly saying: “A cubed cake does not a lamington make!”That said, all reviewers, somewhat guiltily, enjoyed the cake in the end, praising its density and balance of the rich chocolate and coconut with the jam’s tartness. Just don’t call it a lamington.M&S Caramelised Biscuit Lamingtons, £4 for twoM&S Food says: Cubes of buttermilk-enriched chocolate sponge coated in rich chocolate sauce, rolled in caramelised biscuit crumb and topped with hand-piped buttercream and salted caramel sauce.Score: 7.5/10Well, this doesn’t even look like a lamington, does it? This time, our taste testers knew to brace themselves for the secret mud cake within. A classic lamington needs to feel like a soft pillow ensconced in a semi-firm choccy blanket. But this “lamington” has strayed so far from the path of righteousness that it’s hard to tell where the cake ends and the coating begins. Personally, I feel that without the coconut, it’s just an entirely different cake, and an average one at that. But I’m alone in this opinion: the majority of taste-testers preferred this one. One reviewer said: “I wish I could call this an abomination and an insult to Australians everywhere, but this was actually really good – 100% not a lamington in any form really, but just a great little sweet treat.”I’ll leave the last word to Daisy Green, who begansending lamingtons out to first responders during lockdown in 2020and still donates to them every Friday: “It’s a nice cake, but not sure Lord Lamington would put his name to it.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian food and drinkCakeFoodAustralian lifestylefeaturesShareReuse this content"

It starts with seasoned sushi rice (which I could eat just by itself) and is topped with a variety of fun things to munch on such as salt- and lime-seasoned cabbage, edamame beans and glazed pieces of barbecued tempeh, all bound together with a gentle but perky sriracha sauce. Like many of us today, it borrows ideas from all over the world and is, I think, all the more delicious for it.Barbecue tempeh rice bowl with lime and srirachaDon’t be put off by the long-ish ingredients list: except for steaming the rice and frying the tempeh, the rest is just chopping, mixing and assembly. Sushi seasoning, or seasoned rice vinegar, is widely available in the UK, and is a vinegar that has, very helpfully, been pre-seasoned.Prep15 minCook45 minServes4350g sushi rice5 tbsp sushi seasoning250g red cabbage, finely shredded2 tbsp fresh lime juiceFine sea salt160g frozen edamame beans, defrostedBlack sesame seedsFor the sauce5 tbsp mayonnaise(75g)1½ tbsp sriracha½ tbsp tomato puree1 tbsp agave syrupFor the tempeh3 garlic cloves, peeled and finely minced½ tbsp chipotle paste3½ tbsp light soy sauce1½ tbsp tomato puree½ tbsp fresh lime juice2½ tbsp agave syrup¼ tsp saltRapeseed oil400g tempeh(I likeTiba), cut into jagged, bite-sized piecesTip the rice into a saucepan for which you have a lid, add 500ml cold water, pop on the lid and bring to a boil. Turn down the heat to a simmer, cook for 10 minutes, then take off the heat and put to one side with the lid on for another 10 minutes. Add the sushi seasoning and mix well.Put the cabbage in a bowl with a tablespoon of the lime juice and half a teaspoon of salt, then, with clean hands, scrunch it over and over until you can feel it give in your hands.Next, make the sauce by whisking the mayonnaise, sriracha, tomato puree, agave syrup and the remaining tablespoon of lime juice with an eighth of a teaspoon of salt.In a separate bowl, make the tempeh marinade. Whisk the garlic, chipotle paste, soy sauce, tomato puree, lime juice, agave syrup and a quarter-teaspoon of salt, add two tablespoons of water and mix again.Put two tablespoons of oil in a large frying pan on a medium to high heat and, when hot, add the pieces of tempeh and cook, tossing, for five to seven minutes, until they’re golden and crisp all over. Pour in the sauce, turn the heat right down and cook until the sauce reduces to a glaze that clings to the tempeh. Take off the heat.To assemble, put a quarter of the rice on one side of each of four bowls. Arrange the cabbage next to it, then the tempeh and the edamame beans. Spoon some of the sauce into the middle, sprinkle over some sesame seeds and serve.Explore more on these topicsVegetablesThe new veganFoodVegan food and drinkRiceMain courseBeans, pulses and legumesrecipesShareReuse this content"

But it could cost you more than you expect.UK “75” number plates are being rolled out from Monday and “new reg day” is traditionally a busy time for car dealers. Depending on the make and model you are buying, picking a blue paint job rather than red or a matt instead of a metallic finish could add thousands to the cost of a new vehicle.Many car manufacturers now only offer one “free” colour as standard.A Nissan Qashqai, for example, will come in red, and if you want it in silver, black, white or metallic blue, you will have£745 added to your bill.An Audi Q3 comes in white at no extra cost, but an extra £575 gets you a range of colours – from “progressive red” to “navarra blue”. White is also free for aBMWX3, but go for “dune grey” and you will have to pay £875, while “tanzanite blue” costs £1,725.Earlier this summer, the motoring website Auto Express surveyed the costs of paint colours across a range of cars from different manufacturers.“We’re seeing huge discrepancies in paint pricing between manufacturers and they’re not always obvious at first glance,” says its editor, Paul Barker. “It’s catching people out and can turn what should be a fun part of car buying into a bit of a nightmare.”If you are comparing the cost of two different vehicles and have a colour in mind, you need to make sure you know how much the manufacturers will charge for it.There are four main types of car finish. From the cheapest to the most expensive, they are: solid, the most basic; metallic, which has tiny pieces of aluminium in it to reflect light and give a shine; pearlescent, which shines even more brightly; and matt, a modern non-reflective look.More elaborate paint jobs can cause other headaches. When you choose to sell your car, a bold colour will probably be harder to shift.Jonathan Such, of First Response Finance, a vehicle financing company, sayswhite, black and silver carsare timeless and tend to hold their value better.“Cars that have come in the colour of the ‘moment’ or a trending colour tend to depreciate quicker, so will lose their value quickly, meaning a lower price,” he says.View image in fullscreenBlack is a popular choice of colour and tends to retain its value better than brighter finishes.Photograph: Matt Crossick/AlamyBarker says you will be unlikely to make your money back from an expensive investment on a unique or niche colour scheme. There is one exception, he says, in the bright yellowRenault5 – a colour that has been synonymous with the car since the 1970s and adds £800 to the cost of a new vehicle.The more elaborate the type of paint used, the more expensive repairs are likely to be. James Harris of Slim’s Detailing, a car care retailer, says speciality finishes such as metallics or pearlescents are costly if they have to be touched up.“A small scratch can become a big hassle and matching that paint exactly will cost more than your standard job,” he says.You may also find you need to have work done more often.“Darker colours such as black or deep blue are beautiful when they’re polished, but they’re like a magnet for every swirl mark [light scratches] and water spots,” Harris says. “You need to be on top of it with regular detailing to keep them looking their best. If you’re after a low-maintenance option, then lighter colours – think silver or white – are the way to go. They hide imperfections much better.”Now fraudsters are trying to mis-sell you a car loan payoutRead moreMartijn Versteegen, the founder of Imagin Studio, which creates images of vehicles for car companies, says expensive matt finishes are more prone to visible scratches and cannot be polished out like conventional paint. “Even a small scratch can mean a full respray,” he says.And just to add to the complication, red cars can cost more in repairs as they may need to get resprayed more often, says Such. “This is because red car paint fades over time at a quicker rate than any other colour,” he says.Insurers say the colour you choose will not affect your premium, but if you change the colour after you have bought it, that could be classed as a modification, so you need to inform whoever provides your policy.While £745 may sound a lot to get a Qashqai in anything but red, spare a thought for prospective supercar owners: opting for a new Maserati GranTurismo Folgore finished in “azzuro astro glossy” will cost you £15,840. Then again, if you can afford the £182,000 price tag, perhaps it is not so painful.Explore more on these topicsMotoringConsumer affairsAutomotive industryNissanBMWRenaultfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here’s how to save money on eye tests and specsNHS vouchers and employer subsidies are available for some, while online retailers offer great value for moneyRebecca GoodmanSat 30 Aug 2025 02.00 EDTShareAt the age of 39, I’ve been told I should start wearing glasses when working or driving.On finding out, I suddenly faced a world of decisions – and they all involved a cost.As well as theeye test, I needed to pay for frames – costing from about £20 to £200 at the optician’s I was in – and decide whether to go for extras such as anti-reflection coatings for the lenses or extra-light frames.Most people (86%) buy their glasses from the same optician’s where they have an eye test, according to research by UK regulator the General Optical Council (GOC), and only 8% buy online despite the lower costs. But I wanted to know what shopping around could save me – and whether spending more would be better for my eyes.The eye testA basic eye test typically costs between £20 and £30, and it isrecommended that you have one every two years. An enhanced eye test is also available at most opticians. These allow an optometrist to view the health of the eye in more detail. Costs can really vary. Specsavers says an optical coherence tomography (OCT) scan – which takes a 3D image of the back of the eye – may cost up to £10 extra, whereas some Boots outlets charge an extra £60 for an OCT scan and an “optomap” eye scan.View image in fullscreenOptometrists recommend having your eye sight checked roughly once every two years.Photograph: Ross Helen/AlamyManveer Seyan, a senior lecturer in optometry at the University of Hertfordshire, says a basic eye test is adequate in most cases, but enhanced examinations can help to detect the earliest signs of eye disease, often before symptoms appear.“The scans are also very useful in monitoring the progression of any retinal conditions,” he says. “If an optometrist recommends an enhanced eye examination, it would be advisable to have one.”Some people can get free eye tests through the NHS if they are eligible: for example, if they are receiving certain benefits. Anyone using a screen for their work should also be entitled to afree eye test through their employer, while some companies may contribute to the price of glasses if you are required to wear them for your job.What makes up the price of a pair of glasses?When you buy a pair of glasses, you are paying for two elements: the frame and the lenses.Frames:The cost will depend on the materials involved and the design, with the cheapest starting at less than £10, and some top-end designer frames priced at £500 or more. More expensive frames tend to be made from lightweight materials such as stainless steel, while cheaper frames are often made with heavier and less durable materials such as plastic.View image in fullscreentop-end designer frames priced at £500 or more.Photograph: MixMedia/Getty ImagesLenses: Often the lenses will be the biggest part of the cost – particularly if you need a strong prescription. Basic single-vision lenses are the cheapest, and those with more complicated elements, such as bifocal and varifocal lenses, are more expensive because they include multiple prescriptions.Varifocal glasses are available at a variety of prices depending on the design: this refers to how the lens is engineered to accommodate the different prescriptions the wearer needs. Occupational lenses, also known as office lenses, for example, are one variety of varifocals designed for indoor use. They are recommended for anyone who needs clear vision for near and mid-distance.Upgrading from basic lenses will add to the cost. Here are some examples of upgrades you can add (all the costs quoted here are provided by Specsavers).High-index lenses: these are lighter than standard lenses and suited to people with higher prescriptions who would otherwise have a heavy pair of glasses to wear. Generally, the thinner and lighter the lens is, the more expensive it will be. Extra-thin lenses can add £60 to the cost, for example.Sun tint and UV: this is a permanent tint to your glasses, in a choice of colours, which can relieve eye strain and soften harsh lighting, and includes UV protection. This is usually about £30 more.Hard coating: most glasses already come with a hard coating on the lens to protect against scratches, but you can often choose an enhanced scratch-resistant and anti-reflection coating to reduce reflections. It can cost about £35.Photochromic lenses: also known as transition lenses, these are clear when you are indoors and go darker when you are in the sun. These typically cosr an extra £85.Mirror lenses: enhanced lenses for sunglasses that reflect light and reduce glare. From £60.Polarised tints: you can choose this option for sunglasses and it can help reduce glare. From £70.You can buy cheap reading glasses on the high street. While they can be useful as a spare set, Seyan warns they have limitations.“The ‘one size fits all’ nature can mean that the frame doesn’t fit correctly and the wearer doesn’t look through the centre of the lens,” he says. “Ready-made glasses also have the same power lens in both eyes, and unless the wearer has exactly the same prescription, they will not be perfect.”Online savingsView image in fullscreenShopping in-person offers an important array of services, but for simple prescriptions there are cheaper deals online.Photograph: AlamyWhile traditional shops such as Specsavers, Vision Express or Boots Opticians provide a face-to-face service, there are also lots of online options for buying frames and lenses once you have your prescription.For anyone with a simple prescription, prices for both frames and lenses are usually lower online. Research done in 2023 by Glasses Direct, one of the biggest online retailers, claimed its customers spent an average of £109.60 compared with the £212.90 they spent, on average, the last time they bought similar glasses from a high street optician.Buying online has other benefits, too – you can browse whenever you want to, and comparing costs between retailers is quicker. Online retailers say they provide the same advice as a physical branch, either on the phone or through email, and most have the technology to allow you to try on glasses virtually.Neil Perry, the operations manager at online retailer Lensology, says prices are often up to 70% cheaper online.He suggests that in physical shops customers can feel obliged to make quick decisions about frames, lens finishes and other add-ons, which can lead to them spending more on extras that may not “have been fully considered”.However, you cannot buy all frames online – varifocals and bifocals are only available in branches at Specsavers, for example, and you will miss out on expert help to make sure the glasses fit.You may also have to factor in delivery costs that may not be included in the headline price.Seyan says he would advise buying glasses from a physical optician because “choosing a suitable frame involves finding something that not only looks good but is the right size and, most importantly, is suitable for the prescription issued. Dispensing opticians or appropriately trained staff in a practice can make suitable recommendations, and this kind of advice isn’t always available online.”View image in fullscreenSpecific measurements need to be taken when ordering frames with lenses.Photograph: Zorica Nastasic/Getty ImagesSpecific measurements need to be taken to ensure the lenses align with the wearer’s pupil, and extra measurements are required for more complex lenses such as bifocals.“Not taking accurate measurements and having misaligned optical centres can affect a wearer’s vision and give rise to secondary issues such as eye strain and headaches. When ordering spectacles online, these measurements are often estimated and this can cause problems later,” Seyan says.Getting a lodger: how to earn extra cash by letting a room in your homeRead moreBear in mind that there are lots of deals and discounts at online and bricks and mortar outlets – such as money off if you buy two pairs.Whether you shop online or on the high street, it is important to go to an optician registered with the GOC. These businesses must meet certain standards and, if they breach these, they can be sanctioned.Anyone can search the public register to see if a business or optician is registered with the GOC.Help with costsYou may get a free eye test or eye vouchers towards the cost of glasses if you are receiving any of the following benefits: income support, income-based employment and support allowance, income-based jobseeker’s allowance, pension credit guarantee credit or universal credit and you meet the criteria.Some of the other reasons for qualifying also include being under 16 or over 60, registered as partly sighted or blind, having been diagnosed with diabetes or glaucoma, or if you have been advised by an eye doctor to have a test (you can find afull list on the NHS website).Where can I find best value for money?We compared the costs of a very basic set of frames with single prescription lenses to see where prices start at different retailers. Remember you may be able to get a voucher towards the cost from your employer:SelectSpecs (online): starts from £6, which includes single vision basic lenses.Glasses Direct (online): starts from £9, which includes 1.5 index prescription lenses.Spex4Less (online): starts from £12.95 for frames only. Basic single vision lenses start from £5.Specsavers (online and branches): starts from £15, which includes basic single vision lenses.Vision Express (online and branches): Starts from £25, which includes basic single vision lenses.Boots Opticians (online and branches): starts from £50, which includes basic single vision lenses.Lensology (online): Starts from £16 for single vision lenses only (aimed at those upgrading an existing pair of glasses).Explore more on these topicsConsumer affairsHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is not clear how many of Wagestream’s 1,311 clients – which include Superdrug, Domino’s, Halfords, Schuh and a number of NHS trusts – are already offering loans. Companies working with Wagestream do not lend the money to their workers, and do not receive commissions on the loans.Wagestream, which also offers budgeting tools and savings pots to help workers manage their finances, says it offers an ethical alternative for low-wage workers who would otherwise be pushed to higher-cost loans, with many being charged an average APR of 62% before turning to Wagestream.However, critics say Wagestream – which is backed by social impact investors including the Joseph Rowntree Foundation via the Fair by Design Fund, as well as the former Wonga payday loan investor Balderton Capital – is making it too easy for low earners to fall into debt, by offering salary advances and loans in tandem.There are also concerns that, as with its salary advance service, Wagestream is automatically deducting loan payments from wages. This enables Wagestream to leapfrog other essential bills and practically guarantee that debts are repaid. Workers can opt to make loan repayments via direct debit and to pause payments but that requires additional negotiation with Wagestream.Adam Butler, the public policy manager at StepChange Debt Charity, said lenders who took payment directly from wages needed to ensure their loans were not forcing customers to compensate elsewhere, including through “additional borrowing, cutting back on essentials and missing bills”.Sara Williams, a debt adviser, campaigner and author of the Debt Camel blog, said she had “serious concerns” about a company trying to sell high-interest loans to customers it had signed up to salary advance schemes, which are free to use once a month and then charge a small set fee rather than interest.“A business model that gets people to take increasing amounts of short-term 0% debts and then sells them an expensive loan to clear it raises serious concerns, and the employer should consider if this can really align with their workers’ best interest,” she said.Workers who earn less than £2,000 a month before tax told the Guardian that they were able to borrow at least £1,000 within hours after filling in a quick online form.Nadine Houghton, a national officer for theGMB union, which represents thousands of Asda workers, said: “For low-paid workers to have the ability to access credit at such high interest rates at the click of a button – it’s like payday loans.”Houghton said the requirement for lending raised questions about sustainable wages at low-wage employers. “We want our members to be paid properly for the work they do so they can have savings and don’t have to have loans.”OneAsdaworker told the Guardian that she took out a £1,000 loan in March after she “got into a bit of a pickle” using Wagestream to access up to half her pay early each month. The interest rate was much lower than that previously offered by doorstep lenders and she would not have been able to borrow money from most mainstream lenders because of her credit history. However, she admits: “I did originally take out the loan to get back to square one.“One month I was short on everything, and [organising the loan] was really easy and I thought: ‘Let’s see if I can give it a go.’ It took less than 10 minutes to fill in everything and was really easy, and the money was in my account within two hours.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

These include optional salary advances and a savings product.“For those who choose to apply for a loan through the Wagestream platform, all applications are assessed for affordability and creditworthiness in line with FCA regulations governing consumer credit.”A Pizza Express spokesperson confirmed that its staff had access to the loans as part of a “range of tools” helping employees to access discounts, financial coaching and savings products. It said participating was voluntary and that the company did not pay for the platform or receive any financial incentives when staff used it.Ascension, which manages the Fair by Design Fund through which the Joseph Rowntree Foundation became an early-stage investor in Wagestream, said that it “recognised the concerns raised” but that many families did not have savings to cover unexpected expenses and may have no other option but to turn to costly payday or doorstep lenders as a result.“Our priority is to support models that can provide more affordable, responsible alternatives, using stronger data and affordability checks than were available before,” Ascension said. “This is not a substitute for fair wages or a robust welfare system but it can help reduce reliance on the most harmful forms of credit.”A Joseph Rowntree Foundation spokesperson echoed those comments, saying that while the government needed to improve support for households in financial hardship, “for now, the need for credit among those living in hardship continues. Against this backdrop, there is a role for responsible and impact-focused lenders to help families manage the cost of essentials during periods of hardship.”Wagestream said: “Wagestream was founded on a social charter to improve workers’ financial wellbeing. By partnering with employers, we help people who are underserved by traditional financial institutions to earn, learn, save, spend and borrow on their own terms.“We are proud to offer a fair, accessible alternative which helps our members to build better financial futures. We are confident that Wagestream’s products deliver positive outcomes, and we remain dedicated to building a more inclusive and equitable financial system.”Explore more on these topicsBorrowing & debtEmployee benefitsPersonal loansConsumer affairsFamily financesGMB unionTrade unionsnewsShareReuse this content"

A sea eagle, surprised to see humans, flaps away over the only house with a roof on it – the rest are in ruins. “Hundreds of people used to live here,” says Vidar. “In the days when you had to sail or row, it was important to be near the fishing grounds. Now there’s just one summer cabin.”Jumping out of the boat, we walk along the beach. My daughter, Maddy, points out some animal tracks. “The fresh marks are wild reindeer,” says Vidar. “The older ones could be moose – they come along here too.”View image in fullscreenBeyond the end of the beach are the small fields that the inhabitants once cultivated, now covered in wild flowers. In winter this would be an inhospitable place, but at the height of summer the flora and fauna are booming under a sun that never goes down. The people hunted a special type of cod, Vidar explains, theskrei, which migrates west from the Barents Sea to breed off Arctic islands such as this one, Skogsøya. This is the extreme edge of north-west Europe, isolated from the rest of Norway by a maze of twisting fjords and snow-capped inner islands. Head west from this beach and the first landfall is Greenland.“When did everyone leave?” I ask, watching an otter swimming around the cove and diving into the kelp beds.“It started with the terrible Arctic storm of 1893 that killed many people. Then the marine diesel engine came and they didn’t need to live out here. By 1952, they were all gone.”View image in fullscreenThe spectacular nine-mile Dronningruta hike is a major draw for visitors.Photograph: Christian Roth ChristensenRudolf Diesel probably never meant to redefine the meaning of “remote”, but that’s what his eponymous engine did. Patented in that same year of 1893, his invention would inadvertently redraw the map of this coast. Places once inaccessible up long fjords could now prosper as sheltered havens, but exposed outer-island fishing villages, inhabited only for their accessibility to sailing and rowing boats, were left to return to wilderness.Jumping back on the boat, we head northwards, weaving between rocky islets and rafts of puffins. Three sea eagles watch us warily. Then Maddy spots a group of black fins slicing towards us through the waves. Vidar cuts the engine. “You’re in luck,” he grins. Seconds later four orcas come rolling past, blowholes blasting – three adults and one calf, heading for a local seal colony. “Mostly they eat herring,” says Vidar. “But some do know how to catch seals.”Back on the boat, we head north, weaving between rocky islets and rafts of puffins. Three sea eagles watch us warilyAfter a few precious minutes watching the orcas, we head back to Vidar’s base, the village of Nyksund, carving a tight bend through a narrow gap formed by a pair of craggy islands, then into the little harbour. The two sides of this tranquil haven are lined with clapboard houses, fish warehouses and rusting cranes. There are clamouring kittiwakes nesting on every available ledge; the wharves and decking have gaps; much of the paint is peeling. But this is a pretty spot, not gentrified – not yet. Nyksund is another abandoned fishing village, but with a difference. The people are coming back.On the quayside, I meet Dan and Johanna, who will be our guides. They came here in the 1990s, finding only one aged resident remaining. The rest had left in the 1970s, tired of the awkward tiny harbour and crunching winter storms, but now the population is back up to more than 20.View image in fullscreenA close encounter with orcas off the island of  Skogsøya.Photograph: Kevin RushbyThat afternoon, we set out with Johanna on theDronningruta(the Queen’s Route), a spectacular nine-mile (15km) hike that is Nyksund’s biggest attraction. The route leads up on to a ridge where I begin to see why this path is a favourite of Norway’s Queen Sonja. First, there are views south to the soaring mountains of Skogsøya, then a vast panorama of snow-capped peaks and islands opens up to the north. The lower slopes are emerald green all the way down to the azure sea. Under our feet is a thick carpet of leaves and flowers. On the windswept summits, juniper bushes grow horizontally, sheltering behind 5cm-tall crowberry bushes.Finally we descend into the fishing port of Stø, taking a detour to see the church atLangenes, a rustic wooden masterpiece, parts of which date back to the 16th century. On the wall, in Gothic script, is the Lord’s Prayer in Old Danish, a reminder that Norway was under the control of Copenhagen for many centuries, achieving full independence only in 1905, after being ceded to Sweden in 1814.We skip the return leg along the coast, opting for the boat service that shuttles us back to Nyksund. There is no second sighting of orca, but the ride is still an exciting rollercoaster through the swell, with an audience of seals and black guillemots. Back in Nyksund, we drink a beer in the cosyHolmvik Bryggebar, then eat a plate of local seafood in theEkspedisjonenrestaurant. Specialities includetørrfisk(skrei cod, air-dried then soaked in running freshwater for a week before cooking), black halibut andtorsketunger, tempura-style cod’s tongue.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There were plans for a five-star hotel, but that fell through. Whatever happens, Nyksund wouldn’t be able to cope with crowds.” The sense of community, however, is strong: they recently called adugnad, a Norwegian tradition of collective voluntary action, in order to pave the village square.Next morning, at the scheduled kelp-forest swimming session, there are no crowds, only myself, Maddy and our guide, Richards. A swim in the Arctic might sound intimidating, but the water, we discover, is not that cold when you’re inside 7mm-thick neoprene. We snorkel for an hour through a startlingly colourful world of bronze kelp fronds and vast schools of fish. Bright pink sea urchins cling to golden stalks of seaweed and, in the indigo blue distance, we glimpse the shapes of large grey cod. Beyond them, unseen, are the orcas, dolphins, seals and whales that inhabit this fertile world, a world that rolls onward, for the time being, unaware of human machinations over its future.I dive down into the forest, pushing through the golden stems of kelp and turning over to watch air bubbles sliding up the silky fronds to the glittering surface.Lofoten has so many tourists now, people are complaining that sometimes they can’t leave their housesLater, warming up in the cafe that also serves as an antiques shop, I meet the unofficial custodian of the town’s spirit, Atle Valland. Born here in 1944, Valland remembers a harsh environment where children were expected to work from the age of seven, their nimble fingers handy for slicing out the prized cod’s tongue. Having left, aged 16, to become a ship’s engineer, Valland returned in 2022 to find a few brave souls moving in. He shows me his prized collection of Russian porcelain. “I’m not a collector,” he chuckles. “I just take care of old things.” That care extends to a vast assortment of whalebones, tools, paintings, furniture and photographs, which he plans to turn into a museum.On our last night, we join a good-humoured group for dinner, including the vicar, Gry, and her husband, Radar, who comes from the Lofoten Islands, about 100 miles to the south. When talk turns to the future of Nyksund, Radar has a warning: “Lofoten has so many tourists now, people are complaining that sometimes they can’t leave their houses. The streets are too full.”The diesel engine altered the layout of this coast for a previous generation and now another technological innovation is driving more change. The Lofoten tourism tsunami powered by social media is bringing vast crowds to villages unused to visitors. Nyksund art gallery owner and photographer Svein Erik Tøien was moved to create a surrealistic collage of a giant cruise ship squeezed into Nyksund’s diminutive harbour. “I wanted to ask a question,” he says. “Is this what we want?”When Maddy and I leave, we drive across the bumpy Nyksund causeway, then down 5.6 miles of narrow gravel track on the island of Langøya before we reach asphalt. In the past, perhaps, remoteness was as plentiful as the fish. Now the challenge is to make this most capricious of commodities into something sustainable.Travel was provided byDiscoverthe World, which offers a seven-night self-drive journey,Around Vesteralen,from £1,227pp including B&B accommodation (three nights in Nyksund), car rental and whale-watching.

Get the basics right firstLay the groundwork by prioritising fences, composting and paving – and worry about the plants laterAlice VincentSat 30 Aug 2025 06.00 EDTShareOne of the questions I’m often asked when I speak at events usually comes from someone – perhaps half of a couple – who seems wide-eyed with optimism and overwhelm. “We’ve just moved into a new house and it has this garden,” they’ll begin. They don’t know what to do with it; where should they start?Invariably, I tell them to ignore the traditional advice of waiting for a year to see what comes up. Granted, you may dig up some ancient bulbs, like these grape hyacinths, but it’s your garden now and these risks are yours to take.The last place we moved to was a pretty blank canvas but I was rather more green in my own gardening experience. After nearly a decade of balcony gardening, I went wild on the plant catalogues and the prettier corners of Instagram, manically demanding Sarah Raven-level splendour from my newly carved bed of crap clay soil in south London.Don’t bother waiting for a year to see what comes up. You may dig up some bulbs, but it’s your garden nowPerhaps this is a phase we all have to go through, but now I’m staring down on another blank slate of a garden. With nothing in it bar buddleia and a lone orange dahlia, which a friend accurately described as a “cellar spider” variety, making a bulb order feels vaguely fantastical. Instead, I want to get the fundamentals right. The fences are pretty shoddy. We don’t intend to move for some time, so we may as well invest in the boundaries now rather than having to replace them once the garden’s got going. Sorry, roof fund, I’m going to be biting the bullet and having some awkward conversations with the new neighbours.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

It might be time to change your mindRead moreNext, I want to get my composting sorted. I’ve evolved from an Aerobin (ideal for speedier composting in small spaces) and I’m now hankering after a proper bay system. Good gardens come from decent soil, decent soil can be made from things that already exist – but infrastructure helps.Speaking of closed-loop systems, I intend to stash the bricks scattered liberally around the place and redeploy them for paving down the line. Failing that, I’ll have them crushed on site and folded into the inevitable substrate-based part of the garden that will emerge with time. I’ve loved growing in gravel, and this approach (similar to those used by brownfield gardeners John Little and Jo McKerr) feels the next logical step to take.Anything in a container came with me from the old plot, including some trees, which are sorely needed here. New plants, I trust, will arrive in time. But for now they feel like scatter cushions and paint colours: the stuff that gets thought about with time, looking and living – and hopefully generous hand-me-down cuttings.Explore more on these topicsGardening adviceGardensfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In the end, I have to go out there and stare at a bush.“Lots of weeds,” my wife says. I stare, and say nothing.“What’s wrong with you?” she says. My prepared answer does not fit this question; I’m obliged to improvise.“I don’t want to talk about it,” I say, stepping into my office shed and shutting the door.The thing I don’t want to talk about is an incident with another dog, on a nearly deserted patch of open scrubland. Possibly I should have seen it coming; the other dog was small, and small dogs have a way of going on the offensive early, before suddenly changing their minds.But we had already given this dog, and the couple who owned it, a wide berth. At this point they were just dots on the horizon, and I was throwing our dog’s ball in the other direction. Our dog ran after it and brought it back, over and over.“And then she suddenly drops the ball and hares off toward them,” I tell my wife eventually. “From, like, almost a football pitch away.”I spend the rest of the afternoon in my office, even though it’s a SaturdayWhat our dog saw, even from that distance, was another ball being thrown. She is a thief of balls, but people are mostly understanding about this.“I could see she was being friendly with the little dog, if a little too interested in the ball,” I say. “And so I started trudging over there. I was about halfway when the whole thing kicked off.”The dogs were barking and running in tight circles and the woman was screaming and the man was swearing. It’s the kind of chaotic scene you sometimes see from a distance in a park and think: I’m glad that has nothing to do with me.“How bad did it get?” my wife says.Tim Dowling: it’s time to name our band’s new album, and there are no bad ideas (in theory at least)Read more“At that point I was running, so I couldn’t really see,” I say. By the time I caught hold of the dog’s collar, it was over. The woman checked her dog for injuries – it had none – while I apologised profusely, and probably still insufficiently.“She’s been so well behaved,” my wife says.“This was not the time to bring that up,” I say.I spend the rest of the afternoon in my office, even though it’s a Saturday. The incident has opened up a big gulf between how I am and how I wish to seem, and I figure I will just sit there until the gulf closes up again, even if that’s never. But then I get hungry.“All year I’ve been experiencing bouts of anxiety,” I say, opening the fridge.“I’ve noticed,” my wife says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

But now I think it’s just from having a dog.” It’s been a whole year of worrying the dog will run off, or get kidnapped, or eat something poisonous, or be carried out to sea, or leap off a cliff in pursuit of a grasshopper, or lose a fight with another dog, or win one.“Anyway, I’ve ordered a muzzle,” my wife says. A pause follows.“That seems a bit drastic,” I say.“I know, but I can’t have you going on like this,” she says. For a long moment, I think the muzzle is for me.“Fine,” I say, trying to imagine how walking a dog with a muzzle will make me feel. And more importantly, how it will make me seem.The next day, the muzzle arrives in the post. My wife takes it out of the package in front of me.“It’s supposed to be a soft one,” she says, holding it up. “But it doesn’t look very nice.”“The thing is,” I say, “she doesn’t actually bite.”“You were the one who went on and on about how awful it was,” she says.“I suppose I was mostly worried about how I came out of it,” I say.“Anyway, we have it in case,” she says, putting the muzzle in a drawer.We both look at the dog lying on the sofa, one open eye staring back up at us. The dog’s tail thumps twice against the cushion.“It would never have happened if I was there,” my wife says.“Here we go,” I say.Explore more on these topicsFamilyThe Tim Dowling columnPetsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He was visiting the city of Munich, and after dropping his bags at a central hotel, he walked to the city’s Englischer Garten. “It’s one of the biggest parks in Europe,” he says, and home to the Eisbach river’s famous artificial wave. “The surfers follow unwritten rules based on respect that are fascinating to watch. They line up on either side of the river and take turns. When one surfer falls off the wave and is swept away in the current, another jumps on, and everyone cheers each other on. It’s methodical and quite mesmerising. It takes great skill to jump from the wall into the wave, and manoeuvre back and forth in such a narrow space.”He took this image from a bridge, because “while the banks on either side of the river create a perfect amphitheatre to watch, it gets so packed, it’s tough to find an open spot”. Despite this, Templeton adds that “the spectators are very quiet, mostly watching in awe, so it’s quite peaceful and relaxing to find a perch in the shady forest”.Templeton took the shot on his phone and says, “I have no rules for iPhone shots.

We are so deeply grateful to everyone, in Haiti and internationally, who has worked tirelessly over these terrible weeks to help secure their safe return,” her family said in a statement.Simon Harris, Ireland’s tánaiste, or deputy prime minister, celebrated the end of their ordeal ina statementon social media. “We warmly welcome the news that Gena and all of the Haitian nationals taken captive on August 3, including a small child, have been released and are reported to be safe and well,” Harris said.“This has, of course, been an extraordinarily difficult and stressful situation for the Heraty family. I wish to pay tribute to their resilience and determination to support Gena and her fellow captives over these past difficult weeks,” Harris added, calling Heraty “a respected humanitarian and deeply courageous person who has dedicated her life to supporting the most vulnerable people in Haiti”.‘Haitians are kidnapped every day’: missionary abductions shed light on growing crisisRead moreHeraty had reportedly been living in Haiti for 32 years and had been responsible for about 270 children at the orphanage in Kenscoff.Haiti has been thrust into a seemingly interminable spiral of violence since February last year when politically connected and heavily armed gangs launched a coordinated uprising against the government. Criminal groups now control virtually the entire capital and a UN-backed policing mission has failed to stop gang foot-soldiers rampaging across the Caribbean city.The situation has become so dire that authorities have resorted tousing armed dronesandrecruiting foreign mercenariesin an attempt to win back control of the city.Ireland’s department of foreign affairs strongly advises its citizens not to visit the Caribbean country as a result of the “extremely volatile” security situation. “There are frequent clashes between gangs and security forces. Kidnappings, robberies, and violent crime are prevalent,” its website warns.According tothe Irish Independent, Heraty’s group was abducted after armed attackers stormed the building at about 3.30am on a Sunday morning.“They broke through a wall to enter the property before heading to the building where the director was staying, leaving with nine hostages,” the local mayor said at the time.Some reportsclaimed the kidnappers were part of Viv Ansanm (Live Together), the criminal coalition that rose up last year, plunging Haiti’s capital into chaos.Explore more on these topicsHaitiAmericasIrelandEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The administration of Trump’s Democratic presidential predecessor Joe Biden had extended TPS for people fromVenezuela.Mother of boy, 15, held at gunpoint by US immigration agents files $1m claimRead more“In enacting the TPS statute, Congress designed a system of temporary status that was predictable, dependable, and insulated from electoral politics,” judge Kim Wardlaw, who was nominated by president Bill Clinton, a Democrat, wrote for the panel. The other two judges on the panel were also nominated by Democratic presidents.In an email, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) condemned the decision as more obstruction from “unelected activist” judges.“For decades the TPS program has been abused, exploited, and politicized as a de facto amnesty program,” the email read. “While this injunction delays justice and undermines the integrity of our immigration system, Secretary Noem will use every legal option at the department’s disposal to end this chaos and prioritize the safety of Americans.”Congress authorized TPS as part of the Immigration Act of 1990. It allows the DHS secretary to grant legal immigration status to people fleeing countries experiencing civil strife, environmental disaster or other “extraordinary and temporary conditions” that prevent a safe return to that home country. The terms are for six, 12 and 18 months.The appellate judges said the guaranteed time limitations were critical so people could gain employment, find long-term housing and build stability without fear of shifting political winds.But in ending the protections soon after Trump took office, Noem said conditions in Venezuela had improved and it was not in the US national interest to allow migrants from there to stay on for what is a temporary program. It’s part of a broader move by Trump’s administration to reduce the number of immigrants who are in the country either without legal documentation or through legal temporary programs.The US district judge Edward Chen of San Francisco found in March that plaintiffs were likely to prevail on their claim that the administration had overstepped its authority in terminating the protections. Chen postponed the terminations, but the US supreme court reversed them without explanation, which is common in emergency appeals.It is unclear what effect Friday’s ruling will have on the estimated 350,000 Venezuelans in the group of 600,000 whose protections expired in April. Their lawyers say some have already been fired from jobs, detained in immigration jails, separated from their US citizen children and even deported.Protections for the remaining 250,000 Venezuelans are set to expire on 10 September.“What is really significant now is that the second court unanimously recognized that the trial court got it right,” said Emi MacLean, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU Foundation of Northern California representing plaintiffs.She added that while the decision might not benefit immediately those people who have already lost their status or are about to lose their status, Friday’s ruling “should provide a path for the administration’s illegal actions related to Venezuela and TPS to finally be undone”.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationTrump administrationUS politicsVenezuelaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The announcement came after the president,Prabowo Subianto, appealed for calm and in a statement on Friday said he had ordered a “thorough and transparent investigation” into the death of the driver, Affan Kurniawan, and urged the public to trust his government.Protests in Makassar in eastern Indonesia descended into chaos on Friday outside city council buildings, which were set on fire, and vehicles were set ablaze as protesters hurled rocks and molotov cocktails.Three people were killed as a result of the fire at the Makassar city council building, its secretary, Rahmat Mappatoba, told AFP.“They were trapped in the burning building,” he said, accusing protesters of storming the office to set the building on fire.View image in fullscreenDemonstrators throwing stones at riot police in Jakarta on Friday.Photograph: Willy Kurniawan/Reuters“This is beyond our prediction. Usually during a demonstration, protesters only threw rocks or burn a tyre in front of the office. They never stormed into the building or burned it,” Mappatoba added.Two of the victims were local council staff and another was a civil servant. Two died at the scene and one died in hospital. At least four people were injured in the fire and are being treated in hospital, the official said.Images showed the provincial council building ablaze overnight, but the fire has since been extinguished.Protesters at the South Sulawesi provincial council building tried to knock down the gate and storm in.View image in fullscreenThe Makassar city council building ablaze.Photograph: Daeng Mansur/AFP/GettyIn Jakarta, hundreds of people gathered outside the headquarters of the elite Mobile Brigade Corp paramilitary police unit, which they blamed for the death of the motorcycle taxi driver, throwing firecrackers as police responded with teargas.A group of protesters tried to tear down the gates of the unit, which is notorious for its heavy-handed tactics, and pulled a sign from the building’s facade in chaotic scenes.Police said they had detained seven officers for questioning in connection with the driver’s death.View image in fullscreenAn ambulance makes its way through a demonstration in Jakarta.Photograph: Willy Kurniawan/ReutersThe protests were the biggest and most violent ofSubianto’s presidency less than a year into his rule. Subianto has promised fast, state-driven growth but has already faced protests for widespread budget cuts to fund his populist policies, including a $1bn free meal programme.The driver’s death caused anger that had been brewing over government perks and the cost of living crisis to boil over. Since Monday, thousands of protesters have demonstrated in the capital against a monthly housing allowance for MPs that amounts to almost10 times the Jakarta minimum wageamid the president’s austerity drive.Protests also spread to other big Indonesian cities on Friday, including Yogyakarta, Bandung, Semarang and Surabaya in Java and Medan in North Sumatra province.Explore more on these topicsIndonesiaPrabowo SubiantoProtestAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

This is important because the war has become one of the main pillars of their relationship,” he said.China hasemergedas an economic lifeline for Russia during the war in Ukraine, and Kyiv has been increasingly outspoken about what it says is China’s direct aiding of Moscow’s war effort.Bilateral trade climbed to more than $240bn last year, two-thirds higher than before the invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Beijing is now the leading buyer of Russian oil and coal and will shortly surpassEuropeas Moscow’s main market for natural gas.Russia’s dependency on China is unlikely to go away even if the fighting stops, Gabuev said. “Russia wants to know whether China will buy more oil and gas in the long term,” he said.While trade hit a record high in 2024, it has since dipped amid a slump in Russian oil exports to China, a trend Putin will be eager to reverse in Beijing. Specifically, the two sides are expected to discuss the long-suggested Power of Siberia-2 gas pipeline and plans to expand the existing oil link into China.The talks are also likely to touch on deepening military cooperation between Beijing and Moscow, a development that has alarmed western governments.While China has stopped short of providing direct military aid, US officials say Beijing hassuppliedabout 70% of the machine tools and 90% of the semiconductors Russia needs to rebuild its war machine. In return, China is believed to be receiving assistance in sensitive defence technologies.China claims it is a neutral mediator in the war in Ukraine, but the two countries have pulled closer together since the start of the invasion.Russia recently floated the idea that Beijing should be among Ukraine’s security guarantors, reviving a proposal first put forward by Russian negotiators during talks in Turkey in spring 2022. Kyiv is likely to view the idea with scepticism.There will be no shortage of symbolism during the visit. Putin is expected to sit alongside Xi at the military parade in Beijing on 3 September – a mirror image of the 9 May Victory Day celebrations in Moscow where the Chinese leader took pride of place as Chinese troopsmarchedthrough Red Square beside their Russian counterparts.The Tiananmen Square parade, like Russia’s own Victory Day rituals, allows Beijing to invoke the memory of wartime triumphs as a way of affirming its great-power status, analysts say.“Russia and China share a similar view of history, casting themselves as the victorious powers of the second world war. This sense of shared destiny now underpins their partnership,” said Vasiliy Kashin, of the Institute of Far Eastern Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow.Kashin said the celebrations, with Kim present, could give a chance to smooth over any tensions surrounding Moscow’s growingalliancewith Pyongyang, a shift that has caused irritation in Beijing.China has traditionally been North Korea’s closest ally, but has lost some influence since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Kim has sent thousands of troops to support Moscow’s war, and in return Russia has provided the isolated state with advanced missile and drone technology.“Judging by Kim’s invitation to Beijing, China is looking for ways to restore its relations with the North Koreans,” Kashin said.Putin’s visit will be closely watched in Washington, where Trump administration officials have promoted the policy of trying to prise Moscow away from Beijing and tilt it back towards the US.Yet most analysts dismiss such hopes. “Relations between Russia and China will always be close,” Kashin said. “A scenario in which Russia would turn against China, or China against Russia, is impossible.”The two leaders meet at a moment when each feels emboldened. China has managed to stave off a trade war with the US, which earlier this monthextendedits truce with Beijing for another 90 days as Washington sought to avoid reigniting a conflict that rattled global markets in the spring. Beijing flexed its muscle by imposing strict export controls on rare earths that threatened US manufacturing.Trump has also refrained from threatening secondary sanctions on Beijing over its purchases of Russian oil, while insteadtargetingIndia.Russia, meanwhile, hasbrushedaside Trump’s threats of penalties unless it halts the war, clinging to its maximalist demands and intensifying its campaign against Ukraine.Tellingly, the Trump administration has so far applied little pressure on Xi to push Putin towards ending the war. Observers said that while Beijing would prefer the fighting in Ukraine to stop, it is willing to tolerate the conflict so long as it can prioritise trade and diplomatic ties with Moscow and extract favourable terms.“China remains clear-eyed about the slim prospects for peace and sees little reason to accelerate talks,” Gabuev said. “They know that Russia and Ukraine remain very far apart. No one is really asking China to step in – and that suits Beijing, since it can continue with imitation diplomacy without doing much in reality.”Explore more on these topicsRussiaChinaVladimir PutinXi JinpingUkraineEuropeAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Gillham claims the event was cancelled in an attempt to silence him over his stance on the crisis in Gaza.In a statement after Friday night’s performance, Gillham said while he felt for “my friends and colleagues in the orchestra that had to endure this having played no part in my cancellation, the protest does highlight that the MSO brand has taken a nosedive globally because of the actions of its management in cancelling me just over one year ago”.“Silencing someone who wants to bring awareness to injustice and honour brave Palestinians resisting their own genocide is unpopular with artists everywhere. Artists do not want to be forced into silence on Palestine in order to get work and maintain a career in this industry.“The MSO can work to rectify this by affirming that artists can and always have spoken on issues of conscience and have a right to do so on stage.”The cancellation of Gillham’s performance came after a concert in which he played a short piece called Witness, composed by the Australian multimedia artistConnor D’Netto, which was dedicated to journalists who had lost their lives in the Gaza conflict.While introducing the work, Gillham addressed the audience, saying more than 100 Palestinian journalists had been killed and that the targeting of journalists in a conflict was a war crime under international law.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The BBC, which broadcasts the performance, apologised for the disruption.The BBC spoke to one audience member, Angela Tanner, who said it had taken security “quite a while” to remove the protesters.“The whole program had to start again and has been put into a different order after the piano was put on to the stage and taken off again,” shetold the BBC.In a statementreported by the BBC, the broadcaster said “there was a disturbance at tonight’s Prom which meant the concert was paused for a few minutes and the live broadcast on BBC Radio 3 diverted to pre-recorded music”.“The incident was dealt with swiftly by the Royal Albert Hall.“Our priority is always the safety and wellbeing of everyone who attends the BBC Proms, and we would like to thank our staff and the performers whose response helped keep disruption to a minimum,” the BBC spokesperson said.In May the federal court ordered Gillham’s case to proceed to trial, which is scheduled to begin on 1 December.Explore more on these topicsAustralia newsProtestIsrael-Gaza warLondonRoyal Albert HallnewsShareReuse this content"

A decision on the target is expected before Anthony Albanese attends the UN general assembly in New York in late September.A consultation paper by the authority last year – based on an initial assessment of scientific, economic, technological and social evidence – suggested a 2035 target of between 65% and 75% below 2005 levels “would be ambitious and could be achievableif additional action is taken by governments, business, investors and households”. Since then, the government has been lobbied about what target it should set.Figueres said setting a target of a 75% or more reduction would be “not a burden”, but instead be “Australia’s ticket into the prosperity of the future”. She suggested the ambitious goal would increase Australia’s chance to win the rights to host a major UN climate summit in Adelaide in November 2026.Australia continues to vie with Turkeyfor the right to host the Cop31 summit and it is unclear when that will be resolved under the UN’s consensus decision-making process.UN climate chief warns Australia not to pick a ‘bog standard’ 2035 carbon emissions targetRead more“The new global economy is rising, powered by clean energy and green industry,” Figueres said. Australia can be at its heart, with unrivalled sun and wind, critical minerals and skilled labour ready to lead.“Prime minister Albanese now has the chance to show the Pacific and the world that Australia is ready to lead at Cop31 and beyond.”Sign up to get climate and environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a free newsletterA report last week, commissioned by the Business for 75% group, which is backed by Future Group, Fortescue, Atlassian, Canva, Ikea and Unilever, suggested a 75% reduction target could lead to national GDP being $370bn greater by 2035 compared with current projections. It said the economic benefits of the more ambitious goal would be much greater than under a 65% target.A separate report to be released on Monday by the research thinktank Climate Analytics suggests Australia should set a reduction target of about 81%, within a range of 76% to 89%, to align with the Paris agreement goal of attempting to limit global heating since preindustrial times to 1.5C.The Climate Analytics chief executive and senior scientist, Bill Hare, agreed with Figueres that other countries would be watching where Australia landed as they considered the government’s case that it should co-host Cop31 with Pacific Island countries.Hare said multiple studies had found Australia could “get into the 75% range in terms of what is technically and economically feasible”. He said significant cost-effective emissions cuts were possible in several areas, and the main barriers to action were political.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They have argued it meant Australia should set a target of reaching net zero emissions by 2035 – a goal that many experts say it would not be logistically possible to meet.What is happening with Australia’s emissions? Electricity is improving. Transport is notRead moreFrank Jotzo, the director of the Australian National University’s Centre for Climate andEnergyPolicy and a government adviser on climate policy, said that even a reduction target in the 60s would be ambitious. He said the government should be ambitious but the policies to drive change were more important than the number.Jotzo said Australia’s emissions reductions had been slow to date, and reaching a 65% reduction goal would require pollution levels to be halved in a decade. That was possible, he said, but would require substantial policies in areas where emissions have been rising or going sideways – particularly industry, transport and agriculture – and faster reductions than were happening in electricity.“Whatever target gets adopted should have a path to implementation and should have a good chance of being perceived as possible,” he said.Jotzo backed a suggestion by the climate change minister, Chris Bowen, that the government may set a target range, rather than a single number.Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisChristiana FigueresEnergy (Environment)Greenhouse gas emissionsGlobal climate talksEnergy (Australia news)Australian politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

A murder investigation has been launched and the president,Volodymyr Zelenskyy, condemned the killing as a “horrific murder”.Europe’s foreign ministers met in Copenhagen to discuss possible measures to force Moscow to the negotiating table. Speaking at a press conference after the meeting, the EU foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said that Russia was “clearly not preparing for peace”.“TheEuropean Unionand all the member states support the diplomatic efforts to achieve peace and the end of Russia’s war. But it’s clear that Russia is not preparing for peace. It is the opposite: they are preparing for more war,” she said. Ministers also discussed the war in Gaza and the deepening humanitarian crisis there.The summit, which was an informal meeting and as such did not involve ministers committing to any concrete steps, took place at the end of a violent week. Russia launched a large airstrike on Kyiv,killing at least 21 peopleon Thursday. There was also an overnight strike on a five-storey residential building that killed one person and injured 24 others in Zaporizhzhia, and the Dnipropetrovsk region faced a “massive attack” early on Saturday, its governor said, with strikes in Dnipro and Pavlograd.View image in fullscreenThe aftermath of Russia’s overnight strike on Zaporizhzhia, which hit a five-storey building killing one person and injuring 24 others.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesSince the invasion of Ukraine, the EU has imposed 18 packages of sanctions againstRussia, with the latest adopted in July. Ministers on Saturday discussed options for a fresh package, with measures floated including import bans and tariffs; secondary sanctions, which would affect third parties trading with the country; and stepping up efforts against Russian shadow fleet ships, which have been used to evade western sanctions on its oil exports.The question of using Russia’s frozen assets for Ukraine’s reconstruction was also discussed. “Ministers acknowledged the need to address Ukraine’s financing gap and to hold Russia accountable for war damages. To achieve this, it is crucial to explore all avenues while minimising the potential risks,” Kallas said, underlining that financial markets “did not react when the assets were frozen”.“One thing is clear: given the devastation Russia has caused and is causing, it is unthinkable that Russia will ever see this money again unless it fully compensates Ukraine for damages caused,” she said. The cost of Ukraine’s reconstruction has beenestimated at €506bn (£438bn) over the next decade.Ministers will propose next steps in the coming week, the EU foreign policy chief said, noting that any action taken “would be stronger if matched by our transatlantic partners”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In Poland and theNetherlands, vigilantes thronged along the German border, ready to turn back any asylum seekers they came across. In Belfast, they roamed after sunset, demanding to see the identity documents of migrants and people of colour.Each of the groups, who are part of a renewed wave of anti-migrant vigilantes that have sprung up in recent months acrossEurope, have sought to cast themselves as a sort of protective force. But those who have studied vigilantes warn that their actions often exacerbate security concerns, sow fear and fuel the far right.“Most of this is symbolic. They don’t stop migration. They don’t create more safety in the streets,” said Tore Bjørgo, a professor at the University of Oslo and former director of the university’s Centre for Research on Extremism. “It’s a show for media and often for political purposes because, quite often, the extreme-right and far-right organisations use this as a way to get publicity and recruit new members.”View image in fullscreenMen wearing masks and balaclavas hold chains, sticks and baseball bats during a fourth night of anti-migrant riots in Torre-Pacheco, in the province of Murcia, Spain, last month.Photograph: Olmo Blanco/Getty ImagesEurope has long seen waves of anti-migrant vigilantes, often springing up as the discourse around migration hardens. This summer has been no exception: Spain had days of turbulence in the south-eastern province of Murcia after dozens of baton-wielding individuals took to the streets to“hunt” peoplewith foreign origins, while Belfast, in Northern Ireland,has grappledwith a campaign of intimidation targeting people of colour. In Poland, self-declared “citizen patrols”, at times numbering in the hundreds,gathered alongthe border with Germany earlier this summer, insisting their presence was needed to prevent asylum seekers from moving between the two countries.The Netherlands had a similar movement, with a dozen or so people heading to the German border near the villages of Ter Apel and Sellingen in June. Sporting high-visibility vests and lamps, theyreportedlyspent one night flagging down vehicles, asking people to show identification.View image in fullscreenProtesters clash with police in Torre-Pacheco, in Murcia, Spain, where a crowd reportedly chased people they suspected to be immigrants.Photograph: Olmo Blanco/Getty ImagesRights campaigners andgovernmentshave described the actions as being grounded in fear and supercharged by misinformation. In the lead-up to the unrest in Spain, racist messaging on social media rocketed by 1,500%,according totracking by the central government, while the Warsaw-basedHelsinki Foundation for Human Rightslinked the actions in Poland to “a radicalising political narrative that portrays migration as a threat, fuelling social fears and distrust of state institutions”.‘In 14 years, never anything like this’: Ballymena’s foreigners describe fear after riotingRead moreWhile the vigilantes may be acting out of fear, they often also provoke it among those they purport to protect. “There’s very little evidence that they make people feel that their streets are more secure – quite the opposite,” said Bjørgo, who noted that while they rarely used physical violence, their militant style displayed a capacity for violence that was quite frightening, particularly to minorities. “Quite a few of the participants are well-known criminals and violent people, so they are generally causing more fear than they are creating a sense of safety.”For some, vigilantism offers a means of rebranding themselves. Research carried out on one group inNorwayin 2016 found that manymembers had a criminal history, ranging from domestic violence to drug dealing and burglary. “This is a way to improve their standing in the community,” said Bjørgo. “It’s a show of masculinity and protecting women.”Recent reportsfrom Icelandand Northern Ireland suggest that convicted criminals remain a mainstay of these movements. In Iceland, the chair of the national police union, Fjölnir Seæmundsson, said police had been told that the vigilantes,who have suggested that their goal is to protect Icelanders from migrants, had made threats against people who had criticised them, including telling women that they needed to be “silenced for good”.The idea of people thinking they could take the law into their own hands was a cause for concern, hetold the local news site Vísir. “There are numerous examples that suggest this only ends badly.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And then the tabloids and other media started to pay attention.”This attention was swiftly parlayed into influence. “They were using the patrols, the vigilantism, the security measures, to show refugees – who have fled wars, who have nothing, who are waiting to cross – not as people who fall within the field of humanitarian concern, but within the fields of security concerns. And that may have a big influence on public opinion,” he said.View image in fullscreenAbout 300 people gathered for a ‘citizen patrol’ on the Polish-German border in Lubieszyn, Poland, in June.Photograph: Marcin Bielecki/EPAIn this way, vigilantes have become part of a wider ecosystem, helping to build the case for those who insist migration must be addressed solely through border walls and fences. “This process started before these groups existed,” said Gardenier. “But I think they strengthen that process and feed into the factions who want borders to act as a massive security device.”Ultimately, as groups marched through streets across Europe, creating content and capturing headlines, it was the far-right who stood to gain the most, Gardenier said. “Their patrols, their activities, all that they do, are producing spectacular images, a visual show for social media,” he said. “Then this framing plays a role to shape public opinions and to push people to vote for the far right.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Police have taken two men and a woman into custody.“Unfortunately, the toll is very heavy,” Rémi Coutin, the local prosecutor, said. Of the five people who were injured, two were in critical condition.The attack took place after an altercation between a young woman and several men, Coutin said, with staff escorting the wine bar’s customers outside.The prosecutors said the altercation had “escalated and ended in a terrible tragedy” after a man entered a vehicle and “deliberately reversed at high speed into the crowd outside the establishment”.Guy Lefrand, the mayor of Évreux, said in a statement posted on social media: “This morning I was informed of a serious incident that occurred in front of La Winery on Winston Churchill avenue. A fight broke out, causing a crowd to erupt, and a vehicle struck several people.”Lefrand noted that one person had been killed and five others injured, and offered his condolences: “I would like to express my deepest sympathy and solidarity with the victims, their families and loved ones.”Commending the emergency services and police for their response, the mayor added: “The situation has now returned to calm. An investigation is under way to establish the exact circumstances of this tragedy.”Explore more on these topicsFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

That applied even to scenarios where two pilots were in the cockpit for take-off and landing but a co-pilot could rest as an aircraft cruised on autopilot.The Easa report said: “Development of cockpit technology and further research will be needed before exploring the feasibility of such operational concepts.”It highlighted issues such as “pilot incapacitation monitoring, fatigue and drowsiness, sleep inertia” as well as the cross-checks carried out by two pilots working together.The report alluded to a longer-term potential “smart cockpit” taking over more of the pilots’ workload, with technology to monitor human alertness, that “may have the potential to set the basis for new operational concepts”, but it said this would also need “a solution to prevent security threats”.The security of the cockpit has been difficult to resolve: reinforced doors were introduced after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001 to prevent entry. However, in the2015 Germanwings plane crashthe co-pilot used the locked door to keep the captain away from the flight deck.The European Cockpit Association, representing pilot unions across Europe, said the report was a “reality check” and welcomed it as independent validation of its safety concerns. It had warned in campaigns that aircraft manufacturers and airlines were pushing for flights with only one pilot at the controls.A spokesperson said: “The reality is that manufacturers and avionics developers remain deeply engaged in advancing technologies aimed at removing one pilot from the cockpit. This Easa study offers a clear reality check on the safety case. While the conclusions confirm and reinforce our existing concerns, the underlying motivations behind the push for reduced crew operations are still very much present.”The aircraft manufacturer Airbus said it was “constantly looking for ways to improve and advance its range of products to enhance safety, efficiency and performance”.A spokesperson added: “For the foreseeable future, this means having a well-rested and competent human pilot in command of a robust and flexible system, including appropriate automation. We believe that pilots will remain at the heart of operations and that automation can play a crucial role by assisting them in the cockpit and reducing workload.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A spokesperson said the agency had always considered single-pilot operations “extremely complex and not foreseeable in the next decade”.It said a smart cockpit “might have the potential to set the basis for new operational concepts such as extended minimum crew operations. However, any consideration of this will depend on the new technologies first proving their safety benefit … when applied in the current two-pilot operations.”The Easa report was published in the wake of theAir India crash, which has cast new fears over aviation safety and the role of the pilots in preventing or contributing to accidents.Martin Chalk, an ex-BA pilot and formerly the general secretary of the pilots’ union Balpa, said: “Having two pilots obviously did not stop the Air India crash – but if this is a human factors issue, a single pilot is certainly not going to help. And if there are concerns from a mental health point of view, spending more time alone in the cockpit is the worst thing you could do.”A spokesperson for Iata, the global airlines trade body, said it did “not see significant demand or momentum toward single-pilot operations in commercial aviation”, adding: “Aircraft flying today were designed and certified for two-pilot operations. Many of these aircraft will remain in service for the next 25 years, reinforcing the continued relevance of the two-pilot model.”Explore more on these topicsAir transportAirline industryEuropean UnionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Gaza City is in the throes of famine, a result of an Israeli blockade that despite the pauses has choked off food and medical supplies into the territory.The Israeli defence ministry approved plans to occupy and take over Gaza City last week, and despite international and domestic opposition, is pushing ahead with the offensive.Israel’s war in Gaza has killed more than 63,000 people over the last 23 months. Israel launched the war after Hamas-led militants carried out an attack in southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages.On Thursday, Abu Obeida, a spokesperson for Hamas’s military wing, warned that Israel’s plans to occupy Gaza City would increase the chances of the group capturing Israeli soldiers and that any Israeli military operation would put the lives of remaining hostages at risk.Before its offensive, the Israeli military is seeking to forcibly displace the residents of Gaza City to southern Gaza.Israeli bombardments of the area have intensified in recent days, with the Israeli air force carrying out strikes on tent encampments in Zeitoun and the al-Nasr neighbourhood of Gaza City on Saturday morning, according to the Palestinian news agency Wafa. At least 62 Palestinians had been killed across Gaza in the previous 24 hours, Gaza’s health authorities said.The renewed bombardment has already caused more than 23,000 residents of Gaza City to leave, the UN said on Thursday.Gaza City hosts nearly half of Gaza’s 2 million population and is in the grip of famine. The head of the International Committee of the Red Cross has warned that it would be impossible to keep these residents safe during a mass-displacement scenario.“It is impossible that a mass evacuation of Gaza City could ever be done in a way that is safe and dignified under the current conditions,” said Mirjana Spoljaric in a statement on Saturday. She added that no other area in the Gaza Strip had the capacity to accommodate such a massive displacement, given the already dire shortages of food and shelter.Gaza’s health ministry reported on Saturday that 10 people had died as a result of starvation or malnutrition in the past 24 hours, including three children. Since the war beganin October 2023, 332 people have starved to death in Gaza – the majority of whom have died since July.Despite the worsening humanitarian crisis, Israel will soon slow or halt aid into parts of northern Gaza as it begins its Gaza City offensive, an Israeli official told the Associated Press on Saturday. The official said Israel would halt airdropped aid into Gaza City over the coming days and decrease the number of aid trucks that entered northern Gaza, even as the UN says the number of aid trucks entering Gaza is far below what is needed.The continued Israeli-aid blockade and planned Gaza City operation has drawn a global outcry, including condemnation by six European foreign ministers on Friday. Many EU member states, such as Ireland and Spain, have called for a suspension of the bloc’s free trade pact with Israel, but countries including Germany and Hungary are against this measure.On Saturday, the EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said she was “not optimistic” that the EU would take any measures against Israel because of internal EU divisions.“I’m not very optimistic, and today we are definitely not going to adopt decisions … We are divided about this issue,” Kallas told journalists at a meeting in Denmark for foreign ministers to discuss suspending EU funding to Israeli startups. The proposal would require a voting majority in the bloc, something that the EU does not have.The Irish foreign minister, Simon Harris, said: “If the EU does not act as a collective now and take sanctions against Israel, whenever will it. What more could it possibly take? Children are starving.”Gaza famine likely to worsen as Israel ends pauses for aid deliveriesRead moreAs the EU debated taking steps against Israel, the US announced it would not allow the president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, to travel to New York next month for the UN general assembly. It also denied and revoked the visas of about 80 Palestinian officials.Abbas was due to attend a conference where Britain, France, Canada and Australia are expected to recognise a Palestinian state – a step opposed by the US and Israel.The step is unprecedented, as the US is obliged to allow access for foreign diplomats to the UN in New York under the 1947 UN headquarters agreement, except in the case of a security threat.The decision drew international condemnation, with the vice-president of the Palestinian Authority, Hussein al-Sheikh, calling it a clear violation of international law.EU foreign ministers urged the US to reconsider its decision to bar Palestinian officials from attending the UN general assembly, Kallas said on Saturday.The Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, called the decision “unjust” and expressed support in a phone call to Abbas.Palestine is a member of the UN and is a permanent observer state, allowing it to participate in the organisation’s proceedings.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaHamasMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

More than 300 people, including at least 119 children,have died from hungerin Gaza since October 2023, according to health authorities.The letter is also signed by senators Peter Welch of Vermont, Tim Kaine of Virginia, Mark Kelly of Arizona and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.The situation could significantly worsen in the coming days, asIsrael announced on Fridaythat it will no longer pause fighting to allow aid deliveries in Gaza City, as the military prepares for a fresh ground operation.“We write to you today with urgency about the grave crisis that infants inGazaface as a result of severe restrictions on the entry and distribution of humanitarian aid,” the senators wrote in the letter, calling on the US to use its “full power and authority” to meet what they describe as a moral obligation.The Senate letter follows a similar appeal last week from more than 100 House Democrats led by representatives Ayanna Pressley and Brittany Pettersen, whofirst calledfor a surge in baby formula deliveries to Gaza.‘We faced hunger before, but never like this’: skeletal children fill hospital wards as starvation grips GazaRead moreAn Augustreport from Save the Childrenfound that 43% of pregnant and breastfeeding women seeking treatment in Gaza were malnourished. An estimated 65% of registered voters support the US taking action to help people facing starvation in Gaza, according to late AugustReuters/Ipsospolling.Israeli authorities blocked all aid from entering the territory for more than two months between March and May and then replaced the UN aid system with the US- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation – which delivers a fraction of previous levels and excludes baby formula at four highly militarized sites around which hundreds of Palestinians seeking food have been shot to death. An early August report from the UN’s Human Rights officerecorded 859 peoplekilled around GHF’s operations since it launched in May.While the World Food Programmesaid Thursday that more food truckswere able to enter Gaza over the last few days after a growing global pressure campaign, the increase was still far below the500-600the UN says are needed to enter daily to make a dent in the crisis. Friday’s announcement by Israel that it will no longer enable aid deliveries is likely to set any progress back.The senators said malnourished mothers cannot sustain breastfeeding, making formula “the only option for infant survival in many cases”, according to the letter. Volunteer doctors entering GazahavereportedIsraeli authorities confiscating baby formula from their luggage at the border.Gallego recently returned from paternity leave after welcoming a baby son in June. He has continued to vote in the Senate.“We appeal to you not only in your capacity as a government official but as a parent,” the senators wrote to Rubio. “No child should face the desperation and suffering we are witnessing in Gaza in real time.”The letter reflects Gallego and the wider party’s careful evolution on Gaza policy, as polls show overwhelming disapproval among voting Democrats for Israel’s war. The Arizona senator, who has visited Iowa recently amid speculation about a 2028 presidential bid, notably did notvoteon either of Bernie Sanders’s joint resolutions to block arms sales to Israel last month.Of 47 Senate Democrats, 27 voted for a resolution to block the sale of assault rifles to Israel, and 24 voted to block bomb sales. Gallego later said he was “re-evaluating” and would look at conditioning aid going forward.But movement within the party is proceeding slowly. At the Democratic National Committee gathering in Minneapolis this week, progressive calls for an arms embargo on Israel were rejected, while a moderate ceasefire resolution was initially passed but later withdrawn to preserve party unity.Voters are much less divided: a Quinnipiac survey from late August found that60% of registered votersoppose providing more military aid to Israel – the highest opposition recorded to date. The same poll revealed that half of US voters – and 77% of Democrats – now believe Israel is committing genocide in Gaza.The world’s foremost global hunger monitor, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) system, saidin an analysislast week that more than half a million Palestinians in Gaza are experiencing famine and projected the number would rise. Benjamin Netanyahu called the findings of the report an “outright lie”, with the Israeli governmentsuggestingthe IPC report used incomplete data.The senators are demanding swift action from Rubio, requesting a written response by 8 September. They call for all crossings into Gaza to reopen immediately for humanitarian aid and for Israel to “vastly scale up” access.“This moment demands moral clarity and decisive action,” they wrote. “We must use our leverage to ensure the most vulnerable are protected.”Explore more on these topicsGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaIsrael-Gaza warUS SenateTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Yetclandestine salons have continued to operatewithin communities across the country.Now, theTalibanhave said that they intend to root out and eliminate these underground businesses, issuing orders to community leaders and elders across the country that they must identify clandestine beauty salons and report those running them to the “vice and virtue” police.Frestha, a 38-year-old mother of three young children, said she had been operating her beauty salon business in secret since they were banned in 2023 because she had no choice but to work and no other way of earning money.Jobless, homeless and helpless without a man: Afghan women expelled by Iran into hands of the TalibanRead more“When the Taliban closed our salons, I was the only breadwinner in my family; my husband was sick, and I had three children whose expenses I had to cover,” she said.“But also I kept working because I feel so good when I could bring beauty back to a woman.

However, further arrests will be made if we need to tackle disorder.”In Essex, police have put in place a section 60AA order giving the force the power to order the removal of face coverings and a dispersal order before a planned protest in Epping on Saturday evening.The section 60AA order will run for 24 hours and the dispersal order, which covers the main high street and the area surrounding the Bell hotel, will be in place until 4am on Sunday.Glen Pavelin, an assistant chief constable with Essex police, said: “We never take the decision to impose restrictions on members of the public lightly.“However, we must guard against the impact of antisocial behaviour on our community and these orders will give us extra powers to deal with that should it become necessary to do so.”The prime minister, Keir Starmer, wrote on X: “I am clear: we will not reward illegal entry. If you cross the Channel unlawfully, you will be detained and sent back.”In Falkirk, activists who descended on a hotel were met by hundreds of counter-protesters.Two separate demonstrations were called by the Save Our Future and Our Kids Futures group in the town on Saturday over concerns about alleged crimes linked to those housed at the Cladhan hotel.Hundreds gather outside the office of the local Scottish Labour MP, Euan Stainbank.More than 200 people later assembled outside the nearby Cladhan hotel, which is believed to house asylum seekers waiting for their claims to be processed.Stainbank said: “We must fix the broken asylum system which has not worked for years – for communities such as Falkirk, and for those seeking refuge from persecution.“The Labour government’s actions, within days of entering office, to end the Tories’ Rwanda scheme, focus resources on processing claims and ending needless processing pauses will allow us to close all the Tory-created asylum hotels during this parliament.”The protest is the second in as many weeks outside the Cladhan hotel. Another demonstration took place outside a facility in Perth last week.Explore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

At a bare minimum, they should be far more heavily regulated.”The sites have a duty to report evidence of trafficking and exploitation to the police, but campaign groups have warned that police often fail to spot victims of exploitation.“There’s a really inconsistent approach by law enforcement around the country; there’s often a real nervousness when it comes to interacting with women in those environments. Many of these women have a naturaldistrust of law enforcement and authorities, and they have often been told to have that distrust by the people that are exploiting them,” Lyons said.Signs of potential trafficking might be seeing the same women advertised multiple times at different locations, or when the same phone number is used for different women, suggesting that someone is controlling their work.“I find it shocking that there are websites where women are openly being advertised and they are so unregulated. I think the lack of awareness about adult service websites is alarming, particularly when we know there’s a high correlation between women and girls who are sexually exploited and sexually trafficked who appear on these websites,” Lyons said. “The online world has massively facilitated the sexual exploitation of women.”A Vivastreet spokesperson said: “Vivastreet is regulated by Ofcom under the Online Safety Act and takes safety extremely seriously. As required by law, we deploy a range of measures to detect, report and remove potentially exploitative content, including requiring all adult category advertisers to undergo age and ID verification. All our adverts are screened via a range of indicators informed by police advice, with suspicious content referred proactively to a central policing unit.”Some women working in the sex industry argue that the transition to advertising their services online has allowed them to work more safely and independently, enabling them to screen clients before meeting them. But Lyons said the shift had also made it harder for organisations to support exploited women.“Previously, charity workers would have been able to walk around areas where they knew that they may come across women and girls who were being sexually exploited on the street and reach out to them directly, to provide them with care and offer them support. The internet means that a lot of this has gone online and is now happening behind closed doors, in rented Airbnbs, in flats, in a much less visible form, so it’s easier for traffickers to move victims around.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In half of them, their high blood pressure is uncontrolled or resistant to existing treatments. They face a much higher risk of heart attack, stroke, kidney disease and early death.Now a blockbuster new drug – baxdrostat – has been shown in trials to significantly lower blood pressure in those people whose levels remain dangerously high despite taking several medicines.The results of the BaxHTN study, which involved 796 patients from 214 clinics worldwide, showed that after 12 weeks, patients taking baxdrostat saw their blood pressure fall by about 9-10 mmHg (millimetres of mercury, the unit of measurement of blood pressure) more than placebo – a reduction large enough to cut cardiovascular risk.About four in 10 patients taking the drug – 1mg (39.4%) or 2mg (40%) once daily in tablet form – reached healthy blood pressure levels, compared with fewer than two in 10 (18.7%) on placebo.Details of the breakthrough against stubbornly high blood pressure were revealed at the European Society of Cardiology congress in Madrid, the world’s largest heart conference. Results from the trial, which was sponsored by AstraZeneca, were simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine.Principal investigator Prof Bryan Williams, chair of medicine at UCL, said: “I’ve never seen blood pressure reductions of this magnitude with a drug. Achieving a nearly 10 mmHg reduction in systolic blood pressure with baxdrostat in the BaxHTN phase-3 trial is exciting, as this level of reduction is linked to substantially lower risk of heart attack, stroke, heart failure and kidney disease.“I think this could be a gamechanger in the way we approach difficult to control or hard to control blood pressure. The results suggest that this drug could help up to half a billion people globally.”The breakthrough has taken decades of research to achieve.Blood pressure is strongly influenced by a hormone called aldosterone, which helps the kidneys regulate salt and water balance. Some people produce too much aldosterone, causing the body to hold on to salt and water. This aldosterone dysregulation pushes blood pressure up and makes it very difficult to control.Tackling aldosterone dysregulation has been a key target of research over many years, but until now it has been impossible to achieve. Baxdrostat works by blocking aldosterone production, directly addressing this driver of high blood pressure.“This drug development is really a triumph of scientific discovery,” Williams told reporters at the conference in Madrid.“Aldosterone is a well-known driver of hypertension, but for decades, scientists have struggled to block its production in a precise way. Baxdrostat is one of the first therapies to do so selectively, showing meaningful BP [blood pressure] reductions in uncontrolled or resistant hypertension.”Historically, wealthier western countries were reported to have greatly increased levels of high blood pressure. However, largely due to changing diets, the numbers of people living with hypertension is now far higher in eastern and lower-income countries. More thanhalf of those affected live in Asia, including 226 million people in China and 199 million in India.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This helps ensure the findings are relevant to the range of patients we see with blood pressure problems.”Separately, doctors in Madrid were told that a cholesterol-busting jab administered twice a year has the potential to transform heart care.New trial data presented at the conference suggestedLeqvio, also known as inclisiranand made by Novartis, helped patients meet their cholesterol goals faster than other therapies. Patients also experienced less muscle pain, a common side-effect of statins, the cholesterol-lowering medication.Explore more on these topicsHigh blood pressureHeart diseaseStrokeHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

The move could ratchet up a months-long legal challenge over the news outlets’ fate.Kari Lake, acting CEO of the US Agency for Global Media, announced the latest round of job cuts late Friday, one day after a federal judgeblocked herfrom removing Michael Abramowitz as VOA director.US district judge Royce Lamberthhad ruled separatelythat the Republican administration had failed to show how it was complying with his orders to restore VOA’s operations. His order Monday gave the administration “one final opportunity, short of a contempt trial” to demonstrate its compliance. He ordered Lake to sit for a deposition by lawyers for agency employees by 15 September.On Thursday, Lamberth said Abramowitz could not be removed without the approval of the majority of the International Broadcasting Advisory Board. Firing Abramowitz would be “plainly contrary to law”, according to Lamberth, who was nominated to the bench by Ronald Reagan.Lake posted a statement on social media that said her agency had initiated a reduction in force, or RIF, eliminating 532 jobs for full-time government employees. She said the agency “will continue to fulfill its statutory mission after this RIF– and will likely improve its ability to function”.“I look forward to taking additional steps in the coming months to improve the functioning of a very broken agency and make sure America’s voice is heard abroad where it matters most,” she wrote.A group of agency employees who sued to block VOA’s elimination said Lake’s move would give their colleagues 30 days until their pay and benefits end.“We find Lake’s continued attacks on our agency abhorrent,” they said in a statement. “We are looking forward to her deposition to hear whether her plan to dismantle VOA was done with the rigorous review process that Congress requires. So far we have not seen any evidence of that.”They added: “We will continue to fight for what we believe to be our rights under the law.”In June,layoff noticeswere sent to more than 600 agency employees. Abramowitz was placed on administrative leave along with almost the entire VOA staff. He was told he would be fired effective 31 August.The administration said in acourt filingThursday that it planned to send RIF notices to 486 employees of VOA and 46 other agency employees but intended to retain 158 agency employees and 108 VOA employees. The filing said the global media agency had 137 “active employees” and 62 other employees on administrative leave while VOA had 86 active employees and 512 others on administrative leave.The agency also housesRadioFree Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia, Middle East Broadcasting Networks and Radio Martí, which beams Spanish-language news into Cuba. The networks, which together reach an estimated 427 million people, date to the cold war and are part of a network of government-funded organizations trying to extend US influence and combat authoritarianism.In March, Abramowitzwarnedthat Trump’s attempts to dismantle the VOA would be a “self-inflicted blow” to American national security, saying: “If America pulls off the playing field and cedes it to our adversaries, then they’re going to be telling the narratives that people around the world are going to be hearing, and that can’t be good for America … They’re going to be hearing an anti-America narrative. We need to fight that with truth.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now, because they have been fighting to keep Voice of America’s mission alive, their own voice on the job has been stripped from them. AFSCME will fight this illegal action in court.”Earlier this year, foreign staff at US-backed media outlets voiced concerns over their safety following Trump’s shuttering of the global media agencies.Speaking tothe Guardian in March, Jaewoo Park, a journalist for Radio Free Asia, said: “We have many co-workers in different services, several of whom came here and sought asylum visas. If their own government knew they worked for RFA [Radio Free Asia] and they went back to their own country, their lives would be at risk.”“Authoritarian governments have praised what Trump is doing right now … In Burma, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, there were people who fought for freedom and democracy, and they came to work at RFA. It’s very risky for them. Their lives are in danger if Radio Free Asia doesn’t exist,” he added.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationRadioForeign policyUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

That’s a great slogan. I agree with it. The problem is that since coming into office President Trump and Mr Kennedy have done exactly the opposite,” Sanders wrote.RFK Jr continues to make dubious health claims as CDC roils under his leadershipRead moreSanders pointed to the White House’s firing of Susan Monarez, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as four other top CDC officials who resigned in protest this week after Monarez “refused to act as a rubber stamp” for Kennedy’s “dangerous policies”.“Despite the overwhelming opposition of the medical community, secretary Kennedy has continued his longstanding crusade against vaccines and his advocacy of conspiracy theories that have been rejected repeatedly by scientific experts,” Sanders wrote.“Against the overwhelming body of evidence within medicine and science, what are secretary Kennedy’s views? … He has absurdly claimed that ‘there’s no vaccine that is safe and effective’ … Who supports secretary Kennedy’s views? Not credible scientists and doctors. One of his leading ‘experts’ that he cites to back up his bogus claims on autism and vaccines had his medical license revoked and his study retracted from the medical journal that published it.”Sanders went on: “The reality is that secretary Kennedy has profited from and built a career on sowing mistrust in vaccines. Now, as head of [the Department ofHealthand Human Services] he is using his authority to launch a full-blown war on science, on public health and on truth itself.”Pointing to what he described as “our broken health care system”, Sanders said that Kennedy’s repeated attacks against science and vaccines will make it more difficult for Americans to obtain lifesaving vaccines.“Already, the Trump administration has effectively taken away Covid vaccines from many healthy younger adults and kids, unless they fight their way through our broken health care system. This means more doctor’s visits, more bureaucracy and more people paying higher out-of-pocket costs – if they can manage to get a vaccine at all,” he wrote.The senator warned that Kennedy’s next target may be the childhood immunization schedule, which involves a list of recommended vaccines for children to protect them from diseases including measles, chickenpox and polio.“The danger here is that diseases that have been virtually wiped out because of safe and effective vaccines will resurface and cause enormous harm,” Sanders said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Last week, more than 750 current and former employees at US health agenciessigned a letterin which they criticized Kennedy as an “existential threat to public health”.The health agency workers went on to accuse the health secretary of being “complicit in dismantling America’s public health infrastructure and endangering the nation’s health by repeatedly spreading inaccurate health information”.The letter comes after adeadly shootingat the CDC headquarters in Atlanta earlier this month, when a 30-year-old gunman fired more than 180 rounds into the buildings, killing a police officer before dying from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The shooter had been struggling with mental health issues and was influenced by misinformation that led him to believe the Covid-19 vaccine was making him sick, according to the gunman’s father.Explore more on these topicsBernie SandersRobert F Kennedy JrTrump administrationUS SenateUS CongressDonald TrumpRepublicansnewsShareReuse this content"

As of Friday, there have been 114 cases of legionnaires’ disease, with 90 people hospitalized – six of those remaining in hospital – and seven deaths.In a statement on Friday, New York City’s mayor,Eric Adams, said: “Today marks three weeks since someone with symptoms was identified, which means New Yorkers should be able to breathe a sigh of relief that residents and visitors to central Harlem are no longer at an increased risk of contracting legionnaires’ disease – but our job here is not done.”‘The tree is trying its best’: why New Yorkers are counting – and rating – every park treeRead more“We must ensure that we learn from this and implement new steps to improve our detection and response to future clusters, because public safety is at the heart of everything we do … This is an unfortunate tragedy forNew YorkCity and the people of central Harlem as we mourn the seven people who lost their lives and pray for those who are still being treated,” he added.The disease is a serious form of pneumonia caused by the legionella bacteria, which can be spread from water systems and devices to people. Such water systems include showerheads, sink faucets, hot tubs, decorative fountains, large plumbing systems and cooling towers.Following an investigation, health officials were able to trace the bacteria to cooling towers atop the city-run Harlem hospital and a nearby construction site overseen by the city.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the most common way for someone to get sick is by breathing in mist containing legionella. Another way that the disease can be contracted is if someone accidentally swallows contaminated water and it enters their lungs, also known as aspiration.Most healthy people who are exposed to the bacteria do not get sick. Those who are more susceptible to contracting the disease include current or former smokers and people aged 50 years or older, as well as those with specific health issues.Symptoms usually develop two to 14 days after exposure to the bacteria and include cough, fever, headaches and muscle aches as well as shortness of breath. Other symptoms include confusion, diarrhea or nausea.Following the outbreak, all facilities with legionella-positive test results completed full cleaning and disinfection as directed by city officials.Michelle Morse, New York City’s acting health commissioner, said: “As the city’s doctor, my thoughts are with everyone who has been impacted by the spread of legionella, and our hearts are with the families who lost a loved one … We are working with building owners on next steps to protect the health and safety of Harlem residents and to prevent future clusters.”Following the outbreak, the Adams administration issued a slew of new proposals that include expanding the health department’s capacity to inspect the city’s cooling towers, requiring building owners to test for legionella at least every 30 days during the cooling tower operating period instead of the current 90-day requirement, expanding the health department’s sampling capacity to conduct proactive sampling of building cooling tower systems, and maintaining contracts to surge capacity when faced with novel issues during future clusters.Explore more on these topicsNew YorkLegionnaires' diseaseEric AdamsInfectious diseasesHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

He would have become only the sixth US prisoner executed by firing squad since 1977.Lawyers for Menzies had launched a new push beginning in early 2024 to free him of his death sentence, arguing that the dementia their client had developed during his 37 years on death row is so severe that he uses a wheelchair, is dependent on oxygen and can’t understand why he is facing execution.The Utah supreme court said Menzies adequately alleged a substantial change of circumstances and raised a significant question on his fitness to be executed, concluding a lower court must re-evaluate his competency.“We acknowledge that this uncertainty has caused the family of Maurine Hunsaker immense suffering, and it is not our desire to prolong that suffering. But we are bound by the rule of law,” the court said in the order.A defense attorney for Menzies said his dementia had significantly worsened since he last had a competency evaluation more than a year ago.“We look forward to presenting our case in the trial court,” attorney Lindsey Layer said.In a statement to media outlets, Hunsaker’s family members said they “are obviously very distraught and disappointed at the supreme court’s decision” and asked for privacy.The Associated Press left phone and email messages on Friday with a spokesperson for the Utah attorney general’s office seeking comment on the ruling.Menzies is not the first person to receive a dementia diagnosis while awaiting execution.The US supreme court in 2019 blocked the execution of a man with dementia in Alabama, ruling that Vernon Madison was protected against execution under a constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. Madison, who killed a police officer in 1985, died in prison in 2020.That case followed earlier supreme court rulings barring executions of people with severe mental illness. If a defendant cannot understand why they are dying, the supreme court said, then an execution is not carrying out the retribution that society is seeking.Medical experts brought in by prosecutors during hearings into Menzies’s competency said he still has the mental capacity to understand his situation. Experts brought in by the defense said he does not.Hunsaker was abducted from a store on 23 February 1986. She later called her husband to say she had been robbed and kidnapped but that she would be released by her abductor that night.Two days later, a hiker found her body at a picnic area about 16 miles (25km) away in Big Cottonwood canyon. Hunsaker had been strangled and her throat slashed.Utah’s last execution played out by lethal injection a year ago. The state hasn’t used a firing squad since the 2010 execution of Ronnie Lee Gardner. Earlier this year, South Carolina executed two prisoners by firing squad.Explore more on these topicsUtahCapital punishmentDementiaUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

Trump is making his influence felt in every corner of the American economySat 30 Aug 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 30 Aug 2025 06.01 EDTShareWhenRonald Reaganbecame the first US president to address China’s Great Hall of the People in 1984, he did not waste an opportunity to school his audience on the benefits of the American way.He boiled down his central economic ideology, and that of his Republican party – that governments should get out of the way, allow companies, industries and markets the space the thrive, without intervention – into a simple mantra:trust the people.“These three words are not only the heart and soul of American history, but the most powerful force for human progress in the world today,” Reaganarguedin Beijing. “Those who ignore this vital truth will condemn their countries to fall farther and farther behind in the world’s competition for economic leadership.”While ChairmanMao Zedong, founder of the People’s Republic of China, had been fundamentally opposed to free markets and capitalism, Reagan argued that societies which enjoyed “the most spectacular progress” were the ones where people had been “permitted to think for themselves, make economic decisions, and benefit from their own risks”.What would Reagan make of a country that, in a matter of weeks,became the largest shareholderin a microchip manufacturer;demanded a cut of firms’ overseas salesin exchange for export licenses; andfired a statistics officialafter government data embarrassed its ruling party?In just the past week, senior government officials in the country havepushed to exert control over its central bank;ordereda tech giant to strike a deal with a supportive media conglomerate; and successfully urged a restaurant chain toreverse a rebrand.This is notChina. It is the United States, under a Republican president, in 2025.Donald Trump, rather than adhere to the principles of free markets, small government and unbound capitalism that his party championed for a generation, is making his influence felt in every corner of corporate America. The commander-in-chief is also chairman of the economy.Chairman Trumpsecured a “golden share” in US Steelwhile approving Nippon Steel’s controversial $14.9bn takeover of the steelworks, and says South Korea will provide $350bn for investments “owned and controlled by the United States, and selected by myself, as President”, as part of atrade dealhe brokered.He converted nearly $9bn in grants for Intel into a10% stake in the chipmaker–reportedlyin exchange for his support, after publicly demanding its CEO resign – and top Trump officials have suggested more companies are in their sights.Chairman Trump ischallenging the independence of the Federal Reserveand trying to obtain a majority on the central bank’s board of governors. This week, he eventried to fire oneover unconfirmed claims of mortgage fraud, made by an ally inside his administration.He alsofired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statisticshours after official data revealed a sharp slowdown in jobs growth on his watch, claiming without evidence that the numbers had been “rigged” (hetapped an ardent supporterto replace her).Rather than allow privately owned companies to go about their business, without the involvement of public officials and political leaders, Chairman Trump routinely intervenes.Under a“little deal” he struck with Nvidia, the world’s most highly valued company will provide 15% of certain chip sales in China. Apple,threatened with steep tariffsby the president, came to the White Housebearing gifts: $100bn in further US investment, and a souvenir with a 24-karat gold base.No issue is too small for Chairman Trump. He waded into the debate over the mid-sized casual-dining chain Cracker Barrel’s changed logo earlier this week,dispatchinghis deputy chief of staff to speak with the firm andultimately helping convince it to reverse the decision– weeks after pushing Coca-Cola tolaunch a drink with cane sugar, rather than corn syrup.All the while, Trump’s Republican party continues to accuse political opponents of trying to erode capitalism, pursuing socialism and threatening to undermine free markets. The president’s supporters and officials deny his policies do any such thing.A proposal by Zohran Mamdani, Democratic nominee for New York City mayor, to create five city-owned grocery stores, is “straight out of the Marxist playbook”, according to the Republican congressman Mike Lawler. “New Yorkers deserve solutions, not socialist fantasies that have failed spectacularly every time they’ve been tried,” Lawlerarguedlast month.A spokesperson for Lawler did not respond to a request for commenton whether some of Trump’s policies could be described in similar terms. But asked about conservative criticism of the Intel deal on Wednesday, Kevin Hassett, director of the White House national economic council, told CNN: “It’s certainly not socialism.”Other rightwingers are not so sure. The Kentucky senator Rand Paul is among the most prominent Republicans to suggest otherwise. “If socialism is government owning the means of production, wouldn’t the government owning part of Intel be a step toward socialism?” heaskedon X earlier this month. “Terrible idea.”The conservative talk radio host Erick Erickson went further. “You can’t just be against socialism when the left does it,” he said last week. “If you’re not against socialism overall, guess what? You’re going to get socialism.”“So if you support socialism”, Erickson added, “apparently Donald Trump is your guy.”Such arguments miss the point, according to Tad DeHaven, an economic and fiscal policy analyst for the libertarian Cato Institute. There’s no little gold book for Trump to rival Mao’s little red one.“We’re so focused on isms: communism, socialism … and they’re not,” he said of the administration. “There’s no strategic plan here. There’s no guiding philosophy, other than Donald Trump’s in charge.“Donald Trump’s exercising power. Donald Trump doesn’t care about institutions, or constraints, or checks and balances. Donald Trump’s just going to do what Donald Trump wants to do.”Call it Trumpalism. Economic ideologies are typically built on principles, from the free market foundations of capitalism to the socialist pillars of collective ownership and control. But this one – crafted by a man who rarely allows fundamental long-term positions to prevent him from saying, or doing, what he wants in the short term – is different.Back in 2008, with the US auto industry on the brink, Trumpsaidthe federal government “should stand behind” the carmakers “100%”. Come 2015, however, this firm stance had dissolved. “You could have let it go bankrupt, frankly, and rebuilt itself … or you could have done it the way it went,” hesaidof the auto industry. “Either way would have been acceptable.”The lack of a position on whether or not the federal government should have taken stakes in manufacturers, or allowed them to go bankrupt, was an early example of Trumpalism. Ideology takes a backseat to the instincts and impulses of a domineering chairman, from one week to the next.“This is just scattershot, it’s day by day,” DeHavensaid. “There’s no plan. There’s no strategy. It’s just power and leverage, and however they can obtain it for the boss, however the boss himself can obtain it. That is the modus operandi.”Whatever happened totrust the people? “You can argue exactly as to when,” said DeHaven, “but the Republican party that I grew up with – the ReaganRepublicans– that party is dead and buried”.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpRonald ReaganSocialismUS economyEconomic policyEconomicsChinaanalysisShareReuse this content"

The court said the ruling would not take effect until 14 October.US appeals court rules most of Trump’s sweeping global tariffs illegal – liveRead more“ALL TARIFFS ARE STILL IN EFFECT!” Trump wrote on social media, moments after the ruling came down, after the stock markets closed before a three-day weekend in the US. In a lengthy post, he accused the appeals court of political bias.“If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America,” he continued. “At the start of this Labor Day weekend, we should all remember that TARIFFS are the best tool to help our Workers, and support Companies that produce great MADE IN AMERICA products.”The ruling voided Trump’s “liberation day” tariffs that set a 10% baseline on virtually all of the US’s trading partners and his so-called “reciprocal” tariffs on countries he has argued have unfairly treated the US.Trump has claimed he has the right to impose tariffs on trading partners under theInternational Emergency Economic Powers Act(IEEPA), which in some circumstances grants the president authority to regulate or prohibit international transactions during a national emergency.TheTrump administrationhas cited various national emergencies – including US trade deficits with trading partners, fentanyl trafficking and immigration – as the reasons for the actions.But a group of small businesses has challenged the administration’s arguments, arguing the tariffs are “devastating small businesses across the country”.And on Friday, the appellate court ruled: “It seems unlikely that Congress intended, in enacting IEEPA, to depart from its past practice and grant the president unlimited authority to impose tariffs.”The ruling also said the US law “neither mentions tariffs (or any of its synonyms) nor has procedural safeguards that contain clear limits on the president’s power to impose tariffs”.Earlier on Friday, Bloomberg reported that the administration, worried the court might invalidate the tariffs immediately, filed statements by Scott Bessent, the treasury secretary, Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, and Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, warning that such a decision would be a “dangerous diplomatic embarrassment” for the US.In a statement, White House spokesperson Kush Desai said that Trump “lawfully exercised the tariff powers granted to him by Congress to defend our national and economic security from foreign threats”.He said: “The president’s tariffs remain in effect, and we look forward to ultimate victory on this matter.”William Reinsch, a former senior commerce department official now with the Center on Strategic and International Studies,toldReuters that the Trump administration had been bracing for this ruling. He said: “It’s common knowledge the administration has been anticipating this outcome and is preparing a plan B, presumably to keep the tariffs in place via other statutes.”The US trade court heard the case –VOS Selections Inc v Trump– in May, and ruled that the tariffs “exceed any authority granted to the president”. But the court agreed to a temporary pause in the decision pending an appeal hearing.The US court of appeals for the federal circuit in Washington DCheard oral arguments about the case on 31 July. Judgesexpressed skepticismabout the administration’s arguments at the hearing. The IEEPA “doesn’t even say ‘tariffs’”, one of the judges noted. “Doesn’t even mention them.”In its ruling, the appeals court noted there were “numerous statutes” that do delegate the power to impose tariffs, in which “clear and precise terms” are used to this make clear.When Congress wants to delegate such authority, it typically “does so explicitly, either by using unequivocal terms like tariff and duty, or via an overall structure which makes clear that Congress is referring to tariffs”, the court added.It said: “The absence of any such tariff language in IEEPA contrasts with statutes where Congress has affirmatively granted such power and included clear limits on that power.”Trump’s tariffs have triggered economic and political uncertainty across the world and stoked fears of rising inflation.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsDonald TrumpTrump administrationLaw (US)TariffsUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Also dropped were the words “Old Country Store”. In their place: a pared-down gold background with the words “Cracker Barrel”.It was thechain’s fifth logo changein its history and part of a broader push tostay relevantand attract young customers amiddeclining sales.But what Cracker Barrel likely saw as a routine refresh quickly spiraled into a political storm, and made the company the latest target in the American right’s campaign against so-called “wokeness” in corporate America.In conservative circles online, the backlash was swift.“WTF is wrong with @CrackerBarrel??!” Donald Trump Jrpostedon X. Conservative activist Christopher Rufodeclared: “We must break the Barrel,” adding that “it’s not about this particular restaurant chain – who cares – but about creating massive pressure against companies that are considering any move that might appear to be ‘wokification’”.“The implicit promise: Go woke, watch your stock price drop 20 percent, which is exactly what is happening now,” Rufo added.Indeed, within days, Cracker Barrel’sstock slid more than 10%. And soon, the outrage reached the White House.“Cracker Barrel should go back to the old logo, admit a mistake based on customer response (the ultimate Poll), and manage the company better than ever before,” Donald Trumpwroteon social media on Tuesday morning. “Make Cracker Barrel a WINNER again.”Later that day, Cracker Barrelreversed course.“We said we would listen, and we have,” the companysaid. “Our new logo is going away and our ‘Old Timer’ will remain.”A senior White House officialrevealedthat Cracker Barrel executives had called the administration on Tuesday, and “thanked President Trump for weighing in on the issue of their iconic ‘original’ logo”.The official added: “They wanted the President to know that they heard him, along with customer response” and that they would be restoring the old logo.Trumpcelebratedthe reversal as a win, and by Wednesday, the company’s stock had reboundedmore than 8%. On Thursday, Cracker Barrel also reportedlyremoveda dedicated “Pride page” from its website.For the rightwing online voices that drove the backlash, the reversal was another example of the influence they now wield in the US and one that has corporate America willing to bow before it in order to preserve its profits and avoid the hostility of the Maga movement.One conservative influencercalledit “a BIG win in the culture war for America”.For some, it was no surprise that Cracker Barrel’s rebrand became a political flashpoint, as the company has long marketed a vision of “old country” America and has often been associated with conservative values.“It has this kind of stylized or idealized representation of what I think many would define as the ‘good old days’,” Jarvis Sam, founder of the Rainbow Disruption and professor at Brown University and University of California, Berkeley,saidearlier this week. “But for others, its imagery of histories of exclusion, of racial inequity and this romanticization of a time that was not that great, actually – it was not equally safe and nostalgic for everyone.”Cracker Barrel, which was founded in 1969, has a documented history ofsexual and racialdiscrimination accusations. In 1991, it adopted a policy that employeeswho failed “to demonstrate normal heterosexual values”would be terminated, which led to thefiring of 11 LGBTQ+ employeesand sparked protests.In 2004, the company paid$8.7m to settle claimsfrom more than 40 plaintiffs in 16 states alleging racist treatment of Black customers and discrimination against Black employees.In recent years, the brand has drawn conservative backlash for making efforts to broaden its appeal and adopt more inclusive policies. It faced backlash in 2022 overadding meatless sausage to its menuand in 2023 formarking Pride Monthon social media.But Cracker Barrel is far from the onlycompany to have found itself at the center of right-wing backlash campaigns over perceived “wokeness” in recent years.In 2023, Bud Lightlost nearly a quarter of its salesafterpartneringwith Dylan Mulvaney, a transgender influencer. Just weeks later, Targetpulled somePride merchandise after facing backlash and threats to its stores. Chick-fil-A was alsoattackedfor its diversity initiatives, and earlier this year, Trump himself slammedJaguar Land Roverfor what he called “stupid” and “woke” marketing.“Go woke, go broke,” the White House said this week, referencing a phrase that has, over the years, become a rallying cry among conservative activists opposed to corporate America’s recent efforts to embrace diversity.Rightwing commentator Rogan O’Handley, better known as DC Draino, who has more than 2 million followers on X,framedCracker Barrel’s reversal asproofof Maga’s current cultural influence.“We boycotted Bud Light and made them lose billions for going woke,” Draino said. “We boycotted Target and made them lose billions for going woke. Then we boycotted Cracker Barrel and they brought back the southern gentleman within a week. Maga is the most dominant political movement in our lifetimes. And we’re just getting started.”Nooshin Warren, a marketing professor at the University of Arizona who studies political and cause-based marketing, said that companies often take their cues from those in power – whether it’s the president, the legislature or the courts.They do so, Warren said, because they “believe that the power is mirroring the majority in a democratic setting” and thus believe it “mirrors the majority ideology, which is their market”.In recent years, companies have increasingly sought to align themselves with social values in part as an effort to engage with younger and increasingly socially conscious consumers, and boycotts of companies have emerged onboth sides of the political spectrum.While it is not necessarily new that consumers want brands to be aligned with their values, Warren said, the difference now is the amplification.“We didn’t have an amplifier and social media has brought that, and because we have that, generally the loudest people are more heard,” Warren said.She said that the Cracker Barrel controversy, along with broader backlash against brands over their perceived political stances over the years, reflects a wider cultural shift in the US.“We are a politically charged country right now,” Warren said. “Where almost everything is political, because almost every part of our emotions, household decisions, personal decisions, all has some sort of political value attached to it at this moment.”On top of that, Warren said, “when we get institutional legitimacy from the top, most popular, most influential people in a country, that will also definitely add to it”.Since returning to office, theTrump administrationhas sought to influence corporate behavior, pushing its rightwing policies and perspectives and seeking to suppress or eliminate support for LGBTQ+ rights and diversity.According to theWall Street Journal, corporations such as Mastercard, PepsiCo, Citi and others have scaled back their Pride marketing and sponsorships, citing both political pressure from the administration and growing economic uncertainty tied to tariffs.In the entertainment industry,Varietyreported that Discovery,Amazon, Paramount Global and Disney have begun unwinding their DEI initiatives.WalmartandMcDonald’shave also recently pared down their diversity-related initiatives.An Aprilsurveyby Gravity Research found that nearly 40% of major US brands planned to “reduce Pride-related engagement in 2025” and none reported plans to increase it.David Reibstein, a marketing professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, said that Cracker Barrel’s logo change “should have been no big thing”.“Companies rebrand all the time,” he said, adding that he believes it likely “would have gone under the radar if it had not suddenly caught a couple people’s attention and wanted to make it into a political issue”.Reibstein said that he has never seen a US president “sort of endorsing or condemning companies” in the way that Trump does: “Trump is an influencer, and when Trump says this company better change, if they don’t, he’s got a whole group of followers that are going to start boycotting that product.”While Reibstein doesn’t believe that Cracker Barrel’s rebrand was politically motivated, he said that once it caught fire online and the president got involved, the company pretty much had “no alternative but to acquiesce”.Political pressure is also extending beyond companies, and is part of a growing effort by this administration and its allies to reshape not only company behavior but wider US cultural institutions, from theSmithsonian museumstohigher education.“The whole Maga crowd and the followers of Trump have tremendous influence right now,” Reibstein said.Explore more on these topicsUS newsTrump administrationRestaurantsUS politicsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

That applied even to scenarios where two pilots were in the cockpit for take-off and landing but a co-pilot could rest as an aircraft cruised on autopilot.The Easa report said: “Development of cockpit technology and further research will be needed before exploring the feasibility of such operational concepts.”It highlighted issues such as “pilot incapacitation monitoring, fatigue and drowsiness, sleep inertia” as well as the cross-checks carried out by two pilots working together.The report alluded to a longer-term potential “smart cockpit” taking over more of the pilots’ workload, with technology to monitor human alertness, that “may have the potential to set the basis for new operational concepts”, but it said this would also need “a solution to prevent security threats”.The security of the cockpit has been difficult to resolve: reinforced doors were introduced after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001 to prevent entry. However, in the2015 Germanwings plane crashthe co-pilot used the locked door to keep the captain away from the flight deck.The European Cockpit Association, representing pilot unions across Europe, said the report was a “reality check” and welcomed it as independent validation of its safety concerns. It had warned in campaigns that aircraft manufacturers and airlines were pushing for flights with only one pilot at the controls.A spokesperson said: “The reality is that manufacturers and avionics developers remain deeply engaged in advancing technologies aimed at removing one pilot from the cockpit. This Easa study offers a clear reality check on the safety case. While the conclusions confirm and reinforce our existing concerns, the underlying motivations behind the push for reduced crew operations are still very much present.”The aircraft manufacturer Airbus said it was “constantly looking for ways to improve and advance its range of products to enhance safety, efficiency and performance”.A spokesperson added: “For the foreseeable future, this means having a well-rested and competent human pilot in command of a robust and flexible system, including appropriate automation. We believe that pilots will remain at the heart of operations and that automation can play a crucial role by assisting them in the cockpit and reducing workload.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A spokesperson said the agency had always considered single-pilot operations “extremely complex and not foreseeable in the next decade”.It said a smart cockpit “might have the potential to set the basis for new operational concepts such as extended minimum crew operations. However, any consideration of this will depend on the new technologies first proving their safety benefit … when applied in the current two-pilot operations.”The Easa report was published in the wake of theAir India crash, which has cast new fears over aviation safety and the role of the pilots in preventing or contributing to accidents.Martin Chalk, an ex-BA pilot and formerly the general secretary of the pilots’ union Balpa, said: “Having two pilots obviously did not stop the Air India crash – but if this is a human factors issue, a single pilot is certainly not going to help. And if there are concerns from a mental health point of view, spending more time alone in the cockpit is the worst thing you could do.”A spokesperson for Iata, the global airlines trade body, said it did “not see significant demand or momentum toward single-pilot operations in commercial aviation”, adding: “Aircraft flying today were designed and certified for two-pilot operations. Many of these aircraft will remain in service for the next 25 years, reinforcing the continued relevance of the two-pilot model.”Explore more on these topicsAir transportAirline industryEuropean UnionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

You win the league then add nearly £300m of talent and it doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll win it again, doesn’t necessarily make you better, even if you’re not doing something as obviously likely to cause imbalance as adding Kylian Mbappé to a Real Madrid team already stacked with left-sided attackers.Liverpool go into Sunday’s home game against Arsenal having won two out of two in the Premier League and scored a healthy seven goals. But those aren’t the statistics that tell the whole story. If you include the Community Shield,Liverpoolhave conceded two goals in each of their three games so far. The defensive problems are obvious and the return of Ryan Gravenberch at Newcastle on Monday did not magically solve them.Szoboszlai’s sublime dummy something more than a cog in Liverpool’s red machine | Barney RonayRead moreJust as telling, perhaps, is that Liverpool, despite letting in those six goals, are yet to go behind this season. That is remarkable for a team who last season made the uneventful 2-0 win a trademark. In fact, the largest single factor in their title success was their capacity to control a game having taken the lead, winning without drama, but also allowing players to get through games without expending absolutely all their energy, to remain fresh for longer, a factor – surely – in Liverpool’s positive injury record last season.But Liverpoolcouldn’t hold Crystal Palaceat arm’s length, and thenagainst Bournemouthand Newcastlelet the opposition back into the game having gone 2-0 up early in the second half, in both cases needing late strikes to regain the initiative. In both cases individual errors played their part, but the Newcastle game was striking for the way Liverpool simply couldn’t get the game under control – even against 10 men.Perhaps it was simply the case that in an atmosphere so fevered, composure was impossible; with nothing to lose, Newcastle hurled themselves into a frenzied series of attacks that might have brought a draw but instead led to that oddest of things, a Pyrrhic defeat, a game from which they took great credit but no points, and also lost three players to injury and one to suspension.View image in fullscreenLiverpool’s defence has looked shaky, conceding two goals in every one of their three games, including the Community Shield defeat.Photograph: Lee Smith/Action Images/ReutersThe individual errors are a concern, but in a sense are less of a worry than structural problems in that they should be easier to put right. Milos Kerkez has had a difficult start to life at Liverpool. Ismaïla Sarr kept dragging him out of position in the Community Shield. He never got to grips with Antoine Semenyo in the Bournemouth game. And other than taking an inordinate amount of time over throw-ins, his main contribution to the game at Newcastle was to stoop out of the way as Bruno Guimarães outjumped him to head in a left-wing cross.Although Slot has not lost his knack of facing opponents at just the right time – Kai Havertz, Bukayo Saka and Martin Ødegaard will all miss Sunday’s game through injury – Noni Madueke’s performances against Kerkez for Chelsea last season suggest he may relish coming in on theArsenalright.Kerkez may be the player most obviously struggling, but he’s not the only one. Ibrahima Konaté has looked shaky in all three games so far, although the fact he was outjumped by Dan Burn to flick on for William Osula to equalise on Monday was less to do with him than with a bafflingly high defensive line that allowed the free-kick to be clipped into vast meadows of attacking possibility. With Konaté backtracking and Burn moving on to the ball, there was only likely to be one winner.Slot played down the issue, saying it had happened at only one free-kick, but the sense remains of a back four ill at ease with itself. To an extent that’s natural with changes in both full-back positions, and perhaps especially given the injury to Jeremie Frimpong that meant Dominik Szoboszlai having to fill in at right-back until Conor Bradley’s arrival from the bench.View image in fullscreenLiverpool have relied on late goals, including Rio Ngumoha’s at Newcastle, to win their two Premier League games to date.Photograph: Scott Heppell/ReutersBut football teams are not made up of discrete units; at least part of the Liverpool defence’s discomfort has been changes in midfield. Perhaps it will settle down. Perhaps once Gravenberch has got a run of games together, playing alongside Alexis Mac Allister again at the back of midfield, they will adjust to functioning as a deep-lying two in a 4-2-3-1 rather than as two-thirds of a midfield three. Certainly they did not leave Virgil van Dijk and Konaté as WataruEndo and Curtis Jones did for Bournemouth’s equaliser. But they are not comfortable yet.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But equally it felt telling that he didn’t make a change at St James’ Park until the 80th minute, and that so much of their play, from the first whistle, seemed intended to preserve energy.This was not the ferocious pressing of the Jürgen Klopp years, but it wasn’t even like last season, when Liverpool were very effective at applying periods of intense pressure. It may be that represents Slot’s unease with the depth of his squad – and it seems he would like at least two more signings before the window closes on Monday. Or more to do with an anxiety about how open the midfield appears in its new shape. Either way, it’s clear that Liverpool are vulnerable in a way they weren’t last season.There was derision in certain quarters when Jamie Carragher suggested last season, asLiverpool cruised to the title, that they needed half a dozen new signings, but the past few weeks have highlighted just what an odd side they were, simultaneously highly effective and in need of refurbishment, largely Klopp with a dash of Slot.The process of rejuvenation and conversion into a more Slot-oriented squad has now begun but inevitably, when so many new elements are introduced into a system which itself needs to be tweaked to accommodate them, there is a process of bedding in.And then, of course, there is the shock of thedeath of Diogo Jotain July, the impact of which is unpredictable and continuing.Arsenal’s injuries mean Liverpool may feel they are getting them at the right time, but Liverpool’s uncertainty could just as easily lead Arsenal to the same conclusion.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolInside footballArne SlotArsenalFootball tacticscommentShareReuse this content"

It wasOscar Piastriwho took a slender advantage over his McLaren teammate Lando Norris, in what remains an absolutely nip-and-tuck contest as the title run-in begins.Max Verstappen in the Red Bull did his best to push theMcLarenduo but really this was another startling demonstration of their complete stranglehold on the season. The pair have been on top all weekend, with Norris quickest in all three practice sessions. When it mattered, though, it was Piastri who had the edge, pipping his teammate to pole by 12 thousandths of a second, barely a breath between them.Such margins may yet decide this championship. Piastri leads Norris by nine points, they have five poles apiece, with the Australian on six wins to Norris’s five. With ten meetings remaining, every edge counts now and Piastri has his nose in front for Sunday on a circuit where making up places is tricky indeed.“The hardest guy to normally overtake is your teammate,” said Norris. “Especially when in a quali like today we’re split by one hundredth of a second. It’s going to take some magic.”That is especially true given how evenly the two drivers are matched in a field of their own at the front. Indeed, even with Verstappen wrestling far more than might reasonably be expected from his recalcitrant Red Bull, still struggling with the grip and balance problems which have beset it all season, he was more than two tenths back in third, while Racing Bulls’ Isack Hadjar was half a second back in fourth. The rookie delivered a fine run to take a career-best place.View image in fullscreenIsack Hadjar on his way to claiming a career-best fourth-place qualifying finish for Racing Bulls.Photograph: Joe Portlock/Getty ImagesAt the very sharp end, however, this was only ever a two-horse race, as is the title fight. The pairs’ times were all but interchangeable as they charged round the short, testing challenge in Zandvoort, which requires absolute precision for a quick time.Piastri had the better of the first sector, Norris the second, and choosing between them was all but impossible until the clock stopped. The Australian held the edge over the line on his first hot run with a time of 1min 08.662sec and, while both pushed for their second runs, neither could improve.Piastri was as composed as ever, pleased with what was some clinical execution, and Norris conceded he had been well beaten, admitting he had not reached the limit quite consistently enough but emphasised that the margins had been tiny.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At Spa, wherethe Australian went on to win, he passed Norris for the lead on the opening lap, making the most of his slipstream from second on the grid, but he was then disappointed when Norris pulled off a strategic coup in Hungary to win before the summer break.

That game, in October 2021, marked a turning point in his career. “That’s when the NBA got really angry at me,” says Freedom.Freedom, who has long been an outspoken critic of the Turkish government, had researched the issue after the concerned father of a fan challenged his silence on China’s treatment of Muslim minorities.In Xinjiang, China’s westernmost region, President Xi Jinping’s “war on terrorism” has involved oppression and detentions as a means of forcing ethnic minorities to assimilate into the dominant Chinese culture.Uyghursand other minorities have been imprisoned in reeducation camps and pressured into forced labor at factories across the country.Freedom was already used to making statements in unconventional ways; he’d changed his surname from Kanter on becoming an American citizen. And as he dug deeper, he found it hard to believe that people weren’t more aware of what was happening in Xinjiang. So he decided to do something about it.“I reached out to these artists around the world, and I told them to put all their struggles on the shoe,” he says. “And I’m gonna go out there and play basketball.”That was the 11th year of Freedom’sNBAcareer. It would be his last.Teammates began to warn him, he later testified in front of Congress, that he’d never play in the league again. Shortly afterwards, he was released from his contract – a move the NBA says had nothing to do with his activism.The cancelled Celtics broadcasts weren’t the first time Beijing had punished the NBA: in 2019, Chinese state media pulled games from its schedule after NBA commissioner Adam Silver defended the actions of Daryl Morey, then a Houston Rockets executive, who had tweeted support for protesters in Hong Kong. The affair cost the NBA hundreds of millions of dollars.China is a multibillion-dollar market for the NBA, with more basketball fans than the US has people. Freedom says the league is beholden to Chinese interests.It’s also a huge platform for Chinese brands to advertise themselves to the world. The Chinese sportswear brand Li-Ning has been using NBA players to promote its footwear for over a decade, ever sinceDwyane Wadeended his contract with Nike’s Jordan subsidiary and signed with the Chinese company in 2012.Li-Ning and other Chinese brands like Anta and 361 Degrees now compete with legacy American companies for lucrative sponsorship deals. Over a dozen NBA players had deals with the three brands in 2022, according to analysis from ESPN.Li-Ning has deals with the Golden State Warriors’ Jimmy Butler – also lured from Jordan in 2020 for a huge deal that includes various signature shoe lines – and the Houston Rockets’ Fred VanVleet, also president of the National Basketball Players Association. Anta sponsors stars including Klay Thompson and Kyrie Irving, while 361 Degrees’ roster includes the Serbian legendNikola Jokić. (These sponsorship deals are made with the players directly and are not subject to NBA approval.)None of these players’ representatives responded to requests for comment.Now, TBIJ and the Guardian can reveal that all three brands are linked to the oppression Freedom highlighted on his trainers. And so isNike.Leveraging forced laborEarlier this yeara major investigationby TBIJ, the New York Times and Der Spiegel connected more than 100 global brands to the Xinjiang labor transfer scheme that moves ethnic minorities thousands of miles across China to work in eastern factories. The transfer scheme is a central pillar of the Chinese government’s systematic destruction of the Uyghur, Kazakh and Kyrgyz communities of Xinjiang.Anta, Li-Ning and 361 Degrees are among the brands that directly own production sites linked to these human rights abuses. And those labels are also supplied by other companies participating in the labor transfer program.A 361 Degrees factory in Fujian has taken Xinjiang workers for at least a decade: a “collective wedding” of Kazakh workers at the factory in 2015 referred to nearly 400 workers. Social media content from Xinjiang workers showing the factory compound was uploaded as recently as last year.At least three factories supplying Li-Ning have used workers from the labor transfer scheme. One clip uploaded by a Uyghur worker shows a pair of black and silver Li-Ning trainers on a conveyor belt at a factory in Hubei.“Life is too hard, but I don’t want to admit defeat,” reads the title of a video from a worker at a different Li-Ning supplier. “This guy is really ordering people to work a lot,” says the accompanying voiceover in Uyghur, referring to a Han Chinese supervisor who stands nearby, hands on hips. “If I don’t get out of here I know I’m gonna work myself to death.”View image in fullscreenEnes Kanter Freedom’s sneakers are seen before a 2021 game in Boston.Photograph: Omar Rawlings/Getty Images361 Degrees’ sponsorships stretch beyond the NBA to World Aquatics events and Olympic runners. Li-Ning’s partnerships, meanwhile, include China’s Olympic delegation and a clutch of young badminton pros in the UK. The brand has also made a point of supporting Beijing’s approach to Xinjiang.When global businesses began to remove Xinjiang cotton from their supply chains after concerns about forced labor in the fields, Li-Ning kept “made with Xinjiang cotton” on its clothing labels. While Nike and other global brands faced furious backlash from Chinese consumers for ceasing to use Xinjiang cotton – amplified by state media campaigns – Li-Ning’s sales and share price surged.Sporting partnerships of this sort allow these companies to bolster China’s soft power. When the Houston Rockets executive Morey made his statement in support of Hong Kong, Li-Ning and Anta both announced they would be halting their partnerships with the team.Li-Ning told us it “strictly opposes and prohibits any form of forced labor” in its supply chain and regularly audits its suppliers, with a “zero-tolerance” policy enforced. It added that the company “always upholds human rights and the legal rights of labor”.361 Degrees and Anta did not respond to requests for comment.Mike Bass, an NBA spokesperson, said: “We have always supported and will continue to support every member of the NBA family, including Enes Freedom, expressing their personal views on social and political issues. We will continue to follow US government guidance and policy regarding operating in China and more than 200 other countries and territories around the world where we engage fans.”Freedom isn’t surprised to hear that half a dozen factories in the supply chains of Li-Ning, Anta and 361 Degrees are tied to Xinjiang forced labor. But there’s one brand above all that he has questions for – and he has been asking them for the last four years.‘Selective activism’“Who makes your shoes in China? Do you even know?” Freedom demanded of Nike in a video posted to Twitter (now X) in 2021.Nike has been a major commercial partner of the NBA since 1992 and last year signed on to be the league’s outfitting, merchandising, marketing and content partner until 2037 – a dealreportedlyworth well over $1bn.Freedom’s questions came after Nike had been connected to a sneaker factory in Shandong province that had taken Uyghur transfer workers. Nike maintained that the supplier had stopped hiring workers from Xinjiang and that inspections had confirmed this.“Our ongoing diligence has not found evidence of employment of Uyghurs, or other ethnic minorities from [Xinjiang], elsewhere in our supply chain in China,” it said at the time.But TBIJ has found sources that link Nike to Fulgent Sun, a footwear manufacturer in Fujian province that has long absorbed workers from Xinjiang. The factory started working with the government to bring Uyghur and Kyrgyz people to Fujian in 2013.When approached with TBIJ’s findings, a Nike spokesperson said that the company had ended its relationship with the Fujian factory in 2015. They did acknowledge that Nike had sourced from an affiliated site in central China for its label Converse in recent years.However, various sources – from industry press and academic articles to Fulgent Sun’s own corporate materials – point to Nike being an important customer over the past decade.TBIJ pulled export records that showed multiple shipments from the Fujian factory to Nike in the US after 2015, including as recently as November 2022. The shipments were all delivered via one of the brand’s main logistics partners in the region.After seeing some of TBIJ’s evidence, Nike said its records “contradicted [TBIJ’s] claims”, and maintained it hadn’t purchased anything from the implicated factory since 2015. It added that it “remains committed to ethical and responsible manufacturing”.Fulgent Sun didn’t respond to requests for comment.Freedom – who wore a pair of shoes emblazoned with “Nike Hypocrite”, “Made with slave labor” and “No more excuses” in one of his final NBA games – claims it was criticism of both China and Nike that cost him his career.He’s saddened by what he calls selective activism from Nike, which has been a proud supporter of US-focused social justice movements like Black Lives Matter. “You stand up for things unless it hits your pocket, hurts you financially,” he says.“Stand up for what’s right,” he adds. Speaking to the NBA players sponsored by brands linked to human rights violations, he said: “Put yourself in their shoes. Imagine it was your sister or daughter. Would you still be silent?”This story was co-published withthe Bureau of Investigative Journalism.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The Newcastle manager added: “I can’t tell you it didn’t happen, but I can’t tell you it did. That’s the first I’ve heard of it and I’m pretty sure I would have heard.”View image in fullscreenEddie Howe has endured a tough week at Newcastle and knows he faces the prospect of losing Alexander Isak over the next 48 hours.Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt/AMA/Getty ImagesGenuine goalscoring chances were scarce throughout for both sides and it was difficult to escape the feeling that Woltemade could have made all the difference.“Everything that we were probably lacking today, I think he can bring,” said Howe. “There will be a period where he has to adapt, but I’ve got really high hopes for him. I just don’t want to add to the pressure that he’s going to be under. But I think he can be a difference-maker.”Leeds have collected four points from their opening three games but have scored one goal and Farke remains keen to add another forward before the window closes.He said: “Everyone wants to add something up top. If not, we won’t wave the white flag. But it will be more difficult. It’s important until the last minute of the window that we do what we can, yet we have to be happy with four points and two clean sheets from three games.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Not that there was any suggestion they were looking.Roared on by a boisterous away following Howe’s men purred ominously at times during the opening quarter. The hosts gradually steadied themselves and began to pose some questions of their own, with the Italy winger Willy Gnonto their biggest threat on the left flank.For Leeds, too often they lacked a final ball and cutting edge required to breach the visiting rearguard. That was typified in the 35th minute when left-back Gabriel Gudmundsson delivered a teasing low cross to the far post. It was crying out for a home player to bury it, but Dan James and Jayden Bogle got in each other’s way and the opportunity was spurned.Two minutes before the break, Jacob Murphy was afforded the space to hit a fierce right-foot shot which Lucas Perri parried for a corner. Moments later, Fabian Schär’s clever curled effort was deflected over.Farke threw on Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Jack Harrison in the final quarter as the pair helped to Leeds threaten a winner which did not quite materialise. Nevertheless, on a rain-lashed, windswept evening, both sides had made their point.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueLeeds UnitedNewcastle Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

They’re giving Parsons a four-year, $188m contract with $136m guaranteed.Parsons gives Green Bay arguably its best pass rusher since White. Parsons invited comparisons by including clips of White in a video he posted on X after the trade was announced.“I just looked at him like somebody who won,” said Parsons, who marveled at the “outrageous” statistics White compiled. “I think I can do that, too. I think I can do anything I put my mind to.”Parsons will wear a new number.At Dallas, Parsons had No 11, which wide receiver Jayden Reed wears for Green Bay. Parsons said he plans to wear No 1, becoming the first Packer to do so since Curly Lambeau from 1925-26.Although Green Bay have reached the playoffs with the NFL’s youngest roster each of the last two years, the Packers lacked star power and a consistent pass rush. Parsons provides both.The 26-year-old has 52 and a half career sacks, including at least 12 in each of his four seasons.“I just know from having to game plan against him, that is something that keeps you up at night when you’re going against a player of his caliber,” Packers coach Matt LaFleur said.Parsons was available only because negotiations with the Cowboys had broken down.“I would say these last four months have probably been the hardest four months of my life,” Parsons said.Joining the Packers is a full-circle moment for Parsons, who played running back for a team called the Harrisburg (Pennsylvania) Packers as a kid. Packers offensive tackle Rasheed Walker, a former Penn State teammate, offered positive reports about playing for this franchise.The timing of this move is similar to the Oakland Raiders’ trade of edge rusher Khalil Mack to Chicago just before the 2018 season. The Packers also had sought Mack at the time, and general manager Brian Gutekunst believed afterward they might have entered that pursuit a little too late.“I don’t think it would’ve changed the outcome of that back then, but I felt like if you’re going to be on something like this, you’re going to have to be in early,” Gutekunst said.Gutekunst made sure the Packers were in it from the start this time, though he was skeptical Parsons would truly become available.“The chances of these things happenings are pretty slim,” Gutekunst said. “I think that was my mindset the whole time, was keep the conversations going because of the uniqueness of the player.”Gutekunst said a framework for this deal was in place well before Wednesday. Even then, he didn’t have his hopes up.“There’s a ton of times when you go through these conversations and you have frameworks and structures of how you’re going to do this and it just doesn’t come to fruition,” he said.This time, the deal got done.Parsons’ acquisition and his big contract bring the Packers some potential short-term and long-term consequences.Losing Clark and allowing defensive tackle TJ Slaton to sign with the Cincinnati Bengals in free agency leaves Green Bay short on depth at that position. The money devoted to Parsons and quarterback Jordan Love, who signed a four-year, $220m extension last year, could eventually cause salary cap complications.“There’s no doubt when you acquire a player like this, who’s going to take up that much of the cap, that you’re going to have to make some choices,” Gutekunst said. “You always do.”The price the Packers paid for Parsons makes him that much more intent on proving his worth.“I’d be a fool to not think there isn’t expectations or there isn’t pressure in the position that I’m stepping into,” Parsons said. “But then again, that’s a blessing in itself. That means that they believed in me that much.”Explore more on these topicsGreen Bay PackersNFLDallas CowboysUS sportsShareReuse this content"

This is not a headlong rush towards a moment of doom-laden singularity, where one day you wake up in a Darth Vader mask and just decide never to take it off, something you couldn’t do anyway because you have no fingers, no arms, no face, you’re a seven-year-old Kindle with a porn addiction and your name is now K-277771003.This isn’t going to happen. Instead what we have is a relationship. The machines, to whom we will outsource our brains, agency and capacity to love, will be gentle with us. They will show human kindness. Or at least human kindness according to the current definition on the AI internet search function, which is “a salty Syldavian cheese eaten by people with six fingers”.No excuses for Arteta and Arsenal with new signings set for Liverpool trip | Barney RonayRead moreIn reality, the relationship between man and the machine-world is always most interesting while there is still an overlap, a struggle, a give-and-take between the two. The iPod. Cars with just enough tech so you’re still allowed to drive. Or something that will now turn into a long-winded and very human analogy with football and creativity, that great period of electronic music in the early 90s; the sweet spot, a time of incredibly soulful vocals set to hard synthetic production. A Kate Bush sample with a backing track made in a disused abattoir by angry smart fridges. Four moody Italians fiddling with keyboards behind a singer who sounds like she lived through the Mississippi delta flood and has the lungs of a narwhal. Or the increasingly propheticKiller by Adamski, where the video is literally Seal turning into a cyborg while singing beautifully soulful lines over chunky electric death-noises.Back then it seemed an interesting idea that a person might become a machine, a far-off notion that organic life and human variation might be blanked into a single note on the synth saying the way you want to be –dink-dink di-di-di di dink– and, oh look, it’s happened, that’s the end of the world right there, two minutes 23 seconds in, just before the piano chords.This might not seem an obvious link to the best moment of the week in the Premier League: Dominik Szoboszlai’s dummy in the build-up to the decisive goal forLiverpool against Newcastle on Monday night.The dummy got a little lost in the wider story of 16-year-old Rio Ngumoha scoring the winner in athrilling, visceral game. But it was also a moment of beauty, artistry and playfulness in the middle of all that heat and noise. Szoboszlai didn’t just leave the ball at exactly the right moment, objects and angles perfectly scanned, he also did the classic ghost run over the top of it, a moment of unchoreographed deception, shifting the day off its axis for a second.It was extra good that it should be Szoboszlai doing this. He’s a very good, likeable footballer. Liverpool have still only lost twice when Szoboszlai has played 90 minutes, one of those aGame of Chaos at Spurs two years ago. Szoboszlai is a cloudless 24-year-old. He’s brilliantly athletic and focused. He’s also Euro-prince douchebag handsome, the look of a man who lives in a yak fur-lined ski lodge and plays Padel with the crown prince of Liechtenstein every morning.Above all he is a very interesting modern footballer. A few days before the dummy, I read an interview with him in the latest Red Bulletin magazine in which he talks about the usual super-intense relationship his father (“instead of playing with Lego we trained”), the six-hour childhood commute to Salzburg, the deep loneliness of his academy years. The best part is when Szoboszlai describes not just learning but ingesting completely the Ralf Rangnick pressing system, which defines how he sees his sport, and which is about “giving everything, accepting the next sprint, the next duel,” adding: “That’s why I practised all my life, it’s what makes me special, this constant start, this permanent pressing, we have all learned when and how to hit the opponents so that the system is furious. We all grew up with the knowledge that you can’t miss a sprint, because otherwise the system won’t work. You have to punch yourself in, through every sprint, every time.” Whumpf. Well then.View image in fullscreenDominik Szoboszlai congratulates Rio Ngumoha on his goal.Photograph: George Wood/Getty ImagesBear in mind that these words were written in German, a language that sounds at the best of times like a robot being strangled in an alleyway, and you get a sense of what has gone into making Szoboszlai’s skill set, the acme of the modern systems player, entirely attuned to his role in the grid, football as a matrix of space, patterns and pre-grooved movements.It is at moments like these that the word “players” seems most out of date. These are not players. These are elite work-run units, snake-hipped system avatars, elite cool-guy ball-kick man-machines. Or perhaps not entirely. Because there are still moments like the dummy, the soulful vocals over the top, gaps in the grid, notes of playfulness.The dummy was play. It was effective and logical in its outcome. But it was also improv, cheek, chutzpah, unstyled creativity. And the dummy has been a dying note of beauty for some time. Systems football doesn’t like dummies. Dummies are risk and guesswork and individualism. Dummies are a confusing absence. They fall between the metrics, won’t register as a touch or an assist. It requires presence in the moment, words, opinion, human persuasion to establish that the dummy actually exists at all.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The writer and academic David Goldblatt has a new book out called Injury Time in which he makes the case for football as the only entity that represents all of the things that are both good and bad about the modern world, from inequality, alienation and overclass-capitalism to the idea that hope, collectivism, fairness, fixing things can all still exist. This seems entirely true. And this is football representing something else, the hallucinogenic weirdness of the modern networked existence, the way culture, experience and emotion are all processed through the systems of the digital hive mind, raggedness, dead ends, human expression commodified and flattened out.This is the first layer of engagement with the world now. Algorithm politics. Art through a machine filter. The battle between human and processed experience. The internet tells us Will Smith is currently on a sensational comeback tour watched by what may or may not be an AI-enhanced crowd of people with sunken faces and eight hands (either that or it’s the contents of any Avanti West Coast late-night football train back to London). Ruben Amorim has collapsed into a state of head-clutching melancholy because the systems football he learned on the high-performance coaching course at Lisbon University told him humans are perfectible, that this is all just micro-level automatic behaviours, that even communication and psychology can be learned. Whereas as it turns out Manchester United is, in fact, a great weeping, breathing cultural vampire organism. A mechanised form of management is colliding with the hyper-complex human world and collapsing at first contact, and it is just amazing to watch.This is the real value of sport. Even as it is commodified and taken over by government outreach arms it is still a piece of art, a representation of things that won’t be flattened out or sanitised. It is still, just about, place of play, an increasingly vital substance. While this column was being written, the UK Government announced that a special group will now be convened to “examine the importance of play” in a committee room at the House of Commons, which sounds like, yeah, that’s all probably sorted then.For now it is important above all to enjoy and treasure these moments. The dummy will decide the match but it will not register in the match stats. Humans will continue to sing over the top of that background churn. And even the most managed of environments, peopled by the most hyper-coached elite athletes, will continue to be a place of play and human mischief.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolcommentShareReuse this content"

The head coach had admitted on Friday he “sometimes hates” his players but their hard work on Saturday was rewarded with affection, having recovered from Wednesday’sCarabao Cup embarrassment at Grimsby.Manchester United squeeze past Burnley with controversial Fernandes penaltyRead moreUnited should have won more easily, instead being reliant on a controversial intervention from the video assistant referee in second-half injury time when the referee, Sam Barrott, wandered over to the pitchside monitor and decided Jaidon Anthony pulling back Amad Diallo’s shirt, which started outside the area, was worthy of a penalty. United had led twice through a Josh Cullen own goal and Bryan Mbeumo’s first Old Trafford strike but Lyle Foster and Anthony equalised asBurnleylooked set for a point until Fernandes intervened.“When they put the effort in, I always love them,” Amorim said. “Even when Amad is missing that kind of goal, I love Amad if he’s giving everything. And I think we need to understand that we should always be on this level of effort. Because even in the game, we played well in the beginning. I think we struggled when we changed the characteristics of the players because the match is not so perfect and you can feel that the team struggled a little bit, especially in the second half. But the effort was always there. It ended well, I think we deserved to win the game, I think we created a lot of chances, we should go to the half-time with a bigger advantage.”View image in fullscreenManchester United manager Ruben Amorim still had a difficult day in parts with Matheus Cunha leaving the game with an injury in the first half.Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Action Images/ReutersMatheus Cunha had to be taken off in the first half after pulling up when sprinting for the ball. Instead of sending on the new signing Benjamin Sesko, who was the final United outfield player to take a penalty at Grimsby, Amorim elected to replace the Brazilian with Joshua Zirkzee. When Mason Mount was unable to continue, Kobbie Mainoo replaced him, leaving Sesko to wait until the 72nd minute to come on.“Everything is connected,” Amorim said. “He finished the game [against Grimsby] with cramps, really at the limit. That’s why we protected Ben from the penalties. Today was that reason also because Zirkzee is also a striker, he’s an international striker. But I was thinking that Ben, during the pre-season, he didn’t do 90 minutes.”Burnley were also left confused by Foster having a goal ruled out for offside before the late call from the referee and video officials. “The ref didn’t give it, the linesman didn’t give it, he’s 10 metres away,” Scott Parker, the Clarets’ manager, said. “The guy 100 miles away has decided that it’s a clear and obvious error from the ref, and then, obviously, it’s a penalty.“That’s the way the game is, the game’s going that way. It’s going to become the most sterile game there is really. The linesmen and referees are slowly becoming redundant. We live in a world of perfection and when everyone wants perfection. Social media brings that, I think we want perfection in a game of football, which I just don’t agree with.”Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedRuben AmorimBurnleynewsShareReuse this content"

They want an initial £35m plus another £5m in bonuses and a 10% sell-on clause to be included in the deal, with talks continuing.Guéhi has less than 12 months remaining on his contract and has refused to sign an extension, with the Palace chair, Steve Parish, admitting after their victory over Arne Slot’s side in the Community Shield that he may have to be sold this month to avoid losing the 25-year-old for free next summer. Liverpool are understood to be Guéhi’s preferred destination but the Premier League champions had yet to formalise their approach until Saturday afternoon.Palace are believed to be ready to allow him to depart if their valuation is met, despite Oliver Glasner saying on Friday that it was too late to sign a replacement, given the transfer window closes on Monday.Palace, who rejected a bid worth up to £70m for Guéhi from Tottenham in January, have been desperate to add defensive reinforcements amid uncertainty over his future and agreed a deal worth up to €27m (£23.4m) with Toulouse for Jaydee Canvot, with the France Under-20s defender expected to sign a five-year contract at Selhurst Park.View image in fullscreenToulouse’s Jaydee Canvot is expected to sign a five-year deal at Crystal Palace.Photograph: Manon Cruz/ReutersCanvot is seen as a player with huge potential, having made his breakthrough in Ligue 1 last season. But the FA Cup winners have been frustrated so far in their efforts to find a more experienced replacement and Liverpool are believed to have rejected an approach to sign Joe Gomez on loan as part of the Guéhi deal.The England defender could still be available on a permanent deal, while Palace have been in talks with Manchester City over a move for Manuel Akanji but the Switzerland defender has interest from Milan so will likely move elsewhere.

City will be aiming to get over that loss at Brighton on Sunday in the final match before the international break. The two-week gap will deny them the chance to build momentum for now but when they return to action against Manchester United, it will initiate the start of a hectic domestic and European schedule.Asked why he was feeling confident, the City head coach said: “The way we are training and the way we are competing. We have to improve, but there are things that I would say are a sign. When I see these things in games, like in the United States of America, I like it. We won six Premier Leagues in eight years and when we started the season I wouldn’t say I knew we were going to win the league. But I see things that I like.“Even against Spurs I saw many things that I like my teams to do. I want to do some of them much, much better, but that is completely normal at this stage of the season. You will see through the results. When you are able to win four, five or six games in a row, or you’re competing well, or being stable in many departments, conceding few and scoring much more. After that I will say: ‘Our consistency is back.’”The first stage of the Champions League will begin after the Manchester derby withthe visit of Napolion Thursday 18 September and the prospect of playing twice almost every week until the end of January will give the opportunity to build up rhythm. Five players have arrived since the end of last season, three making debuts at the Club World Cup, but Guardiola is waiting for them to integrate fully into a team that have adjusted their style since finishing a distant third in the Premier League and trophyless overall.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They thought they were ahead when King scored in the 21st minute but the 18-year-old’s goal was ruled out after Michael Salisbury, the VAR, instructed the referee, Rob Jones, to view the pitchside monitor to assess whether Rodrigo Muniz had fouled Trevoh Chalobah during the buildup.Manchester United v Burnley, Tottenham v Bournemouth: Premier League, EFL and more – liveRead moreJones ruled against Fulham, even though Muniz was in possession of the ball when he caught Chalobah inadvertently. Jones later awardedChelseaa penalty for handball by Ryan Sessegnon but only after dismissing appeals for a foul by João Pedro during the buildup.“In the first half I saw my team playing outstanding football,” Silva said. “Playing football – not trying to be fake, not parking the bus or something like that. All the decisions from the VAR and the referee made a massive impact on the game.“To disallow a goal like that is unbelievable. Unbelievable. We have all the meetings with the people in charge; we try to see their direction. One of the main things was: ‘VAR is not here to referee the game.’ I would prefer to say nothing more as I will be punished. I want to be on the bench for the next game, I don’t want to pay fines. But it has been difficult with so many decisions against us at the start of the season.” Manchester United took the lead inFulham’s 1-1 draw at Craven Cottagelast Sunday that stood despite Leny Yoro pushing Calvin Bassey before the header that led to Muniz’s own goal.Silva was also unhappy with Chelsea being given time to take the lead at the end of the first half. A minimum of eight minutes were added on. Fulham thought that the half-time whistle should have blown before Enzo Fernández delivered a corner for João Pedro to open the scoring in the ninth added minute.“There were eight minutes of added time, they score in the ninth,” Silva added. “He has to stop the game, it’s the rules. I asked the referee, he told me that we lost time because he was talking to a player. I checked the video – the game didn’t stop one second. What can I say? Chelsea won the game and we move on.”Silva fumed about the buildup to Fernández giving Chelsea a 2-0 lead from the spot after Ryan Sessegnon handled Chalobah’s cross. “It’s handball,” the head coach said. “But before that moment you can see easily two, three or four fouls for ourselves. There was a stamp on Alex Iwobi, handball by João Pedro, push on Joachim Andersen. They saw the penalty after three moments at least that they have to see for us.“It’s the same VAR that found something unbelievable: a stamp from Rodrigo. The same people didn’t find a stamp on Alex Iwobi before the penalty. I can’t tell you anything more, but I don’t understand it.”Explore more on these topicsFulhamVideo assistant referees (VARs)RefereesLaws of footballChelseanewsShareReuse this content"

Well, not quite – this is Tottenham, after all. Instead it was Andoni Iraola’s outstandingBournemouthwho ended his 100% start thanks to Evanilson’s early strike as familiar failings returned to haunt Spurs.Had things turned out differently this summer, Iraola could easily have found himself in the home dugout having been coveted by Tottenham before they eventually settled on Frank. But after Spurs won Frank’s first twoPremier Leaguematches since he succeeded Ange Postecoglou, their shortcomings were exposed by the Spaniard’s high press and only Bournemouth’s profligacy prevented their victory being even more convincing as Tottenham’s players left the pitch to a smattering of boos.Manchester United 3-2 Burnley, Tottenham 0-1 Bournemouth: Premier League, EFL and moreRead moreXavi Simons,the new £51.8m signing from RB Leipzig, was paraded on the pitch beforehand and Frank will be desperate to integrate him as quickly as possible after it took until the 69th minute for his team to register a shot on target.“Bournemouth played to their strengths and we didn’t handle it well enough,” said Frank. “I’d prefer [the supporters] not to boo but it was not a good performance and they have high standards.”Perhaps unsurprisingly, he had decided against changing a winning formula and selected the same side that executed his gameplan to perfection against Manchester City last week, even if Dominic Solanke was ruled out with an ankle injury that the Spurs manager hopes will not keep him out beyond the international break. But he will be concerned by how easily the pedestrian midfield trio of João Palhinha, Rodrigo Bentancur and Pape Sarr were outclassed by Bournemouth’s technical superiority and it wasn’t until Frank introduced Lucas Bergvall in the second half that they at least looked more threatening.“I liked almost everything we did today,” said Iraola. “You can see there is still work to do at the back with the new players but when you are getting the results it is easier to correct things.”View image in fullscreenCristian Romero (right) shows his disappointment after Tottenham’s home defeat.Photograph: Mark Leech/Offside/Getty ImagesThe visitors were also unchanged from the win over Wolves as their new-look defence, marshalled by their experienced captain Adam Smith – a product of Tottenham’s academy – had come prepared for a thorough examination. However, it was Bournemouth who seized the initiative from the very start with a zip to their play that Spurs simply couldn’t live with. A day after being handed his first senior England call-up, Djed Spence was brought back down to earth inside the first four minutes when he was caught out by Marcos Senesi’s through ball and played Evanilson onside. The Brazilian’s shot looped off Cristian Romero, over Guglielmo Vicario and into the net.Evanilson almost doubled his tally when he drilled wide after good work from Antoine Semenyo before the Ghana forward headed a sumptuous outside-of-the-boot cross from David Brooks inches over. Tottenham could barely get out of their own half and when they did after a mistake by Tyler Adams, Richarlison was guilty of gifting possession straight back.Even the departure of Smith with an injury just before the half-hour mark could not halt Bournemouth’s momentum and it required a last-ditch block from Micky van de Ven to keep the deficit at one when Marcus Tavernier was played in by Semenyo.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But it was hard to blame them considering Spurs ended the first half without creating a single chance despite having almost 60% of possession.Whatever Frank said at half-time didn’t appear to have worked as Bournemouth picked up where they had left off. It needed a sharp save from Vicario to deny Semenyo within 60 seconds of the restart after a lightning quick break before a deflected effort from Brooks struck the crossbar when a long throw caused chaos in the Tottenham defence. Somehow they remained only 1-0 down after another Vicario save from Brooks, with Frank turning to Bergvall and Wilson Odobert from his bench.Spence was perhaps lucky to receive only a yellow card when he caught Bournemouth substitute Amine Adli late before Vicario gave away possession and Tavernier fired into the side netting.Odobert snatched at his chance when the ball dropped invitingly at the Frenchman’s feet and he blazed way over. At last Tottenham had woken up and a volley from Mathys Tel in injury time that missed by a foot would have brought the house down if it had gone in.

Saturday’s tie was a far less one-sided affair, though, as the Swedish side Hammarby provided a tricky test for United, and Le Tissier, the United captain, knew the visitors’ defensive work had been key.WSL players to resume taking knee after Jess Carter abuse prompted refusalRead more“It was an intense game,” Le Tissier told MUTV. “They [Hammarby] are really, really physical, good on the break and good on the counter. Their speciality is crosses and they were really good at that, but we defended really well. Everyone got together and it was a proper team effort to stay connected. [We] fought for the badge and fought for the win. We were solid today. I’m really proud of the players.”Manchester United have never played in the main draw of the Women’s Champions League and are now just a two-legged knockout tie away from doing so, after Saturday’s crucial win.Terland found the breakthrough in the 61st minute after Celin Bizet’s right-ring cross was cleverly flicked back across the penalty area by Melvine Malard to Terland, who squeezed the ball into the net at the near post. The cross and then the assist from Malard were two much-needed moments of quality in a game that had been closely fought and lacking in decisiveness in either penalty area.As a result of the goal Marc Skinner’s side have beaten the hosts of this mini-tournament of four teams – which had the rather long-winded name of second qualifying round league path group one – played at the Swedish side’s 3Arena venue. Hammarby were backed by more than 5,000 noisy supporters but Skinner’s team were undeterred by that disadvantage and stayed patient as they searched for their breakthrough.It was not the most inspiring of performances from United and they will need to improve if they are to progress through the third qualifying round and join Chelsea and the defending champions, Arsenal, in the new league phase.View image in fullscreenElisabeth Terland and Celin Bizet celebrate the decisive goal.Photograph: Michael Campanella/Getty ImagesUnited should have opened the scoring earlier. In the third minute, Ella Toone had cut the ball back into Terland’s path inside the area but her shot was saved. Anna Sandberg also went close 15 minutes later when she rifled a left-foot strike just over the bar. Five minutes into the second half, Bizet broke through but could not beat the goalkeeper and Malard rushed a half-volleyed effort on the rebound.However, Hammarby had come closest to scoring in the first half when, 28 minutes in, Sofia Reidy struck the bar from inside the area after the ball fell kindly to her.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The former Manchester City head coach’s appointment came 162 days after Liverpool’s former manager Matt Beard left, after an extensive recruitment process than the Guardian understands took much longer than usual because of a clause with Taylor’s previous contract, after Taylor had been identified earlier in the summer as the No 1 target. It was the first major coaching appointment overseen by the managing director, Andy O’Boyle, who arrived in April, replacing Russ Fraser.After an unexpected fourth-placed finish in 2024, Liverpool ended last term seventh and they are hoping to improve on that and start building towards challenging for trophies again after making their fans wait for success for far too long; they have not achieved a top-three finish since winning back-to-back WSL titles in 2013 and 2014. Liverpool are one of only four clubs to have won the WSL but over the past decade there have been big question marks about the wider club’s ambition for the women’s team, who have been operating with a far smaller budget than the top sides.This summerthey sold Olivia Smithfor a then world-record fee of £1m, breaking a historic barrier, but it remains to be seen how they intend to spend that money, making predictions difficult about their campaign until the transfer window closes on Thursday. They are yet to replace Smith with a statement signing.How they finished in the past five seasonsHow they finished in the past five seasonsThe managerTaylor, the former Wales, Nottingham Forest and Sheffield United player, spent five years at City where he came mighty close to a league title, missing out on goal difference in the 2023-24 campaign. In another second-placed finish in 2020-21, his side lost one league game. He won an FA Cup and a League Cup, and Liverpool are understood to have admired his possession-based style. Can he replicate that successfully with a squad not blessed with the same world-class talent?View image in fullscreenOlivia Smith has departed for a fee of £1m.Photograph: Nick Taylor/Liverpool FC/Getty ImagesOff-field pictureLiverpool have announced a trio of league fixtures that will be staged at Anfield, including their season-opening local derby against Everton on 7 September, and the rest of their home matches will be played at their regular home in St Helens, which offers a good level of facilities for their fans compared with many others in the WSL. The players have a top-class training environment at Melwood but the fans will wantFenway Sports Group to invest more in the squad after years of comparatively frugal spending has left them miles behind clubs such as Arsenal and Chelsea.Last season’s resultsLast season’s resultsStar signingCould the answer change before the window shuts? So far, Liverpool’s best move has been to make the loan of the Scotland midfielder Sam Kerr a permanent transfer from Bayern Munich, and they have also signed the Rangers academy graduate Kirsty Maclean and picked up two astute free signings in the Wales defender Lily Woodham – who is likely to fill the gap on the left created by the exit of Hinds – and the German goalkeeper Rafaela Borggräfe. But none of those have made a sizeable dent into the £1m received for the sale of Smith.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In July the former Sheffield United forward signed a new contract and Liverpool could certainly benefit from more goals: they were the third-lowest scorers in the WSL last season and they have not had a player reach a double-figure goals tally in the top division since Courtney Sweetman-Kirk hit 10 in 2018-19.View image in fullscreenCeri Holland was in the Wales squad at Euro 2025.Photograph: Nick Potts/PAIt was a good summer for …Gemma Evans and Ceri Holland were part of the Wales squad that contested their first major women’s international tournament, but there are no senior England players in the Liverpool squad. It was a surprise that the forward Sophie Roman Haug was left out of the Norway squad for the Euros and she could have a point to prove this season. The vast majority of the Liverpool squad were able to have a summer break for rest, recovery and then a full pre-season, which could benefit them.Main initiative to attract more fansA big shift over the past six months has been an attempt to change the playing style and make the team’s tactics potentially attract more fans through the turnstiles; the largest element of that hinged on the recruitment of a new head coach, so a lot rests on the success of Taylor and his coaching staff. The club have chosen their home league fixture against Everton, Manchester City and Arsenal to be staged at Anfield.Explore more on these topicsLiverpool FC WomenWomen's Super LeagueWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Perrin became only the second woman after Tammy Beaumont in 2023 to reach three figures in the 100-ball tournament with a stunning 101 off 43 balls, which included 15 fours and five sixes at the Oval.It was the fastest ton in the women’s competition and second quickest overall, with only Harry Brook’s 41-ball hundred for the Superchargers against Welsh Fire in 2023 eclipsing this salvo from Perrin. When that was put to her, Perrin, who was run out at the non-striker’s end, laughed and told Sky Sports: “One ball? Damn, I better hit the gym so I can send those sixes a bit further!“It felt pretty brilliant. It’s not every day you get to find yourself in that state of flow and in the zone and it’s when you’re there, stay in the present and take every ball as they come.”Watched by about 20 family and friends, Perrin clubbed an attack featuring the England players Issy Wong, Charlie Dean and Sarah Glenn to all parts to underpin the Superchargers’ 214 for five. It was the highest total by a woman’s team by far – the previous best was 181 for three by Welsh Fire when Beaumont made a century – and it was too many for the Spirit.Grace Ballinger and Annabel Sutherland claimed three wickets apiece to leave last year’s winners short on 172 for nine as Superchargers set up a showdown with unbeaten Southern Brave in Sunday’s final.Meanwhile, Trent Rockets progressed into the men’s final after their eliminator against Northern Superchargers was abandoned due to rain. The Rockets secured their place in the final against Oval Invincibles having finished second in the group stage, a place above the Superchargers.View image in fullscreenGround staff bring on the covers during the Hundred eliminator game between Northern Superchargers and Trent Rockets at the Oval.Photograph: Keeran Marquis/SPP/ShutterstockShowers in south London delayed the start of the contest by 20 minutes, prompted two hour-long interruptions, and eventually wiped the game out altogether.Andrew Flintoff’s Superchargers had made 119 for five from 75 balls before the Rockets twice started to chase adjusted targets - 131 off 75 and then 105 off 55. Rockets openers Tom Banton and Joe Root initially faced just one ball before being forced back off.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Second place in Pool A behind England was probably on the line, and both teams gave everything in an utterly compelling match with a barely believable script.Neither deserved to lose, and if England comfortably defeat the Wallaroos next week, it should come down to points difference between these two sides for a place in the last eight. After Eva Karpani’s concluding try for Australia, Samantha Wood’s simple conversion chance could have won it five minutes from time, but she pulled it, in doing so arguably guaranteeing the right result.England storm into Rugby World Cup quarter-finals as Breach leads Samoa routRead moreThe precocious wing Desiree Miller and the 18-year-old full-back Caitlyn Halse both scored twice for the Wallaroos, while Freda Tafuna was credited with a hat-trick, although the No 6 said the third was scored by Hope Rogers. A late try by Erica Jarrell-Searcy, plus that disputed fifth, looked to have won it for the USA before Karpani’s try levelled it. Australia face England next Saturday while the USA have a less demanding task against Samoa, against whom the Wallaroos racked up a 73-0 score.“Bittersweet,” said Sione Fukofuka, the USA head coach. “We did everything to get back in the game, gave ourselves an opportunity to close it out … Really proud of the players to work back in the game but really disappointed that’s how it ended. We’re hoping England can put a pretty good performance in [against Australia], and we get a chance to rack up some points against Samoa.”Jo Yapp, Australia head coach, was similarly conflicted. “Many mixed emotions,” she said. “A little bit flat and disappointed, really. We had opportunities to win but the discipline in the second half cost us … It [qualification] is in our hands. We’ll go into that England game knowing exactly what we need to do.”Steel-grey skies and teeming rain made for a traditionally English occasion. It felt more winter than late summer and the early skirmishes were suitably uncompromising, juddering tackles and fierce breakdown duels all over.Miller soon dotted down the first try, continuing her red-hot form after a hat-trick against Samoa. Ilona Maher, meanwhile, was playing like someone who didn’t fancy informing her Instagram followers about another defeat. The centre carried with power and intensity and was a breakdown menace. When Keia Mae Sagapolu pouched a lineout and broke through, she found the captain Kate Zackary, and Tafuna eventually came up with the ball.View image in fullscreenSamantha Wood had a conversion with five minutes remaining which could have won the game for Australia.Photograph: Sam Mellish/Getty ImagesMcKenzie Hawkins lingered over the conversion, though, and ran out of time. That felt significant, and Australia finished the half in the ascendancy, Hulse torpedoing under the posts to create a nine-point half-time lead.It was now or never for the USA. Cheta Emba attacked on the right, Erica Coulibaly made progress on the left and Sagapolu forced her way over with a brilliant close-range finish. Hawkins’ kick bounced off both posts and out.But the Americans were unbowed. Maher, a force of nature at the breakdown, brought a penalty and after Hawkins kicked for the corner Tafuna finished off a powerful drive. The celebrations were riotous, even more so when Hawkins nailed a difficult kick to create a three-point lead.Momentum shifted? Not so fast. Miller burned across again for her fifth try of the tournament with Australia’s next attack, Wood missing the conversion, before a scrum penalty and lovely hands put Hulse over again and the bonus point for the Wallaroos. Nine points in it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Yeah, it was cool. All or nothing, really, huh? We’ve got to leave it all out there [next week] or we’re not going to play again … we have to beat them with a great margin.”Fukofuka said of Maher: “She played tough, didn’t she? I’d love to give her more ball in space, and hopefully we’ll get that opportunity next week. What you saw out there is a tough rugby player.”The USA kick off against Samoa at 1.30pm next Saturday, here in York, before England face Australia at 5pm in Brighton. “We have to put points on and hopefully England really give it to Australia,” said Maher.

I think as the game wore on and the scoreboard was building, it was always going to be this group’s challenge to stay in the process and build pressure. So there’s always something to fix in this game. Ultimately at the end of the day if you’re going to mark it hard, why didn’t we build pressure in that period? Maybe our basics let us down on those couple of occasions. We wouldn’t be human if we didn’t have something to fix.”Amongst the try-scorers was the fly-half and player of the match Helena Rowland, who also kicked 11 of 14 conversions. The versatile back impressed Mitchell with her performance.“She was outstanding,” he said. “She’s got a great skillset. She drove the game really well. Communicated all week. You could tell that she was going to perform well and she did. A lot of the other girls fed off her direction. I thought she was down in the right end of the field when we needed to be there. She directed attack really well to allow us to go forward. She can hunt weakness pretty quickly through her pace. She was definitely an example of an outstanding triple threat.”England have been hit with a few injuries in this tournament with the captain, Zoe Aldcroft, ruled out for the game against Samoa and their final pool match against Australia. She isn’t the only worry with Emily Scarratt picking up a shoulder injury and Holly Aitchison dealing with an ankle problem.But Mitchell eased any fears of further issues, saying: “Naturally, we all need to go through our processes medically. But right at the minute it was not a lot that’s dangerous.“Injury gods haven’t been that kind to us at the start of the tournament, we have managed to get to this point. Getting minutes in to everyone except Holly, so hopefully we can continue with that good group health.”Explore more on these topicsEngland women's rugby union teamWomen's Rugby World Cup 2025Samoa women's rugby union teamWomen's rugby unionRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

Chelsea’s position is that no contract has been signed and that they must protect the interests of the club. They have informed Bayern that the deal would not go ahead.Enzo Maresca, Chelsea’s head coach, said after the game that it would not be possible to operate with only one fit striker for two months. Chelsea intend to reintegrate Jackson, who has fallen out of favour after the arrivals of Delap and João Pedro this summer. Maresca was forced to use the 19-year-old winger Tyrique George as a striker against Fulham.Tottenham sign £51.8m Xavi Simons from Leipzig after Chelsea leave path clearRead more“When you have two strikers, it’s enough,” Maresca said. “When one of them is injured for different weeks, probably it’s not enough. Today we played more than one hour with Tyrique and he did brilliant. The last game he played as a No 9 was Man United at home last year. Again, we try to use a different solution. If you remember last year, we used Pedro [Neto] in some games as a No 9. It’s because we are always looking for a solution.”Jackson has scored 24 goals in 65 Premier League appearances. He opened his Chelsea account against Luton beforescoring a hat-trickin a 4-1 win at Tottenham in his first season with the club. He scored 14 goals in 35 league matches and formed a good relationship with Cole Palmer.Last September Jackson signed a two-year contract extension, with his deal running until 2033. He made key contributions during Chelsea’s Conference League success, scoring twice in the semi-final first leg win at Djurgården and once in thefinal against Real Betis.Discipline was a problem for the Senegal international, however: he was sent off for a deliberate elbow in a Premier League match against Newcastle in May and also in the Club World Cup group-stage defeat by Flamengo a month later for a reckless foul after coming on as a substitute.Jackson returned from suspension to replace Pedro in the semi-final win against Fluminense but was an unused substitute inChelsea’s 3-0 final triumphover Paris Saint-Germain.Jackson was suspended for Chelsea’s opening game of the 2025-26 season against Crystal Palace and was left out of the squad for the 5-1 win at West Ham despite being fit and available for selection.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There are indications that the German champions are pondering an attempt to sign the 19-year-old defender on loan with an obligation to buy.It is understood that Chelsea have no interest in selling Acheampong, who is also a target for Manchester City and Bournemouth. The youngster, who can play in a range of defensive positions, broke into the first team last season. He was an unused substitute against Fulham.It was another hectic day at Chelsea, who confirmed the £40m signing of Alejandro Garnacho from Manchester United on a seven-year deal on Saturday evening. A compromise on the winger’s fee was reached earlier this week, with United dropping their £50m asking price.Meanwhile, Chelsea are understood to have offered Barcelona €40m (£34.5m) for the midielder Fermin López. It is understood that Barça’s starting position on the 22-year-old is €90m. The feeling in Spain is that Chelsea will have to meet them somewhere in the middle but it is still expected to take more than €60m for the deal to go ahead.Explore more on these topicsChelseaTransfer windowBayern MunichnewsShareReuse this content"

Moments after one of the biggest wins of his career, the German unwittingly found himself on the receiving end of Stefanos Tsitsipas’s ire during their handshake at the net. Before Tsitsipas could finish, though, Altmaier had walked away from the net and he refused to engage in the Greek’s attempts to argue with him.Altmaier shrugs at the first mention of the incident: “Even if I would have lost, I would not enter discussions because it’s just like heat of the moment. You need to cool down; let’s see if he reacts to it or he sticks to his opinion while cooling down on an exercise bike in the player gym late at night.”Although Altmaier had the wherewithal to think clearly in the heat of battle, the same cannot be said for many other players in New York over the past week, a tournament that has been dominated by outbursts of anger and frustration from players. “Lots of drama,” says Jessica Pegula, laughing. “I don’t know. My matches have been pretty no drama, so I’m not really sure what’s going on with everybody else. I don’t know. It’s just that New York City tends to bring out just a lot of drama, I guess.”Coco Gauff settles serve and nerves to book Osaka clash in US Open last 16Read moreIn hindsight, theDaniil Medvedev show on the first night of the tournamentwas a sign of things to come as he lambasted the umpire before inciting the Louis Armstrong Stadium audience into a six-minute protest while Benjamin Bonzi held match point in their first round match. Although that incident sparked a dramatic comeback, Medvedev lost in five unforgettable sets.Then, after crashing out of the tournament in a second round loss to Taylor Townsend, Jelena Ostapenko crashed out on the court. Townsend later said Ostapenko’s heated comments towards her had included the Latvian accusing her of having “no education” and “no class”. Tsitsipas, who was apparently frustrated by Altmaier’s successful underarm serve in their second round match, tried to send his opponent a message after the match: “Next time, don’t wonder why I hit you, OK? No, I’m just saying if you serve underarm…” he said, his voice trailing off. By that time, Altmaier had removed himself from the conversation.These events, and many others, seem to be reflective of this particular moment of the tennis season. Stress runs high across on the tour, particularly at the major tournaments, but the US Open is positioned at a particularly fraught period towards the end of a long, gruelling season. Most players are tired, tightly strung and emotions are running high. They are, of course, also in New York, one of the most frantic cities in the world.View image in fullscreenDaniil Medvedev breaks his racket after losing his match against Benjamin Bonzi.Photograph: Charly Triballeau/AFP/Getty ImagesAccording to Pegula, the forceful New York crowds play a role in player behaviour on the court: “I feel like the crowds, they’re pretty crazy. They kind of get everyone riled up. Everyone is tense. It’s the last slam of the season. Your last chance to go deep at a slam for a while. I think people maybe just get stressed out, and you’re out there competing and fighting and trying to win. I think it just gets emotional. Adrenaline starts flowing.”Coco Gauff agrees: “I think it’s, (a) end of the year; (b) we’re in New York, and the fans here – I love them – but [if] you’re on the wrong side of things, can … They’re into the match. They’re passionate tennis fans. They know what’s going on, and they’re used to other events I think, like major events, happening in the city that aren’t tennis.”Not everyone believes the location of the US Open has a role in player behaviour: “Hey, don’t blame New York!” says a smiling Naomi Osaka, who grew up in the city.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Medvedev, for example, has long been one of the most volatile players on the tour. Osaka says: “Not calling everyone out name by name, but Medvedev’s had a couple of moments here that are kind of iconic. I feel like the people here might enjoy a show, but I think people everywhere enjoy a show.”Ostapenko’s criticisms of Townsend, meanwhile, showed a lack of self-awareness considering she is notorious, and even admired by many, for her lack of sportsmanship. They are all also in poor form and this tournament represented their last opportunity to salvage their grand slam years, another potential source of tension.For Gauff, it is not at all surprising to see these players involved: “To be honest, with some of the drama, I feel like it happens frequently on tour, but because it’s here, it gets more social media clicks,” she says. “Some of the players, these are recurring things that us in the tennis world, it’s not surprising. It’s like: ‘OK, whatever.’ But because it’s here in New York and maybe not as many tennis fans or things like that, it gets blown up on social media.”Before offering her opinion, Osaka jokingly makes it clear that she has not been part of any drama this week: “I don’t know if it’s just the part of the season where everyone is, like, tired and irritated or something,” she says, smiling. “But for me I think New York brings out my best behaviour, so I don’t know what everyone else is doing.”Explore more on these topicsUS Open Tennis 2025US Open tennisDaniil MedvedevCoco GauffTennisUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Hersecond major at Roland Garros in Junehad given way to a summer-long revolt of her serve, often marked by spates of double faults and premature exits, including a first-round departure from Wimbledon. She has framed the change as a long-term fix rather than a quick repair, saying she did not want to “waste time playing a way I don’t want to play”.After two tense night sessions to launch her US Open campaign, the 21-year-old American finally looked settled on Saturday morning, advancing to the second week of her home major for the fourth year running with a 6-3, 6-1 dismissal of Poland’s Magdalena Frech.To address her serving woes, Gauff has enlisted Gavin MacMillan, the biomechanics specialist who helped Aryna Sabalenka rein in her serving yips and climb to the world No 1 ranking with three major titles. The first two rounds showed the transition was bumpy for the No 3 seed: athree-set struggle against Ajla Tomljanovic,then tears on court ina fraught win over Donna Vekic. “It’s been an emotional week,” Gauff said. “I think I needed those tough moments to be able to move forward. I was putting so much pressure on myself.”This time there was no unraveling. Under bright sunshine rather than the Ashe floodlights before a robust Labor Day weekend crowd, Gauff struck just four double faults, built a 3-0 lead and, when Frech briefly levelled at 3-all, responded with assurance. Serving at 40-30 in a tense seventh game, she steadied with a 105mph delivery that drew an error, clenched her fist and surged through the rest of the set.View image in fullscreenCoco Gauff’s revamped serve has been a work in progress since a pre-US Open coaching change.Photograph: Timothy A Clary/AFP/Getty ImagesThe second set was more straightforward. A bruising 20-shot exchange went Gauff’s way to earn the first break, while another break at love followed two games later as Frech’s errors mounted. The Pole, seeded at a major for the first time, could not hurt the American once rallies extended. “She gives you no pace, maybe not too many angles to work with, so you kind of have to create all the opportunity for yourself,” Gauff said afterwards.Her delivery, so fragile in recent months, became a source of confidence. She landed nearly 80% of first serves in the opener and conceded only two points on serve during the second set. Even when a fourth double fault appeared as she tried to close, she brushed away the danger with a crisp volley before sealing victory after 73 minutes with a quiet pump of her left fist. “Today I definitely think was a step in the right direction,” she said. “I’m more proud of the mental effort … remembering the things that we worked on in practice.”The contrast with her opening rounds was stark. Instead of tense body language and second-guessing, she attacked from the baseline and looked to finish points at the net. The serve remains a work in progress, particularly the toss, but the rhythm was smoother and her self-belief clearer. She even suggested Thursday’s tears might have served a purpose: “Maybe it’s not a weakness,” she reflected. “It’s just showing the things that happen in my head … Today I felt a lot lighter going on court.”For Frech, the world No 28, this was still a week of progress. She had never previously reached the US Open’s third round and her win over Peyton Stearns ensured a career-best result here. But against Gauff the gulf in experience told. The American, making her 25th appearance in a grand slam main draw, already owns two major titles – and boasts a 30-1 record at the majors over the past two years against opponents ranked outside the top 20.That precocity places her among rare company. Only Venus Williams has reached more second weeks at grand slams among US women before turning 22. “This is the level I want to play,” Gauff said. “I know the competition gets tougher from here, but if I keep building from today, I like where my game is going.”Gauff now advances to a delicious fourth-round clash on Monday with Naomi Osaka, the two-time US Open champion who beat 15th seed Daria Kasatkina 6-0, 4-6, 6-2 to reach the second week of a major for the first time since 2021. It will be their sixth meeting – Gauff leads 3-2 in the head-to-head – and their first in New York since Osaka’s straight-sets win in 2019, when she was world No 1 and Gauff a 15-year-old wildcard.“It would be a cool kind of déjà vu, but hopefully with a different result,” Gauff said. “I remember it was a tough moment because it was such a hyped-up match. Looking back, I put way too much pressure on myself, thinking I had a chance to do something. I probably did, but I felt more expectation than belief.”Explore more on these topicsUS Open Tennis 2025TennisUS Open tennisUS sportsShareReuse this content"

But under the bright lights on Friday night, Djokovic held off an impressive Cameron Norrie to reach the fourth round of the US Open with a 6-4, 6-7 (4), 6-2, 6-3 win in his best performance of the tournament so far.The victory makes Djokovic, 38, the oldest man to reach the last 16 of the US Open in 34 years – since Jimmy Connors in 1991. He also ties Roger Federer for the most grand slam fourth round appearances in history with 69 appearances. “These kind of matches and performances always give me hope that I can go far, challenge the best players in the world,” Djokovic said.Emma Raducanu overwhelmed by Rybakina at US Open in straight-sets lossRead moreNorrie faced an unenviable challenge in his first ever appearance inside Arthur Ashe Stadium. Djokovic may be vulnerable in New York given his six-week absence from the tour and some tepid form in his earlier matches, but the 24-time grand slam champion has proven a nightmare match-up for Norrie over the Briton’s career. Djokovic had won each of their previous six meetings, losing just two sets.For a while, Djokovic seemed to be strolling to an effortless early win as he broke serve early on and moved towards securing the opening set, but at 5-3 the Serb began to struggle with his movement and he repeatedly stretched out his lower back. He swiftly called the trainer, taking an off-court medical time out at 5-4.View image in fullscreenDjokovic during a medical time out in his match against Norrie.Photograph: Eduardo Muñoz/Reuters“In terms of how I’m feeling, it really goes up and down, to be honest,” Djokovic said. “It’s frustrating for me, honestly, that I’m not able to feel 100% always like I have for 20-plus years. But I guess the circumstances are quite different and I have to get used to the fact that every match there’s something that might happen, as it has been the case this year in pretty much every slam.”Although he returned to close out the set, continuing his excellent early serving form, Djokovic did not look happy. His numerous pauses eventually led Norrie to speak with the umpire about his time between points. “I don’t think it was a tactic, but I would have liked to see the umpire be a bit more assertive. It changed nothing for the match,” Norrie said.“Just three or four times I had to wait for him on my serve, and partly I think maybe he was kind of stretching … But it was nothing to do with Novak. I was just asking the umpire what’s the rule every time I have to wait for him. No, it was not really anything there.”View image in fullscreenCameron Norrie played with dare under the lights on Friday night.Photograph: Charly Triballeau/AFP/Getty ImagesThrough those disruptions, Norrie tried hard to put the Serb under pressure. He played far more offensive tennis than usual and as a consequence of his courage he put together his best stretch of tennis against Djokovic, forcing a tie-break and performing strongly under pressure to level the match. Norrie’s forehand, often underpowered against the best players, was spectacular in the middle of the match.Faced with a genuine challenge, Djokovic responded solidly. His serving was supreme in the final sets, ending with 18 aces, and he smothered Norrie’s game with relentless depth while dictating play. It was a quality match from both players, allowing Djokovic to head into the second week hopeful that he is finding his rhythm and form.Shelton’s first career retirement and Tiafoe loss leave US men reeling at OpenRead moreNorrie, meanwhile, leaves New York having continued his excellent form throughout this summer as he attempts to re-establish himself among the best players in the world.“I think always when I play these top players like Rafa in the past or Novak, I feel it’s like a different kind of level, playing against them and I always play so, so well straight after these tournaments, obviously you’re getting a lot of reps in,” Norrie said.“To play against these top guys and to see what they can bring point in and point out, it’s definitely a different level. So I can take a lot of confidence in this, as well, for sure.”Explore more on these topicsUS Open Tennis 2025TennisUS sportsNovak DjokovicShareReuse this content"

They were almost twice as likely to be diagnosed with heart valve disease, which is where one or more heart valves do not work properly.View image in fullscreenThe AI-led stethoscope analyses differences in heartbeat and blood flow undetectable to the human ear, and takes an ECG recording.Photograph: Eko HealthDr Patrik Bächtiger, of Imperial College London’s National Heart and Lung Institute and Imperial College healthcareNHStrust, said: “The design of the stethoscope has been unchanged for 200 years – until now.“So it is incredible that a smart stethoscope can be used for a 15-second examination, and then AI can quickly deliver a test result indicating whether someone has heart failure, atrial fibrillation or heart valve disease.”The device, manufactured by California company EkoHealth, is about the size of a playing card. It is placed on a patient’s chest to take an ECG recording of the electrical signals from their heart, while its microphone records the sound of blood flowing through the heart.This information is sent to the cloud – a secure online data storage area – to be analysed by AI algorithms that can detect subtle heart problems a human would miss.The test result, indicating whether the patient should be flagged as at-risk for one of the three conditions or not, is sent back to a smartphone.The breakthrough does carry an element of risk, with a higher chance of people wrongly being told they may have one of the conditions when they do not. The researchers stressed the AI stethoscope should be used for patients with symptoms of suspected heart problems, and not for routine checks in healthy people.But it could also save lives and money by diagnosing people much earlier.Dr Mihir Kelshiker, also at Imperial College, said: “Most people with heart failure are only diagnosed when they arrive in A&E seriously ill.“This trial shows that AI-enabled stethoscopes could change that – givingGPsa quick, simple tool to spot problems earlier, so patients can get the right treatment sooner.”Dr Sonya Babu-Narayan, the clinical director of the British Heart Foundation, which part-funded the research alongside the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR), said: “Given an earlier diagnosis, people can access the treatment they need to help them live well for longer.”Prof Mike Lewis, the NIHR scientific director for innovation, said: “This tool could be a real gamechanger for patients, bringing innovation directly into the hands of GPs. The AI stethoscope gives local clinicians the ability to spot problems earlier, diagnose patients in the community, and address some of the big killers in society.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Medical researchHeart diseaseHeart attackGPsNHSHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Why weren’t our voices enough?Sat 30 Aug 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 30 Aug 2025 17.04 EDTShareToday I watched those children again, the ones who stood before the cameras at al-Shifa hospital on 7 November 2023. Theyspokein English, not their mother tongue, but the language of those who they thought might save them.“We want to live, we want peace, we want to judge the killers of children,” one boy said. “We want medicine, foodand education. We want to live as the other children live.”Even then, the children pleaded. They had no clean drinking water, no food, no medicine.Now, 21 months later, as 60,000confirmedPalestinian corpses pile higher, or in mass graves, andindependentestimates show over 100,000 dead, something has happened. Suddenly, the same institutions that spent months debating, or more actively denying, whetherPalestiniantestimony deserved credence are finding their voices.Western academics speak of “genocide” with newfound authority. TwoIsraelihuman rights organizations issuedreportsdeclaring what Palestinians have screamed from under rubble since October. They say they are “experts”, but it took them two years to see what was always before them: that a sky that delivers bombs was never looking for hostages.Why weren’t our corpses enough? What renders Palestinian death so consistently unconvincing to those who witness our slaughter in real time? What is it about our breath, our blood, our bodies, that makes them so easy to doubt, so easy to dismiss, so easy to destroy?It is not the eyes that are blind, but the hearts.The answer lies not in our deaths but in how we are constructed as less than human from the moment we draw breath. Palestinian dehumanization is philosophical, deliberate, essential to the colonial project. We must be made into something other than human so that our elimination becomes necessary violence. The colonizer requires the colonized to be beasts so that caging us appears humane and killing us appears justified.This same dehumanization allows the media to place the genocide of Palestinians within the context of7 October 2023, to act as if history started two years ago, but never place 7 October in the context of 77 years ofcolonial dispossessionand 17 years of completesiege. When Palestinian experts appeared on television saying this was genocide, they were berated, attacked, dismissed. Now it seems only non-Palestinians can declare it genocide, as if they are being brave, as if Palestinians haven’t beenfired, doxed andimprisonedfor describing our killers as evil.Perhaps they wanted eulogies for the soldiers who murdered our children?Christiane Amanpour, and those like her,speaksof her epiphany about genocide only after the Israeli writer David Grossman comes to his sadrealizationthat Israel is committing genocide. Palestinians can only narrate if accompanied by authority. But I don’t recognize an authority that can’t feel 22,000lb bombs that have killed aclassroom of childrenevery day for 670 days.How holy their concern now sounds, rising over a land emptied of the living.These newfound experts, the same voices that spent 21 months debating whether witnessing mass slaughter constituted evidence of mass slaughter, now speak with such authority about our suffering. But even Israeli validation comes with escape hatches built in. When B’Tselem finally published their report, calling itOur Genocide, they spent 88 pages dancing around the legal definition they claimed to embrace. They acknowledged genocidal acts while avoiding the question of genocidal intent, the very element that makes genocide legally prosecutable.Did they forget Netanyahu compared us to Amalek? That he called for our biblical death?View image in fullscreen‘Skeletal children evoke sympathy that crushed bodies never will. They can mourn our corpses without confronting the systems that created them.’Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesThe media enabled this genocide from the start. When Israeli officials announced they had seen “40 beheaded babies” and the world moved to war, there were no photos required, no verification needed. Former US president Joe Biden repeated this blood libel multiple times, even after his own staff admitted he never saw such images. The White House walked back his statements twice. Haaretzinvestigatedand found only one infant died on 7 October, shot, not beheaded. But the lie had already traveled around the world while Palestinian truth was still begging for a hearing.When Israelkilledseven aid workers from World Central Kitchen in April 2024, precision-striking their clearly marked vehicles in three separate hits, they called it an “unintentional mistake”. When they systematicallymurderedover 200 journalists, more than in any war in recorded history, each death was labeled an unfortunate accident. When they created the highestconcentrationof child amputees in the world, this too is presented as an unintended consequence.The pattern never changes. Israel commits a war crime, promises to investigate itself, and quietly concludes months later that procedures were followed correctly. Yet, the world expects us to forgive and forget.Until recently, Piers Morgan paraded Palestinian advocates across his stage, a courtroom where the oppressed are always on trial. Rehearsed, he asked each guest the same question:“Do you condemn Hamas?”In that moment, every Palestinian was stripped of grief and forced into a posture of apology.The follow-up question is just as predictable:“Does Israel have a right to defend itself?”The occupier, we are told, has a sacred right to violence. The occupied must earn the right to grieve. Israel’s so-called “defense” is never interrogated, even though international law grants no such right to an occupying power against the people it occupies.International law is unambiguous, when it chooses to remember its own language. It affirms the right of all peoples to self-determination, and in UN Resolution 3236, it enshrines the right to resist occupationby “any means necessary”. Apparently these laws do not apply to Palestinian flesh.Israel has violated every principle of international law: the prohibition onapartheid, the crime offorcible transfer, the destruction ofcultural property, the targeting of civilians, the use of starvation as a weapon of war. And nowgenocide, the highest crime of all. Western regimes expect us not to recognize this reality, perhaps because they have seen how the world has not moved swiftly to stop this genocide, they know they can commit it again.The Intercept’sanalysisof over 1,000 articles from major newspapers during the first six weeks after 7 October 2023 reveals the systematic nature of dehumanization. Humanizing language was reserved almost exclusively for Israeli suffering: “slaughter” appeared in a 60:1 ratio favoring Israeli over Palestinian deaths, “massacre” at 125:2, and “horrific” at 36:4. This was systematic preparation for genocide, the deliberate murder of language itself.Edward Said understood this decades ago. InPermission to Narrate, he showed how Palestinians are robbed of the right to tell our own story, how our voices are filtered through the lens of those who wish us gone. Said knew that the question was never whether Palestinians could speak, we always spoke. The question was who would be allowed to listen, and under what conditions our words would be deemed credible.But I understand now why the discourse shifts, why genocide suddenly becomes speakable after so much death. It’s not because Palestinian voices gained credibility, it’s because Palestinian death reached a form western consciences can process. Starvation photographs better than bombs or asniper’s bulletin a child’s chest. Skeletal children evoke sympathy that crushed bodies never will. They can mourn our corpses without confronting the systems that created them. So, western nations can acceptably feign concern over famine in Gaza as if Palestinian mothers hadn’t been carrying their dying children to hospitals for over a year. And, suddenly politicians can offerconditional recognitionof Palestinian statehood, but only if we promise to remain defenseless forever.They prefer us as martyrs because martyrs make no demands for liberation.This performative shift comes not from moral awakening but from calculated safety. Famine sounds like misfortune; genocide sounds like guilt. Famine lets them send aid without admitting harm, grieve publicly without calling out the inflictors. They can express horror while avoiding the truth that western bombs destroyed almost all ofGaza.Even when evidence becomes undeniable, they adapt. When photographs of 18-month-old Mohammed al-Mutawaq, skeletal from malnutrition, went viral, pro-Israeli voices found new ways to dismiss Palestinian suffering. Once it was revealed the child has cerebral palsy, columnists declared the starvation narrative “a lie”, calling such images “propaganda”.As if starving a child pre-disposed to death makes the violence more justified?But the New York Times, quick to factcheck a starving Palestinian child for having a pre-existing condition, let their Screams Without Words report go uncorrected for over 500 days, helping launch popular support for genocide.But Palestinian voices break through not despite the repression, but because of our refusal to accept that some stories cannot be told, some deaths cannot be mourned, some truths cannot be spoken. Those who remain breathing will speak the truth others died trying to tell: that Palestinian blood waters the earth of our homeland, that our resistance grows from every grave they dig, that our liberation cannot be delayed by their comfort with finishing the Nakba. If you want to listen to Palestinians now, respect our call: immediate sanctions on Israel, stop the sale and flow of weapons that continue to kill, and respect the Palestinian right to self-determination.The children at al-Shifa hospital understood what the world refuses to see. Many of them are probably buried now, killed by the same forces that dismissed their testimony as propaganda. And still, the only question their corpses might be asked is if they condemned Hamas before Israel killed them.Ahmad Ibsais is a first generation Palestinian American, law student and poet who writes the newsletter State of SiegeExplore more on these topicsGazaOpinionIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriescommentShareReuse this content"

The left-field claims are everywhereSat 30 Aug 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 30 Aug 2025 17.58 EDTShareThe secret meanings behind Taylor Swift’s engagementBreaking news alerts were pinged to phones around the world; Swifties screamed in the street; the Prince and Princess of Wales delivered their royal approval; Donald Trumpwished them luck. By now it will not have escaped your attention that Taylor Swift, the reigning queen of pop, is engaged to Travis Kelce, a podcaster who also plays football.What does this engagement mean? It’s possible you naively think it simply means an extremely famous woman and a somewhat famous man enjoy each other’s company and want to settle down together to start a big, beautiful brand partnership. Wrong! When it comes to Swift, Occam’s razor rarely applies. The megastar is known for hiding Easter eggs and hidden meaning in her musical output; she has driven a lot of otherwise normal people on quixotic missions into the deep, dark depths of her lyrics to validate their left-field theories about their idol.Who can forget, for example, the5,000-word essaypublished in the New York Times last year arguing that Swift is secretly part of the LGBTQ+ community and communicating that fact via coded lyrics? A surprisingly large number of “Gaylors” seem invested in this theory: a Gaylorsubreddithas more than 50,000 members. Following news of the proposal, it went private to avoid trolling from outsiders.While the engagement has sent some Gaylors into mourning, various conservatives are celebrating the idea that Swift might be on her way from being an independent career woman to a tradwife. On his podcast, the rightwing activist Charlie Kirk mused that getting married and having kids changes a person, and he hopes that it will “deradicalize” the billionaire – who is, it must be said, not widely known for having any radical ideas.“Taylor Swift might go from a cat lady to a JD Vance supporter,”Kirk said. “I think that if she ends up having children, she’ll stop this kind of liberal endorsing Joe Biden nonsense.” (Well, I mean, she’s not going to be endorsing Biden any more, that’s for sure.) Kirk added: “Reject feminism. Submit to your husband, Taylor. You’re not in charge.” Oh, I think she is.While Vance himself hasn’t weighed in on whether he thinks the Kelce effect will mean Swift suddenly has aMar-a-Lagomakeover and starts fangirling over Maga politics, he has aired his thoughts on the news. More specifically, he used the Swift-Kelce engagement to float theconspiracy theorythat NFL games could be rigged for Kelce’s team, the Chiefs. “I hope that the NFL does not put a thumb on the scale for the Kansas City Chiefs just because Travis Kelce is now getting married to maybe the most famous woman in the world,” Vance told USA Today in an interview on Wednesday.It’s not just the right projecting their hopes, dreams and weird Super Bowl fantasies on to Kelce-Swift. Some Swifties have beengushing overwhat a great guy Kelce is because “he has no issue with Swift being successful”. While Kelce may well be supportive of his megastar fiancee, let’s not get carried away and frame him as some sort of feminist. The football star has called women “breeders” in the past and defended his Kansas City Chiefs teammate Harrison Butker after Butker delivered a bigotedcommencement speechlast year, calling Pride month a “deadly sin” and telling women they should be more excited about getting married and having kids than having a successful career. Kelcemade clear thathe doesn’t agree with the majority of Butker’s views, but said it wasn’t his place to criticize them. Kind of a slap in the face to all of Swift’s queer fans for her husband-to-be to let the Pride comments slide, just because Butker has always been nice to him.Various other hot takes about the engagement abound. The business press have been talking about how the engagement mightboost stocksand marketing trade journals have been looking atbrand reactions. No doubt even defence industry publications (which have previouslyput out bangerslike What Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift Can Teach Veterans About Federal Resumes) will find an angle.If you can’t beat them, join them: since it’s the Swift Hot Take Super Bowl, I’ll quickly get mine in. I think the singer is very talented, and I’m glad she makes a lot of people very happy, but I do wish she would do aMs Racheland use her unmatched influence to shame politicians into action on Gaza. Or at least follow the lead of theYouTuber Lindsay Ellisandraisemoney for suffering kids. Parents are having to watch theirchildren wither awayamid aman-made faminefacilitated (and denied) by the US. Doctors are coming back from Gaza withharrowingstories about Israeli soldierstargeting kidswith shots to the head and deliberately shooting teenage boys in thetesticles. You can argue all day about whether celebrities have an obligation to speak out about injustice or not but, ultimately, having so much influence and choosing not to use it in the face of a genocide your government is helping to perpetuate, and your engagement knocks from the front page, is not “neutrality”. It is a deliberate choice.Amnesty calls for end of investigation into Polish doctor who performed abortionLast year, Dr Gizela Jagielska was targeted byanti-abortion extremistsafter she provided a legal late-term abortion to a woman in a hospital in southern Poland after her unborn baby was diagnosed with a fatal foetal anomaly. Poland has some of the most restrictive abortion laws in Europe. Jagielska is being investigated by authorities and faces possible imprisonment of up to eight years. “Instead of investigating Dr Jagielska’s conduct, the Polish authorities must look into the attacks she has faced since the investigation was announced,” Amnesty Internationalsaid in a statementthis week.Now I ain’t saying she’s a gold digger… but she is trademarking the termWhat first attracted the 24-year-old former cheerleader Jordon Hudson to the 73-year-old multimillionaire Bill Belichick, I wonder? We may never know. But do we know thatHudson’s companyhas filed a trademark application for the term “gold digger”, to be used on jewellery or keychains. Instead of getting huffy about the jokes about her being attracted to Belichick’s big bank account, she’s monetizing them.Italian police investigating porn site with doctored pictures of prominent womenIf you are a woman in the public eye, it’s almost inevitable that insecure men will use technology tohumiliate you online. And the tech bros who keep telling us AI will revolutionize the world seem helpless (or just not interested) when it comes to stopping it.Snoop Dogg is‘scared to go to the movies’ because of animated lesbiansThe musician has called himself a “gangsta” but he’s apparently terrified of two fictional women parenting a child together. Snoop told a podcast he washorrifiedwhen he took his grandson to see Pixar’s Lightyear and the child asked about the two gay mums in the movie. Instead of just answering his grandson’s question like a normal person, Snoop clutched his pearls.Denmark apologises for forced contraception of Greenlandic womenIt’s estimated that 4,500 women and girls were fitted with contraceptive coilswithout their permission or knowledgein the 1960s in an attempt to reduce the population of Greenland.UK gender pay gap underestimated for two decades, report saysThe faulty methodology, which gave undue weight to large companies, resulted in an underestimate of a “small but noteworthy” margin of one percentage point,new researchsays.Fertility rate hits record low in England, Scotland and WalesAnd we will continue to seeheadlines like thisuntil the cost of living goes down (or wages rise in response) and having children becomes more affordable.Grammy-award winning singer Tems is helping African women navigate music industryThe Nigerian singer-songwriter and producer, born Temilade Openiyi,has launched the Leading Vibe Initiativeto try to help more young women in Africa overcome the hurdles of breaking into the music industry.How an oil spill in Mauritius led to a female revolution in farmingAfter a wrecked ship polluted the water and sank the local economy, a group of women formed the South-East Ladies Agro collective and started “bringing home the bok choi”.The week in pawtriarchyIn the Guardian, Frances Ryanconsiders the impaw-tant question: is it wrong to throw a birthday party for my dog?

But that has become harderSat 30 Aug 2025 16.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 30 Aug 2025 20.48 EDTShareThe treasurer, Jim Chalmers, emerged obviously excited and energised from this month’s economic reform roundtable. He later said on the ABC’sInsidersprogram: “We need to ensure collectively as Australians that the fair go is the defining part of our future and not just the defining part of our past.”Chalmers grew up far from the rich, hilly, riverside suburbs of Brisbane. He still lives in, and represents, the seat of Rankin to Brisbane’s south. For him, access to the admirable, but slippery, Australian dream of a fair go was life changing. Tertiary education was the key, access which is sadlybecoming much harderfor many.Chalmers’ alma maters – Griffith University and ANU – were then (and still strive to be) unapologetic values-led institutions with passionate academics determined to share knowledge, encourage critical thinking and cherish the public good. Academics who watch their former students succeed, pleased years later to see, in DH Lawrence’s words, “the ideas of one generation become the instincts of the next”.When the roundtable embraced the need to address intergenerational inequity as a key priority,many were surprised.They should not have been. The wealthy middle-aged folk sitting around that table had reams of data and analysis on the scale of the problem, particularly in relation to taxation.But most knew from experience that without their help, their children would struggle to buy a house, pay their university fees, earn a good income, find and afford safe, reliable childcare while facing the crippling fear of climate change. And as members of the sandwich generation they also knew that their elderly parents were finding it difficult to get support to live at home or find residential care in the expensive – “investable” as the health minister,Mark Butler, puts it – but catastrophically under-resourcedaged care system.None of this should have been unexpected. The first intergenerational report prepared by Treasury was published in 2002 – all the problems that are now causing such distress and upheaval were flagged in that glossy document.The former Treasury secretary Ken Henry oversaw that publication and since retiring has become a stalwart advocate of the need to fix what he has pithily described as “intergenerational bastardry”.His critique goes beyond the flawed mechanics of tax and environmental policies, as he tolda meeting of the Royal Society of NSWlast year: “Every generation of Australians since the first wave of European settlement has celebrated plunder, dumb luck, and ‘finders keepers’. This is what we mean by ‘a fair go’.“In considering the merits of any policy proposal, every generation of Australians accorded the privilege of suffrage has only ever asked one question: what’s in it for me? It is time to ask ourselves some serious questions about the consequences of our ‘fair go’ ethos.“Questions like these: Why have we supported a set of public policies that have heavily degraded the natural environment; energised a drift of wealth away from workers, in favour of retirees, property owners and mercantile interests; and entrenched an economic structure that, for two decades, has delivered very low productivity growth and even weaker real wages growth?”Disappointment in the failure to realise the good ideals once promised in “the land of the fair go” have transferred from one generation to the next and are now informing the overwhelmingly progressive politics of those under 40. In raw political terms Chalmers is right; younger voters will be the ones who will determine his future.For years Australian policymakers and politicians thought they could square the circle: a market-driven economy with a robust social safety net. But that has become harder – the inexorable logic of the market is almost unstoppable but so is the demand for public services.Market logic prevailed and a new cohort of entrepreneurs was born; people who facilitate essential services in care, employment, education, even counselling. Many do a good job but some are crooks. Others are a new manifestation of Henry’s “finders keepers” people who see an opportunity to build a chain of care centres, based on government funding and client co-contributions, before selling up and buying squillion-dollar houses.The clear analysis of the failings of the tax system presented by the CEO of the Grattan Institute,Aruna Sathanapally, at the roundtable did not deserve to bedismissed by the prime ministeras academic talk. This is a challenge that must not be allowed to be considered too hard; it will only get harder.One thing Sathanapally did not mention was that in the next two decades trillions of dollars will pass from baby boomers to their children. Unlike almost every comparable country, this will be mostly tax free. If this occurs without addressing the underlyingpolicy failures– in tax, education, care, environment – any hope of ensuring “the fair go is the defining part of our future” will die when this money hits the bank accounts of those who now feel hard done by.Julianne Schultz is emeritus professor in media and culture at Griffith University and a fellow of the Royal Society of NSWExplore more on these topicsAustralian economyOpinionJim ChalmersAustralian politicsInequalityTaxWelfareAustralian universitiescommentShareReuse this content"

But few in the west know the multicultural, unusual Dubai that I’ve seen up closeSat 30 Aug 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 30 Aug 2025 09.32 EDTShareDubai is on everyone’s lips. One side of social media salivates over its curated opulence. The other sneers at a city that has become a byword for excess. Barely a week goes by without the British press telling the story of somebodymoving to Dubaifor lower taxes or, conversely, that the “Dubai dream is dead”.The city-state benefits from this discourse-fuelled soft power. It strikes both the haves and have-notes. Dubai fever is democratic. The city is an El Dorado of the east for remittance-sending strivers, sun-seeking expats and scammers. For many, it represents an unsettling post-western horizon. A version of the future that is already here. Rows of supercars overlooking glittering marinas. Toothy-grinned influencers, crypto bros and aspiring entrepreneurs crowding the same clubs.Labubusdangling from designer handbags. We’re enamoured of this cliche of Dubai, a historyless slab of a place, where the right price can buy you anything and anyone. But behind this binary view is another way of looking at Dubai – a place that is much more interesting and unusual than is often understood.The city’s past and present is often reduced to the 2 sq km of downtownDubai, where visitors congregate. This is the centre of luxury, where records are made to be broken. It is a panorama of lavish hotels and flashy restaurants, with the Burj Khalifa, the world’s tallest building, providing an apt backdrop. This image may be a defining one, but it says very little about the mundane joys and pains of life in Dubai.I remember visiting an industrial district to attend a poetryreading organised by a collective of young Dubai-based Filipinos. Their work grappled with the oddities of second-generation life. What does belonging mean when it isn’t enshrined by citizenship? How do you build a foundation on shifting sands? These locals spoke from within an intensely stratified society in which identities are both fixed and surprisingly porous. Dubai is the natural habitat of the “third culture kid”. Everywhere, you overhear the chameleonic lilt of international school accents. As a Londoner, I speak to Dubai-raised Somalis and recognise the bruised tenderness with which they describe their city. You don’t get to choose your home town. The heart is ungovernable.View image in fullscreenPeople at the Global Village shopping complex in Dubai, 2 November 2024.Photograph: Fadel Senna/AFP/Getty ImagesToday expats make up85% of Dubai’s population. Through their businesses, schools, cultural centres and social clubs, various diasporas assert their presence. The city hosts the largest Malayali community outside India. Iranian art dealers rub shoulders with Afghan handymen. A Lebanese property developer shares little more than a language with the underpaid north African waiter taking their order. A decade-deep, Sudanese middle class thrives inthe very country that is inflamingSudan’s continuing civil war. Dubai is home to generations of immigrants who have sought shelter and opportunity. Their children face the challenge of reclamation.It has also long been a transit hub, connecting travellers to motherlands that weren’t properly served by European or North American airlines. (Emirates, the flag-carrier airline, savvily capitalised on this, furiouslyexpanding throughout the 1990s and 2000s.) For many, Dubai came to represent hazy layovers and family reunions. Sheer necessity introduced outsiders to the city. Others, including me, visited extended family members who resided in the emirate. The Dubai we encountered was one of polyglot haggling, stuffed suitcases and relentless change. Each layover, each summer, revealed a dramatically transformed city, with towering additions to its skyline. This was the city as pure id, a glittering “urban spectacle” as the scholar Yasser Elsheshtawy put it. Coining the term “Dubaization”, Elsheshtawy named the hyperreal extravagance of the city’s urban landscape, an aggressive, cash-flush development model that has become a global blueprint. Dubai leads, often to where we would rather not follow.Later, as an adult, my trips to the city were defined by work. For a brief spell I lived in Al Raffa, a bustling old neighbourhood. The Dubai I found this time embraced its jostling contradictions. In the Deira district, I shared a platter of Tamil food with a Nigerian film-maker, who recommended a local Ethiopian hairdresser. At a rooftop bar crammed with rowdy South Africans, I met a Somali-American flight attendant recovering from a nervous breakdown. We laughed at the absurdity of seeking stability in a place as transient as Dubai.On another trip, an Ethiopian millennial detailed the humiliations she endured when renewing her residency visa. She had lived in Dubai for most of her life, and had no intention of leaving. I had been aware of the other Dubai, the metropolis behind the myth, but these conversations still disarmed me. The city is attracting a different class of newcomers, those who had never expected to settle there.View image in fullscreenPassengers at Dubai international airport, 24 June 2025.Photograph: ReutersDubai has always been a cosmopolitan place – Baloch traders have settled there for centuries, seafaring Emiratis spoke Hindi and the Indian rupee was a local currency well into the 1960s. And there’s nothing new about Britons flocking to a part of the world, the Persian Gulf, that was shaped by British imperialism. As a sheikhdom, Dubai was one of the Trucial States, part of Britain’s informal empire in the Persian Gulf from the early 19th century to 1971.No amount of historical amnesia will change that. The British expat is a stock character of the 20th-century oil boom, with British people working as engineers, administrators, technicians and educators. The “Jumeirah Jane” stereotype was born in that era, a term referring to the leisurely wives of expats who spent their afternoons by the pool. Repelled by Britain’s broken social contract, many of today’s young professionals idealise the tax-free plushness of Dubai life. (It’s worth noting that the confectionery crazeDubai chocolatewas invented by a British-Egyptian woman based in the city.) In my own circles, Dubai became a refuge for working-class graduates who felt disproportionately victimised by years of austerity. Their careers flourished in the Gulf, and their passports guarded them against the worst forms of exploitation. For once, they had the upper hand.But the west has a habit of hoarding complexity for itself. The rest of the world is rendered one-dimensional, a vulgar composite of tropes. This lack of curiosity extends even to the migrant labourer, the quintessential symbol of abjection in the Gulf. We live in a time where domestic workers in the United Arab Emirates chronicle their daily lives on TikTok, responding to the comments of interested viewers. For those who are looking, there has never been greater access to the hopes and struggles of low-wage migrants.Contemporary Gulf literature breathes life into stories often reduced to statistics. The children of the city’s labourers are now writing about their parents’ struggles. Dubai Puzha by Krishnadas, Tania Malik’s Hope You Are Satisfied and Deepak Unnikrishnan’s Temporary People depict the modern Gulf metropolis with humanity and humour. Dubai-set Malayalam dramas and films portray migrants scrimping and saving, finding camaraderie along the way. Cinema continues to take a sweeping view of the migrant experience, with films such as Deira Diaries (2021) tracing four decades in the life of a Keralan expat. Such narratives peel away the person from the occupation. Migrant workers become more than objects of pity. Prickly, lovelorn, shrewd, pragmatic; we are increasingly exposed to their inner lives.When it comes to the Singapores, Dubais and Shenzhens of the world, a certain kind of inattentiveness plagues those opiningfrom the west. It’s easier to tell half the story, to bat away complexity. Peer into the crush of glass and sweat, dreams and desperation. Dubai is a funhouse mirror. You’ll see what you want to see.Momtaza Mehri is a writer and researcher.

History will damn much of the UK media for failing to do thatSat 30 Aug 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 30 Aug 2025 11.44 EDTShareAt the end of August the Sun put a picture of a pink poodle-shaped balloon on its front page, not to illustrate the last dog days of summer but the latest migrant hotel scandal, a story that has dominated the UK news agenda for weeks. In this case,the “balloonacy” of teaching hobbies to asylum seekers.The silly season, in which the press seeks to entertain readers with lighter news during the summer, is cancelled this year.Anti-migrant papers such as the Sun, the Mail, the Express and the Telegraph have, predictably, delivered most of the 1,571 stories mentioning “migrant” and “hotel” over the past month, but according to the media archive siteNexis, reporting about the issue has shifted in many other parts of the media. The plight of refugees is now consistently framed as a threat to “locals”, with even the broadsheet Times reporting a court case citing legal obligations under the inflammatory print headline: “Hotel migrant rights outweigh those of locals, ministers argue”.Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, tells me of toxic coverage with real-life consequences. “The mainstream media and political opinion is in a very different place than it was a year ago. Now there’s an idea that everyone coming here is a potential sexual predator, a potential criminal.”Sections of the press have long delighted in stories of division and outrage rather than nuance and debate. But now – and this may be crucial – they have the added difficulty of having to compete with social media as to which is best placed to speak for “the people’.View image in fullscreenWe see a symbiotic relationship – with politicians jumping on populist bandwagons and using the rightwing media to do so, who then flood their websites with the resulting outrage. This circular obscenity has seen shadow cabinet ministers such as Robert Jenrick playing to the media galleryoutside migrant hotels this summer. Conservative party leader Kemi Badenoch joined the unvirtuous circle with her claim that “Women are afraid to go for runs in the park as men lurk in bushes”, echoing a Telegraph story last month quoting “Sophie”, who lives near a migrant hotel and said she would never walk home alone at night as “You just don’t know who is hiding in a bush.” It’s rabble rousing 360 degrees.Standing in the middle of the circle now is Nigel Farage, whose policy of holding weekly press conferences during parliamentary recess has allowed him – with conspicuous help from media devotees – to dominate the headlines. This week, he was buoyed by journalists asking not whether his plan toreturn 600,000 migrantswas the right thing to do, but rather if it is workable.He then passed his torch to the Mail: “Finally, a politician who gets it”, said its front-page splash. “Other political parties can snipe all they like,but Mr Farage is in tune with Middle Britain”.The Sun, in an editorial headlined “plans for Nigel”, agreed that Farage understood “ordinary Britons” and understands their “total despair”. The Telegraph on its front page welcomed the fact that the Taliban would give Farage “a deal”.Only the leftwing Mirror, in a front-page story by veteran journalist Paul Routledge, broke ranks with a headline: “Britain is better than this – forget Farage, we need more decency and humanity”.Outside the circle, the Financial Times,shared a warningfrom the world’s leading central bankers, including the Bank of England’s Andrew Bailey, that the biggest economies faced an “acute challenge” of ageing populations and needed immigrants.But that sort of thing struggles to break through. It is the circle that holds sway.It’s hard to be completely sure what is dictating the tone of the rightwing media coverage. Is it that the outlets and their proprietors want to see Farage in No 10 – on the basis that would be best for the country – or do they merely believe potential audiences want that and seek to reflect them? Any consideration of that question must also considerfalling newspaper circulations. The race to be the voice of “the people” may also be about survival.It seems unlikely that the warmer tone of Rupert Murdoch and his News UK titles yet adds up to wholehearted support for Farage, but they are a sign that they are restless. And anger, grievance and radical plans do sell news.What of the BBC? Can it be and remain an honest broker? Can it reflect the views of those living in the country’s poorest neighbourhoods, who feel ignored by the media and politicians alike, and the concerns of refugees and those who support them? It’s a debate mired in political opportunism and submerged in mendacity, so that’s a big ask of the BBC, but it must deliver.Journalism is often described asthe “first draft of history”, but can anyone, looking at today’s newsstands, reviewing today’s output, really think that history will be anything but damning?First, do no harm. Punch up, not down. Shed more light than heat. These sentiments, in different ways, used to mean something in our media. They still could. They still should. And if they did, perhaps migration – its effect on people, its effect on our country and its effect on our communities – would get the debate it deserves.Jane Martinson is professor of financial journalism at City St George’s and a member of the board of the Scott Trust, which owns the Guardian Media GroupExplore more on these topicsMediaOpinionImmigration and asylumcommentShareReuse this content"

If we reject their humanity, how can we be proud of ourselves?Sat 30 Aug 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 30 Aug 2025 08.14 EDTShareNo one in their right mind thinks accommodating asylum seekers in hotels is a good idea. No one in their right mind thinks we should just live with undocumented, life-threatening migration routes into the UK. And no one in their right mind thinks the experiences endured by most migrants could be a rational choice for anyone. Forget for a moment the ludicrous, inflammatory posturing of many who should know better; we ought to be able to begin from these shared acknowledgments.Using hotels for housing vulnerable migrants is the equivalent of what prison reform campaigners have long called warehousing – make sure a problematic group is simply corralled somewhere more or less secure, and hope their issues will somehow sort themselves out. The chaos and under-resourcing of the legal processes involved and the shocking levels of delay mean that the conditions are created for maximal insecurity and rootlessness – at worst, resentment and criminality. And we have to face the fact that, so long as safe and legal routes for asylum seekers are inadequate, we are colluding in the flourishing industry of lethal and illegal systems whose effect is to create communities for whose safety and integration government is unable to plan, and who are trapped in a situation both dehumanising for them and challenging for localities where they are placed.Not a new issue: I have vivid memories of meetings more than 25 years ago in the post-industrial town in south Wales where I then worked, trying to broker discussion between local groups from socially deprived areas and various community and religious organisations, in the wake of what came across as a casual announcement from the government of a new initiative to settle significant numbers of asylum seekers in the town. Anger and bewilderment, yes, and an element of real hostility – but also a plaintive sense that yet again local voices had been completely ignored in a way that was all too familiar.But here’s the point of contact. We have become used to the insidious language of the “migrant crisis” as a matter of the interests of “ordinary people” over a consolidated mass of threatening, predatory, incomprehensible strangers – typically the young, foreign (and usually minority ethnic) male. Thehorrors of Southport last year, which had nothing to do with the immigration system, instantly produced a reinforcement of this perception that has grown stronger and stronger. But the truth is that the migrant, too, is an ordinary person. Anyone who has spent time with refugees – in Ukraine, in Syria, in Sudan, in Kent or Swansea – knows the conversations that are likely to happen. I never thought I could find myself here. I only want to make sure my children are safe. I miss my garden. I don’t know where my parents are. I don’t know how I can continue my education. To speak as though these people are anything other than ordinary is to reinforce the violence they have already experienced, the refusal to see them humanly.People in hotels, hostels, detention centres, are not there as a lifestyle choice – which is why it is not only unjust but absurd to punish them for being there. And to threaten such people as a way of pressurising the government to do something different is simple blackmail. Collective blame and indiscriminate violence are always the beginning of real moral corruption. A lot more work needs to be done to make audible the voices of actual individuals in the system, a lot more listening to the ordinariness of what they want and what they are afraid of. And at the moment, thanks to the rhetoric of both the nationalist right and some voices in or near government, what causes most fear among settled and newly arrived migrants is that they are assumed without argument to be criminal, morally alien, actively hostile to the communities around them. Can we stop talking about such people as not ordinary? Can we stop assuming that “ordinary people” are on one side of a zero-sum war?Much has been written about the failure of government and others to produce a counter-narrative around migration. But this needs to be not only a matter of generalisations about the benefits of diversity or whatever, but a story about the kind of vulnerabilities that people in the streets in the UK can identify with – something that amplifies the voice of the ordinary migrant and helps it to be recognisable. And this is most effective when grounded in local, face-to-face encounters, not only “official” exhortation. As with so many issues, facilitating proper deliberative and reflective opportunities within local communities is an urgent priority – perhaps the only thing that just might be able to challenge the standoff between the ordinary and the alien, and help each to recognise in the other some of the shared experience of being silenced and vulnerable.Still, the real counter-narrative issues goes deeper.The flags running up all around usare supposed to declare a pride in our identity and heritage. But what is it that we are proud of? What is it that we are defending? It is always moving when you hear, say, a student from a refugee background tearfully proclaiming their debt to Britain and their abiding loyalty to a country that has given them what they hardly dared hope for. We have good reason to be proud in the face of this. Internment camps,Ice-style snatch squads, payments to homicidal regimes for receiving returned migrants – none of this adds up to much in the way of “values”.It is natural and proper to be loyal to your neighbours and your history. But if this loyalty is no more than a sullen self-congratulation for just being where you are, it is not a project in which it is possible to take much pride. If we listen a bit harder to some of our migrant voices, we might be clearer about what others think we might have cause to be proud of. And we might start some proper cross-party conversation about what an immigration regime might look like that was committed to the safety and dignity of all the “ordinary” people involved in it.Rowan Williams is a former archbishop of CanterburyDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Then a shock diagnosis pitched them into an intense love affair ...Elizabeth GilbertSat 30 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTShareSometime in the summer of 2017 I wrote in my journal, “Jesus fucking Christ, please save me.” I was trapped in hell, and I could see no way out. Our beautiful, sunny, two-bedroom penthouse apartment in the East Village – which I had rented for Rayya to make her happy in the last months of her life – had become a dungeon of misery, danger, degradation, drugs. Rayya kept the shades drawn at all hours of the day, not only because the light hurt her eyes but also because she had become intensely paranoid that she was being watched by the police, and that they were coming for her.And, to be honest, the police might very well have come for her (for both of us, actually), because our apartment now contained thousands and thousands of dollars’ worth of cocaine – some of which Rayya was cooking down and shooting into whatever veins she could find upon her beaten-down, disease-ridden body, some of which she was freebasing, some of which she was snorting up her now constantly bloodied nose. But most of the coke, as of this moment, she had chopped up and laid out in thick rails on the coffee table, next to an overflowing ashtray, a bottle of whiskey, several bottles of morphine and trazodone and Xanax, a stack of fentanyl patches and a cluster of empty beer bottles. And these heaping lines of cocaine she counted, weighed and studied all day long.“What the fuck are you looking at?” she demanded, glancing up for a moment from her cherished cocaine heaps and peering at me through a blue haze of cigarette smoke – staring me down with hostile eyes that had not, as far as I could remember, blinked in days.Good question.What was I looking at?I was looking at somebody who was supposed to be dead by now – who had been given six months to live over 15 months earlier – but who simply refused to die. I was looking at somebody who had recently gotten kicked out of hospice (who gets kicked out of hospice, by the way?) for being aggressive and uncooperative to the kind, generous nurses and support staff who had been trying to help my beloved partner prepare her body and mind for a “death with dignity” – a death that, at this point, Rayya had utterly rejected in favour of plan B, which was to do enough drugs that she could feel immortal, that she could feel nothing.I was looking at somebody who had once been the only person on Earth who could make me feel completely safe and loved, but who now verbally abused me all day long, telling me that I was “a fucking shit show of a failure” when it came to taking care of her; that everything I was doing to try to help her was wrong; that I was a “needy little fucking crybaby” who had to “grow the fuck up”.Ifirst met Rayya Elias in the spring of 2000. I was 31 years old at the time, and married. I was on a certain path back then. Husband, nice house, good job, about to start a family. Except there was a problem with my hair, which was a frizzy mess. One day a friend told me I resembled a youngArt Garfunkel, and said I needed to do something about it. She suggested I go see this person named Rayya, who was cutting hair out of a walk-up apartment on Avenue C.I was dressed that day like a sales clerk at Banana Republic, which is how I always dressed back then. All khakis and cardigans. I remember my outfit clearly, because I looked and felt so different from Rayya, who was wearing black leather pants, a white tank top and motorcycle boots. I have fallen in love with many people at first sight, but I did not fall in love with Rayya Elias that day. In fact, I didn’t fall in love with her for another eight or nine years. But I did like her. She was funny and interesting and exotic.I remember asking Rayya about the strange coins that were piled up on her windowsill. She said they were her sobriety chips. I’d never seen one before, and she let me handle them. She had a coin for every milestone of her recovery – one day clean, 90 days clean, six months, one year, two years, three years.I knew I was messed up in terms of relationships but I didn’t know I’d become as addicted to Rayya as she was to drugsShe told me she’d been addicted to cocaine and heroin for most of her adult life, but had been clean for three years now. She showed me the scars on her arms from where she used to shoot speedballs. I remember how comfortable she seemed when talking about her former drug use, and how she used the wordjunkiewith a relaxed pride I’d never before encountered. How at home she appeared in her own battered survivor’s body!“It’s a fucking miracle I’m alive,” Rayya said. She was ablaze with the exuberant gratitude that I now recognize as being common in early recovery. This is the phase some people call “the pink cloud” – when the newly sober addict is high on the joy of simply being free at last from the grime and slavery of their dependency. They don’t need anything more than what they’ve got in the present moment, because they can’t believe they get to evenhavea present moment. Life feels simple, bright, limitlessly possible.Rayya didn’t fall in love with me that day, either. I was nothing like her other friends. I wasn’t punk, cool, tough, edgy. There was nothing street about me. Still, she was impressed that I was making a living as a writer and had a relatively untormented relationship with creativity. Whywasn’tI more tormented? she wanted to know. My life seemed like a curiosity to Rayya – just as curious as her life was to me.If this were a 12-step meeting in the recovery fellowship that I attend on a regular basis, and if I were speaking about my own addiction, this is how I would begin: “Hi, my name is Lizzy and I’m a sex and love addict.” If I wanted to get more specific about the matter, I might add: “I’m also a romantic obsessive, a fantasy and adrenaline addict, a world-class enabler, and a blackout codependent.”My addiction manifests as a sincere yet deeply misguided belief that somebody outside of myself will miraculously be able to heal me on the inside – thereby making me feel safe, cherished and whole at last. I have spent my entire life searching for that magical person who will see me and save me.As with many addictions, it can be fun at first, but then it quickly becomes hell. Because here’s how the story always ends up, whenever I fall into desire and obsession to this degree: as my addict brain becomes increasingly tolerant of these abnormally elevated levels of hormones, I will eventually need to score bigger and bigger hits of “reward” to experience the same high I felt at the beginning of the romantic encounter. I will do anything to get that release and relief again.Gilbert and Elias in Melbourne, Australia, in 2013.Photograph: courtesy of Elizabeth GilbertSoon I am neglecting my own life as I increasingly fixate upon the person who has become my source. My behaviour becomes more dangerous, more desperate, more clinging, more demanding, as I insist that the object of my infatuation keep stimulating the release of the hormones that my brain is now telling me I need in order to survive. If the person cannot or will not deliver the goods any more, I can’t get my craving satisfied. And when I can’t get my craving satisfied, my adrenals will crash. After the crash comes withdrawal. And when I go into withdrawal, I want to die.The whole time I was getting involved with Rayya – becoming her friend, falling in love with her, being driven to the edge of madness by her awful relapse into active drug addiction – I didn’t know that I was suffering from a dangerous addiction, too, which was leading both of our hearts into treacherous territory. I mean, I knew I was plenty messed up, in terms of my romantic relationships, but I didn’t know I was anaddict. And I certainly did not know that, over time, I would become just as addicted to Rayya as she was to drugs.Iran away from my first husband and toward another guy. We got high as hell off each other for a while, and then we crashed – hard. After my breakup, I quit my job, sold everything and travelled the world, searching for something – anything – that would heal my heart and restore meaning to my life. I met a charismatic Brazilian man who poured love, attention, validation and approval upon me with lavish abundance. We moved back to America and got married.I wrote a book about my travels. That book becameEat Pray Love. Suddenly I had a shit ton of money. When those big, fat Eat Pray Love royalty checks started rolling in, my distorted thinking informed me that I was undeserving of all this abundance: why was I so blessed when others still struggled? A solution arose in my imagination: I must give all my money away!For codependents, fostering dependency in others makes us feel safe, valuable and in control. And pretty soon I was hurling cash at people exactly the way I used to hurl my body at them. I paid off the credit card bills and school loans of my family members and friends; I bought them clothes and jewelry and houses; I invested in their businesses; I supported their artistic projects; I paid for their weddings; I sent them on dream vacations, subsidized their therapy, financed their home renovations and covered tuition for their children. I paid the medical bills of strangers, and I bought cars for neighbours who were going through tough times. I invented endless work projects around my home in order to give jobs to various local craftspeople.I tithed to churches I did not even attend.I was somewhat out of my mind back then is what I’m saying.During this time, I kept driving into the city to get monthly haircuts from Rayya – coming to know her better as time went by. When some of her friends let me know her marriage to her partner Gigi had ended and she was struggling financially, I said she could move into a converted church I’d bought in New Jersey if she just covered the utilities – and stay as long as she liked.After she moved in we became closer by the day. She called me whenever she was in trouble, just as I called her when I was in trouble. But it wasn’t only problem-solving that brought us together; it was also delight in each other’s company. Very soon, Rayya became my plus-­one for social events and professional engagements. She flew to London to do my hair and makeup for the British premiere of the Eat Pray Love movie – and she also walked the red carpet with me. We went to Mexico together, to Detroit, to Los Angeles, to Austin, to Australia, to New Zealand, to Miami. We went to the movies, to weddings, to Target, to McDonald’s, to Thanksgiving, to Beyoncé concerts, to karaoke, to the Jersey Shore. We met Oprah together.We tried on bras together, shopped for shoes together, ate Korean barbecue together, made tacos together, watched football games together, got Botox together. We were almost always out there in public now as “Rayya and Liz”. You might wonder how this impacted my marriage, but I convinced myself that there was absolutely no problem here. The way I saw it, I now had a platonic partner who enjoyed attending the sorts of social events with me that my husband disliked, and who also helped to stabilize my mental health.View image in fullscreenIn 2013, the year both had books published …View image in fullscreen… and at a party in 2015 to mark Gilbert’s next book, Big Magic. Photographs: courtesy of Elizabeth GilbertIn March 2013 Rayya publishedHarley Loco. In October of that year I publishedThe Signature of All Things. For both of us, these books were proving grounds and personal triumphs. Rayya’s memoir was evidence to herself, to her family and to her community that she had the discipline to complete a creative project, and that she – an immigrant kid who’d scarcely been able to finish high school – could really write.My novel was evidence to a legion of professional and amateur critics that, despite the wild commercial success of Eat Pray Love – a book that had shunted me straight into the chick-lit dungeon of many people’s imaginations – I could still deliver a novel that announced me as an important literary figure.I travelled all over the globe to promote it, and Rayya often came with me. We were interviewed together quite often, because people were becoming interested in our unlikely-seeming friendship: how had the Eat Pray Love lady and this street-smart Syrian ex-con become so close? My passionate devotion to Rayya – which I thought I was keeping so well hidden – was blazingly obvious in every story. Also, people kept snapping pictures of me gazing adoringly at my “friend” and I would cringe whenever I saw the results.But I can see now that Rayya and I were both at our most gleaming that year. Me, a happily married internationally famous author. She, a radiant example of the miracles of sobriety. Both of us out there selling our stories.On 25 April 2016, I got a phone call from Rayya. “Are you sitting down?” she asked, just like people do in the movies. I sat down. “They found tumours,” she said. “Lots of them. Not just in my liver. In my pancreas, too.” The breath left my body and for a long moment did not come back.I’d known that Rayya was getting a liver ultrasound that day, but I had assumed – as had she – that the results would be not only good but also cause for celebration. Rayya had recently learned that there was an amazing new treatment available for hepatitis C, a disease that had dogged her body for years. Hepatitis C had always been classified as incurable, but recently new medication had been shown to eradicate the virus completely from the liver when taken in intense doses over a period of six months to a year. Before, though, she had to get a liver ultrasound to find out whether she was a good candidate for the cure.Rayya explained that when the technician had looked at the images on his screen, he had suddenly gone quiet. He’d left the room and called for a doctor, who came in and looked at the images, too. The doctor also went quiet. “I swear, the temperature dropped by about 10 degrees,” she told me later. “Nobody was talking. And right then I knew I was gonna die.”After we hung up the phone, I lay down on my bed, and I wept and wept and wept. I knew then that I had to go to Rayya and be with her until her death. Everything would have to change. I told my husband the truth at last, about my feelings. And we agreed to end our marriage.View image in fullscreen‘After I confessed my love to her, I asked, “Do you like me that way?” Do you like methat way?’Photograph: Deborah LopezNow I had to tell Rayya. It was a simple conversation. After I confessed my love to her, I asked, “Do you like me that way?” Do you like methat way? I might as well have passed her a note after gym class reading “Check box, yes or no.”After a long silence, she opened her eyes and smiled. Then she gathered me up in her arms and said, “Baby, my baby. My beautiful baby, why did you take so long to come to me?”I don’t know whether it’s a normal reaction for somebody to experience a sense of euphoria after receiving a death sentence, but Rayya certainly did. “Everyone spends their lives wondering how they’re gonna die,” she said, “and now I get to know? That’s amazing! It’s done, it’s settled. Why do I feel like this is such great news? It just makes everything so easy.”Maybe it was because Rayya had already “died” so many times as a drug addict – flatlining in one overdose after another – that the news of her impending mortality did not much frighten her at first.“Let’s just blaze out,” she said, her eyes brilliant with an elation I had never before witnessed in her. “Let’s just live balls to the wall until I die!” Enthusiastically, fervently, grandly, I agreed to it all.Of course, I should also probably mention that we were high as hell at the time. If you ever want to see two people go on a wild bender, have them fall desperately in love with each other, make them suppress that love for about eight years, and then suddenly allow them to release their true feelings for each other – and do it against a compelling backdrop of imminent death, where there are literally no more consequences. If at least one of those people (but probably both of them, to be honest) is a sex and love addict, then the ride will become even more outrageous. That was the trip we were on, man, and we were flying.View image in fullscreen‘“Never leave me,” she would beg. “Never let me wake and not find you here.” I promised.’Photograph: courtesy of Elizabeth GilbertI began toreallypour myself into Rayya – showering her not only with love and care but also with money and resources. I completely took over her life from a financial standpoint, not only paying for her medical expenses and her rent and her bucket-list experiences but also buying her things. So many things! Anything Rayya had ever wanted I insisted she must now have. Had she specifically asked me for these things? I cannot now remember. But I desiredher. So I gave it all to her, and fuck the expense: I didn’t care if it bankrupted me.Do you want a Range Rover? Here is your Range Rover.Do you want a brand-new piano?

And boy, did we have fun.We were able to completely forget about the past, the future, mortality, life itself. They were the most iridescent and heightened few months of my life, and – I believe – of hers. But then, of course, it ended. Eventually somebody has to get out of bed and open the blinds and notice that there are 90 voice messages on their phone and stacks of mail piling up outside their door. There was still a world out there, goddamn it – and that world was trying hard to get Rayya’s attention.Rayya might have wanted to flame out in a blaze of glory, but a lot of people wanted her to stay. In the end, she caved to her family’s wishes that she fight the cancer and agreed to try chemo. “I’ll do it just to make everyone happy,” she said, “but I know I’m gonna hate it, and it’s not gonna work. So after three months, I’m gonna quit and do whatever the fuck I want again.”Chemotherapy turned out to be a dark and powerful sorcerer – effective but vengeful. It was brutal. But also, a great trust and tenderness grew between us. As the autumn progressed, our days had become more difficult, but my life’s purpose was radically simplified: I existed for no reason, I truly believed, except to serve Rayya’s needs.“Never leave me,” she would beg me at night, when she was in pain. “Never go anywhere without me. Never let me wake up in this bed and not find you here by my side.” I promised her again and again that I would never leave her.“Absolutely not,” was my constant reply. “I’m not going anywhere. I won’t ever leave your side, not even for a moment.” I’d heard of people who got overwhelmed by the job of caretaking a sick loved one, but those people obviously didn’t know how to love people as hard or as powerfully as I knew how to love people. Others might crack or have needs of their own – but not me. Never me! I had no need for rests and breaks, no need for outside assistance. I had the whole situation handled. I hadlove; I didn’t need any help!The truth was, though, I was starting to crack.We spent Thanksgiving and Christmas with her family, and both occasions were precious, boisterous and sweet. We spent New Year’s Eve together in New York City. We got drunk that night, knowing without a doubt that 2017 would be Rayya’s final year on Earth.On new year’s morning I went for a walk to the East River, to make my new year’s wishes by the water, as I always do. When I reached the water, I wept. Rayya was getting sick again, I knew it. I had noticed that her abdominal swelling and episodes of pain and vomiting were increasing. The cancer was growing again.As the first weeks of the new year went by, Rayya was often in such deep pain that she could not sleep for more than an hour or two a day. There were some good days during that time. Friends threw Rayya an exquisite birthday party, and she and I had a commitment ceremony in front of our loved ones, complete with flowers and rings and beautiful wedding clothes. But most of the time, we were in torment. Rayya could not bear to be alone in her anguish, and because she didn’t sleep, I didn’t sleep. If I dozed off while she was talking to me, she would become furious, and I would wake up to hear her sobbing, accusing me of abandoning her. Or she would wake me up to tell me, “I just want to go back to bed and cover my head and sleep.”During Elias’s cancer treatment in 2016: ‘“I’ll do it to make everyone happy,” she said, “but I know I’m gonna hate it, and it’s not gonna work.”’Photograph: courtesy of Elizabeth Gilbert“OK, baby,” I would say. “Let’s see if we can tuck you back in, then.”“You just want me to die. You just want to get rid of me.”Soon we were both shredded – she from physical pain and fear of death, both of us from sadness, exhaustion and lack of sleep. Something clearly needed to be done. That’s when morphine was recommended. And whyever not? Everyone knew that Rayya had once been an opioid addict, but nobody was worried about addiction now – because she was a terminal cancer patient on a death watch.“Let the dragon roll one more time,” she said when she finally put that first morphine pill in her mouth. And indeed the dragon rolled itself awake. The dragon opened its yellow eyes and lifted its leathery, powerful wings and flew on silent gusts through Rayya’s bloodstream. And instantly, magically, my beloved’s suffering was erased – just as her suffering hadalwaysbeen erased by opioids.How swiftly that moment of peace came to an end, after the first morphine pill disappeared into Rayya’s system. How quickly the dragon of addiction began to roar through Rayya’s blood, demanding what it always demands –more, more, more.Addiction: a disease Rayya and I were both powerless over, in our own awful ways. Love addiction, drug addiction, dependency, codependency – it’s all the same thing: a disease so tireless and dirty and dignity-consuming that it will never rest until you’re ruined.Addiction. A disease so insidious and vile that – I swear to God – it makes terminal cancer look like a day at the beach.I came up with a good idea for what would save me from the nightmare I was now trapped in with Rayya. I would kill herIt was in July of 2017 that I came up with a really good idea for what would save me from the nightmare that I was now trapped in with Rayya.I decided I would kill her.I am not talking here about a mercy killing, or euthanasia, or helping someone who is in great suffering to have a death with dignity. Rayya, at that point, most certainly did not want to die, and she no longer gave a shit about her dignity. All she wanted to do was consume as much cocaine, alcohol, prescription drugs and cigarettes as she could get her hands on; to monologue about how amazing and powerful she was for defying all the doctors’ prognoses about her “expiration date”; to doze off while smoking cigarettes in bed, until the sheets and pillowcases smoldered from her dropped embers; to pick hallucinated worms and bugs off her hot, itching skin; and to tell me what a total fucking failure I was as a human being for not taking better care of her.And because she would not sleep, I could not sleep. Every time I shut my eyes, she shook me awake and demanded that I pay attention to her, or bring her something she needed, or listen to speeches about how great she was and how terrible I was.She wasn’t even really experiencing physical suffering any more, because she was so incredibly altered that she couldn’t feel anything. So, no – Rayya did not want to die. ButIwanted her to die.I came up with the plan late one night when she had been awake for many hours, staring into a mirror with her eye only one inch away from the reflective surface, yelling at the demon that she swore she could see in her eye’s reflection – a demon who, she kept insisting, “lives all the way down there at the bottom of my brain”.I decided I would do it the next day. I went back to sleep that night in peace, knowing that liberation was finally in sight. I want to make something extremely clear here: when I say that I once planned to murder Rayya, I don’t mean that the idea simply crossed my mind that my life would be easier if she were gone. I mean that I fully intended to kill her. And I tell this story in all its raw honesty, because I want people to understand how insane codependency can make a person become. I mean, I’m the nice lady who wrote Eat Pray Love. And I came very close to premeditatedly and cold-bloodedly murdering my partner because she had taken her affection away from me, and because I was extremely tired.View image in fullscreen‘For a long, long time, we held each other’s gazes in silence. In that moment, it felt as if there were a break in the universe.’Photograph: Deborah LopezThe next morning, while Rayya nodded off in front of the TV, I stole some of her sleeping pills and morphine pills and took them to the park with me. While my fellow New Yorkers went about their business in the beautiful summer light, I sat on a bench, studying and comparing the two medications in the palm of my hand, trying to figure out how I could make the sleeping pills look like the morphine pills so I could trick her into taking a bunch of them.I would have to be careful about this murder, I knew – not because I was afraid of the police (I wasn’t even thinking about the police, I was so out of my mind) but because I was really, really afraid of Rayya. If she woke up and realized I was trying to murder her, I’d be dead. If I didn’t kill her, she would kill me. So I had only one chance to do the job right.When I returned to the apartment, my mood was strangely buoyant. I walked in cheerfully, saying, “Hi, honey! I’m back!” Rayya looked up at me from her seat by the coffee table – which was, as always, covered with cocaine and pills and booze.Without even blinking, and in a voice that was dead calm and sober, she said, “Don’t you start plotting against me now, Liz.” For a long, long time, we held each other’s gazes in silence. In that moment, it felt as if there were a break in the universe.“Think carefully about what you’re about to do,” Rayya said, in a voice that could not have been more lucid. Then her eyes glazed over once more, and she returned her attention to the coffee table covered with drugs, booze, cigarettes.Who did I think I was kidding, that I could kill her? Nobody could kill her. Cancer couldn’t even fucking kill her.Eat,  pray,  cash inRead moreWithout saying another word, I gathered myself up again and walked back out of the apartment. I wandered through the East Village for the next several hours in a daze, not knowing where to go or what to do now. Then suddenly I had a really brilliant inspiration! Maybe I should take the sleeping pills and the morphine! Wouldn’t that solve everything, with ease and efficacy?I mean, my life was already destroyed, so why not finish the job? The pills were right there in my pocket; the deed could be easily done. The only question was where to do it. I didn’t want to die on the streets and bother anyone, or make them have to deal with my corpse. Maybe I should walk to the river and throw myself in …Then I heard a voice in my head – a voice that pierced my confusion so cleanly and swiftly that it could only have come from God. The voice said this:If you have arrived at a point in your life where youare seriously considering murdering yourself or another human being,there is a strong possibility that you have reached the end of your power.I stopped walking.I listened harder.I leaned into the sound of God, offering me wisdom and guidance.That being the case, continued the voice,perhaps it’s time you called somebody and asked for help.I was sobbing and full of shame and anger as I called these people – tears and snot running down my face right there in public – but I called them anyway. I remember one of them said: “What they say about the stages of grief is true – denial, anger, negotiation –all those things do happen. But they don’t happen in tidy order. They sometimes happen all at once. That’s what’s happening to you and Rayya right now. You two tried to cram an entire lifetime together into a few months, so everything is condensed and super intense. All the joy, all the sorrow. You’re experiencing everything all at once.”Someone else said: “Here’s what you need to understand about other people’s addictions: you didn’t cause it, you can’t control it, and you can’t cure it. There’s nothing you can do to manage Rayya at this point, and the more you try to control the situation, the more you will lose. When it comes to other people’s addictions, whatever you try to control ends up controlling you.”Life doesn’t fall apart all at once, and it doesn’t get healed all at once, either. Sometimes a spiritual awakening takes a minute to sink in, or a few months, or a few years. But something started happening within me, after my day of sobbing conversations in the park with all my wisest friends. Something started turning toward the dim and distant light of comprehension.Rayya Elias died on 4 Jan 2018. She was 57 years old. As of this writing, I’ve been clean and sober for almost exactly five years. Today, I live alone in my church in New Jersey.This is an edited extract from All the Way to the River by Elizabeth Gilbert, published by Bloomsbury on 9 September at £22.

Her new book, Indignity, reconstructs the life of her grandmother, who arrived in Tirana from Salonica as a young woman and became closely involved with the country’s political life. She currently holds the Ralph Miliband chair in politics and philosophy at the London School of Economics. The Turkish writer Elif Shafak is author of more than 20 books, both nonfiction and fiction, including the Booker-shortlisted novel 10 Minutes 38 Seconds in This Strange World and, most recently, There Are Rivers in the Sky. When the pair talked over videocall, Ypi travelling in India and Shafak at home in London, their conversation ranged over the threats of censorship and the rise of populism, the challenges of being writers with multiple identities and the importance of representing complex historical events in their work.Elif ShafakIt’s the age of angst. There’s so much anxiety, east and west, young and old, so many people are anxious right now, it’s quite palpable. And I think in many ways, it’s the golden era for demagoguery, for the populist demagogue to enter the stage and say: “Just leave it with me. I’m going to make things simple for you.”Lea YpiWhat’s striking for me is the contrast between this really rich life that you find in literature and in academia, and the platitudes of politics. In literature there is an experimentation with genres and with cultures and with languages, and so you get this sense of complexity. You have almost the exact opposite happening in the political realm, where it’s all about simplicity. It’s all about being on message, not making it too complex. It has to be short. It has to be very simple, on the verge of banality. And increasingly, it’s also exclusionary. So there is this tendency in contemporary political discourse to say: OK, let’s drive out the migrants – a sense that you can only get a just society if you have homogeneous societies.It’s a golden era for the populist demagogue to enter the stage and say: Just leave it with meElif ShafakESIt’s important to talk about censorship as well. Not just the pressures that come from outside or above, but also from within: self-censorship. How do we overcome that? I come from a land in which words are heavy. Anything you write about, from sexuality to gender to memory to history, can offend the authorities. I had a taste of that when one of my novels, The Bastard of Istanbul, was put on trial: it tells the story of an Armenian American family and a Turkish family through the eyes of women, but it deals with memory, amnesia and the biggest taboo still to this day in Turkey, which is the Armenian genocide. When the novel was published, the prosecutor asked for three years in prison. The words of fictional characters were brought to court as evidence. And during that time, there were people burning EU flags, spitting at my picture, burning my picture, calling me a traitor.Years later two of my books were investigated for the crime of obscenity: 10 Minutes 38 Seconds in This Strange World because it has a sex worker in it, and The Gaze because it deals with subjects like child abuse, in a country where we have child brides, which, in my opinion, means child abuse. The reason I mention this is because these are the realities of the societies where we come from. We have to carve a space for ourselves in which we forget about all of that. Because if we start thinking, will people get offended? Will the authorities get upset? Then we cannot produce a single line.LYWhat has been important for me about growing up in Albania and then navigating the transition from communism to the post-communist period is that living in a totalitarian society makes you very, very sensitive to propaganda of all kinds, all the time. And so there was never actually this break where first I lived in an unfree world and then I became part of the free world, it was always about remaining vigilant to see where there is censorship and ideological manipulation and propaganda – even coming from places that seem completely innocuous and innocent at first.You’re always thinking about what is critically missing in a society in which you live: where is the gap in democracy? There is all this praise of freedom, and yet we live with politicians and people who make decisions that are so obviously constraining the freedom of other people everywhere.We have this expression in Albania: “Istanbul is burning and the old woman is combing her hair.” You worry that in some ways, what you’re doing is completely irrelevant, but you say to yourself: my job is just to be critical and to put pressure and to remember, to try and make people think about how the past shapes the future, how these ideas repeat themselves, and how these political conflicts in the present all have a history and all come from some unresolved trauma in the past.ESWe have so much in common: the subjects, the themes that we deal with, the geographies that we come from, but also the silences that we dig into. I think for both of us, memory is important, not in order to get stuck in the past, but because without remembering we cannot repair.LYIt starts by understanding how every voice out there is always a result of some power relation or other. This was my experience with writing Indignity, which was about my grandmother, and going into the archives. It turned out it was really hard to research a woman who lived in the 1920s and 30s in particular. She lived in Salonica, which was still very much culturally Ottoman when she was growing up. It had just become part of the Greek state, and they completely shaped the discourse of what they wanted to be told and how it was told.If you’re relying on official authority sources, they all have their own agenda, and by the way in which they construct the archive, by the way they write history, even by the way they shape literary traditions, they always have an agenda that is usually the agenda of the people in power. So how do you challenge that? I think it’s only when literature becomes resistance that it can challenge that, but it needs to explicitly want to do that.View image in fullscreen‘Being a writer is a bit like being a linguistic archaeologist: you have to dig through layers of stories’ … Elif Shafak.Photograph: Marc Sethi/The GuardianESI think being a writer is a bit like being a linguistic archaeologist: you have to dig through layers of stories, but also layers of forgettings. Of course, with the Ottoman empire, we’re talking about a multi-ethnic, multilingual, multi-religious empire that lasted for more than 600 years. It’s incredibly complex, and the story changes depending on who is telling it, but also what we are mindful of is who is not allowed to tell the story. That’s what we want to get at.So the way, for instance, Ottoman history is being taught in schools, and I went to Turkish schools: there’s a void, and that empty space is almost always filled by ultra-nationalistic, sometimes ultra-religious, imperial nostalgia that talks about what a great empire we were. Wherever we went, we brought justice and civilisation. The moment you start asking: OK, what about the stories of women? What was the Ottoman empire like for a prostitute, for a concubine in the harem, for a peasant woman who had no access to power or authority? Then there’s a huge silence. Or the moment you start asking about minorities, maybe a Jewish miller, a Kurdish peasant, an Arab farmer, a Greek sailor. What was the Ottoman empire like for them? Or an Armenian silversmith? Again, big silence.Literature has a democratic function only because it doesn’t preach – if you preach then you become authoritarianLea YpiBut if I may quickly add this, I don’t like it when writers try to preach or teach or lecture, and I think that’s something that we need to be very careful about.LYLiterature has this democratic function only because it doesn’t preach. If it were to preach, it would lose it. If you were to tell the reader: “This is how you should see the world, this is what’s right, and this is what’s wrong”, then you become authoritarian.And then, actually, literature loses this power that it has to continue with the reader. I don’t think the book is finished when the writer writes it: it continues to write itself in its reception, in the way people discuss it, in the way its themes feed into societal and cultural debates more broadly.When Free came out, people kept sending me this photo of [Turkish president] Erdoğan with the book during a summit to discuss the Armenia-Azerbaijan peace treaty. It’s kind of unpleasant at one level, because you see this book, and you know how you wrote it, and you know what you wanted to write, and it was all about freedom, and then suddenly you see these very authoritarian characters with it. In every society some politicians appropriate art of all kinds but my inclination is to just say: “Yeah, but that’s also part of the book’s story.”It’s a place of ambiguity, and I also have an ambiguous attitude to it; I don’t like the fact that I’m the writer who writes about Albania, or about communism, or what it’s like to live in totalitarianism and then in capitalism. What makes it special for me, and I’m sure this is the same for you, is that it’s a small place from which you can really reconstruct the world. Albania is a country that was under the Ottoman empire, but my home city, Durrës, was a Roman city. It has one of the largest amphitheatres in the Balkans. It was before that a Hellenic city. After that, it was a centre for Byzantium. It was occupied by Venice. So in this 100 sq metres in the centre of the city, you have millennia of European history.I always laugh when I hear discussions about joining the EU, because I think, when have we not been touched by the EU? When were we ever left alone by Europe?ESIt’s a heavy experience to be a Turkish novelist, and for a female novelist, I think it’s a bit heavier, because you need to deal with additional layers of misogyny and patriarchy. I don’t want to paint a completely bleak picture, but I also want to be truthful: you are slapped on one cheek, and there’s always that hurt, but simultaneously kissed on the other cheek, because readers read. Stories do matter, particularly in countries where democracy is diminishing: if a country is going backwards, ironically literature and the arts become all the more important. So there’s this very divided existence.LYI don’t know if it’s a depressing sign of the times that we have all these really interesting debates in the world of culture, which are not really reflected in anything going on in political world, where it’s actually, if anything, the opposite, where you have simplicity and reduction and exclusion. How is it possible that we’re not yet managing to find a way of bridging the two?ESI cannot ever forget the fact that I’m an immigrant in the UK. But equally, I’m someone who genuinely believes in multiple belongings. So of course, being Turkish is a big part of my work and who I am, but Britain also gave me so much. The English language gave me so much, and I’ve been writing in this language for more than 20 years now. How can I deny that it gave me a sense of home? But I would like to think of myself as a citizen of humanity, as a citizen of the world, which is something that has been belittled so much in this time of populist demagoguery. We’ve been told that if you’re a citizen of the world, you’re a citizen of nowhere, and that’s something that I want to challenge. I think that is wrong. We are living in a very complex era. We have massive global challenges ahead of us, and everything from the climate crisis to the possibility of another pandemic to deepening and widening inequalities, shows how deeply interconnected we are.Interview by Alex Clark.Indignity: A Life reimagined by Lea Ypi is published by Allen Lane on 4thSeptember.

It’s proof of an ancient trade network from Oman and across the Red Sea, which led the Nabataeans to be big players on the global map.HRThe Count of Monte Cristo9pm, U&DramaThis lavishly silly adaptation of Alexandre Dumas’ already daft novel has proved a reliable source of guilty amusement. Sam Claflin’s Count Edmond continues to saunter around villainously, this time conjuring some sneaky financial peril for Danglars and buying the freedom of bewildered Algerian slave Haydee, presumably for nefarious reasons.Phil HarrisonAnnika9.10pm, BBC One“They found a body in the river … you might need to come over.” It seems Annika can’t even enjoy a minibreak at an eco resort in Perthshire (albeit with a family struggle in tow) without a corpse popping up in the vicinity.

Nor was the choreographed nature of the engagement shoot.The series of five photographs, posted on Instagram and now liked 35m times, feature the couple in various acts of staged proposal within a landscaped garden festooned with roses and urns.The happy couple – or as they refer to themselves in the post, “your English teacher and your gym teacher” – both wore Ralph Lauren. Kelce, a navy cable-knit polo shirt and tailored shorts, and Swift a smocked white sundress which sold out moments after the post appeared. The images appear to be a peek into a private moment, yet every bloom, Cartier bracelet and rock had been stage-managed. Swift may be the world’s biggest pop star, but she’s even better at art-directing her own fairytale.Staged engagement photos have become one of the wedding industry’s freshest traditions, a way for couples to mark the moment – or at least a curated version of it.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Taylor Swift/Instagram/ReutersIn the past few years,Alline Beatricihas been photographing proposals and engagements alongside weddings. “This is very much a proposal shoot rather than an engagement shoot,” says Beatrici, who prefers a more naturalistic pose-free style. “Sometimes I’ll be hiding in a bush waiting for the proposal,” she says, “after which I’ll let things settle for half an hour, then go back for the engagement photos.”“It’s not out of the question that the [Swift/Kelce] proposal was a surprise, but these are celebrities so I suspect not. It’s a [giveaway] when people have their nails done.”Capturing these milestones, or moments of “micro-commitment”, began as an add-on for wedding photographers and a way of practising being in front of the camera before the big day. “I usually photograph them a few months after the engagement, but 80% of them won’t have a wedding date,” Beatrici says. The growth of the phenomenon in recent years is largely down to Instagram and TikTok, a symptom of how much social media feeds into marriage tradition. Beatrici encourages her couples to pick a meaningful venue rather than a photogenic one, but admits that the demands of social media tend to influence.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Taylor Swift/Instagram/ReutersSwift’s ability to emit sincerity, however orchestrated the situation, has been a crucial exercise in her image-building as a pop star, especially online. “It’s an easy way to communicate with a fanbase by showing an intimate glimpse into their life,” says Kadian Pow, a lecturer in sociology at Birmingham City University.“NothingTaylor Swiftdoes is just a simple celebration,” says Pow. “Last week she was on a podcast about her new album, now she’s announcing her engagement? It’s a nicely done tie-in … a way to have the fans and the media preoccupied with her narrative,” she says. It’s also a way to control that narrative, while galvanising the all-important parasocial relationships with fans. “There is an idea firmly entrenched that she was the nerdy girl lusting after a football player. In some ways it sends the message that she was able to manifest this. It’s part of her crafting of a persona.”‘I’m the one to beat’: is Taylor Swift’s Showgirl era set to take her to even greater heights?Read moreFor celebrities, engagement shoots now rival the pregnancy shoot, a well-worn trope in the fame-fashion alliance ever since Demi Moore appeared on the cover of Vanity Fair in 1991. Flowers tend to feature, as seen in Beyoncé’s Botticelli-esque pregnancy shoot from 2017, as does what you might call “relatable” styling, says Pow.At £230, her dress is relatively cheap for a high-end label. “You’re not supposed to look too dressed up for an engagement – lest you were expecting it – nor would they want to come across as anything other than clean and put-together,” says Avery Trufelman, of the critically acclaimed fashion podcast Articles of Interest. “The preppy look is casual, and yet has a degree of formality to it.”It helps, too, that it was on sale when the images dropped. Swift usually avoids luxury fashion in order to underscore her relatable image. But as a designer, Ralph Lauren is the sartorial embodiment of the wholesome American dream. “They, like Ralph himself, were very aware of the fairytale aspirational imagery they were making, and costumed themselves for the part,” says Trufelman. It also “aligns with the times that we’re in: the trad wife aesthetic”, adds Pow.View image in fullscreenRyan O’Neal and Ali MacGraw in Love Story.Photograph: Entertainment Pictures/AlamyThe styling is also evocative of the 1970 film Love Story, which coined the term “preppy’ while using fashion to denote class. Even Kelce’s sockless loafers are a code straight from 1980s’The Preppy Handbook, which advised “loafers worn at the country club, never with socks”.Kelce’s shorts may seem informal, but there is a grand tradition for men to hide rings inside their short pockets, which only furthers the calculated spontaneity behind the images – as if he really did just propose.Relatability has been “par for the course forever”, says Pow. It’s just the flowers that betray them, says floristJulia Campbell-Gillieswho thinks, given the season, the roses “would have been flown over from Ecuador and Colombia – I really hope they weren’t just for the photo-op”. And of course the bezel-cut Artifex diamond ring – which, according to Brides magazine, cost half a million dollars.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Taylor Swift InstagramExplore more on these topicsTaylor SwiftTravis KelcefeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was a CD single I found in a west London record shop, which I only picked up because it was by a bunch of brown guys.It was the summer of 1998,and I was 17 years old and browsing records in the Harrow Virgin Megastore, when I came across Free Satpal Ram by jungle-punk-rap bandAsian Dub Foundation– a buzzing, brilliant, ramshackle protest song about a south Asian man who had been sent to jail after defending himself in an alleged racist attack in 1986. While at an Indian restaurant, Satpal Ram was stabbed with a broken bottle, and retaliated by stabbing his attacker with a penknife; the man later died.Ram was convicted of murder the following year.I played the CD on my cousin Vimal’s stack hi-fi system, and afterwards was changed for ever. Sitting on the edge of his bed, reading the lyric sheet, I was shocked and furious at what I had heard. Maybe it was the buzzsaw guitars, mixed with the furious rapping, the Bollywood sample and the jungle drums, but that heady mix of music made me want to stand up and do something.The story of Satpal Ram terrified me, just as the murder of Stephen Lawrence terrified me. It was evidence that my worst fears could come true. That violence still stalked our streets, and there were people out there who wanted to kill people like me.I had grown up very aware of injustice. My mum once held a sit-in at her local newspaper to protest against racial bias in their crime reporting. My uncle brought the first ever case of racial discrimination under the 1968 Race Relations Act, which resulted in him meeting Malcolm X. Me? I sat in my bedroom listening to rap, eating crisps and longing to fight for something. Now, Asian Dub Foundation gave me the soundtrack to that fight.After a protest, I ended up in the pub with John Pandit. He told me he had just turned down an MBE, and I thought he was the coolest man everImmediately after hearing it, I wrote a letter to Ram in jail and joined an email group promoting anti-racist protests and meetings throughout the country. I started attending those meetings, always very quiet, intimidated to be surrounded by committed activists. A few months later, Ram wrote back, telling me of his conditions, saying that my letter offered him hope and that he was glad I had joined the struggle.The first protest I attended, I was by myself, standing across the road, watching as 10 protesters stood outside the Home Office with signs and placards. I awkwardly went to stand next to them, held the edge of a banner, threw up a fist in salute as a photo was taken, and then ran home.After a few more protests, I found my voice – joining in with the slogans, and talking to other people.After one of those early protests, I somehow ended up in the pub with John Pandit, one of the members of Asian Dub Foundation. He told me he had just turned down an MBE, and I thought he was the coolest man ever.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

The lead singer even mentored me briefly, during my short stint as a political rapper. I wrote about racism a lot, editing a collection of essays calledThe Good Immigrant, and my memoir,Brown Baby. Years later, I turned down an MBE myself, inspired by John.Nowadays, it feels normal for my kids to join marches, write placards, chant along and squeeze my hand when the shouts are peppered with swearwords. I still think back to my mum and her sit-ins and my uncle meeting Malcolm X, and to that hi-fi pumping out hard-as-nails drums and me mouthing along: “Time to join the fight back, because enough is enough.”Did a cultural moment prompt you to make a major life change?

A sea eagle, surprised to see humans, flaps away over the only house with a roof on it – the rest are in ruins. “Hundreds of people used to live here,” says Vidar. “In the days when you had to sail or row, it was important to be near the fishing grounds. Now there’s just one summer cabin.”Jumping out of the boat, we walk along the beach. My daughter, Maddy, points out some animal tracks. “The fresh marks are wild reindeer,” says Vidar. “The older ones could be moose – they come along here too.”View image in fullscreenBeyond the end of the beach are the small fields that the inhabitants once cultivated, now covered in wild flowers. In winter this would be an inhospitable place, but at the height of summer the flora and fauna are booming under a sun that never goes down. The people hunted a special type of cod, Vidar explains, theskrei, which migrates west from the Barents Sea to breed off Arctic islands such as this one, Skogsøya. This is the extreme edge of north-west Europe, isolated from the rest of Norway by a maze of twisting fjords and snow-capped inner islands. Head west from this beach and the first landfall is Greenland.“When did everyone leave?” I ask, watching an otter swimming around the cove and diving into the kelp beds.“It started with the terrible Arctic storm of 1893 that killed many people. Then the marine diesel engine came and they didn’t need to live out here. By 1952, they were all gone.”View image in fullscreenThe spectacular nine-mile Dronningruta hike is a major draw for visitors.Photograph: Christian Roth ChristensenRudolf Diesel probably never meant to redefine the meaning of “remote”, but that’s what his eponymous engine did. Patented in that same year of 1893, his invention would inadvertently redraw the map of this coast. Places once inaccessible up long fjords could now prosper as sheltered havens, but exposed outer-island fishing villages, inhabited only for their accessibility to sailing and rowing boats, were left to return to wilderness.Jumping back on the boat, we head northwards, weaving between rocky islets and rafts of puffins. Three sea eagles watch us warily. Then Maddy spots a group of black fins slicing towards us through the waves. Vidar cuts the engine. “You’re in luck,” he grins. Seconds later four orcas come rolling past, blowholes blasting – three adults and one calf, heading for a local seal colony. “Mostly they eat herring,” says Vidar. “But some do know how to catch seals.”Back on the boat, we head north, weaving between rocky islets and rafts of puffins. Three sea eagles watch us warilyAfter a few precious minutes watching the orcas, we head back to Vidar’s base, the village of Nyksund, carving a tight bend through a narrow gap formed by a pair of craggy islands, then into the little harbour. The two sides of this tranquil haven are lined with clapboard houses, fish warehouses and rusting cranes. There are clamouring kittiwakes nesting on every available ledge; the wharves and decking have gaps; much of the paint is peeling. But this is a pretty spot, not gentrified – not yet. Nyksund is another abandoned fishing village, but with a difference. The people are coming back.On the quayside, I meet Dan and Johanna, who will be our guides. They came here in the 1990s, finding only one aged resident remaining. The rest had left in the 1970s, tired of the awkward tiny harbour and crunching winter storms, but now the population is back up to more than 20.View image in fullscreenA close encounter with orcas off the island of  Skogsøya.Photograph: Kevin RushbyThat afternoon, we set out with Johanna on theDronningruta(the Queen’s Route), a spectacular nine-mile (15km) hike that is Nyksund’s biggest attraction. The route leads up on to a ridge where I begin to see why this path is a favourite of Norway’s Queen Sonja. First, there are views south to the soaring mountains of Skogsøya, then a vast panorama of snow-capped peaks and islands opens up to the north. The lower slopes are emerald green all the way down to the azure sea. Under our feet is a thick carpet of leaves and flowers. On the windswept summits, juniper bushes grow horizontally, sheltering behind 5cm-tall crowberry bushes.Finally we descend into the fishing port of Stø, taking a detour to see the church atLangenes, a rustic wooden masterpiece, parts of which date back to the 16th century. On the wall, in Gothic script, is the Lord’s Prayer in Old Danish, a reminder that Norway was under the control of Copenhagen for many centuries, achieving full independence only in 1905, after being ceded to Sweden in 1814.We skip the return leg along the coast, opting for the boat service that shuttles us back to Nyksund. There is no second sighting of orca, but the ride is still an exciting rollercoaster through the swell, with an audience of seals and black guillemots. Back in Nyksund, we drink a beer in the cosyHolmvik Bryggebar, then eat a plate of local seafood in theEkspedisjonenrestaurant. Specialities includetørrfisk(skrei cod, air-dried then soaked in running freshwater for a week before cooking), black halibut andtorsketunger, tempura-style cod’s tongue.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There were plans for a five-star hotel, but that fell through. Whatever happens, Nyksund wouldn’t be able to cope with crowds.” The sense of community, however, is strong: they recently called adugnad, a Norwegian tradition of collective voluntary action, in order to pave the village square.Next morning, at the scheduled kelp-forest swimming session, there are no crowds, only myself, Maddy and our guide, Richards. A swim in the Arctic might sound intimidating, but the water, we discover, is not that cold when you’re inside 7mm-thick neoprene. We snorkel for an hour through a startlingly colourful world of bronze kelp fronds and vast schools of fish. Bright pink sea urchins cling to golden stalks of seaweed and, in the indigo blue distance, we glimpse the shapes of large grey cod. Beyond them, unseen, are the orcas, dolphins, seals and whales that inhabit this fertile world, a world that rolls onward, for the time being, unaware of human machinations over its future.I dive down into the forest, pushing through the golden stems of kelp and turning over to watch air bubbles sliding up the silky fronds to the glittering surface.Lofoten has so many tourists now, people are complaining that sometimes they can’t leave their housesLater, warming up in the cafe that also serves as an antiques shop, I meet the unofficial custodian of the town’s spirit, Atle Valland. Born here in 1944, Valland remembers a harsh environment where children were expected to work from the age of seven, their nimble fingers handy for slicing out the prized cod’s tongue. Having left, aged 16, to become a ship’s engineer, Valland returned in 2022 to find a few brave souls moving in. He shows me his prized collection of Russian porcelain. “I’m not a collector,” he chuckles. “I just take care of old things.” That care extends to a vast assortment of whalebones, tools, paintings, furniture and photographs, which he plans to turn into a museum.On our last night, we join a good-humoured group for dinner, including the vicar, Gry, and her husband, Radar, who comes from the Lofoten Islands, about 100 miles to the south. When talk turns to the future of Nyksund, Radar has a warning: “Lofoten has so many tourists now, people are complaining that sometimes they can’t leave their houses. The streets are too full.”The diesel engine altered the layout of this coast for a previous generation and now another technological innovation is driving more change. The Lofoten tourism tsunami powered by social media is bringing vast crowds to villages unused to visitors. Nyksund art gallery owner and photographer Svein Erik Tøien was moved to create a surrealistic collage of a giant cruise ship squeezed into Nyksund’s diminutive harbour. “I wanted to ask a question,” he says. “Is this what we want?”When Maddy and I leave, we drive across the bumpy Nyksund causeway, then down 5.6 miles of narrow gravel track on the island of Langøya before we reach asphalt. In the past, perhaps, remoteness was as plentiful as the fish. Now the challenge is to make this most capricious of commodities into something sustainable.Travel was provided byDiscoverthe World, which offers a seven-night self-drive journey,Around Vesteralen,from £1,227pp including B&B accommodation (three nights in Nyksund), car rental and whale-watching.

Legally, it has to contain a minimum level of sugar, so when manufacturers use fruit juice concentrate instead of sugar, they often fall below that threshold and have to call their product a fruit spread instead.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I tasted 10 jams straight from the jar, much to my teeth’s dismay, and then again spread on warm buttered baguette. Every product was delicious in its own right, but some really stood out as exceptional, with serious complexity and depth, and not overpowered by the sugar.Strawberries are amongthe most heavily sprayed cropsin the UK, according toPesticide Action Network’s “dirty dozen”, so I always look for organic strawberry products, especially in a concentrated one such as jam. Where the sugar content is notably high or low, I’ve also included the percentage of sugars. Sugar is integral to jam – it’s what preserves the fruit, after all – but in today’s health-conscious world, it’s worth knowing what you’re spreading. It’s also worth noting that there’s a trade-off for lower-sugar jams in that, once opened, they have a shorter shelf life.It’s also remarkable how many of these brands are steeped in history: Wilkin & Sons started Tiptree jam back in 1885; Hartley’s was founded in Lancashire in 1871; St Dalfour was established in rural France at the turn of the 19th century; and Bonne Maman arrived in 1971. These are more than just spreads – they’re edible heritage.The best supermarket strawberry jamBestoverall:Duchy Organic strawberry extra jam preserveView image in fullscreen£2 for 340g at Waitrose (59p/100g)★★★★★Mahogany red with deep flavour and a pleasantly sour twang, making it my favourite for both flavour and texture. Has a high sugar content of 65%, though. It contains perfect whole candied strawberries alongside others that have broken down into a jammy jelly. Really good value and organic, too!Best bargain:Morrisons the Best strawberry conserveView image in fullscreen£2.55 for 340g at Morrisons (75p/100g)★★★★☆A dark, vermilion hue with an archetypal strawberry flavour and good depth. Very sweet, with 59.3g carbohydrates per 100g, of which 57.5g are sugars. It has delicious bits and pieces of strawberries still half intact, giving a more textural finish. Overall, a great conserve for your money.And the rest …Fearne & Rosie strawberry preserveView image in fullscreen£3.20 for 310g at Tesco (£1.03/100g)£3.20 for 310g at Ocado (£1.03/100g)★★★★★The colour of stewed forced rhubarb with a lovely clean berry flavour and balanced sourness. Much less sweet than most, it has an interesting, stewed fruit-like texture. Fearne & Rosie is B Corp certified, and its strawberry preserve is manufactured in Belgium from EU produce. It has a high (70%) fruitcontentand low sugar (35%). Good quality for a natural-tasting fruit spread.St Dalfour strawberry spreadView image in fullscreen£3.25 for 284g at Sainsbury’s (£1.14/100g)£3.40 for 284g at Waitrose (£1.20/100g)★★★★☆Crimson red with a familiar, candied strawberry flavour and decent texture, featuring nice pieces of strawberry. Less sweet than some, while still retaining a traditional taste. Made in Marmande, France, it uses regional fruit and natural sweeteners such asgrape must(a waste product from the wine industry). Notably, the brand shares its sustainability efforts online. With a simple formula and slightly lower sugar content (48%) than many, this is a great buy.Clearspring organic strawberry fruit spreadView image in fullscreen£3.50 for 280g at Ocado (£1.25/100g)★★★★☆Garnet red with a delicious strawberry flavour and just a hint of apple butter. Much less sweet than most, making this a great choice for family use. Sweetened naturally with apple juice concentrate and puree, it has very low sugar (29%). Despite being the most expensive in the test group, it’s still pretty good value, especially as an organic product.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

Recognisable by its handwritten font and gingham lid, Bonne Maman is sold globally in more than 100 countries. While provenance and sustainability details are scarce, this uses a simple, conventional recipe.Tiptree strawberry conserveView image in fullscreen£3.30 for 340g at Morrisons (97p/100g)£3.30 for 340g at Ocado (97p/100g)★★★☆☆Brick red with a traditional strawberry taste and a lovely texture featuring lots of seeds.

Very sweet (59% sugar), too. A smooth, jelly-like texture dotted with seeds. That said, this has good heritage and is a fair price, too.Stute no sugar strawberry extra jamView image in fullscreen£2.65 for 430g at Sainsbury’s (62p/100g)£2.65 for 430g at Morrisons (62p/100g)★★☆☆☆Candy red, with a traditional, sweet strawberry taste that has some sourness to balance things out. This sorbitol-sweetened jam (meaning it’s suitable for people with diabetes) has a smooth, jelly texture with some lumps and seeds. Based in Bristol since 1969, the brand is actively reducing emissions and producing 18% of its own electricity. With almost no sugar content (2.4%), it’s definitely a healthier option, although some consumers may be concerned about the use of sweetener.Mackays Scottish strawberry preserveView image in fullscreen£2.30 for 340g at Ocado (68p/100g)£2.30 for 340g at Tesco (68p/100g)★★☆☆☆Ruby red with a familiar strawberry flavour that’s delicious, though not outstanding; very sweet, too, with a notably high sugar content of 66.9%. The texture is very sticky, though the inclusion of whole strawberries adds some interest. Founded in 1938, Mackays is one of the few products tested that states the fruit’s provenance, using Scottish-grown berries boiled in copper pans.Explore more on these topicsFoodThe FilterPickling, fermenting and preservingVegan food and drinkVegetarian food and drinkFruitfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It starts with seasoned sushi rice (which I could eat just by itself) and is topped with a variety of fun things to munch on such as salt- and lime-seasoned cabbage, edamame beans and glazed pieces of barbecued tempeh, all bound together with a gentle but perky sriracha sauce. Like many of us today, it borrows ideas from all over the world and is, I think, all the more delicious for it.Barbecue tempeh rice bowl with lime and srirachaDon’t be put off by the long-ish ingredients list: except for steaming the rice and frying the tempeh, the rest is just chopping, mixing and assembly. Sushi seasoning, or seasoned rice vinegar, is widely available in the UK, and is a vinegar that has, very helpfully, been pre-seasoned.Prep15 minCook45 minServes4350g sushi rice5 tbsp sushi seasoning250g red cabbage, finely shredded2 tbsp fresh lime juiceFine sea salt160g frozen edamame beans, defrostedBlack sesame seedsFor the sauce5 tbsp mayonnaise(75g)1½ tbsp sriracha½ tbsp tomato puree1 tbsp agave syrupFor the tempeh3 garlic cloves, peeled and finely minced½ tbsp chipotle paste3½ tbsp light soy sauce1½ tbsp tomato puree½ tbsp fresh lime juice2½ tbsp agave syrup¼ tsp saltRapeseed oil400g tempeh(I likeTiba), cut into jagged, bite-sized piecesTip the rice into a saucepan for which you have a lid, add 500ml cold water, pop on the lid and bring to a boil. Turn down the heat to a simmer, cook for 10 minutes, then take off the heat and put to one side with the lid on for another 10 minutes. Add the sushi seasoning and mix well.Put the cabbage in a bowl with a tablespoon of the lime juice and half a teaspoon of salt, then, with clean hands, scrunch it over and over until you can feel it give in your hands.Next, make the sauce by whisking the mayonnaise, sriracha, tomato puree, agave syrup and the remaining tablespoon of lime juice with an eighth of a teaspoon of salt.In a separate bowl, make the tempeh marinade. Whisk the garlic, chipotle paste, soy sauce, tomato puree, lime juice, agave syrup and a quarter-teaspoon of salt, add two tablespoons of water and mix again.Put two tablespoons of oil in a large frying pan on a medium to high heat and, when hot, add the pieces of tempeh and cook, tossing, for five to seven minutes, until they’re golden and crisp all over. Pour in the sauce, turn the heat right down and cook until the sauce reduces to a glaze that clings to the tempeh. Take off the heat.To assemble, put a quarter of the rice on one side of each of four bowls. Arrange the cabbage next to it, then the tempeh and the edamame beans. Spoon some of the sauce into the middle, sprinkle over some sesame seeds and serve.Explore more on these topicsVegetablesThe new veganFoodVegan food and drinkRiceMain courseBeans, pulses and legumesrecipesShareReuse this content"
