But who will be the new Time Lord – and is it goodbye to Russell T Davies?The BBC have confirmed that the long-running sci-fi show will return to our screens. But with ratings falling and its Disney partnership ending, questions hang over its futureMartin BelamThu 30 Oct 2025 10.01 EDTLast modified on Thu 30 Oct 2025 10.02 EDTShareSometimes the answer to one mystery only prompts more questions. That may well be the case with this week’s announcement from the BBC thatDoctor Whowill return to BBC One with a 2026 Christmas special and a new series to follow, but that the show’s international streaming partnership with Disney+ will end.There was no indication of who might play the Doctor in next year’s special, which will be written byRussell T Daviesand produced by Bad Wolf with BBC Studios.The final episode of the 2025 series,The Reality War, appeared to show a departing 15th Doctor, Ncuti Gatwa, brieflyregenerating into Billie Piper. Piper has previously played companion Rose Tyler, although it was notable that she was not credited as “The Doctor”, leaving the future casting of one of British television’s iconic roles very much up in the air.Lindsay Salt, director of drama at the BBC, said: “We’d like to thank Disney+ for being terrific global partners and collaborators over the past two seasons. The BBC remains fully committed to Doctor Who, which continues to be one of our most loved dramas, and we are delighted thatRussell T Davieshas agreed to write us another spectacular Christmas special.“We can assure fans, the Doctor is not going anywhere, and we will be announcing plans for the next series in due course, which will ensure the Tardis remains at the heart of theBBC.”Fans have already begun speculating, noting that the phrasing of the press release doesn’t confirm that Davies will continue as showrunner, the role he has held – for a second time – since taking the helm for the 60th anniversary specials in 2023. Nor does it commit the BBC to continue to work with Bad Wolf in Cardiff, where the show has been made since its 2005 revival.View image in fullscreenIs Rose the new Doctor? … Billie Piper in The Reality War.Photograph: BBC Studios/Bad WolfLike many high-profile dramas, Doctor Who had been perceived to be struggling, with diminishing linear transmission viewing figures. Episodes in the most recent series were regularlypulling in fewer than 2 million viewerslive on BBC One, a historic low for the long-running show. None of the ratings for this year’s episodes, even including iPlayer views after seven days, reached 4 million viewers, a significant slump compared with Jodie Whittaker’s tenure. The Disney deal did not power Doctor Who to be the global streaming hit that both sides of the arrangement must have been hoping for.While figures have been a closely guarded secret, Disney+ ending their association with the show will inevitably have an impact on the BBC’s budgeting for a programme that had a reputation in the 1970s and 1980s for wobbly sets andbubble wrap monsters, but which has been enjoying an expensive CGI-enhanced glow-up.Davies once told Doctor Who Magazine that a reported Disney-boosted figure of £10m an episode for the last two seasons was “exaggerated”, with Bad Wolf executive producer Jane Tranter only confirming that the deal with Disney provided “a really good budget for us”.She suggested, however, that the budget was not on a par with Game of Thrones or The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, highlighting one of the issues that Doctor Who has faced. In the streaming world it is competing with the likes of Andor and The Last of Us. It faces the scrutiny of an international adult fandom, while the BBC is also still trying to make it a programme that will appeal to families on a Saturday teatime and, crucially for the future of the franchise, give younger viewers an on-ramp to becoming the next generation of lifelong fans.Fun, flirty and far too brief: why did Ncuti Gatwa leave Doctor Who so soon?Read moreThe Gatwa era has been plagued by rumours of production difficulties behind the scenes, with his decision to leave the lead role after just 18 episodes apparently necessitating reshoots of the season finale. Carole Ann Ford, who played the Doctor’s granddaughter Susan in the very first episode in 1963 and who made a brief return this year,recently suggestedduring a convention interview that only part of what she had filmed was used. Gatwa’s departure, it seems, had resulted in her storyline being scrapped.Millie Gibson, who played companion Ruby Sunday, recently spoke out about tabloid coverage labelling her a “diva” on set, which, reports claimed, led to her being dropped in favour of Varada Sethu as the companion for Gatwa’s second series. The former Coronation Street star has claimed she found herself in a situation where she felt shecouldn’t speak up to defend herselfin case she spoiled future plot developments for viewers.A spin-off from the show,The War Between the Land and the Sea, starring Russell Tovey, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Jemma Redgrave and Ruth Madeley, is expected to be broadcast on BBC One later in 2025, marking the end of Doctor Who’s association with Disney.The BBC has also previously announced that it isexploring options for an animated versionof Doctor Who, aimed at a preschool audience, which would run on CBeebies, independently from the main show.Explore more on these topicsDoctor WhoFantasy TVTelevisionRussell T DaviesBillie PiperfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Take a look at our no-longer-chocolatey biscuitsZoe WilliamsTalk of ‘small boats’ may dominate politics and the media, but the cost of living crisis is what most adults spend their time worrying aboutThu 30 Oct 2025 11.52 EDTLast modified on Thu 30 Oct 2025 13.06 EDTShareWage increases finally began to outpace price rises in June 2023, so we could technically class the previous month as the height of the cost of living crisis. Certainly, May that year was when the headlines about butter peaked. Lurpak and Anchor, both owned by the same dairy co-op, Arla, had reduced the size of their standard butter pack from 250g to 200g. The price was brought down accordingly, in due course, but for a while, certain supermarkets were still charging half-pound prices for a “what would we even call 200g?” pack.The problem was, butter units are universal. A half-pound of butter always weighs the same amount in your hand, regardless of the brand. Seeing the small version in a supermarket felt almost sci-fi, like a tiny off-key detail that alerts you to the fact you’ve been kidnapped by aliens into a simulacrum world. They would have gotten away with it, but for that tiny flaw. Forced by the outcry to release a statement, the brand said it was trying to make prices “more accessible” for consumers. One almost feels embarrassed for it, flailing around for cosy equality language that didn’t explain its butter-miniatures at all.The butter meltdown was prompted by a steep climb in prices that began with the Russian invasion of Ukraine the previous year. By the start of 2023, the cost of a pack of Lurpak had gone up in some places by 37%, and people on social media were posting pictures of butter with its own security tag. What next: would they have to sell it like shoes, and keep the crackers on display and the spreadables out the back?At its height, which was 2023, grocery inflationhit 17.5%, which sounds less bad than it felt, because that was an aggregate across all foodstuffs, and there were one or two that went down in price. In fact, it was the highest shopping-basket hike since records began in 2008, costing the average household an extra£683 a yearon food had they bought the same goods as the year previous. Prices were galloping so fast nobody really understood what “average family” meant any more: previously, maybe you were average if you bought eggs, chips and beans without a glance but thought twice about steak. If you were standing in a Tesco metro, holding a Heinz four-pack, muttering: “What the living hell,seven quid?”, what did that make you? Someone with still-above-average means, but below-average speed-on-the-uptake? Or were we all,to invert Michael Govefrom way back when he was education secretary, below average now?Living costscontinued to risewell into this year, although political attention hasshifted to household bills, away from subsistence essentials, which are still very high (wait, council tax and certainly water also count as “subsisting” – maybe the better qualifier would be “commodities besides those you could immediately eat”). Food prices completely slipped off the political and media agenda, even though, just because inflation had eased, prices hadn’t gone down. Some corporations are at the mercy of global prices themselves; others are price gouging; all have seen their production costs increase, as energy prices have gone up; some have bespoke challenges related to Brexit. It’s a complicated picture, but it’s not so complicated that we need to collectively avert our eyes.Penguins and Clubs have been so hard hit by the cost of cocoa that theydropped their chocolate contentand as of a fortnight ago, can no longer be classed as chocolate biscuits. It’s a big moment for the “if you like a lot of chocolate on your biscuit, join our Club” generation, who are now biscuitally homeless. Overall, it’s been a quiet slide into things being smaller while costing the same – toothpaste, coffee, Gaviscon,Celebrations– whether you can’t live without it or should be able to, the trend is the same. It’s not discretionary, in other words, nor market-sensitive, obeying insteadthe principle of enshittification, which has yet to make it as a business studies module: everything that can get worse, will.For average families, for consumers, for – hell, throw them a bone – food producers (though major supermarkets are still doing just fine), the situation has remained dire, and yet the conversation has moved on. Which? magazine does valiant work insisting on the old values – that unit pricing should “be prominent, legible and consistent” – but there is no drumbeat demanding basic answers: how much is price-gouging, how much is necessity, how much is follow-my-leader, has anyone ever tried price-capping, will we ever get back to the old normal? These are questions a Labour government would be asking, if it weren’t so petrified of alienating businesses. That fear forces them to stay quiet, too, on the reality that the cost of living crisis isn’t over.Simultaneously, people are incessantly polled on the national issues of the day, and increasingly, they say immigration. Yet when they’re asked what’s most affecting them personally,immigration isn’t even in the top threeissues. It seems as though the media tired of the cost of toothpaste and moved on to small boats, as did all the main political parties. Who influenced who? PMQs and the media, whether print or broadcast, are like the brain and the gut, connected by the a nerve that goes both ways. In turn, this has informed what people feel they ought to say, if they want to sound as though they’ve been paying attention. Backs against the wall, though, people overwhelmingly still put the cost of living crisis first on their list of concerns. This is particularly marked among renters (91%), parents of a dependent child (91%), those aged 16 to 29 (89%), 30 to 49 (90%) and women (89%). If you’re thinking, “Wait, isn’t that everyone?”, no – those aged over 70 are more likely to worry most about the NHS (86%) and people educated to degree level angst about “the economy”, because that’s how you say “why does everything cost so much?”, when you’re fancy.What looks like a low-attention media environment is actually an omertà – a refusal to mention the thing that almost all adults spend almost all their time worrying about. “Gaslighting” is such an overused term, but we can’t stop using it until everyone stops doing it.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsUK cost of living crisisOpinionSupermarketsInflationRetail industryEconomicscommentShareReuse this content"

From serene sushi-making to a shell with shoes on, we run down the finest films for those of a nervous dispositionByStuart HeritageThu 30 Oct 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 30 Oct 2025 10.56 EDTShare20.Cars(2006)Just so we’re all clear on the brief, tomorrow isHalloween. But some people do not like scary films. Some people do not like films where there are any intense emotional momentswhatsoever. This is mostly a list of those films. So, for example, Up cannot be included in the lineup because its first 10 minutes are genuinely traumatising. Similarly, Finding Nemo cannot be included because it is a film about a grief-stricken father searching for a son he believes might be dead. But Cars, a film about some cars, can. The scariest that Cars gets is when a car has a near-miss with a train. Other than that, barely any jeopardy at all.19.My Dinner With Andre(1981)View image in fullscreenChatty man … Wallace Shawn in My Dinner With Andre.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyHowever, this isn’t to say that all these films have to be for children. If you’re looking to keep your heartbeat at a consistently low thud, Louis Malle’s My Dinner with Andre fits the bill perfectly. Though rated 12, for infrequent moderate sex references, it’s fair to say that nothing at all happens here. Two men have dinner and talk a lot, and then it ends. A small army of viewers are quick to call My Dinner with Andre the most boring film ever made. It isn’t – a kinder read would be to call it deliberately cerebral – but nothing about it will keep you up at night.18.Curious George(2006)This adaptation of the classic children’s books (the first of which was published in 1941), about a pleasant chimpanzee getting into moderate scrapes, is nothing if not relentlessly charming. Will Ferrell plays a man who seeks to discover a hidden treasure in order to raise funds to save a museum, and a monkey follows him around. Unless you are extremely disturbed by scenes of paint being flung, this is one of the most happily inoffensive films ever made.17.In the Mood for Love(2000)On the surface, the films of Wong Kar-wai seem perfect for this list, since they all tend to move in a dreamily hypnotic state. However, he does seem to like to inject them with intermittent violence. There’s a car crash in My Blueberry Nights, for example, and a stabbing in Days of Being Wild. In the Mood for Love, on the other hand, is far more sedate. Two people are brought together after learning that their partners cheated on them with each other, and the result is this mournfully peaceful story. The trigger warning websiteDoes the Dog Die?states that food gets eaten rather loudly in one scene, though, so watch out for that.16.The Red Turtle(2016)View image in fullscreenExtremely touching … The Red Turtle.Photograph: Atlaspix/AlamyI desperately wanted to include the Latvian animation Flow in this list, until I remembered how badly it freaked out my eight-year-old. More sedate is Michaël Dudok de Wit’s similarly dialogue-free The Red Turtle. A man is stranded on a beach, his chances of escape thwarted by a turtle. Although – and here comes the only remotely frightening part – the turtle dies, it is reincarnated as a woman who falls in love with the man. Extremely touching and truly beautiful.15. On the Beach at Night Alone (2017)The work of South Korean director Hong Sang-soo could have filled this list from top to bottom, since he specialises in quietly meditative films where barely anything happens. However, his standout is still On the Beach at Night Alone, in which a Korean woman runs away to Germany after the end of an affair. The premise makes the film sound far more action-packed than it is, because in reality the most shocking thing that happens is that the main character raises her voice once. But the lack of tangible plot is the point. This is a film made to wash over you.14.Everybody Wants Some!! (2016)Compared with On the Beach at Night Alone, Everybody Wants Some!! is as action-packed as a Transformers movie. There are drugs, parties and repeated mentions of masturbation. But still, this is a Richard Linklater film, so it’s important to state that very little happens. For the most part, the film is just a loose collection of fun scenes comprising college baseball players hanging out and goofing off. With maybe one exception, this is as fast as your heart will beat in the entire list, but that isn’t really saying much.13.Le Quattro Volte(2010)View image in fullscreenThe GOAT? Le Quattro VoltePhilip French called Michelangelo Frammartino’s film “an essay, a cinematic poem, a spiritual exploration of time and space” – and it’s hard to find fault in that description. Le Quattro Volte is a film about an elderly goatherd in the Calabrian mountains, who quietly goes about his business in a calm and unhurried manner. It might be worth stating that this is ultimately a film about death – it’s sad but not scary – but for the most part this near-silent meditation feels like a long, slow exhalation.12.Jiro Dreams of Sushi(2011)The legacy of Jiro Dreams of Sushi is a million Netflix documentaries where chefs are treated with far more reverence than they deserve, but that doesn’t mean that this isn’t a masterpiece. Jiro Ono owns a 10-seat sushi restaurant in a Tokyo subway station, but his quiet focus and dedication to perfection mean that it has won three Michelin stars. The joy of the film comes from the loving, trance-like scenes of Jiro preparing his food with a monastic stillness. It cannot be called a truly soothing movie, because the guy is mean to his son, but other than that it fits the bill perfectly.11.The Peanuts Movie(2015)View image in fullscreenIn step with Schulz himself … The Peanuts Movie.Photograph: 20th Century Fox/AllstarThe danger, when it comes to adapting a beloved children’s character for modern audiences, is that there’s a tendency to go full Peter Rabbit and fill it with horrifying poop gags that sully the charm of the original. There is none of this in ThePeanutsMovie, which is as sincerely good-natured as any film could be. Charlie Brown harbours a crush on a redheaded girl in his class, and embarks on various methods of self-improvement so that she might notice him. It’s perfectly in step with Charles M Schulz’s comic strip and has such a lightness of touch that you’d have to be a monster not to adore it.10.Before Sunset(2004)Despite his ever-expanding sense of ambition (he is now adapting Merrily We Roll Along, filming over 20 years, with an eye to release in 2040) Richard Linklater’s masterpiece will always be the Before series, where we intermittently check in with Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy across the various stages of their relationship. Although 1995’s Before Sunrise landed with the most impact – Hawke and Delpy are young, sexy and flirtatious, and we get to watch them fall in love in real-time – Before Sunset is the heart of the trilogy. The pair are older and a little more bruised, and life has become more complicated. But it’s still a gorgeous, low-stakes, definitively unscary film.9.Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives(2010)Does the Dog Die?has an absolute field day with Apichatpong Weerasethakul’s languorous fantasy drama. Yes, this is explicitly a film about ghosts, but the site points out that they are “friendly spirits” and “not jumpscare ghosts”. And yes, there is also sexual content in the form of a scene where it is implied that a woman has intercourse with a fish, but “it somehow isn’t as disgusting as it sounds”. In truth, it is harder to justify the inclusion of this film than any other on the list, but the overwhelming tone is so soft and slow that it fits the bill.8. Playtime (1967)View image in fullscreenSterile modernity … Playtime.Photograph: Specta Films/AllstarJacques Tati’s masterpiece isn’t so much a film as an opportunity to marvel at his incredible production design; he built an entire city, Tativille, on the outskirts of Paris to make it. A procession of blink-and-you’ll miss it visual jokes, set in a stylish if sterile vision of modernity, Playtime has no real plot to speak of. Tati, dressed as his baffled Monsieur Hulot character, drifts through scenes more as an onlooker than an active participant, as the world goes about its business around him. Nevertheless, it’s a film that you will find yourself getting lost in time and time again.7.The Straight Story(1999)View image in fullscreenSlowly does it … The Straight Story.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyFewDavid Lynchfilms could comfortably fit into a list of unscary movies – stick a pin anywhere in his oeuvre and it’s likely to land on something that will psychologically terrorise you forever – but The Straight Story is his outlier. An old man (Richard Farnsworth) drives a lawnmower across middle America to visit his dying brother (Harry Dean Stanton), and that’s it. Rated U upon release, there is nothing to trouble even the most sensitive of viewers here, with the possible exception of an offscreen car crash. Nevertheless, the humour and emotion that Lynch crams into such a slight story is extraordinary. One of his finest.6.Paterson(2016)Jim Jarmusch’s best film, Adam Driver’s best film and almost certainly the best film ever made about the act of carefully redrafting a poem while simultaneously driving a bus. Paterson is an extraordinary movie with the slightest of premises. That is literally all that happens; Driver writes a poem, then changes it as he drives his bus around town, then the same thing happens the next day, and the day after. There are, admittedly, spikes in tension here and there – a guy pulls a fake gun at one point, and his wife is so relentlessly whimsical that it’ll put your teeth on edge – but for the most part this is simply a film about a man quietly going about his day.5.A Shaun the Sheep Movie: Farmageddon(2019)Especially compared with the other, far more languid, films on the list, Farmaggedon can feel a little bit like you’re being trapped in a shedful of exploding fireworks. But this is as joyful as film-making can be, and there is cross-generational appeal here. Shaun the Sheep finds an alien in his quiet small town, and decides to help it return home. The premise is just an excuse to deliver gags based on hoary old sci-fi tropes, but the scene that pushes Farmageddon into masterpiece territory is a near-scientific demonstration of what happens if you let a hyperactive alien ingest too much sugar. This may be heresy to some, but I’d bat for this as Aardman’s finest work.4.Marcel the Shell With Shoes On(2021)View image in fullscreenThe man himself … Marcel the Shell With Shoes On.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyIn these troubled times for cinema, where not even huge tentpoles can be guaranteed to make money any more, Marcel the Shell With Shoes On was a baffling thing to release theatrically. A quiet stop-motion animation about a shell who sort of ambiently potters about the place, the film is just about as niche as it gets. While it is very funny and sweet – Marcel is the sort of character you yearn to protect – there’s a melancholy undertow to the film that may catch you off-guard. But this is a list of films that aren’t scary, not films that aren’t sad, so it counts.3.Singin’ in the Rain(1952)“Very mild comic violence is unlikely to upset even the youngest children” ishow the BBFC describesthe classic music comedy, and anecdotally this is accurate. I had worried that Donald O’Connor’s aggressive slapstick in the Make ’Em Laugh sequence would be too much for my kids when they were very young – you are essentially watching a man injure himself for applause – but it turned out to be their favourite part. As films about the death of the silent movie experience go, this is vastly more palatable thanBabylon(which, let’s not forget, included a scene of an elephant crapping directly at the audience).2.Kiki’s Delivery Service(1989)Many parents will have experienced the horror of leaping into a family screening of aStudio Ghiblifilm without proper research – I cannot be the only person to have abandoned Pom Poko after all the dead racoons made the children leave the room – but Kiki’s Delivery Service is the safest bet in town. A film about a young witch who decides to work as a courier, the film is relentlessly delightful. I was going to say that there isn’t a person on the planet who wouldn’t fall in love with Kiki’s Delivery Service, but I just looked on Does the Dog Die? and there’s a trigger warning because it contains a body of water, so who knows?1.Perfect Days(2023)View image in fullscreenUtterly zen … Perfect Days.Photograph: Collection Christophel/AlamyA film about a man silently cleaning toilets for two hours has no right to be as beautiful as Wim Wenders’s 2023 film, and yet it manages to be staggering. Kōji Yakusho wakes up, gets dressed, cleans toilets, eats lunch, goes home and dreams, over and over again. The result is the best film about quiet contentment that has ever been made. It helps that the public toilets are genuinely works of art – you wonder how many holidays have been booked to Tokyo purely to visit them – but this is a film about a man experiencing everything as if for the first time. Nature, people, music, peace … it is so meditatively zen that you’ll want to watch it once a month to reset your nervous system.Explore more on these topicsRankedAnimation in filmWim WendersStudio GhibliPeanutsHalloweenPixarfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What kind of message and lyrics do you want to sing at this point in your life?steve_bayleyThe first song I got for the album was Human Mind, written by Hozier and Allison Russell, and that really set the tone for the entire record. It starts: “I deal in love baby, in good words from above … and I ain’t giving up.” I cried when I was trying to sing it for the first time. Then the next song was Beautiful Strangers by Kevin Morby. All the songs are part of me and what I’ve been singing about my whole life. There’s some about war, fighting, love … some about hard times, like the farmer whose losing his farm. Things that are going on in the world today, so Sad and Beautiful World is the perfect title.View image in fullscreen‘She was my idol’ … Staples sings with Mahalia Jackson at the 1969 Harlem Cultural festival.Photograph: Entertainment Pictures/AlamyI loved the documentarySummer of Soul. What was it like to play there [the1969 Harlem Cultural festival] and sing alongsideMahalia Jackson? Same question forWattstax [the 1973 Stax Records benefit concert in Watts, LA, to commemorate the seventh anniversary of the 1965 riots].snak3spanIt was an honour to sing with Sister Mahalia Jackson. She was my idol. When I was 10 or 11 I walked up to her and I said: “My name is Mavis and I sing, too.” She said: “Oh, you do, huh? Well, I wanna hear you.” I said: “You’ll hear me because I’m loud.” Then I started going out of the door to jump rope, because us children didn’t wanna hear the preacher. She pulled me over to her, and touched my neck and said I was damp. She said: “Don’t go out in the air when you’re damp like that. You wanna get to be an old lady like me and sing, don’t you?” She was letting me know how to take care of my voice. So my idol became my teacher and my friend. The Summer of Soul concert was a good time. Sister Mahalia told me: “Baby, Hayley don’t feel so well” – she always called herself Hayley – “I need you to help me sing this song.” So that’s why I came in on Precious Lord, Take My Hand. Wattstax was a different ballgame, because we were working in Las Vegas and had to rush over there. So in the documentary you see us in the back seat of a car having lunch. We didn’t have the chance to stay. It was fun watching the film because that was the first time I’d seen the show.You were influential in the civil rights movement in the 1960s. Do we need another civil rights movement now, 50 years later?AD2023When I did my album of freedom songs with Ry Cooder [We’ll Never Turn Back, 2007] we sang a song called 99 and 1/2. You know, 99 and a half won’t do … we gotta make a hundred. We gotta keep on pushing because the struggle is still alive.I discovered your music via Prince –The Sacrifice of Victor, a video release of one of his aftershows atBagley’s in London[1993]. Were those times and that show as fun as it looks?DrLongpigIPresumeOh lord. Any time I was with Prince was fun. I loved him so much but he was so painfully shy. He would talk to my sister more than me. He would just look at me, roll those big eyes and smile. I thought: well, if he’s going to write for me he’s gotta know something about me. So I wrote him some letters and the first album he produced for me [Time Waits for No One, 1989] had songs about or lyrics from what I talked about in my letters. Like, I told him I married an undertaker, so on The Undertaker [on The Voice, 1993] he wrote, “Don’t go with the crack, you might never come back … don’t be another number for the undertaker.” He was a genius. He kept everything all to himself, then it would come out like a blast.View image in fullscreen‘Another shy guy’ … Mavis Staples and David Byrne perform at the Apollo, New York City, 2019.Photograph: Taylor Hill/Getty ImagesHow did you find working withDavid Byrnewhen theStapleSingers covered Slippery People?Twig_the_WonderkidAnother shy guy. He would talk mostly to my father, but I loved David. He came to my birthday celebration in New York and we sang Slippery People together. Then I had the pleasure of going to his show on Broadway. He likes riding his bike. He was photographed with his bicycle on the No Kings marches? I’m not surprised. He rode that bicycle everywhere.Watching old videos of you, when you sing there are moments where you go so deep you seem to be in a trance state. Is that really the case?bluesgalI’m surprised but glad somebody noticed that. Sometimes, the spirit moves you. I definitely get lost in the music when I’m on stage. My father taught me: “Mavis, if you sing from your heart, you’ll reach the people, because what comes from the heart reaches the heart.” So when the spirit hits me, you’re gonna see Mavis looking like a zombie up there.View image in fullscreen‘Sometimes, the spirit moves you’ … Staples, circa 1970.Photograph: Michael Ochs ArchivesIs it true you had heardMartin Luther Kinggive the “I have a dream” part of his famous speech before and you shouted“Tell them about your dream, Martin”, to get him to use it that day? And you were also at theLorrainemotel in Memphiswhen he was shot. What do you remember about that day?SimonPavIt was Sister Mahalia Jackson who shouted “Tell them about your dream.” Also, I never called Dr King “Martin”, it was always “Dr King”. We weren’t at the Lorraine motel when Dr King was assassinated, we were around the corner, although we had stayed there many times because it was a Black-owned motel, so in the 60s it was the only place we could stay. We’d see Dr King every morning. He would come down to have breakfast and say, “How are you girls doing this morning?” He didn’t have to say anything: he was so powerful you would feel his presence. He called my father “Stay” and would go, “Stay. You gonna sing my song tonight?” His favourite song was Why Am I Treated So Bad, so we’d have to sing that every night at his meetings before he would get up to speak.I read in the liner notes about the moment your father [Roebuck “Pops” Staples] handed you some lost tapes and told you: “Don’t lose this.” You did a wonderful job with them – do you have your own “lost tapes”?tommytackerMy father was on his sickbed and he called me upstairs and asked me to bring him the last music he had recorded and he said, “Mavis, don’t lose this.” But it wasn’t finished, so I asked Jeff Tweedy if he would help me finish this record of Pops’ last music. When my sister Yvonne and I went to the studio and heard Pops singing Friendship we just broke down. But it came out so beautiful. That’s why the album is called Don’t Lose This. Most of the stuff that I did was released, and if it wasn’t it was probably because it didn’t come out right or I didn’t like it. There isn’t a whole bunch of stuff but if the record company want to come out with it later, it’ll be all right with me.View image in fullscreenSome of the Staple Singers … Pops, Cleotha, Mavis and Pervis in the late 1950s.Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty ImagesI first heardI’ll Take You Therein third grade when a classmate brought in this treasured 45rpm.

They get on the front row and sing along with me, and sometimes I get them on stage. I call them teenyboppers. I love it because I used to think that the young people weren’t interested in what we were singing about. But I found out different.In my mind Stax Recordswas a true band of sisters and brothers pushing boundaries and creating magic, with a shared vision of art, liberty and righteousness. Is that the reality?Mr_202It was a pleasure working at Stax because they had all these great people such as David Porter and Isaac Hayes. We called Otis Redding “the footballer” because he was so huge, but he was one beautiful spirit. They had a mixed [race] band in Booker T and the MG’s. In the early 60s, two white guys and two black guys working together was not supposed to happen, but in Stax no one looked at colour. Anybody could walk into your session and sit and listen. It was like a family and, now they’ve got a museum, a lot of teenyboppers can see Stax today.View image in fullscreen‘I keep my head up’ … Staples and Hozier perform during Newport folk festival in 2019.Photograph: Mike Lawrie/Getty ImagesIs this the darkest time you’ve lived through or am I foolish to believe it is?babylonfallingIt is pretty dark.

It mostly focused on beautiful places far from large-scale human development: deep rainforest or pristine grassland. Then, in the late 1990s, in the desert city of Phoenix, Arizona, scientists shifted their gaze closer to home.A team of ecologists went out into their own neighbourhood to map the distribution of urban plants in one of the first studies of its kind. Equipped with tape measures and clipboards, they documented trees and shrubs, sometimes getting on all fours to crawl through bushes under the curious watch of local people.“We had a lot of fun. Little kids loved our measuring wheel,” says Prof Ann Kinzig, from Arizona State University. “It made me look at cities differently.”Existing ecological theories did not explain the distribution of plants in cities. In wild areas, plants are typically arranged by influences such as geography and weather: the rockiness of the soil, level of rainfall, exposure to light and shade.The scientists wondered whether a new theory was needed. “And the answer was, we did,” Kinzig says.View image in fullscreenPhoenix city, where a 2003 study first documented the ‘luxury effect’ on wildlife diversity.Photograph: AlamyThe urban data kept telling them the same thing: the most significant impact on the distribution of plants was not elevation, proximity to water bodies, being close to rural areas or soil type. It was the wealth of people living nearby. In 2003, her team published thefirst paper on the “luxury effect”.The phenomenon describes how wealthy parts of cities have more wildlife, and more wildlife diversity – a finding that can haveprofound implications for human healthand wellbeing. In Phoenix, the researchers wondered if heat was the culprit. It is a desert environment where water is scarce and temperatures can be punishing.When wealth in an area of Phoenix went up, people generally planted more vegetation and kept it watered. A $10,000 (£7,500) increase in the median household income of the study site in Phoenixresulted in a 0.3C (0.54F) decreasein mean surface temperature.View image in fullscreenIn Phoenix, household income was found to be one of the best predictors of lizard diversity.Photograph: Getty/500pxBut since the initial studies in Phoenix, researchers found the luxury effect in other cities with different species, and where heat was less crucial. Black-tailed deer in British Colombia hung out in wealthier parts of town with more gardens, golf courses and parklands, according toa 2023 study.The luxury effecthas been foundin plants in North America, Burundi, China and Australia. It has also beendocumented in birdsin North America, Europe and New Zealand. Birds depend on plant species or food and shelter, so it’s possible that they are following the plants to luxury neighbourhoods. Even some batsgravitate towardswealthier areas of town. As far back as ancient Egypt, the places where labourers livedhosted different insect speciescompared with wealthier areas.“I was surprised – not that human agency might shape biodiversity patterns in unexpected ways, but that the luxury effect holds so well,” says Kinzig. “In other words, you would … expect different types of people to create landscapes that support different types of other species, but you would not necessarily expect the rich would almost always experience higher biodiversity.” (Fewer studies on the luxury effect have been done in tropical regions –one studyfrom Burundi found a positive relationship between plant diversity and wealth, butanother studyin Puerto Rico found no correlation, possibly because there is a smaller income gap between neighbourhoods.)When people have the time and resources … they seem to like more diverse vegetationJeff Ackley, biologistIn urban environments, “humans control everything”, says Jeff Ackley, a US government regulatory biologist, who discovered the luxury effect on “rich lizards” of Phoenix, finding that household income was one of the best predictors of nearby lizard diversity. “When people have the time and resources to do it, they can control what their back yards look like. And for the most part, people seem to like more diverse vegetation.”But the luxury effect is not confined to gardens – it appears to be happening indoors too. Wealthier homes have more insects and spiders living inside,according to a studyfrom the US.Researchers randomly sampled 50 homes in Raleigh, North Carolina, across the income spectrum. Wealthier homes had on average 100 types of arthropods, twice the number than in less wealthy homes, according to the study, which accounted for the size of home.View image in fullscreenContact with biodiverse environments and animals has been connected to positive health effects in humans.Photograph: John Callery/Getty Images/iStockphotoThe results were counterintuitive, because people typically think of wealthier people having cleaner homes, highlighting “how much we have yet to learn about indoor ecology”, researchers wrote.No study has looked at how the millions of species of microbes that live in cities might be influenced by the luxury effect, but research shows poorer people typically have more inflammatory and immune diseases, which could be linked to lack of exposure to microbial life. Contact with biodiverse environments, soil and animals has been connected to a host of positive health effects.How a radical experiment to bring a forest into a preschool transformed children’s healthRead more“Almost all diseases of the immune system are on the rise,” says Dr James Kinross, a consultant surgeon at Imperial College London and author ofDark Matter: The New Science of the Microbiome. “There’s something about the way that we build and construct our urban systems that detaches us from nature, and therefore detaches us from these kind of microscopic ecosystems that we need to maintain our health.”Biodiversity loss is recognised as a pressing global issue, but has typically referred to extinctions and species decline in the wider environment around us, rather than what is taking place in the human body. A growing collection of research, however, shows that they are intertwined. Last year,a paper coined the notion of “nature deficiency”, referring to how nature loss in the human body influenced health.To reverse those health inequalities, scientists point back to the outside world, where preserving and expanding biodiversity can move the dial.A study in Finland showedthat teenagers living with biodiverse gardens, for example, had reduced allergy and autoimmune problems.“The luxury effect represents not just an interesting ecological pattern,” a group of researchers reviewing the phenomenon wrote. “[It is] also yet another layer in the social and structural injustices present in cities.”Find moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverageExplore more on these topicsThe age of extinctionBiodiversityUrban wildlifeInequalityAllergiesMicrobiologyWildlifefeaturesShareReuse this content"

At best, I have three of these traits. Could I change that?Elle HuntThu 30 Oct 2025 06.00 EDTShareWho would you say is effortlessly, undeniably cool? Charli xcx, certainly. David Bowie, of course. Yoko Ono and Fran Lebowitz – or do they just wear a lot of black? I’m not cool and never have been. As a teenager, I was a swot at a school that prized sports. As an adult, I’m always wearing a backpack. I’m garrulous, risk-averse, lazy with my personal presentation and not convinced that any drug beats eight hours’ sleep. “Cool” feels to me like the stock market or Michelin restaurants: none of my business.I’m not alone. Ina recent YouGov survey, a third of respondents said they weren’t cool at school, with only 10% reporting that, yep, they actually were. Half claimed they were “somewhere in between”.But I know I’m missing out. Cool people are desirable and in demand; others want to be them or be with them. That social clout readily converts into capital as people buy what you’re selling, hoping it will rub off on them.The trick, of course, is that it rarely does. “Cool” is fiendish, like a riddle: it cannot be bought, though it’s enthusiastically sold, and it can’t be claimed without surrendering its benefits. The more you aspire to be cool, the more uncool you are likely to be.It’s ineffable but undeniable – or so we thought. A much-publicised paper recently published in theJournal of Experimental Psychologyfound that cool people are seen as possessing six attributes: they are extroverted, open, hedonistic, adventurous, autonomous and powerful.I (generously) score 3/6, lacking hedonism, adventurousness and meaningful power. But by working on those, could I become cooler?“People can increase how cool they seem to others to a certain extent,” says Todd Pezzuti, an associate professor of business at the Adolfo Ibáñez University in Chile and the study’s lead author. “But I also think it’s limited.”View image in fullscreenIn demand ... others want to be them or be with them.Photograph: Massive/Getty ImagesBorn introverts, for example, will probably struggle to seem consistently, convincingly socially confident. “Coolness has to live within you to really make it work,” Pezzuti says.He “never expected this amount of coverage” of his study, he tells me, but agrees it proves his point: “cool” is hugely influential but poorly understood.Few papers exist on the subject, partly because it’s so difficult to quantify, Pezzuti says. “Because everyone has their own opinions about cool, we thought we should really know what the truth is.”Pezzuti’s interest is in coolness as a form of economic labour or production. His hypothesis is that – just as tribal societies prize skilled hunters, who provide food for the group – today’s information economy turns on creativity and innovation. “Cool” expresses the status and reward bestowed upon individuals who push boundaries, generate new ideas and promote their spread, to collective benefit.The Onion’s headlinejoking that consumers spend $14 trillion annually “trying to look cool” wasn’t wrong. Most defining modern brands (Apple, Nike, Coke etc) succeeded by bottling cool. The global influencer industry,worth $24bnin 2024, turns on it.When I ask Pezzuti who he thinks is cool, he names Richard Branson ranking highly on all six traits – contributing to the Virgin founder’s estimated £2.4bn net worth.Is Pezzuti himself cool? “Currently, definitely not,” he says, perhaps wistfully. He was never that extroverted or powerful, but becoming a parent has “taken away my hedonism completely – and my adventurousness, and autonomy”.View image in fullscreenStudiously unsmiling … James Dean.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Limited./AlamyFor the study, about 6,000 people across 12 countries were asked to think of someone they knew personally and considered “really cool”: they were then asked to describe them from a list of 15 personality traits and basic values.Results were remarkably consistent across age, gender, education and – to the researchers’ surprise – location. “We went in thinking that more individualistic countries would think autonomy is cooler than more collectivistic countries,” Pezzuti says. Yet what makes someone seem cool is apparently pretty much the same in Canada or Spain as it is in Chile or Nigeria.Still, it’s not enough to simply possess those traits, says Pezzuti. “Fundamental to being cool is expressing them in an appropriate way.”In a2018 study,he explored the enduring association of cool people with emotional restraint. James Dean, Bob Dylan, Johnny Cash, Victoria Beckham, Kanye West, Vogue’s Anna Wintour: all are studiously unsmiling (and often obscured behind sunglasses).Yet Pezzuti found the stony-faced act only conveys cool in competitive contexts, such as an athlete staring down their opponent. Otherwise, “being inexpressive tends to make a person seem cold”.The six traits recently identified are similarly context-specific, Pezzuti says. A musician could be seen as cool for disregarding what’s popular, expressing autonomy – but not if they’re too avant garde and alienate audiences.And the status points afforded by hedonism, hard partying and drugs can easily be squandered if they tip into irresponsible or sloppy behaviour. Just ask Pete Doherty, who once topped NME’s cool list.View image in fullscreenCommercial success no longer contradicts cool … Charli xcx performs at Glastonbury.Photograph: Scott A Garfitt/Invision/APThe shifting standard mirrors culture. Joel Dinerstein, professor of English at Tulane University and author of The Origins of Cool in Postwar America, agrees with Pezzuti’s findings on what makes someone seem cool, but says they don’t capture it entirely. “It’s a combination of rebellion, personal style, otherworldly confidence and charisma … It’s actually a very mysterious calculus.”Above all, “a person who’s cool does not give a shit about what you think about them”, Dinerstein says. “I wish I could find a shorter and non-vulgar way of saying it.”Age and physical attractiveness are also undeniably relevant in a culture that prizes youth and beauty. And in today’s consumer economy, to be cool, you must also be marketable.This wasn’t historically the case, Dinerstein says. The concept emerged in 1940s New York with jazz, pioneered by young Black artists. White writers (notably the Beats) later popularised it, but cool was born of African American culture, as an act of resistance.Slang served as code, excluding police and white people, while emotional restraint was a self-protective measure amid segregation. “‘Cool’ had real stakes,” says Dinerstein, informing the archetype of the rebel outsider or contrarian. “Cool was about having to fight for your place in society.”Most 20th-century cool icons were poor or working class. Kowtowing to the consumerist mainstream was disparaged as “selling out”, and “a sign that your artistic endeavour was tainted”, Dinerstein says.That changed in the mid-60s, with the Mad Men era of advertising. “Instead of selling you a product, they were going to sell you ‘coolness’ and mirror back to you that you were hip.”View image in fullscreenCool stalwart … Prince.Photograph: Bill Marino/Sygma/Getty ImagesThe commodification of cool has been continuous since, while “selling out” no longer resonates, Dinerstein says. “Once you are fully immersed in a consumer society, that outlaw sensibility can’t come from anywhere.”Rising housing costs and gentrification have wiped out cheap neighbourhoods that once fostered Bohemian scenes and subcultures. Cities such as New York, London and Paris are hubs of capital, not creativity – and today’s artists or outsiders, if not already wealthy, seek “to sell out immediately” in order to survive, Dinerstein says.Now commercial success doesn’t contradict cool; it confirms it. Even marketing is seenas creativework, as with Charli xcx’s album Brat, applauded for the campaign as much as the music, while making money from your art is applauded as “getting your bag”.“At this point, cool is correlated with celebrity,” Dinerstein says. In the History of Cool class he’s taught for 22 years, students often namecheck Timothée Chalamet, whose sex appeal and insouciance trump his “nepo-baby” privilege.Other figures mentioned – alongside stalwarts such as Bruce Springsteen, Prince, Samuel L Jackson and Patti Smith – are Zendaya, Aubrey Plaza, Billie Eilish, Greta Gerwig, Larry David and Bernie Sanders. The last two, Dinerstein says, buck the current cultural dominance of young women by being perceived as authentically unfiltered.Top tastemaker ... Cora Delaney, founder and director of creative agency EYC LtdYet his students often struggle to name someone they know personally who they think is cool, or even someone who is not publicly known. “It’s depressing – they can’t imagine living a quiet life that anyone would consider cool.”The 21st-century shift towards “selling in” and quantifiable status is driven by another cultural force: the internet.Surveys showgen Zand those evenyoungeraspire to be social-media influencers – also dangled as a path for aspiring artists and musicians. But the constant churn of self-promotion online and the breakneck media cycle make it difficult to make a dent.Culture is now split between megastars such as Beyoncé and Taylor Swift, too big to be properly cool, and countless micro-influencers and scenes that pass without impact.“We’re in a bunch of boutique niches, so it’s tougher to have any kind of consensus,” says Dinerstein. All told, “it makes being cool at the moment an incredible challenge”.Yet the pursuit of it remains big business. And so I ask the coolest person I know, and then the coolest persontheyknow, to connect me with someone they consider professionally cool – leading me to Cora Delaney, founder and director of creative agency EYC Ltd.Described asone of “London’s top tastemakers” andvaunted in Vogue, Delaney is a sort of cool broker; her agency EYC is a one-stop shop for companies wanting to buy street cred and individuals looking to sell theirs. As well as managing musicians, influencers and people-about-town, EYC runs edgy campaigns for mainstream brands such as H&M, and generates buzz at Fomo-inducing events.Delaney has worked with Lily Allen, artist and producer Nia Archives, rappers Aitch, J Hus and Central Cee, Chicken Shop Dates’ Amelia Dimoldenberg, Maya Jama and Rihanna – my pick for the coolest person alive.Meanwhile, I am usually wearing head-to-toe Uniqlo. Affordable, yes, practical, certainly – but hardly cool. My wardrobe is a gen-Z punchline: straight-leg (not baggy) jeans, leggings (as opposed to track pants), no-show socks.View image in fullscreen‘My pick for the coolest person alive’ … Rihanna.Photograph: Vittorio Zunino Celotto/Getty ImagesThe morning of my interview with Delaney, I am so uncharacteristically nervous, I change my outfit three times (out of Uniqlo). I arrive at EYC’s Notting Hill offices late, dishevelled and, as usual, lugging a backpack.Delaney radiates poise in a sleek black Chanel tracksuit, zipped up to the throat, and matching tweed trainers. Her dark hair is slicked back save for a single curl, placed just-so on her forehead.As I witter on I feel Delaney scrutinising me, Wintour-like, behind her heavy Miu Miu frames. The word, if not cool, is “self-possessed”. I find myself seeking her approval – and irrationally petrified she’ll somehow discover I’m going to a Coldplay concert that evening.Delaney, 32, is reluctant to claim being cool at school (“That’s so cringe”), but agrees it was a priority.As a teenager in Kent, she was “desperate” to get the NME each week, travelled for gigs and trawled Myspace to keep up with the indie scene. “I was always looking into subcultures, really thinking about what is cool … I had to look to London and the internet to know what was bubbling.”Later, studying fashion in London, she learned how to talk her way into fashion week events, pretending she was “supposed to be there – like, no doubt about it”, she says, eyes glinting.She then parlayed that talent for networking into styling and creative consulting work. “All the coolest people I know are hustlers,” Delaney says. “If you’ve just had it given to you, then it’s not that cool.”Mentally, I’m ticking them off: extroversion, adventurous, autonomous, open. But Delaney is sceptical of the traits hypothesis. Cool, to her, is about being an individual and “doing your own thing”.Rihanna, for instance, “is authentically herself. She’s never changed, doesn’t give a shit, knows what she wants … She was lovely, too,” Delaney adds.View image in fullscreen‘Cool feels to me like the stock market or Michelin restaurants: none of my business’ … Hunt.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianMore recently, she points to rappers Doechii and Fakemink. I saw Doechii’s Glastonbury set, and was awed by her attention to detail, tenacity and vision; I’ve never heard of Fakemink. (Two weeks after our interview, he breaks the Top 10.)Delaney attended his recent show. “All of the people that went were so different: they all had their own fashion sense and none of it was uniform … He started his own trend and his own thing. That’sactuallythe coolest thing you can do.”Her job, at EYC, is to find such originals, hone their X-factor and market it. “I like making deals,” Delaney says. “I like executing things that feel culturally relevant and exciting. And I like making money.” (Power: check.)But even she admits it’s getting harder to cut through the noise. If being cool is about being in the know, now social media swamps us with such information, “and it’s so watered-down and uninteresting,” she says.As for Dinerstein, he’s sceptical of the notion that you can make yourself more cool, noting that it tends to spring from an obsessive artistic vision – or, sometimes, family dysfunction. “Those are not things you can plan,” he says.Any attempt risks coming across fake, or try-hard – worse than actively being uncool. Even Dinerstein’s students, struggling to reach consensus on what’s cool, “are still pretty good at delineating cool people from posers”, he says.I can’t help but ask his authoritative opinion, as a professor of cool: from what he’s observed over the past hour on Zoom, am I cool?Dinerstein ponders. Even with celebrities, we can only ever comment on theirperceivedauthenticity, he says: “We don’t know what these people are like. They may be total assholes.”He certainly hasn’t seen enough of me to say for sure whether I’m cool. Dinerstein’s verdict is thrilling nonetheless. “My guess would be: you could be.”Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

In the book she claimed the prince “believed that having sex with me was his birthright”.Andrew has always denied claims he had sex with Giuffre when she was 17, and settled a civil case with her for a reported £12m with no admission of liability.Giuffre’s family said on Thursday that “today, she declares a victory” and that she had “brought down a British prince with her truth and extraordinary courage”.Buckingham Palace said in a statement: “Prince Andrew will now be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor.“His lease on Royal Lodge has, to date, provided him with legal protection to continue in residence. Formal notice has now been served to surrender the lease and he will move to alternative private accommodation. These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him.“Their majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse.”Royal Lodge – or mini-palace? The 30-room house caught up in the Prince Andrew scandalRead moreIt is understood that Andrew will move to a property on the private Sandringham estate in Norfolk, to be privately funded by the king.His ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, will also move out of Royal Lodge and will sort out her own living arrangements.Formal notice was given to surrender the lease at the Royal Lodge on Thursday and it is understood that Andrew’s move to Sandringham will take place “as soon as practicable”. He will receive a private provision from the king, with any other sources of income to be a matter for the former duke.The removal process applies to the titles of Prince, Duke of York, Earl of Inverness, Baron Killyleagh and the style His Royal Highness. The honours affected are Andrew’s Order of the Garter and Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order. He hadceased to use the HRH style in 2022but it had not been formally removed.As daughters of the son of a monarch, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie retain their titles in line with King George V’s letters patent of 1917.The king is understood to have acted now because while Andrew continues to deny the accusations against him, it is felt that there have been serious lapses of judgment.The royal family had announced on 17 October that Andrew wouldvoluntarily stop using the title Duke of Yorkand give up his honours as a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order and Royal Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter.But MPs proceeded to call for Andrew to be formally stripped of his titles. The public accounts select committee this weekwrote to the Treasury and crown estateto demand more information about the circumstances of the terms of his residence at the 30-room Royal Lodge and why he was required to pay only a peppercorn rent.Although the dukedom could be abolished through an act of parliament, it is understood that Charles did not wish to prevent parliament from focusing on urgent national issues.The dukedom of York is a peerage. The king is sending royal warrants to the lord chancellor to secure the removal of the dukedom from the peerage roll, and the title of prince and style of Royal Highness. The subsidiary titles of Inverness and Killyleagh are similarly affected.The move is understood to have taken place in consultation with the relevant government authorities. The government supports the decision.In a statement to the BBC, Giuffre’s family said: “Today, an ordinary American girl from an ordinary American family brought down a British prince with her truth and extraordinary courage.“Virginia Roberts Giuffre, our sister, a child when she was sexually assaulted by Andrew, never stopped fighting for accountability for what had happened to her and countless other survivors like her.“Today, she declares a victory. We, her family, along with her survivor sisters, continue Virginia’s battle and will not rest until the same accountability applies to all of her abusers and abetters, connected to Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.”Sky Roberts, Giuffre’s brother, commended the king for “setting a precedent” and thanked him for the mention of “victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse” in the statement, but said Andrew should be put “behind bars”.Giuffre alleged she was forced to have sex with Andrew three times – once at the convicted sex trafficker Maxwell’s home in London, once at Epstein’s address in Manhattan, and once on the disgraced financier’s private island, Little St James. Andrew has always denied the allegations.The Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, said it must have been “very difficult” for the king to take the steps against his sibling, but that it was right for the public not to tolerate sexual abuse allegations.The culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, told BBC Question Time that removing Andrew’s titles was a “really brave, important and right step” by the king, which sends a “powerful message” to sexual abuse victims.The Democratic congressman Suhas Subramanyam, who has previously called for Andrew to testify before a US Congressional committee about his links to Epstein and Maxwell, urged Andrew to give evidence.He said: “It’s clear that Prince Andrew has information about Epstein’s crimes and he must do more than just give up titles or hide from the public spotlight. He owes it to the victims to share everything he knows about Epstein’s criminal operation and come before the oversight committee.“Regardless, we will continue to pursue the files and all the evidence, no matter how rich and powerful the perpetrators involved.”Explore more on these topicsPrince AndrewKing Charles IIIMonarchyEd DaveyJeffrey EpsteinnewsShareReuse this content"

But Republican senators Susan Collins of Maine, Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul of Kentucky, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska joined the opposition party.The vote comes as Trump is wrapping up a week in Asia, where he struck a deal with China to lower tariffs on Chinese goods into the country and get China to buy up US soya beans, a pain point of the trade wars that had farmers on edge, among other concessions.Despite the opposition in the Senate, the House is unlikely to take any similar action. House Republicans created a rule earlier this year that will block resolutions on the tariffs from getting a floor vote.The tariff resolutions are a rebuke to the tariffs themselves and to Trump overstepping his authority and bypassing Congress. Senator Tim Kaine, a Democrat from Virginia, told reporters that the symbolic opposition should catch the president’s attention.“I did learn in the first Trump term that the president is responsive to things like this. When he sees Republicans starting to vote against his policies, even in small numbers, that makes an impression on him and can often cause him to alter his behavior,” Kaine said.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsUS SenateUS politicsDonald TrumpEconomic policyGlobal economynewsShareReuse this content"

No 10 wasinitially unable to explainwhy Starmer believed an apology from the chancellor was sufficient.But after a chaotic day, the lettings agency employed by Reeves said it was to blame for not applying for the licence, and apologised for the error.Emails subsequently released by Downing Street between the agency and Reeves’s husband, Nicholas Joicey, a senior civil servant, supported this version of events.Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, argued that this did not close the matter and called for Starmer to hold a full investigation. But with Southwark council saying it had no plans to take action against Reeves, her position seemed secure.Starmer confirmed there would be no further action after consulting with his independent adviser on ministerial standards, Laurie Magnus. In a letter to Reeves, he said: “I still regard this as a case of an inadvertent failure to secure the appropriate licence, which you have apologised for and are now rectifying … I see no need for any further action.”The departure of Reeves would have been a devastating blow for Starmer. The chancellor is pulling together a budget, to be announced on 26 November, that is seen as crucial to the prospects of his government.It would also have been the second loss of a key minister in recent months, after Angela Raynerstood down as deputy prime minister and housing secretaryin September over another property-related controversy, in her case the underpayment of stamp duty on an £800,000 seaside flat.The row over Reeves’s property affairs began on Wednesday evening with the publication of letters between her and Starmer abouther failure to pay for a £945 “selective licence” before she let the home, as required in some parts of Southwark.In her letter, Reeves said she had been unaware of the need for a licence, and that she had applied as soon as she was made aware.In his reply, Starmer said that, having consulted Magnus, he was satisfied the breach was “inadvertent” and that given her prompt action once she knew about the licence, an apology was sufficient.Downing Street refused to say whether Magnus had seen any evidence to support Reeves’s claim of having made an inadvertent mistake, or had taken her word for it.No 10 declined to say whether Reeves contravened the ministerial code or had potentially broken the law. Badenoch argued that if Reeves was fined she should be dismissed, citing Starmer’s argument after Boris Johnson’s fine for breaching Covid rules that “lawbreakers cannot be lawmakers”.In an early piece of good news for Reeves, Southwark released a statement saying that while it could not comment on individual cases, it pushed for enforcement action such as fines only when someone did not apply for a licence within 21 days of being warned they needed one, or if a property was found to be in an unsafe condition.No 10 later announced that Magnus had reopened his examination of the case after new information emerged in emails to and from Joicey.Shortly afterwards, Harvey & Wheeler, an estate and lettings agency based in Dulwich, south London, said it took responsibility for the lack of licence. While owners of properties usually applied for these, it said, in this instance a now-departed staff member offered to do so on Reeves’s behalf and then did not.In a statement, the company said that “in an effort to be helpful” the then property manager offered to apply for a licence on behalf of Reeves’s family, but did not and then left the company just before the tenancy began.“Unfortunately, the lack of application was not picked up by us as we do not normally apply for licences on behalf of our clients; the onus is on them to apply. We have apologised to the owners for this oversight,” it said. “We deeply regret the issue caused to our clients as they would have been under the impression that a licence had been applied for.”View image in fullscreenA redacted email chain supported the statement released by the lettings agency.Photograph: No 10The emails released later by Downing Street between the agency and Joicey supported this narrative.A message from the agent to Joicey read: “I will do the selective licence once the new tenant moves in as I won’t need to do this just yet. At the moment as we are only applying for a council licence.”In response, Joicey asks the agency to “please, do go ahead” and obtain the licence, plus an electrical safety test, asking if any more administrative tasks needed to be completed.In a new letter to Starmer, Reeves wrote that the agency had accepted responsibility, adding: “Nevertheless, as I said yesterday, I accept it was our responsibility to secure the licence. I also take responsibility for not finding this information yesterday and bringing it to your attention.“As I said to you today, I am sorry about this matter and accept full responsibility for it.”A Tory party spokesperson said: “Last night Rachel Reeves said ‘she had not been made aware of the licensing requirement’. Today, we find out that Reeves was alerted to the need for a licence in writing by the estate agents.“Having been caught out, the chancellor is now trying to make the estate agents take the blame … With more information coming to light every few hours, the prime minister needs to grow a backbone and start a proper investigation.”Explore more on these topicsRachel ReevesKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

These include credible reports of mass killings in various locations and summary executions during house-to-house searches and as civilians have tried to flee the city.“Communications have been cut off. The situation is chaotic. In this context, it is difficult to estimate the number of civilians killed. Despite commitments to protect civilians, the reality is that no one is safe in El Fasher. There is no safe passage for civilians to leave the city.”Pobee added: “External support is enabling the conflict. Weapons and fighters continue to flow into Sudan, further contributing to the already desperate situation.”Tom Fletcher, the under-secretary general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator, told the meeting: “El Fasher, already the scene of catastrophic levels of human suffering, has descended into an even darker hell.”Fletcher condemned thereported killing of nearly 500 peopleat the Saudi maternity hospital and said tens of thousands were fleeing to Tawila, where civilians, mostly women and children, faced extortion, violence and abduction.In a statement, the security council said recent developments in El Fasher had had a devastating impact on the civilian population and that council members “condemned reported atrocities being perpetrated by the RSF against the civilian population, including summary executions and arbitrary detentions”.The UN session was likely to be uncomfortable for the United Arab Emirates, the RSF’s key external backer, but diplomatic calls for the UN to recognise it had a responsibility to protect people from a deliberate genocide, as opposed to merely condemning a breach of international humanitarian law, were sparse.In the UK, the Foreign Office minister Stephen Doughty told MPs in the House of Commons: “The reports of mass atrocities against civilians and the forced displacement caused by the RSF advances in El Fasher are both horrifying and deeply alarming.”Calum Miller, the Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson, called for a ban on all UK arms sales to the UAE until it was proven that any such previous exports had not been transferred to Sudan for use by the RSF.The Guardianreported on Tuesdaythat British military equipment used by the RSF had been found on battlefields in Sudan, according to documents seen by the UN security council.Doughty admitted UK-made military equipment had been found in Sudan but distinguished “items” from “weaponry”, telling MPs: “We are aware of reports of a small number of UK-made items having been found in Sudan, but there is no evidence in the recent reporting of UK weapons or ammunition being used in Sudan.”The UAE has repeatedly denied allegations it gives military support to the RSF.Kate Ferguson, a co-director of Protection Approaches, a UK charity working to tackle identity-based violence and mass atrocities, said: “We need an emergency coalition of conscience to drive an immediate global effort to protect civilians and end the atrocities – and demonstrate to the UAE that enabling deliberate destruction of populations is not tolerated.“In the face of countless warnings, the international community has failed to uphold its collective responsibilities to protect El Fasher from genocide.”Human Rights Watch called for targeted sanctions to be imposed on the UAE leadership, while the US Democratic senator Chris Van Hollen called on his fellow senators to pass his bill banning US arms sales to the UAE.Last month the Quad – an external group comprising the US, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the UAE, responsible for overseeing diplomacy surrounding the conflict – outlined a roadmap for peace but it has not been implemented.It called for an initial three-month humanitarian truce to allow for rapid aid delivery, followed by a permanent ceasefire, and concluding with a nine-month transitional period leading to “an independent, civilian-led government with broad-based legitimacy and accountability”.Explore more on these topicsSudanUnited NationsAfricaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It is egregious to exclude refugees who completed years of rigorous security checks and are currently stuck in dangerous and precarious situations,” it added.Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, CEO of the US-based Global Refuge, took issue with the ethics of the decision.Shesaid: “This decision doesn’t just lower the refugee admissions ceiling. It lowers our moral standing. For more than four decades, the US refugee program has been a lifeline for families fleeing war, persecution, and repression. At a time of crisis in countries ranging from Afghanistan to Venezuela to Sudan and beyond, concentrating the vast majority of admissions on one group undermines the program’s purpose as well as its credibility.”Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council posted on X.Hewrote: “Since the US Refugee Program was created in 1980, it has admitted over two million people fleeing ethnic cleansing and other horrors. Now it will be used as a pathway for white immigration. What a downfall for a crown jewel of America’s international humanitarian programs.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Meanwhile, Black Africans, who make up 81.4% of the country’s population, only own around 4% of the land.Thursday’s announcement is not the first time Trump has slashed refugee resettlement numbers.During his first term, in 2020, Trumpset a limitof 15,000 refugees for the 2021 fiscal year. The previous year, in 2019, he had alreadyreducedthe limit to 18,000 for the 2020 fiscal year.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Of these, 31 are in inner London boroughs with high housing costs such as Tower Hamlets, Hackney, Haringey and Westminster.The newindices of multiple deprivationconfirm that attempts at levelling up have failed to shift stubbornly high levels of deprivation in so-called left-behind towns and cities in the Midlands and north of England.Blackpool, Middlesbrough, Burnley, Manchester and Birmingham are the top five most deprived local authority areas. At a neighbourhood level,Jaywickin Nigel Farage’s Clacton constituency in Essex tops the ranking for the fourth time in a row.The recalculation of income deprivation measures to recognise the effects of high housing costs in London represents a dynamic change in the picture of deprivation and may have politically charged ramifications for local authority and NHS budgets across the country.GraphicThe deprivation indices rank neighbourhoods across different aspects of everyday life: income (including income deprivation affecting children), employment, education, health, crime, barriers to housing and services, and the environment, and combines them into one score.The identification of a large cohort of micro-pockets of highly concentrated hardship – likely to be driven in part by welfare policies such as the two-child benefit limit and housing benefit caps as well as high rents – comes as the government prepares to publish its long-awaited child poverty strategy.In 2019, the last time the deprivation indices were published, no neighbourhood – defined as a small area with an average population of 1,500 inhabitants – had more than 90% of children living in income deprivation. In 2025, the figure has risen to 280, with 73 neighbourhoods where at least 99% of children are deprived.Previously, the neighbourhoods with the highest levels of child deprivation were found in northern cities such as Liverpool, Blackpool and Middlesbrough. The addition of housing costs has resulted in a dramatic reframing of child deprivation as a problem that is at its most extreme in the capital.In a neighbourhood in Stamford Hill, Hackney, for example, the proportion of children affected by income deprivation has jumped from just 8.9% in 2019 to 99.9% in 2025, and similar stories are repeated across other parts of London.A year ago the government promised that planned changes to the councils funding formula wouldredirect cash awayfrom the more affluent south-east of England to the Midlands and north. The new housing costs effect could mean the transfer of municipal resources may not be as marked as some expected.The new deprivation index is central to a revised council funding formula expected to be published in November. There are fears among northern authorities that they may lose out as a result of the housing costs change, though London authorities will see this as belated recognition of a longstanding housing affordability problem in the capital.The index highlights the depth and persistence of deprivation across many parts of England. Jaywick village is one of only two neighbourhoods in the country, alongside part of Margate Town, that is in the most deprived 10% across all seven deprivation measures.Neighbourhoods in coastal towns are still likely to be among the most deprived areas, with almost a fifth of them counting among the poorest 10% in England. However, 82% of them saw a slight improvement in their deprivation rank compared with the 2019 rankings.Three neighbourhoods, in central Rochdale, Ayresome in Middlesbrough and Bidston Hill in Wirral, have been ranked among the most deprived 100 across six measures since the index was first created in 2004.A handful of areas dramatically improved their deprivation rank after gentrification or regeneration. The area near the Nine Elms development in Lambeth, where a tube station opened in 2021 and which is home to the new US embassy, jumped from the bottom 20% of areas to the top 10%.Alison McGovern, the minister for local government and homelessness, said Labour’s devolution bill and recent investment in children, including £500m in children’s development and £1bn in crisis support, would help shift the dial on deprivation.“Today’s statistics are a damning indictment of a system that has left some communities broken, councils pushed to a financial cliff edge and residents facing the brunt of service cuts,” she said. “They tell us that in some of the most deprived areas, previous policies had barely begun to break the cycle of deprivation, health inequality, stagnant local growth and, most importantly, loss of hope.”You can see where your neighbourhood ranks using our postcode toolhere.Explore more on these topicsPovertyChildrenCommunitiesEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

That beats the spire of Ulm Minster in Germany, which tops out at 161.53 metres.The Sagrada Familia has not formally laid claim to the title but the numbers are there to compare: it is now 1.38 metres (4ft 6in) taller than the church in Baden-Württemberg.And it is still growing. The central Tower of Jesus Christ that is rising from the top of the church will reach to 172 metres when it is completed in the coming months.A crane placed the first part of the tower on top of the nave on Thursday morning.Vatican puts ‘God’s architect’ Antoni Gaudí on path to sainthoodRead moreThe first stone of the Sagrada Familia was placed in 1882 and Gaudí never expected it to be completed in his lifetime. Only one of its towers was finished when he died.Work has sped up over recent decades as the basilica became a major international tourist attraction with people around the world enthralled by Gaudí’s unique aesthetic that combines Catholic symbolism and organic forms.The money from entrance fees is used to fund the construction. Last year, 4.9 million people paid to visit.Work on the church’s elaborate facades and decorating its interior will continue for several years. It is expected to be completely finished around a decade from now, church officials said this year.Next year will be the 100th anniversary of the death of Gaudí. The church plans to hold several events to celebrate his legacy.Explore more on these topicsBarcelonaSpainAntoni GaudíArchitectureEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Over the Partygate scandal in particular, he called for Boris Johnson to quit over his rule-breaking. “You cannot be a lawmaker and a lawbreaker and it’s time to pack his bags,” he said.After Durham police launched an investigation into whether he had broken lockdown rules himself over having abeer and curry at a campaign event, he took a huge political gamble and said he would quit if he was found guilty. Luckily for him, he was not.At the time, and perhaps not entirely helpfully for the Labour leader who voters already thought was a bit uptight,Lisa Nandy described him as “Mr Rules”, leaning into the contrast between Starmer’s apparently high ethical standards and Johnson’s carelessness.Since taking power, the boomerang appears to have swung back towards the prime minister with a vengeance. Maintaining such levels of probity, not just for himself but for his cabinet, was always going to be an impossible task, especially in the flawed world of politics.But few foresaw that it would be Starmer himself who would be the first to undermine his own position, when his failure to see that acceptingfree glasses, clothes and Taylor Swift ticketscould break what little belief there was that his government would be different.Since then, the scandals have come thick and fast, although they have varied in degree of severity. Louise Haigh wasforced to resign as transport secretarylast November after it emerged she had been convicted of fraud over a missing work phone in 2014.Tulip Siddiqquit as a Treasury ministerin January after accepting the government was being harmed by the furore over her close ties to her aunt, the ousted prime minister of Bangladesh now accused of corruption.The departure of Starmer’s deputy, Angela Rayner, in September after she breached the ministerial code over herunderpayment of stamp dutyon her £800,000 seaside flat was the most serious blow yet.Yet Starmer has always been clear there would be no special treatment. “People will only believe we’re changing politics when I fire someone on the spot. If a minister – any minister – makes a serious breach of the rules, they will be out. It doesn’t matter who it is, they will be sacked,” he told his biographer Tom Baldwin before the election.When it emerged on Wednesday thatRachel Reeves, second only to the prime minister in seniority, could be in hot water it sent a collective shudder round the top of government. If the chancellor were to go, the whole Starmer project could come tumbling down.Downing Street, having apparently learned from the Rayner row, acted decisively, announcing that the chancellor had admitted to“inadvertently” breaking housing rulesby renting out her south London home without the specific £945 licence required by the local council.Not only that, but the prime minister had already spoken to Reeves, consulted his ethics adviser, Laurie Magnus, and decided that further investigation into the matter was “not necessary”, all within hours of the Daily Mail story breaking.Early on Thursday morning, government insiders were confident that Reeves, while having made a mistake, had an excuse: she had not been informed by her lettings agency that her home was a designated area which required a licence. She had quickly rectified the error by applying for one.But Kemi Badenoch, whose Tory researchers are thought to be behind the story, was determined to get a scalp. “This whole thing stinks. The prime minister needs to stop trying to cover this up, order a full investigation and, if Reeves has broken the law, grow a backbone and sack her,” she posted.Downing Street initially failed to draw a line under the story by refusing to say whether Magnus had seen any evidence to support the claim Reeves had made an “inadvertent” mistake, or if she had contravened the ministerial code or broken the law in breaching Southwark council rules.View image in fullscreenA redacted email chain supported the statement released by the lettings agencyPhotograph: No 10Fortunately for Reeves, she had receipts. Her husband dug out emails from the lettings agency they used to rent out their home. Just before they were published, the agent issued a statement saying it had apologised to the couple for an “oversight” that meant they failed to obtain a licence.The chancellor appears to be in the clear, although there are still questions over why her story changed overnight: from her being unaware that a licence was necessary, to the agency having told them it would apply on their behalf.Also, the law clearly states it is the owner – rather than the lettings agent – that is legally responsible for applying. It is also unclear how the couple failed to notice almost £1000 had not left their bank account.While the misdemeanour is relatively minor when compared with numerous ones committed during previous Tory administrations, Reeves’s brush with the standards regime underlines the challenges of Starmer’s position on ethics.His ambition of restoring broken public faith in the political classes, gradually worn down after years of scandals, may be understandable. But the pitfalls of taking the moral high ground – as the boomerang comes back round – are clear: people are fallible.Explore more on these topicsRachel ReevesLabourKeir StarmerPartygateEthicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

Released roughly once every five years, the ranking is based around small areas known as “lower layer super output areas” (or LSOAs) – each usually home to between 1,000 and 3,000 people.In simple terms, it’s a national league table of deprivation. The league table ranks neighborhoods across different aspects of everyday life: income, education, health, crime, barriers to housing and services, and the environment, and combines them into one score.Areas in the middle sit roughly around the median average for England as a whole, while those at either end show where the country’s deepest inequalities - and greatest advantages - lie.Use the box below to find out where your neighborhood ranks compared to the rest of the country – and how things have changed over the last six years.

That killed us.”As the only shop for 20 miles around, The Ferry Stores provided an essential community hub for the 200 inhabitants of the windswept coastal village for more than half a century. It was open all year round, providing post office services and selling a wide range of grocery goods as well as petrol.Keeping the shop well-stocked was a challenge in itself, demanding an eight-hour round trip – including at least one ferry crossing and a drive on a twisting single track road – to ensure that customers’ needs were met.“I worked in it as a child, my sons did too, so it is very emotional to close it – it is a shame and very sad,” said Doherty. “It is the end of an era. But it is not just us. Other rural shops are facing the same problems. You can’t compete with home delivery and online.”View image in fullscreenMorag Doherty, who runs The Ferry Stores in Kilchoan. The village shop provides a post office service and sells a wide range of grocery goods as well as petrol.Photograph: Peter Jolly. Northpix/Peter Jolly/NorthpixBrendan O’Hara, the SNP MP for Argyll, Bute and South Lochaber, said the loss of shops like this one “strikes at the very heart of rural community life because without access to a shop, fuel and postal services, communities cannot remain sustainable and such a loss will inevitably further accelerate the depopulation crisis threatening our remote areas.”The nearest filling station is now in Strontian, 29 miles away, while the next post office is 22 miles away in Acharacle.In a heartfelt statement to customers, the couple said they had struggled with the decision to close. “Over the past several years we have seen a steady decline in footfall as shopping habits have changed, particularly with the rise of online and home delivery services. While we have done our best to adapt and keep the shop running for the benefit of our community, it has become increasingly difficult to sustain the business”.“We would like to extend our heartfelt thanks to our wonderful staff, past and present, who have worked tirelessly to keep the shop running smoothly. We are deeply grateful to our loyal customers who have continued to support us over the years. Your friendship, encouragement and custom have meant the world to us and have kept the shop going far longer than might otherwise have been possible.”“After much thought, we have decided that now is the right time to bring this chapter to a close and step into retirement. We take comfort in knowing that we’ve served this village for seven years and have been part of its life and history.”The headline on this article was amended on 30 October 2025. An earlier version said this was the UK’s most westerly village shop; this should have said Britain’s most westerly mainland village shop.Explore more on these topicsScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

I say this as someone who had a baby last December and has spent the months since getting to grips with what’s actually useful in the first year of a child’s life.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Blankets and cuddly toys are often go-to presents for little ones, and while they’re lovely gifts, there are lots of alternatives that new parents will be grateful for. This guide features all kinds of toys, books and gifts that I have tried and tested with my baby, as well as expert insights on how these items are beneficial for little ones. I’ve also included practical gifts, such as easy-to-clean playmats and zipped sleepsuits, that make nappy changes less fraught.How I selectedSince I had my daughter at the end of last year, I’ve been immersed in all things baby. As a new parent, there is so much noise around the products youhaveto have that sometimes it can be hard to know what you need. Compiling this list, I’ve included books and toys my baby loved during testing, and those that we’ve had a lot of use out of over the past 11 months.I’ve focused on toys that will help encourage a baby’s development at different stages, as well as being fun for parents and little ones to interact with together. I’ve also selected practical products, such as a pram rocker and a comfortable and easy-to-clean playmat – all things that can save the sanity of the new parent. I also spoke to parentings experts to gain insight into the benefits of different types of toys. Based on this, I’ve offered suggestions for gifts that fit their recommendations.Items for babies are often used for a short time as they change and develop quickly. If you’re looking for a more affordable or sustainable way to shop, you can find lots of secondhand baby things in great condition at charity shops, on Vinted or in Facebook and WhatsApp groups.The best toys and gifts for newborns and babies in 2025Smart sleepsuitView image in fullscreenTwo-way zipsleepsuit, pack of threeFrom £17 at John LewisBefore I had a baby, my criteria when buying them clothes was: “Is it cute?” Now I know what I should have considered was: “How does it do up?” Given the number of times a baby needs a change of clothes, this is a crucial detail. Buttons are fiddly and poppers are OK, but when it comes to sleepsuits, the best fastener is a two-way zip. You can undo them from the bottom for swift nappy changes, and the ease of the zip makes changing outfits much quicker.These sleepsuits were a life-saver when my baby was little and became my favourite ones to use. They come in sets of three and are available in neutrals,pinksandblues. In my experience, they come up big, but that means there’s room for babies to grow.Materials:cottonSuitable for:newborns to 24 monthsNap saviourView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Isabelle Aron/The GuardianRockit rocker£49.95 at John Lewis£39.95 at AmazonI’ve spent hours pounding the pavements to get my daughter to go to sleep – and stay asleep – in her pram. I appreciate the chance to stretch my legs and up my step count, but sometimes you do need to sit down. That’s why the Rockit Rockerhas been an essential bit of baby kit for me.This rocket-shaped portable rocker is attached to the pram with a bracket and vibrates to simulate the sensation of the pram being pushed or rocked. You can adjust the speed of the vibrations, too. Mine favours a gentle rock, and that has given me the chance to finish cups of tea while they’re still hot and eat meals in cafes with two hands.Materials:plasticSuitable for:from birthMess-free printsView image in fullscreenLittle Prints imprint kit£14.99 at Little PrintsEveryone tells you how quickly your baby will grow up, and guess what? It’s true. Give parents the gift of preserving those precious memories with this clever kit from Little Prints. It has everything you need to take an imprint of your baby’s hands and feet but, crucially, is mess-free. You open up the sealed ink pad and place it ink-side down on the imprint card, then put your baby’s feet or hands on top, so that it makes an imprint on the card below without getting any ink on their skin. Available in black, blue, silver and pink, it makes a lovely present for new parents, and it’s straightforward enough to get your head around even in the newborn haze.Materials:card and ink padSuitable for:from birthPop-up bookView image in fullscreenPeekaboo Moon£7.99 at the Guardian Bookshop£7.99 at WaterstonesMy daughter loves a book with flaps, but now that she can lift them, she’s started enthusiastically ripping them, leaving me with a pile of sticky-tape repairs. But the books we have from the Peekaboo series, written by Camilla Reid and illustrated by Ingela P Arrhenius, are still intact thanks to the thick board material and the use of sliders rather than paper flaps. Peekaboo Moon is our go-to bedtime book, but there are lots of others in the series. It’s filled with engaging illustrations, sliders on every page and a mirror at the back.It’s light on text, but that’s a good thing, according to Larissa Hazell, a nanny with 14 years’ experience and the founder ofthe Childcare Guide, who says: “Books that only have a few words per page support a baby’s language development because it focuses the reader on connecting that word to the picture. It also encourages the reader to talk more about the picture, which is more engaging for the baby.”Materials:boardSuitable for:from birthPram playView image in fullscreenFreddie theFirefly activity toy£14.99 at Boots£11.20 at AmazonThere are certain items I don’t leave the house without these days – a nappy bag, the pram rain cover and Freddie the Firefly. This clip-on toy packs in a lot of stimulation – there’s a squeaking button, a mirror, a teether and loads of different colours and textures to keep little ones entertained when you’re out. I mostly have it clipped on to the pram, but it’s also good for the car seat. If, like my baby and me, you can’t get enough of this little guy, there’s alsoa highchair version.Materials:polyester, ABS, TPRSuitable for:from birthGood eggsView image in fullscreenTomy Hide and Squeak bright chicks£10.99 at Hamleys£13.74 at AmazonI have yet to meet a baby that doesn’t love playing with this toy. A set of six brightly coloured eggs, three of which are shakers and three of which squeak, it comes in a handy box so you can easily tidy them away or take them out with you. As well as shaking and squeaking, the eggs are good for bashing together, and my daughter is equally obsessed with the turquoise egg box they come in.Materials:plasticSuitable for:0-12 monthsSensory setView image in fullscreenNewborn sensory box£44 at Priya and PeanutThis sensory set from Priya and Peanut includes 10 different toys designed to encourage a baby’s development from birth to six months. Everything is black, white and red; babies can only see black and white initially, and red is one of the first colours they can distinguish.“Sensory cards and books are really good because everything is blurry for newborns in the early days, and they can only see in black and white,” says Hazell. “When they have that high contrast between black and white in front of them, they can start to see those shapes and images more clearly. It holds their focus more and strengthens their visual development.”This set was a hit with my daughter when she was younger – she was engaged in the sensory cards, the decals were a life-saver during nappy change meltdowns, and she loved the sensory foil blanket. You can buy some of the items individually, but the set makes a thoughtful gift.Materials:paper, cotton, polyester, plastic and beech woodSuitable for:from birthPretty playmatView image in fullscreenTotter + Tumble playmatFrom £90 at Totter + TumbleGiven how much time you spend on the floor once you have a baby, a good playmat is well worth having. My daughter and I have put in plenty of hours on our Totter + Tumble playmats. Made from high-quality memory foam, they’re noticeably more comfortable than other mats I’ve tried. My baby loves playing on it, and the fact that it’s padded means it’s ideal for her to move around on as she gets increasingly mobile. They’re also easy to wipe clean, with no awkward dips or ridges.The tasteful designs will actually look nice in your home, with everything from geometric to botanical prints, as well as a new Persian rug-inspired collection. They’re reversible, so you have the option to switch things up, too. The mats are available in a range of sizes, but I’d recommend going as large as the space will allow – once babies are on the move, bigger is better so that they have room to roam.Materials:nontoxic PVC sealed memory foamSuitable for:from birthMultipurpose cupsView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Isabelle Aron/The GuardianLamaze Pile and Play stacking cups£4.99 at Hamleys£8.33 at AmazonStacking cups are one of my daughter’s favourite toys, and I’m a big fan of them too. Julie Pearson, development manager for theEarly Years Alliance, says they’re a great “open-ended” toy, meaning “there’s no right or wrong way to play with them. They’ve got lots of uses and support things such as early problem-solving; young babies will like banging them together, while older babies will try to stack them. This builds their confidence as they’re able to explore them in their own way.”My baby loves bashing them together, knocking down a tower I’ve built with them, or filling them up with water in the bath. Parents will appreciate that they stack together in a compact way, are easy to clean and are ideal for on the go.Materials:plasticSuitable for:from six monthsStep by stepView image in fullscreenHeimess baby gym and walking heart bear£92.50 at BabipurBaby gyms can be great in the early months, but they’re less useful once your child is more mobile. Being a baby gym and a walker, this has more longevity, which is ideal when choosing a toy that’s going to take up some space. My daughter loves this, and as a parent, it’s a joy to watch her interact with it. As a tiny baby, she would lie underneath it and try to grab the hanging rings, and now that she’s a bit older, she pulls herself up on to it (as it’s on wheels, I do have to hold it still) and practises her standing and walking. Made from wood, it’s also a cute design that won’t look garish in your living room.Materials:woodSuitable for:from birthSquishy bookView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Isabelle Aron/The GuardianFarm Tails book£16.20 at Mori£18 at John LewisWith bright colours, crinkly pages and textured animal tails to play with, the Jellycat Farm Tails book has lots to keep your baby entertained; my daughter loves pulling on the tails and turning the pages.“Crinkly books with stuff dangling off them encourage parents or carers to communicate with the child, talking about how the book feels, the sound it’s making, or the colour of it,” says Hazell. “You don’t necessarily need words on the page when there are other things to engage the parent to talk with the child, which allows for more free-flow communication.”. My baby can interact with it independently while sitting in her highchair or pram, but it’s also good for playing with together.Materials:polyester and cottonSuitable for:from birthWater playView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Isabelle Aron/The GuardianColour-changing bath book£12.15 at Natural Baby Shower£13.50 at Etta LovesEtta Loves specialises in making products designed to support a baby’s visual and cognitive development; they’re also aesthetically pleasing for adults. Designed in collaboration with the artist Camille Walala, this colour-changing bath book is filled with engaging shapes that go from black and white to bright colours when submerged in water. It’s suitable from birth, but will last well beyond the newborn days – my 10-month-old still has fun splashing about with it, and older babies can enjoy using their fingers or a paintbrush to bring the colours to life.Materials:made from sponge with a waterproof coveringSuitable for:from birthBaby ballView image in fullscreenBright Starts Oball£3.99 at John Lewis£3.99 at BootsAs babies get beyond the newborn stage, they start being able to grasp things – and the Bright Starts Oball is designed with this in mind. My daughter loved it when she was younger and is still a fan now. It’s easy for little hands to grip, helping them develop their fine motor skills. It’s also a wonderful toy for taking out with you, and while it’s suitable for newborns, older babies will enjoy playing with it too.“The thing that’s nice about these balls is that the space for them to hold on to is really small, so it’s a toy that they can properly grasp from a young age, whereas a lot of other toys are too big,” says Hazell. There are lots of other toys in the range too, including rattles, cars and animals, all with the same easy-to-grip design.Materials:plasticSuitable for:from birthTummy time toysView image in fullscreenHalilit tummy time sensory kit£18.99 at Kiddies Kingdom£19.99 at John LewisMany babies really aren’t into tummy time, especially in the early days, so having a toy for them to focus on can be helpful. Suitable from three months old, this set includes a spinning tube, a shaking drum and a double-sided booklet with colourful designs on one side and black-and-white ones on the other. My daughter’s tummy time days are behind her, but she still loves the drum, which is a handy distraction during car journeys.The booklet can be propped up for babies to look at during tummy time; the toys will draw their attention, and eventually they’ll start reaching for them (shout out to the spinning toy for getting my baby to master rolling).Materials:plastic and cardSuitable for:from three monthsChasing rainbowsView image in fullscreenRainbow sensory ribbon ring£6.99 at the Little Sensory Bag CoThere are loads of ways you can use this simple sensory toy with little ones: hang it over a baby gym, wave it side to side above their face while they’re lying down, or pull it forwards and back in front of them. When my daughter was younger, we used them at baby classes – all the babies loved them. I’ve also had a few passed on to me secondhand, and they’re a great way to entertain your baby at home – just stick on some music and wave the ribbon ring around in front of them.As well as being a lovely way to play with young babies, a sensory ribbon ring has lots of benefits, including helping them to develop their tracking and motor skills, as well as hand-eye coordination. “If you wave scarves, ribbons and things like that across a baby’s eyeline, they’ll start to reach out and grasp them,” says Pearson. “To begin with, it will need to be quite close to the baby’s face, because they can only see about 30cm ahead when they’re quite tiny.”Materials:wood and ribbonsSuitable for:from birthRead all about itView image in fullscreenCrinkly newspapers£15 at Eddie & BeeThese baby-friendly newspapers make for a sweet present. Made from soft cloth that makes a scrunching sound, the Nursery Times is filled with bright illustrations and simple bits of text, laid out like a newspaper. You can choose from a range of topics, including safari animals, gardens and – my personal favourite – the Lionesses. My daughter enjoys playing with this and scrunching the pages, and it’s fun to read to her, too.Materials:polyesterSuitable for:from birthHide and seekView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Isabelle Aron/The GuardianFarm plush activity cube£24 at Jojo Maman Bebe£24 at NextThis activity cube is made from soft and tactile fabric, making it suitable from birth, but as babies get older, they’ll find new ways to interact with it. It comes with six soft balls with textures that make different sounds when touched. My daughter likes squishing the balls and taking them out of the box, and it’s a nice thing for us to play with together. “Older babies who can sit up enjoy emptying and filling things, so look for toys that have the opportunity to put something in and take it back out again,” says Pearson.Materials:polyesterSuitable for:from birthRoll with itView image in fullscreenOli & Carol orange baby ball£17.99 at Little ConceptsFrom toys to teethers, Barcelona brand Oli & Carol uses natural rubber to make lovely baby items in fun designs. This ball, made to look like an orange, is small, light and squishy, making it perfect for little kids to play with. My daughter enjoys playing with it on her playmat, but it’s also handy for when she’s in the bouncer, highchair or car seat, as it’s easy for her to hold. Plus, it has no holes in it, so it can be used in the bath without the dreaded risk of mould, and it’s easy to wipe clean. Other fruit- and veg-inspired balls in the same range include a tomato, cabbage and melon.Materials:natural rubberSuitable for:from birthCute knitwearView image in fullscreenPersonalised cardigan or jumperFrom £22.05 at EtsyI bought one of these personalised cardigans for my daughter in the early weeks of her life (probably at 3am during a night feed), and it brought me so much joy when it arrived. You can choose between a knitted cardigan or jumper in various colours and sizes, and name personalisation comes as standard. This makes a really lovely gift – I’ve since bought them for friends with new babies.Materials:acrylic woolSuitable for:from birthWobbly toyView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Isabelle Aron/The GuardianLittle Dutch stacking rings£13.56 at Natural Baby Shower£15.50 at ScandibornWe bought this stacking ring for my daughter when she turned six months, and at almost 11 months old, she has yet to tire of it. It comes with five different-sized rings that stack on a holder that rocks from side to side. My baby is a fan of taking the rings off the holder (not so much putting them back on yet, so that’s my job), and knocking the whole thing over.It’s ideal for taking on trips or to other people’s houses, and you can hand individual rings to your baby in the car to play with. It comes in two different colourways, both featuring a range of pastel hues.Materials:plasticSuitable for:six months-plusWhat you need to knowWhat to buy for a newborn or baby“Play involves interaction between people,so books and toys that involve being with the people they love the most will be an important part of their early development,” says Pearson. When buying a toy, “try to think about the different things it can do and whether it’s open-ended – things like a soft ball that they can roll and throw, or some soft blocks. This will support babies’ confidence and allow them to explore it in many different ways.”Pearson also advises making sure that any toys are suitable for the age of the baby, and meetsafety standards– look out for the CE or UKCA marks, as well as the British Toy and Hobby Association’s Lion Mark. “Babies will hit themselves with toys and throw them, so it’s important to choose ones that are soft, or don’t have sharp edges if they’re wooden,” adds Hazell. When buying plastic toys, it’s a good idea to look for ones that are BPA- and phthalate-free.Do babies need toys?Sensory toys are best for the first few months, says Pearson. “For babies aged zero to three months, think about things that promote sensory exploration. For example, books with bold black-and-white images and soft toys that make a crinkle sound when a baby grips or moves them.” As babies get to three to six months, “they start to reach out and grasp things”, says Pearson. “Think of items that are easy and safe for babies to hold and manipulate.”Once a baby is six months and older, they will start becoming increasingly mobile and wanting to interact with toys more. “At six to 12 months, they will start being more engaged and controlled with their movements, along with becoming aware of cause and effect,” says Hazell. “They will also begin to use their fine motor skills more, so look for toys they can manipulate – shake, bang, push or pull.”For more, read the Filter’s pick of thebest eco-friendly baby productsandparents on the baby gear they wouldn’t go withoutIsabelle Aron is a lifestyle and culture journalist.

Prunella Scales was in one of them. During a break I was doing a crossword and getting stuck. She sat down next to me and had a look at the mess I was making. “Silly boy!” she said (I was perhaps 30 at the time). “It’s ‘surprise’, not ‘suprise’!” and we soon finished it off. In the end I did around 25 plays, but that’s the only conversation with an actor I remember. Lovely lady.James, Sussex‘Perfection’: how Prunella Scales’s Sybil Fawlty is one of TV comedy’s best charactersRead more‘She winked at me – what confidence that gave me’When I was about 12, a pupil at Nonsuch high school in Ewell, my art teacher entered a piece of my work into an art competition. The brief was to design a Christmas card. My entry was a painting of Mary on a donkey with Joseph in an American-style cityscape, like the Sunset Strip, with city lights and signs around them. I’ve no idea where that idea came from. Anyway, I came second and went somewhere in central London to the awards do, where Prunella Scales was the celebrity congratulating us and giving out the awards. As she shook my hand, she whispered: “I liked yours best!” and gave me a wink. What confidence that gave me. I became an art teacher.Deborah Harris, artist and retired art teacher, Somerset‘That laugh!’We have been fortunate enough to watch Fawlty Towers on PBS in America. It never got old, enjoying her as Sybil over and over again. And, OMG, that laugh! To have lost a talent and wit such as hers in the same month as Patricia Routledge is truly sad.David, Vermont, USA‘Her accents were wonderful’I love listening to audiobooks and an early treasure I had on CD was Prunella Scales reading Jane Austen’s Emma. In this unabridged rendition, her different accents for the characters were wonderful and brought out the comedy in the novel, with Miss Bates completely distinctive in pace and Mrs Elton’s Birmingham roots hilariously apparent.Clare Fisher, Wales‘Her chemistry with John Cleese was perfect’View image in fullscreenComic genius … Prunella Scales with John Cleese, Connie Booth and Andrew Sachs on Fawlty Towers.Photograph: BBC/AllstarThe comic genius of Prunella Scales as Sybil in Fawlty Towers brought Australian families together in the 1970s and 80s. Her on-screen chemistry with John Cleese as Basil was perfect. Decades later, I appreciated the breadth of her acting when she graced the stage in Sydney in her one-woman play An Evening With Queen Victoria. She’ll be missed.Vanessa Witton, Sydney, Australia‘She did what she had always done: perform brilliantly’A few years ago, perhaps 15, I attended an arts festival in the South Downs. The event featured poetry with music from a string quartet. The readers were Timothy West [her husband] and Prunella Scales; I think the overall theme was love, appropriately. A magical evening, with few hints of Pru’s emerging condition. A perfect, unhurried setting for her to do what she had always done: perform brilliantly.Adrian, Southampton‘Do call me Pru’In my teens I was involved with the Chester Summer music festival. Visiting artists often stayed with festival helpers, and after her play An Evening With Queen Victoria I was invited to supper at her hosts’ home. I was surprised to be sat next to her. She said: “Do call me Pru”, and we had a wonderful conversation. She was charmingly inquisitive about my future plans and not remotely “starry”. I treasure that memory.Andrew, Reading‘She spread magic’View image in fullscreenSuch passion … Prunella Scales and Timothy West on Great Canal Journeys.Photograph: Everett Collection/AlamyAs well her fabulous acting, Prunella and Timothy did much to promote our amazing canal networks. I myself lived on a narrowboat for four years, continuously cruising between Essex, London, up and down the Thames, into the Midlands and Gas Street Basin, back to Oxford, and the Kennet and Avon to Bath. Thanks to Pru and Timothy for spreading the word about how precious our waterways are and what a magical environment they can be. It is important that someone like Pru is remembered not just for her exceptional acting talent but for other issues, such as our canals, that she was passionate about.Cathy Elder, CardiffExplore more on these topicsTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And then there are those who, on the night, reluctantly start rooting around for that cat-ear headband they bought several years ago.The Kardashians, Heidi Klum and the singer Janelle Monáe fall into the first category. For weeks, Kim has been sharing pictures of her cobweb-adorned hallway as she gears up for her annual party, Klum has been hosting her own “Heidiween” for more than 20 years, with her costumes getting more elaborate each time, and this weekMonáe told Voguethat Halloween is her “creative playground”. After previously dressing up as a headless bride and the fly that landed on Mike Pence, this year she has gone for Dr Seuss’s Cat in the Hat character, complete with mechanical tail.For those of us in the latter group, these Halloween high achievers are enough to make us want to switch off the lights and pretend not to be in when trick-or-treaters start hammering on the door. But don’t panic. There is still time to impress. A costume that riffs on the zeitgeist is perfect for a last-minute party invitation. A sort of IYKYK insider nod, it gives the illusion of having thought deeply about your look, resulting in instant cultural cachet. Best of all, there is no express [insert name of mass-market retailer] order required.A stolen ideaView image in fullscreenVest foot forward … Add some jewellery to a hi-vis.Photograph: James Hughes/AlamyThe group of thieves who broke into the Louvre recently, stealing more than £76m worth of jewels while wearing security vests, have given us one of the easiest costume ideas for Halloween.

For the last decade, Von Hauswolff has dealt in music that is solemn, echo-laden, heavy on the drone of her beloved pipe organ and fully deserving of the adjective gothic.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Iconoclasts.Her work has elicited comparisons to Nico and Diamanda Galás; 40 years ago, it might have been packaged in a hauntingly abstract Vaughan Oliver sleeve and released on 4AD. She has collaborated with Swans, Sunn O))) and the black metal band Wolves in the Throne Room. Her last album, 2020’s All Thoughts Fly, was a collection of instrumentals, recorded on a replica of a 17th-century German baroque organ in a church in Gothenburg: you can perhaps get some idea of its emotional tone from the fact that it was released on a label best known for releasing doom metal.One blogger called her “the high priestess” of “satanic harmonies”, a description that caused her trouble. Taking the blogger at their word, fundamentalist Catholics succeeded in getting hershows at churches in Nantes and Paris cancelled: in the former location, protesters blocked the entrance. Clearly, Von Hausswolff doesn’t seem much like an artist out to challenge Sabrina Carpenter or Taylor Swift.Yet the description of Iconoclasts as “pop” fits, albeit with caveats. It’s far more straightforwardly melodic than her previous work, and it is no stretch to imagine the most straightforward track, the ballad Aging Young Women (a duet with Ethel Cain), on the radio or in the charts: it sounds a little like Lana Del Rey, had Del Rey somehow contrived to end up at the bottom of a well. Though it is perhaps worth noting that Cain is not the key collaborator here; nor is Iggy Pop, who turns up on another ballad, The Whole Woman, his baritone croon possessed of an affecting wobbliness at 78. It’s avant garde saxophonist Otis Sandsjö, whose music was winningly described by Jazzwise magazine as “intentionally puzzling”: suffice to say, his is not the first name you would think of were you planning a full-scale storming of Spotify’s Hot Hits playlist.Anna Von Hausswolff: The Whole Woman ft Iggy Pop –videoSandsjö is everywhere on Iconoclasts, his sax leading the instrumentals Struggle with the Beast and Consensual Neglect, his woodwind arrangements adding a note of warmth to the title track and The Mouth, his playing alternately raw – there are moments when you can hear his fingers hitting the keys of his instrument – becalmed and driving: the skronky funk of his performance on Struggle With the Beast powers the track for nearly nine minutes. And yet, you couldn’t describe his contributions as dominating: there’s too much else going on.Iconoclasts is a long album – it lasts the best part of an hour and a quarter – but it still feels crammed with sound. There are heaving synthesised drones that, in their intensity, occasionally evoke the sound of Fuck Buttons’ 2009 masterpiece Tarot Sport; explosions of fizzing noise; cinematic orchestrations; and drum patterns that marry a ritualistic-sounding thunder to rhythms that variously recall the pulse of dance music, the glitterbeat stomp of glam, and even reggae. Von Hausswolff is less inclined to erupt into shrieks and ululations than she once was, but her singing still has a blazing forcefulness that cuts through the echo she is frequently doused in.It’s music that feels as if it’s in constant motion, amplified by the fact that the melodies, rich and beautiful as they are, seldom adhere to any standard verse-chorus structure: the songs here usually end up somewhere very different from the place they started. Indeed, its maximalism might be too overwhelming to take in one long sitting.Anna von Hausswolff: ‘It’s still weird to see a woman screaming her nuts out’Read moreBut if it is too much, it’s too much of a good thing: with their sense of movement, their twists and turns, their radiant tunes, their emotive power, these songs are exhausting because they’re exhilarating. For an album with a worldview summed up by a striking line from Facing Atlas that declares life on Earth “full of shit and full of evil”, that ponders ageing and paralysing depression, and on which it is frequently unclear whether the songs are dealing with something personal or with current events (“the sky is crashing down upon the ships of freedom … the life we had has vaporised into the sky”), its overall mood is a kind of frazzled euphoria. The songs surge and build, the bursts of noise feel cathartic. It’s as if the music is fighting against the tone of the lyrics, urgently pressing forward despite everything. “I’m breaking up with language,” Von Hauswolff sings on Stardust, “in search of something bigger.” In the strange, unique, expansive, impassioned and experimental take on pop presented on Iconoclasts, she seems to have found it.What Alexis listened to this weekSampha – Cumulus/MemoryCo-written by Romy of the xx, but left off Sampha’s 2023 album Lahai, Cumulus/Memory is two songs in one, changing tempo midway through but united by a reflective, small-hours mood.Explore more on these topicsPop and rockAlexis Petridis's album of the weekExperimental musicalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

Photograph: cameranest/ShutterstockHow did an obscure district in a neglected state become India’s byword for digital deceit?BySnigdha PoonamThu 30 Oct 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 30 Oct 2025 17.38 EDTShareOn the surface, the town of Jamtara appeared no different from neighbouring districts. But, if you knew where to look, there were startling differences. In the middle of spartan villages were houses of imposing size and unusual opulence. Millions of Indians knew why this was. They knew, to their cost, where Jamtara was. To them, it was no longer a place; it was a verb. You lived in fear of being “Jamtara-ed”.Over the past 15 years, parts of this sleepy district in the eastern state of Jharkhand had grown fabulously wealthy. This extraordinary feat of rural development was powered by young men who, armed with little more than mobile phones, had mastered the art of siphoning money from strangers’ bank accounts. The sums they pilfered were so staggering that, at times, their schemes resembled bank heists more than mere acts of financial fraud.In a short period, scam calls became an almost universal experience in India. With every innovation in India’s digital marketplace – smartphones, digital wallets, e-commerce, crypto – Jamtara’s scams expanded their target area. In New Delhi, India’s policymakers boasted about “Digital India” and the spread of modern telecom infrastructure. But, for the majority of Indian citizens, the digital revolution became synonymous with Jamtara scams. Netflix even made a TV series about the district, with the tag line “Sabka Number Aayega”. You could read that as “everyone will get a call” or as “your number will be up”. Jamtara’s scammers took immense pride in duping the rich and famous. Conning a film star or a parliamentarian wasn’t just about financial gain; it was a triumph that elevated their own standing.From 2015 onwards, police from various states descended on the district. Arrests became common – but bail was easy to secure. Cases took ages to close, and conviction rates weren’t high enough to stem the flood of scams. A few weeks before flying to Jharkhand to report on this phenomenon, I visited Delhi’s state-of-the-art cybercrime police station. The deputy superintendent showed me a video on his phone that captured the unapologetic opulence of a scammer’s house: a vividly painted bungalow with sprawling balconies and art deco styling, each section a splash of nursery-bright colours, of strawberry pink and pistachio green. His disbelief was evident in the breathless commentary that accompanied the video.I wanted to understand how an obscure district in a neglected state became India’s byword for digital deceit. Initially, I thought this would be a story about the dark promise of technology and the lure of easy money. But over weeks of reporting, what emerged was a portrait of two Indias colliding – one chasing material progress, the other bent on survival. And in their collision was born the kind of ambition that can drive those with nothing to lose into criminality, while entrenched inequalities make it impossible for them to turn back.‘The numbers don’t dial themselves,” Jitu* wanted me to know. We were sitting in my borrowed car at the edge of a dusty road in his village, about 50 miles from Jamtara. It was a sweltering day in May, the hottest month, and Jitu was wearing a peach-coloured T-shirt, shorts and well-worn slippers. His face was nearly round, with soft features and gleaming eyes. He looked friendly and smiled effortlessly. He didn’t look like a seasoned grifter minting money from India’s most notorious scam.Jitu was, nevertheless, the “chief scammer” of the village – a title he wore with pride. Naturally, he said, that meant he was kept busy all day. But out of respect for my guide, a local reporter, he would answer a few questions. Respect, it turned out – how it was given, whether it could undermine age-old hierarchies, whether it could be turned into power or money – was central to how the Jamtara scammers operated.In 2012, Jitu had been in school when some older boys who had transferred in from Jamtara “saw something” in him. They showed him how to generate potential targets for scams. Jitu was singled out because he already had the respect of his peers. Unlike most others in school, his father ran a small business. His family identified as Dalits, historically disadvantaged in India, and weren’t middle class in any recognisable way – but he paid his own school fees and always had a bit of pocket money. This meant he was cool enough to hang out with boys much older than him, who gave him the respect due to someone who was good at sports and had money for ice-cream.Map of India showing Jharkhand and JamtaraThe turning point in Jitu’s life, however – as with everyone in his generation – came when his father bought him a phone. It was an early, no-frills Samsung handset, but Jitu, who was 15, took it to school the very next day. In this remote part of Jharkhand, known as Santhal Pargana, whose six districts include Deoghar and Jamtara, sweeping changes are rare. When they come, the impact is earth-shattering. If you ask someone in Delhi or Mumbai, they will tell you the moment that India set itself on a new course was 1991, when it liberalised its economy and foreign capital poured in. But people in rural Jharkhand and places like it across India will insist that the transformative moment came more than a decade later, when mobile phone towers popped up across the country.“At the end of 2012, we heard for the first time of a young man in the village being picked up in a case of cybercrime,” Murari Lal, a local social worker, told me. “We couldn’t understand what was going on. The police were saying,ATM se paisa marta hai.[‘He steals money from ATMs.’] But we wondered what stealing money had to do with mobile phones.”Aman named Sitaram Mandal could have explained. Nearly everyone I met in Santhal Pargana had something to say about him. Their accounts, along with extensive media coverage of his career, offered glimpses into his remarkable journey. If anyone created Jamtara’s signature 21st-century industry, it was him.In 2011, after leaving school in his small Jamtara village, Mandal boarded a train to Mumbai. Over the next five years, Mandal worked at a roadside eatery, a railway station retailer and finally a shop where people bought top-ups for their mobile phones. It was that last job where he learned the particular skill that made his fortune: clearing strangers’ bank accounts using a mobile phone. The thing that pulled him in immediately was that he did not have to break into the victim’s phone or their bank account. They gave you access willingly; you only had to lie.Mandal, in his stint at the mobile recharge shop, found himself learning the manipulative tactics used by fraudsters to extract confidential information from unsuspecting individuals. But he couldn’t do it alone. So, he found himself making the return journey to his birthplace, training several youngsters in his social circle, and building an army of “ATM thieves”, as they were called then. ATMs were as new to rural India as mobile telephony; the dark side of the digital revolution arrived as swiftly as its benefits. The easier it was to access your bank account, the easier it was to scam you out of it.View image in fullscreenA scene from the Netflix show Jamtara: Sabka Number Ayega.Photograph: NetflixMandal’s method began, of course, with a phone call. The voice on the line would be tinged with urgency; it was the bank calling, they would say and issue a dire warning: there was a problem with the target’s bank account. To those unaccustomed to modern banking and increasingly complex know-your-customer (KYC) regulations, this was all too believable. “Your ATM card is about to become inactive,” they would then declare, dialling up the sense of urgency.Under the guise of verifying the victim’s identity, they asked a stream of questions, such as the person’s date of birth and address. By the end, they had harvested every detail they needed: card numbers, pins, three-digit CVV number. Simultaneously, an accomplice would be navigating the victim’s bank account online, armed with the freshly gleaned information. To finalise the illicit transfer of funds to their account, they required one last piece of the puzzle: a one-time password (OTP) sent by the bank to the victim’s phone via SMS. “To complete the KYC process, you must read out the six-digit code sent to your mobile number,” they instructed with authoritative calm. Overwhelmed by anxiety by this point, the victim recited the six digits as if they were items on a grocery list. With this, the fraudulent bank transfer was executed to perfection.Following Mandal’s example, Jitu trained many of his friends and acquaintances, effectively passing on the techniques throughout his community. “That scheme changed the lives of so many people,” he said, closing his eyes as if to relive the glory days of a decade earlier. But the scam had its limitations. The victim needed to be using an ATM card; he needed to be ignorant as well as trusting; he needed to have money in his bank account and a high daily transaction limit. That wasn’t always the case. Fortunately, after a brief lull, new possibilities arose.“In 2014, the BJP won the elections, and Narendra Modi became the prime minister.” Jitu was smiling now, and not without reason. Full of reformist energy, the PM launched a bold mission to digitalise India’s economy. “Mobile apps began to be developed. They were meant to make life easier for the kind of people who had voted for him then. Professionals. Businessmen. People in the cities. People like you,” Jitu continued his lecture. “Suddenly, there was much more than just ATM cards: banking apps, digital wallets, instant lending.”Many of the comfortably well-off Indians I knew who voted for the BJP in 2014 hoped for an economic miracle that would free India, once and for all, from its moribund, statist past. Modi, positioning himself as a dynamic face of market-oriented leadership, was the answer for a burgeoning middle class that credited their upward mobility to individual effort – they called it “merit”. They disdained the old socialist-leaning elite, and in Modi, a man of humble origins, they saw a reflection of themselves. Curtly, they dismissed the continuing importance of the centuries-old systems that built and maintained privilege in India and that facilitated their own access to education, capital and other resources. Any mention of caste produced a fit of anger. Every man for himself became the implicit motto for the Modi era.When Modi’s tenure as prime minister began, life in the villages began to change to some extent. Many people in and around Kherbari, a village about 70 miles north of Jamtara, were grateful to him for welfare schemes that helped them build concrete houses, acquire gas cylinders and collect free food grains. Most of them expected nothing more from the government; little, if anything, was granted beyond the fundamental provisions. For those with loftier life goals, the mobile was the miracle, not Modi.Between them, Jitu and his friends were phoning hundreds of people every day. If the target accepted the call, the scammer could choose from various options:View image in fullscreenJamtara railway station, November 2022.Photograph: cameranest/ShutterstockI am calling from your bank.I am calling from your credit card company.I am calling from your digital wallet startup.I am calling from your mobile service provider.The scammers’ friends and family didn’t see them as cyberthieves. They regarded them as a league of highly skilled workers. Over the next few years, “chor”, or thief, was gradually dropped from their title. The villagers who spoke to me only used the word “cyber” to refer to the scammers. It conveyed the message without emphasising the criminality.This semantic shift mirrored the broader acceptance of scamming as a profession. More and more people transitioned from traditional but less profitable occupations like agriculture and manual labour to the more lucrative and less effortful domain of mobile phone scams. “Scamming,” Murari Lal, the social worker, told me, “became the new farming. The fathers try a different crop every season; the sons, a different con.”One day Jitu showed me how one of his scams worked. Sitting in the front seat of the car, he methodically arranged two mobile phones on his lap. On one, he launched a gambling app that simulated a traditional three-card game. To play, you needed to transfer some cash to your game account, and you were allowed to ping someone else’s digital wallet to ask for a top-up. This meant that you could use the game to ping random wallets attached to random phone numbers to ask for cash.To demonstrate, Jitu pinged his digital wallet on the other phone from his game screen on the first. The second phone popped up a notification that someone was asking for 4,999 rupees (£42).That, he said, was where his game began.This is how the conversation would run when he rang the person who received the top-up request: “Sir, you have received a notification for a 4,999 rupee cashback from your mobile wallet company. It’s something we are doing, keeping in view the hardships faced by our users in the pandemic. If you open the app now, you will see the amount 4,999 rupees flashing on the home screen. Below that, you will see two options: ‘deny’ or ‘proceed’. To claim the amount, you must press ‘proceed’.”This was the point at which Jitu would hope that the victim, through oversight or distraction, would mistakenly authorise a transfer away from his own wallet, instead of to it, without fully understanding the context.“You have done that successfully. The next page will ask you to enter the one-time password sent by your bank to facilitate the transfer of this amount to your account. Did you do that?”Another point at which the victim could back out.Sometimes they did. Often enough they didn’t. Or the cyber-chor could walk away with the 4,999 rupees. But Jitu wouldn’t, of course. Why would he?“Sir! I am very sorry; I have made a huge mistake. You must have received another SMS from your bank saying 4,999 rupees has been deducted from your account. It’s all my fault – I pressed the wrong button at my end. Sir, please don’t raise a complaint. I will get into trouble. The company will fire me right away. I will have to sleep on the street. My family will starve.”View image in fullscreenThe pond where Jitu said most of his discarded phones ended up.Photograph: Snigdha Poonam“Give me a chance to fix this blunder. I will send you a refund plus the original cashback. I am initiating this process. On your homepage, you will see a new amount, 9,999 rupees. Below you will see two options: ‘deny’ or ‘proceed’. To claim the money, you must press ‘proceed’.”This charade would continue until the victim realised he had been repeatedly scammed, Jitu told me, casually placing the two tools of his trade back on the car’s dashboard. Leaning back in his seat, he emphasised the importance of spontaneity. “You must come up with a number while being on the call. It could be 2,458 or 6,978. That’s the amount you tell them they have won – as a discount, a cashback, a surprise gift.” He emphasised that hesitations are fatal. “I choose to stick to the same number: 4,999.”The other trick is to sound completely fearless. “I request them to call up the bank and ask to speak to me. I urge them to record the phone call. I say to them: ‘If you have any doubts about my credentials, go to the police with the recording.’ That’s usually all it takes to kill any suspicions.”While revealing his methods, Jitu was neither sheepish nor boastful. He seemed to take just as much pride in swiftly dispatching his task as a competent individual in any sector. I asked him if he ever felt guilty cheating gullible strangers out of what could well be their hard-earned money. He answered promptly that there were infinite ways in which a cyberthief paid for his bad deeds. “He doesn’t have a moment of peace, for one. Even as I am conducting a scam call, I am thinking of where I will throw the sim card, and where I will hide the cell phone.” Perpetual anxiety was his punishment.The village pond was visible from the car’s window. Jitu pointed in that direction and said that, in the end, that was where most of his scam phones wound up. The scammers exploit the natural landscape at every step, making calls from secluded, overgrown fields, burying their mobile phones in trenches beside streams and retreating up the hills during police raids.This protective geography is also what kept this part of India poor. A short walk from Jitu’s village, the Rajmahal Hills – a mountain range that spans an area about 1,000 sq miles and is older than the Himalayas – begin. Dark forests grow around rugged rocks and water rushes everywhere: even 20 years ago, venturing into these villages wasn’t as straightforward as it is today. Back then, to access them, one would have needed to hire a boat on a day when dark clouds weren’t looming on the horizon.Since the turn of the millennium, this isolation has changed somewhat. Eighteen roads have been built, and the community pooled money to build another school. But official statistics for the region make for difficult reading. More than half of its 10.8 million people live below the poverty line, and 35% are “extremely poor”. That’s comparable to the most isolated parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Dalits like Jitu, who make up 11% of the population, are disproportionately deprived.The next day, I went to the cybercrime police station in Deoghar, where a press conference was scheduled to take place. A pack of reporters (all men) and I trooped into the British-era estate, with its high-ceilinged rooms arranged around a central courtyard. In the courtyard, the constables had lined up 15 men who were to be paraded in front of the reporters. The men had clearly been picked up in the dead of night, for most of them wore pyjamas, shorts and sleeveless vests. The constables fussed over them with the meticulous care typically reserved for fashion models prepping for a runway – arranging them according to height and straightening their postures.In an orderly procession, they were led to the office of the superintendent. There, they were rearranged in two rows behind the senior officer’s desk. Two rows of mobile phones were placed on the table in the same formation as the men standing in the back. The event commenced with the superintendent coughing into the mic. He proceeded to read a press release: “Based on a secret tip, simultaneous raids were conducted in various villages, and 14 people wanted in cybercrime cases have been arrested,” he began. “These cybercriminals used to pose as customer care executives and service providers to obtain sensitive information from the people …”He then read out their names. All suspects had the same surname, one that is common among some of the local Dalit communities.The policeman was from an upper caste, so I was sceptical when he told me that their inquiries often lead them to the homes and hideouts of three specific communities: Dalits, Muslims and the Other Backward Classes (OBCs), a collective term the government of India uses to classify hundreds of marginalised castes.View image in fullscreenDelhi cybercrime police after busting a call centre syndicate operating from Jamtara in April 2023.Photograph: Hindustan Times/Getty ImagesJitu, however, confirmed to me that caste and community affiliations really do anchor the regional fraud networks. “It starts at the training stage itself,” he explained over the phone one day. Since assuming the title of “mastermind”, he said he has primarily trained young Dalit men in and around his village, who live close to each other and at a safe distance from the violence and intimidation they would face in upper-caste districts. In the villages where Muslims outnumbered Dalits and OBCs, the mastermind was likely to be one among them.When I asked my reporter guide, a Brahmin, if upper-caste Hindus were in fact under-represented in this most profitable of vocations, he took me to his own village, home to more than 200 families. As we drove down the main street, he showed me the sturdy homes in which the upper-caste elite lived. They had a stranglehold, he explained, over the traditional modes of money-making: owning vast tracts of fertile land, securing government contracts for local infrastructure projects, and controlling the extraction of coal from the earth and sand from the riverbanks. These were not people with scruples, he said, since these professions are shorthand for the exploitation of farm workers, bribes to government officials and income from illegal mining. Instead, they needed to protect their assumed sense of superiority. “Most have qualms about associating with lower castes and Muslims,” he said. If you spot a person with an upper caste surname, such as Pandey, on a police charge sheet, you can tell they are down on their luck, he told me.Back at the police station, as the superintendent took questions from the press, the suspects stood completely still, their eyes fixed on the row of reporters. I stood directly opposite the man on the extreme left, the only one wearing a proper T-shirt. A pithy slogan ran across his chest: “Your Limit Is You.”The police had tracked down scammers thanks to local informers. But who were these informers? The accused often pointed fingers at upper-caste people from their villages who had shown their displeasure at lower-caste families’ displays of wealth. Not all of them could be passing on information, but there was no doubt that plenty of resentment had built within their ranks. As I went around the villages, the tension was impossible to ignore.In one village, landlord Bunty Singh* regularly reported boys riding off motorbikes. Once the most influential family, the Singhs now faced competition from Dalit families who had raised their status through cyberfraud. Their men once worked on his farms and their women rolled tobacco in the courtyard of his bungalow. He sold the harvest at a wholesale market and the hand-rolled tobacco to a factory. Some days, he paid the workers; other times, he sent them back with grain for their kitchens and straw for their roofs. Now, some of those families have become millionaires, he said with an air of intolerable woe. “Their daily transactions would shock you. These days you see large currency notes either in the wallet of a politician or a cyber-chor.”That politicians became fabulously wealthy through corruption was a foregone conclusion; much harder to accept was the idea of marginalised people using similar means. While we were having this conversation, Singh kept an eye on the road, noting every person and vehicle that passed by. He pointed out some of the men riding motorbikes, detailing their position in the local network of cyberfraud. This one is a mastermind; that one is still at school; the one in the backseat has just come out on bail. He asked me if I wanted the names of every cyberthief active in his village. I declined his offer.Singh had reported many of these “boys” to the police, but most were released on bail. Enough members of the local upper-caste elite were indirectly profiting from the scams themselves.In another nearby village, I met a Brahmin who sold construction supplies to the newly wealthy “cyber” families. He claimed they were building grand houses. “They have towering gates, Italian marble and air-conditioned bathrooms. The idea is that even if there is a raid and the police take away everything, they will still have the house.” He narrated the tragic story of a client burying illicit cash in a sandpit after receiving word of a police raid, only to have it stolen by neighbours.The supplier himself did not let caste stand in the way of genuine connections. After closing his shop, he told me, he hung out at the village tea stalls where cyber-chors often narrated their escapades. “Even going to jail is part of the adventure. Money is not the only reason they take the risk of arrest. There is alsomaza[fun] in what they do.” Being a Brahmin, he argued he couldn’t make scam calls himself, but he took pride in the number of “rock star” cyber-chors he personally knew.While cheating strangers, Jitu was able to peer into their lives. On the other end of the line, many of his victims lived in bustling cities, worked in air-conditioned offices and spent their money on luxury goods. Some of his victims would certainly have had to struggle to get where they were. Yet he suspected that few truly understood what it meant to be trapped in one’s circumstances.This, however, wasn’t the justification he and his accomplices gave themselves for stealing. They simply believed that if they didn’t claw their way toward a better life, no one else would do it for them. And if others suffered along the way, that was just the collateral damage of trying to wrestle free from fate.Using the income he earned from the scams, Jitu opened a supply shop in the village. “My wife set up a tailoring business from home.” Their two sons didn’t just go to a good school but also acquired a private tutor, an upper-caste retired schoolteacher who comes to his home to teach them nursery rhymes. “She is not an ordinary woman. Her son is a pilot, and her daughter is a doctor,” said Jitu.When Jitu was making serious money, he felt like the master of his own destiny. He expressed that the way his victims did: through ordering a laundry list of luxury goods – phones, clothes, shoes – for himself and his family. “We didn’t always keep those things at home. That would have attracted too much attention. Instead, I entrusted some of those items to the Brahmins in my village. They agreed to store them on the condition that they could keep some items for themselves. It was a mutually beneficial agreement. The police would never suspect them, no matter what phones they use or what clothes their women wear.”View image in fullscreenCybercrime police in Delhi after arresting members of a scam-call syndicate operating from Jamtara in April 2023. (Faces pixellated by Guardian imaging.)Photograph: Hindustan Times/Getty ImagesFor Jitu’s associates, the lavish lifestyle that fraud permitted them was one that would not be remarked upon were they from upper-caste families. But to be safe, they needed the complicity of those they were trying to displace. “The level at which you see yourself is not the level at which others see you.” This dichotomy was a constant struggle for him. “If the police believe my level is to carry a budget phone worth 20,000 rupees, they will be alarmed to see me carrying a flagship model priced at 50,000 rupees.” By contrast, he said to me: “If I gave you a silk outfit, you could walk around the whole village wearing it, and no one would think it was bought with scam money. That’s why every cyber-chor needs upper-caste friends.”Over the past few years, as police raids have become a daily affair in these villages, a spin-off economy has emerged to help the scammers evade the law. Schoolchildren earned pocket money for watching the entry points to the village. Busybodies took protection money from the scammers to keep their names off the police radar. Police officers accepted bribes to avoid making arrests, and mediators openly quoted their fees for arranging bail. At the district court in Deoghar, advocates dropped cases involving murder and rape to represent cybercrooks; a single bail plea meant a fee of 25,000 rupees, cash in hand.When all other avenues failed, political representatives came to the rescue of cyberthieves. From council officials to members of parliament, local politics was increasingly tied to digital scams. The relationship was mutually beneficial: money earned from the scams funded electoral campaigns and power linked to political office shielded the perpetrators from arrest.Cyberscams, and the wealth, fame and notoriety they brought in their wake, had disrupted the caste hierarchy in unforeseen ways. For upper castes in the region, some of those disruptions were more potent than others. Dalit individuals refusing to work in their homes, farms or factories posed an inconvenience – but that could always be remedied. If some refused, others would eventually step in.Far more troubling was the realisation that lower-caste individuals no longer relied on them as gatekeepers. Armed with a growing mastery of mobile technology, one of the most transformative tools in today’s world, they were reshaping their lives in ways the upper castes struggled to comprehend. Left behind, many clung to caste pride as their only solace.Jitu found that his relationships with upper-caste people were becoming strained. He sensed a growing hostility from some. “Think about this: long after India was liberated from colonial rule, we were still serving upper-caste people. Our women cleaned their cattle sheds, and our men disposed of their dead cattle. For generations they treated us as slaves. But today, we have become aware of our rights,” he said. “This angers them. They give our names at the police stations.” A caste battle was under way, he said, and he was prepared to fight. “We will not be trapped back in slavery in the name of tradition.”In 2019, Jitu contested the post of the president of Kherbari’s Dalit community and won unopposed. Shortly after, he hosted a grand lunch for the visiting chief of an organisation that rejected the patronage of upper-caste-dominated parties to strive for political power for Dalits. Hundreds of people from the lower castes came to pay their respects. The upper-caste elites watched from a distance.View image in fullscreenThe NDCCII building in New Delhi, home to Indian’s national cybercrime division.Photograph: Sidheeq/CC BY-Sa4.0Two weeks later, in an overnight raid that no cyberthief saw coming, the local police arrested Jitu and put him in jail. After 93 days, he came out a man questioning his life choices. His mood, when we met after his release, was doleful. “We, the cyber-chors, know how to make money. What we don’t know is what to do with the ill-gotten wealth. A professional might make 40,000 rupees a month. He has clear ideas for how to spend it. He pays the rent and the school fees, buys gifts for parents once a year during the festive season, saves for his daughter’s wedding. For us scammers, it is different: if we have one good day, we make 50,000 rupees. Just sitting in the field. It distorts proportion. People go berserk buying things. If you make a lot of money, your wife basks in the luxuries that come with it. She will ask you to take her to the market. She will make you buy the priciest objects. She won’t share those things with her mother-in-law. She will rarely allow your mother to buy something for herself with your money. But if you die, your mother is left to suffer while your wife marries someone else.”I could not stop him midway to ask what brought on this diatribe against the wives of cyberthieves. We were sitting in our usual spot, in my rented car parked on the path leading out from his village. In spite of the air-conditioning in the car, Jitu was drenched in sweat. Every ping on my phone made him jump in his seat.After he went to jail, his mother had dug a pit in the field behind their house and buried a total of 50 phones. When he pulled them out three months later, he found rainwater had rotted their internal circuits. “What else could it be but an omen?” He paused, looking at his hands as if they were still smeared with mud. “This work is not easy,” he resumed in a pensive tone, his voice growing heavier with every word.‘Sir, are you using the PhonePe Wallet app?”“I am. What is this about?”“Sir, the company is offering a cashback of 4,999 rupees …”“Chutiya [asshole], don’t waste my time.”Ransomware hunters: the self-taught tech geniuses fighting cybercrimeRead moreJitu’s scam calls had been shorter lately. He had dug out his stash of phishing phones and returned them to regular use. But “business” was increasingly uncertain. At first, he blamed himself. “I used to be very clever. That’s how I pulled off all those scams for years on end. But after coming out of jail, my brain began to slow down.”Talking to his peers in the village, he realised he wasn’t the only one failing to reel in targets. They were still making money from the scams, but compared to what they illicitly earned in the previous years, there had been a downturn. “We made a killing when the time favoured us. The spate of good luck is passing,” he said, perched in his usual spot in my hired car’s front seat. “The public is becoming aware,” he said, dropping his voice to a horrified whisper. “They are watching YouTube videos where they show you the whole scam playing out. Their new phones can detect scam calls.”One day, Jitu and I walked over to a one-room house at the far end of a field. He was once again feeling gloomy. His heart sank when he thought about friends and relatives who have died over the years, he said. “In this business, we can never tell how long we have got.” Karma, he said, would confront him like it did every man who lived. It was only a matter of time. But still, he had to keep going, keep finding new scams. His wife had to be kept happy; his sons had to be educated. Perhaps, if the occasion arose, votes would have to be bought.

Or an any time of morning person. Look at her in the wrong way and you’re likely to catch an earful.So it must have taken a lot of persuading from Conservative central office to get her out and about at 9am. But needs must. All week it has been Reform setting the news agenda, with three press conferences in as many days, and the Tories have barely had a look in. You could almost have forgotten that, for the time being, at any rate, theConservativesare still the official opposition. Their relevance diminishes by the day.The invitation sent out on Wednesday had said access would be strictly limited and that only one journalist per outlet would be accredited. So you would have imagined the venue to be the usual small room in the bowels of a right-of-centre thinktank.Imagine the surprise then, to find the location was outdoors on the South Bank in London. A place where literally anyone could – and did – turn up. It was almost as if they didn’t actually want anyone to come. This was more the kind of event a party puts on in the fourth week of an election campaign when it already knows it is going to lose badly.Political reporters weren’t the only ones taken aback to find themselves gathered outdoors on a chilly late October morning. Passersby were equally surprised to find a small group of extras for CCHQ central casting waving banners that read, “If She Puts Up Tax, Give Reeves The Axe”.“Who is that?” asked several people, as a middle-aged man moved to the centre of the 30-strong rent-a-crowd and began talking into a microphone. PoorMel Stride. Then again, he probably gets the same reaction at family gatherings. It’s a rare talent to be that forgettable.“Do you want me to be chancellor?” he began. Er … not even his friends want that. He had been clearly hoping that some of the staffers might sound at least vaguely enthusiastic. A token whoop at least. But nothing until one voice whispered: ‘Yes’.The Melster couldn’t have looked more grateful. Someone, somewhere loved him. It has been a thankless task being Mel ever since he was the last cabinet minister to openly voice his support for Rishi Sunak in the dying days of the Tory government. And it’s not about to get better any time soon.Still, credit where credit’s due. Many people would just walk away once they realised they were dying on their arse. But either The Melster can’t read the room or he is unfailingly loyal to Brand Mel. Because on he went. Labour had let down the country. Only the Tories could be trusted to get on top of government spending.Even for Mel, this was a hell of a cheek. Because he had literally been the minister who had increased benefits spending to record levels on his watch. No wonder faith in politicians is at an all-time low. Still, if Mel can’t forgive himself, who can?Just then, a van pulled up behind The Melster. For a moment, as no one got out, we wondered if the Lib Dems had hijacked the event with a guerilla campaign of their own. Then Stride remembered this was his cue to wind things up, as the door opened and Kemi made her appearance. “Let me introduce you to the next prime minister,” Mel beamed. Dream on. The Tories are only two points away from fifth place in the opinion polls. People may have lost faith in Labour but few are willing to forgive the Tories any time soon.Yet despite the early start, Kemi seemed positively chipper. She smiled a lot and seemed relaxed. She may be heading for oblivion but she’s not that bothered. Maybe she’s just relieved that things aren’t even worse. Since the party conference, the complaints about her leadership have got quieter. Tories have sensed that changing your leader every year is not a good look with the punters. Besides, there isn’t anyone obviously better to replace her. So, a failure delayed is now something to celebrate.Understandably, Badenoch began with the overnight story ofRachel Reeves’s failure to obtain a licence before letting out her Dulwich house. Given that Reeves had campaigned for such a licence to be introduced, this must qualify as right up there with one of the most brain-dead blunders. Stand by for Reeves to be included on a register of dodgy landlords. Kemi couldn’t believe her luck. If the chancellor couldn’t be trusted to run her own affairs, how could she be trusted to run the economy?

Because within minutes of a very short stump speech, Kemi was also demanding that Rachel resign if she were – as Reeves has virtually already broadcast herself – to break a manifesto promise by increasing income tax. Now we were in two parallel worlds at the same time. One where Rachel resigned right now and another where she resigned in four weeks’ time. For Kemi, Mel and Priti Patel, both scenarios were not just desirable but totally possible. In an infinite number of universes, there could be an infinite number of Reeveses. Any number of resignations were thinkable.Kemi ended with a few suggestions for how the Tories might turn around the country. But no one was listening. It might have been fun to get out of Westminster for a bit, but there is almost no one in the country who reckons the Conservatives are the answer. No matter. Kemi had had a good time and was feeling so relaxed that she invited the journalists into a huddle to take their questions. What’s more, we even got some answers.It turned out that the Tory whip Katie Lam had spoken “imprecisely” by insisting the plan was, in the interest of “cultural coherence”, to deport hundreds of thousands of people legally entitled to be here. Now that Kemi had got round to actually reading the bill that the quarter-witted Chris Philp had tabled back in May, she had decided it was dead in the water.She would find other people to deport instead. Poor Katie. That’s the last time she trusts The Philpster, seizes on racist party policy and treats it as gospel. It’s also the last time for a good while that anyone has described her as a rising Tory star. No wonder Kemi looked so happy.The Bonfire of the Insanities by John Crace (Guardian Faber Publishing, £16.99). To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

Thanks to Donald Trump’segotistical diplomacy, rare earths can again flow one way, soya beans the other, and less of the chemicals used to make fentanyl in between. No matter that the war was Trump’s own idea and seems to have been a stunt. The stunt is over. Trump has played his favourite game of dealmaker, much to the discomfort of millions.Meanwhile Britain still cannot make up its mind if China is its enemy. In 2008 British officials visited the Beijing Olympics authorities to discuss the next games in London in 2012. The government told them to “raise”human rights issues, about which the British government was most concerned. I am told the Chinese reacted with sympathy at the Britons’ embarrassment at broaching the matter, and then everyone got down to business. Soon China was a friend, certainly to David Cameronand George Osborne.Not today. China is now a much-enhanced world power, and in the eyes of some, a threat to Britain’s national security. The recent confusion over whether two British officialswere Chinese spieshas largely and absurdly revolved around whether the Chinese “threat” was greater to a Tory governmentthan to a Labour one. China was clearly recruiting spies everywhere, as do most countries. It sought a huge London embassy,befriended Prince Andrewand required Boris Johnsonto send two aircraft carriersto patrol the South China Sea.Pompous countries crave enemies. They have large military empires heavily reliant on them, empires fiendishly resistant to dismantling. After the fall of the Soviet Union a senior advisor to Russian leader Mikhail Gorbachevjoked to American officials: “We are going to do a terrible thing to you – we are going to deprive you of an enemy.”Who is the US’s new enemy? The answer is clearly China. But as Trump has found, it is an enemy with which it is hard to come to terms. It does not send its armies overseas. As it challenges the US for world economic supremacy, it snaps the bond once thought to hold capitalism in the arms of democracy. It gets richer and richer. China’s Brics-plus alliance with India and othershas overtakenthe G7 in world trade. The Beijing policy expert Henry Wang evenmooted this weekthat a China-led Brics force could police a ceasefire border in Ukraine. It would be a sensational intervention.GK Chesterton wrote that “those who appeal to the head rather than the heart … are necessarily men of violence. We speak of ‘touching’ a man’s heart, but we can do nothing to his head but hit it.”Trump could yet be that blow to the head. He is forcing Nato to ask itself what it is really about. He is telling the world not to rely on the US to police its conflicts, in the manner trumpeted by Kennedy, Johnson and the two Bush presidents. Washington may be about to turn in on itself and deny its manifest destiny to set the world to rights. After all, it was founded to turn its back on the arguments infesting the outside world.Since Britain, too, enjoyed global fantasies, it of all nations should understand this. It cannot refuse to come to terms with the new Beijing. Yes,Chinadoes terrible things to its minorities. It denies freedom of speech and neurotically spies on foreign states. In the new age of artificial intelligence, China is clearly out to rival the US.Since this rivalry will probably encompass attacks on other countries’ cybersecurity, it makes sense for any country to guard its digital space. Whether that extends to embassy buildings is a matter for experts. But clearly, to locate a foreign embassy justfive minutes’ walkfrom a centre of global financial intelligence is a bad idea. China must understand this. Would it let MI6 erect a headquarters overlooking Tiananmen Square?Britain is no longer a superpower and must deal with superpowers, as must all second-division states. But in one respect it is unique. Its soft power is probably equal to none, notably its cultural and teaching assets. It haseducated more world leaders– apparently 50 – and takes in more Chinese studentsthan any other countryincluding the US. It also welcomes half a million Chinese tourists a year, many drawn byaspects of British popular culture. We do not measure soft power, but its influence cannot be negligible – and is certainly profitable.It is therefore absurd that the British government is planning to splurge billions more on defending Britain from a purely notional third world war. At the same time it is slashing the budget of its overseas cultural institution, the British Council. The council is being forced towithdraw from 60 countriesand sell its entire property portfolio.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Why should pupils suffer because of him?Stephen KelmanMy book, which draws on my upbringing on a diverse and deprived Luton council estate, has been used as a GCSE text. But one man objected to its profane language and depictions of violence and sexual behaviourThu 30 Oct 2025 11.36 EDTLast modified on Thu 30 Oct 2025 13.41 EDTShareBack in September, in a measure designed to “prevent immorality”,the Taliban closed down the internetin Afghanistan. This was the latest step – after a ban on all girls over the age of 12 receiving an education, and the removal of all books written by women from universities – to restrict citizens’ access to information that the regime might consider dangerous or difficult, or that challenges their ideological monopoly. The effect would have been to ensure that an entire generation of Afghans failed to reach their potential; the connection was partly restored 48 hours later, after widespread condemnation.It was against this backdrop that I read about the school in Weymouth, Dorset, thathad removedAmerican author Angie Thomas’s wildly popular young adult novelThe Hate U Givefrom its Year 10 reading list, apparently in response to the objection of one parent, former Conservative councillor James Farquharson. While copies of the book would continue to be available in the school library, its removal from classrooms sent a worrying message: that one man’s comfort could be considered more important than the rights of an entire student cohort to access literature that might speak directly to them, never mind that it may contain dangerous or difficult ideas.View image in fullscreenAuthor Angie Thomas at home in Mississippi.Photograph: Imani Khayyam/The ObserverI spoke to Vicky McNab, whose four mixed-heritage children have attended the school, and who launched a campaign to have the book reinstated (after an internal review, the school confirmed that the book will return to the Year 10 reading list). She shared with me Farquharson’s original letter to the school; he seemed to misunderstand or not appreciate the importance of teaching that racial injustice exists in America, as illustrated in the novel by the killing of a Black teenager by a white police officer.To avoid such difficult ideas gaining traction in the UK, he suggested it was the school’s duty to “select books that will teach pupils their cultural inheritance”. By implying all students share a single cultural inheritance, he seems to be residing under the belief that we are or should be a monoculture, and the overriding mission of our schools should be to reinforce some sort of nationalistic hegemony to which everyone, regardless of background, must pledge unwavering allegiance. The question then arises: who was he seeking to protect?The use of my novel,Pigeon English, is also under review at the school, thanks again to Farquharson’s intervention. His objections to my book – which he shared on Facebook having read the first 13 pages and Googled some reviews – centre on its use of profane language and depictions of violence and sexual behaviour. Pigeon English explores some of the same themes as The Hate U Give, social injustice chief among them. It draws on my experiences growing up on a diverse and deprived council estate in Luton in the 1980s and 90s, and on the killing ofDamilola Taylor, the Nigerian schoolboy stabbed to death in Peckham, London, in 2000.View image in fullscreenThe cover of Pigeon English by Stephen Kelman.Photograph: Susannah Ireland/Rex FeaturesThe novel was very much directed at an adult readership, which I felt could parse some of its more troubling content and recognise the urgent social questions it posed. I did not predict that it would end up in the hands of schoolchildren or being dissected in classrooms; nor was I consulted when the decision was made in 2015 – rubber-stamped by a Conservative education secretary – to include it on the GCSE curriculum. But its continued use as a set text suggests that teachers see in it an opportunity, rather than a threat. An opportunity to discuss, in the controlled and collaborative space of the classroom, themes and topics of particular relevance to the lives of their students.This has been borne out by the feedback I have received over a decade of visiting schools up and down the country where Pigeon English is used either as a GCSE text or as a class reader for younger age groups. Teachers report that the book engages their students at a deeper level than other texts at their disposal, while students routinely tell me it is the first book they have studied that represents a world they recognise and includes characters they can relate to. This makes them feel seen as individuals, as well as part of a community bound not just by their real-life familiarity with events similar to some of those described in the book, but by the collegiate experience of reading and studying it together. It might also initiate a connection to the broader world of literature and the arts that can be a lasting source of revelation in their lives.View image in fullscreen‘I have learned more about the human condition from looking at dirty feet’ … Kelman shortly after the publication of Pigeon English in 2011.Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose/The ObserverTo deny students that kind of opportunity just because they may have to traverse some difficult terrain along the way would be to inhibit their progress towards fulfilling their own potential. In my conversations with them, I do not see young people who have been traumatised by the experience of reading my book. I see in their smiles the pleasure of emotional engagement, and in their eyes the fire of intellectual challenge. Like it or not, kids relate to difficult content, in ways their parents and the adult world may not entirely understand or approve of. By providing them with opportunities to discuss that content – to find the social and political context, to analyse cause and effect, to unpack the psychology of why good people do bad things – we teach them empathy, resilience and critical thinking, and train them to enter a world where a command of those faculties is more vitally important than it has ever been.There are many things those who would ban books could be said to lack – reason, perspective, humility – but I would suggest it is their deficit of courage that defines them; or, to put it another way, their fear of discomfort. Perhaps it is the same fear that decrees the heroes of our novels should be sympathetic and relatable, that art should only depict humanity at its best and least offensive. But what can we really learn about ourselves by avoiding the messy and imperfect reality?WhenCaravaggio’s Madonna di Loretowas unveiled in 1606 it scandalised Rome; not because it dared to put a face to the newborn Christ but because it showed the dirty feet of the peasants who knelt to venerate him. Centuries later, do those same prudish sensitivities still prevail? I have learned more about the human condition from looking at those dirty feet than from the halo around the holy infant’s head.View image in fullscreenThe cover of The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas.Photograph: AmazonWhen I think about my own formative reading experiences, an instructive discomfort pertains to them all. The discomfort of learning that Jim was enslaved in Huckleberry Finn; of discovering thatPaddy Clarke’s parents were unhappy in their marriage, just like mine were; of observing, inSlaughterhouse-Five, that the human capacity for cruelty, if left unchecked, could reduce entire cities to ashes. The discomfort of simply trying to figure out, aged 17, what the fuckUlysseswas about was joyful and life-changing. From those discomforts my character was formed; they gave rise to my intellectual curiosity and emotional inquisitiveness, to my sensitivity to injustice, and to my deep compassion for humanity in all its flawed and magnificent diversity. They connected me to the world; and if you feel a part of something, rather than estranged from it, you’re more likely to want to work in its best interests.The modern trend towards avoiding discomfort – medicating against it with performative bigotry and Labubus, with flag worship andchatbot therapists– steals away our vigilance and opens the door to tyranny. To see this, we need only look at the success Nigel Farage and Reform UK are enjoying in fomenting distrust and division for their own political ends. People denied the practice of sitting with their discomfort become, inevitably, desensitised to the discomfort of others. This leads to a deficit of empathy.Discomfort and disorder are the world’s prevailing forces, and books remain one of the best tools we have at our disposal for preparing young people to navigate them. A good teacher – and schools up and down the country are full of them, national assets too often underappreciated and taken for granted – will guide a student through their discomfort, helping them to find clarity of thought within it. This way, a school becomes a breeding ground for empathy. If we are to survive the culture wars, these breeding grounds will be essential.Pigeon English by Stephen Kelman (Bloomsbury Publishing PLC, £9.99).

It’s deeply harmfulThu 30 Oct 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 30 Oct 2025 13.06 EDTShareThere is a video doing the roundson social mediain which Conservative MP Katie Lam pours beads into glass jars. Each bead represents 1,000 migrants and – we are led to assume – the containers they sit in, Britain. As Lam points to the number of people on indefinite leave to remain (ILR) and “all the welfare and services” they have access to, a jar ominously overflows. “State support should only be for citizens,” she says directly to the camera. “And if they are already here, they must not be able to go on benefits. Instead, they will need to leave.”This is not just a social media clip from a rogue shadow minister. It is – potentially – actual Conservative policy.In recent days, the party has confirmed it would retrospectively strip residency rights (otherwise known as ILR) from people who claim benefits or whose dependents do, even if they have lived here for decades. On Wednesday, after a large backlash, officials said a new policy would be produced “in the coming weeks” but refused to rule out removing ILR.I thought of this as I read research out on Thursday by the charityTurn2usthat outlines how decades of negative attitudes and distrust towards social security have been “baked into” the system’s design. Researchers found that 64% of current claimants believe the Department for Work and Pensions is “trying to catch them out”. It is a damning indictment of past governments’ assaults on the safety net and a vital guide to Labour as it eyes up another go atso-called welfare reform. But the report also acts as something else: a warning of how ripe this country is to buy the myth that “foreigners” are milking the benefits system.The Conservatives are not alone in rooting their immigration policy in the language of welfare dependency. When Reform launched itsplan to abolish ILRlast month, its leader, Nigel Farage, did so with the (unproved) claim that more than 50% of the people due to become eligible for the scheme in the next few years “are not working, have not worked and in all probability will never, ever work”.It is not a coincidence that rightwing media and politicians are morphing the two gripes together, or that this is happening at the same time as the far right mobilises. Attacks on immigration and benefits both rely on similar ugly prejudice: certain members of society “contribute” and others “cost”, and in the extreme, leech off the superior healthy and white population.It is often said nowadays that ideas that were once fringe in politics are becoming mainstream and that is certainly the case. But the truth is, many of these ideas – that certain groups are burdens, productivity equates to moral value, and social inequalities are a personal failure – have been mainstream for quite some time.The claim that migrants are workshy drains on the British taxpayer thrives in a society that has long framed the benefits system as too generous and easily exploited. From single mothersunder New Labourto disabled peopleduring the coalition years, over the past 30 years, receiving state support has been successfully stigmatised. The benefit reforms over the past decade – from subsistence-level benefit rates and increased use of sanctions, to degrading disability assessments – have all in effect been “punishments” for people who dare to be poor or sick. Tying the benefits bill to immigration status is in many ways the next logical step, with claiming social security now reason enough to be deported.Look out in the coming days for a debate about which types of state support count towards deportation – a sentence that, in itself, is quite remarkable to write. We have long known that not all social security is created equal. There are “good benefits” (think pensions and child benefit) and there are “bad benefits” (unemployment and disability), just as there are “good immigrants” (doctors and teachers) and “bad” ones (jobseekers or NHS patients). It will be easy enough for the right to sell the idea that, say, a young man on long-term sickness benefits is a drain on the public purse; much harder to do it with a GP on maternity leave. That one of the few details Tory officials have bothered to clarify about the policy is that older people will notlose their ILRfor claiming the state pension gives a clear enough hint at what arguments are coming our way.For an insight into how misinformation and stigma can be weaponised together, just look to the shadow work and pensions secretary, Helen Whately, who isincorrectly claiming on Xthat people on the Motability scheme get “free cars for acne”. There is a sense that the gloves are off, as politicians, legacy media and big tech platforms increasingly propagate far-fetched claims for profit and power.That the UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty has just warned that welfare cuts in recent years have fuelled therise of the far rightand populism globally shows how circular all of this is. The politicians who want to cut your benefits are the same ones who will prosper from it.Still, pull at the thread of the social safety net and it would not be a surprise to see the whole thing unravel. Does statutory sick pay for a bad back count? How about one-off support after a flood? What the hard right may find is that an uncomfortable truth will out: all of us at any given time could become sick or unemployed; most of us will experience old age. Far from what the dehumanisation of migrants would suggest, few things are a clearer sign of being human than to need some help. In the end, we are all just beads together in a jar.Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumOpinionBenefitsConservativesNigel FarageReform UKFar rightcommentShareReuse this content"

Without international support, it risks crumbling altogetherThu 30 Oct 2025 07.35 EDTLast modified on Thu 30 Oct 2025 08.53 EDTShareIsrael’s recent airstrikes in Gaza, which have killedmore than 100 people, show just how fragile this arrangement truly is. This is not the first violation since it came into effect on 10 October, but rather one of many over past weeks – showcasing that without stronger enforcement mechanisms and determined planning this is a ceasefire in name only.According to Israel, thisround of violenceresulted from Hamas fire against IDF forces in Rafah, an area still under Israeli control, resulting in the death of an IDF reservist. Hamas has denied involvement. Israel responded with additional strikes on Gaza City and Khan Younis. With each side interpreting violations to suit its own interests, the ceasefire’s vague structure leaves a wide margin for miscalculation and opportunism.The ceasefire was introduced within the framework of Donald Trump’s20-point planfor ending the war. Indeed, ending the war has been celebrated as an important step forward that has seen Israeli forces partially pull back, and hostages and prisoners exchanged. However, the main problem is that the plan remains largely undeveloped. It offers no clear timeline, verification process or credible means of enforcement.Moreover, few details of the second phase of the ceasefire – which should include a complete Israeli withdrawal, the formation of a technocratic administration in Gaza and the deployment of an international stabilisation mission – have yet been agreed. With no clear sequencing or third-party oversight, the plan risks entrenching instability rather than resolving it.Israel has made clear that it will not move to this next stage until Hamas returns theremains of deceased hostages, a condition Hamas has struggled to fulfil. Hamas, for its part, accuses Israel of using the hostage issue as an excuse to maintain military control. Meanwhile, with Gaza’s infrastructure in ruins, the humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate and essential services are collapsing. The population, already traumatised from two years of war, faces acute shortages of food, water and medicine, while aid convoys remain subject to political bargaining and intermittent blockages.Beyond Gaza,violence continues to spreadacross the West Bank, where over the past few days clashes have intensified between Israeli forces and settlers, and Palestinians. This parallel escalation, enabled if not encouraged by Israel’s rightwing government, draws further attention to the limited scope of the current ceasefire and shows just how easily the conflict could expand again.The Trump administration has attempted to sustain the truce through high-level visits from Jared Kushner, Steve Witkoff, JD Vance and Marco Rubio. It has also deployed200 troopsto a monitoring centre and continues to exert pressure on both parties. While this engagement has been positive and demonstrates American intent, it is on its own insufficient to prevent renewed cycles of conflict. Ultimately, the administration’s statements continue to urge restraint but offer little in the way of accountability. The newly established monitoring centre lacks authority to verify or enforce compliance. Egypt and Qatar continue their mediation roles, but their influence is waning amid this uncertainty.What exists today is not a meaningful peace plan, but a temporary holding pattern through which both sides prepare for the next confrontation. Without mechanisms to prevent violations or impose consequences, the truce remains vulnerable to collapse from any single provocation. Each exchange of fire, each disputed body return and each unverified accusation deepens mistrust and further limits the possibility of compromise or needed discussions on the second phase of the plan.The fundamental flaws in Trump’s plan are clear, and it should be understood as one that treats symptoms rather than fixing the root problems.Gazais still very much politically divided, economically devastated and socially wounded. Israel, which is still in a strong military position, sees the ceasefire as a tactical halt rather than a meaningful change in its strategy.For the ceasefire to evolve into a sustainable framework, it must be reinforced internationally, not just through US pressure and the vague contours of Trump’s 20 points. Regional and international actors must put in place independent monitoring, clear timelines for reconstruction and withdrawal and binding guarantees for security and humanitarian access. Without these elements, the situation will lurch between cycles of calm and violence, eventually giving way to another round of war.Sanam Vakil is the director of the Middle East and North Africa programme at Chatham HouseDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Instead, there is silence – and a huge opportunity for Labour’s opponentsThu 30 Oct 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 30 Oct 2025 06.47 EDTShareScroll back three years. The person sitting opposite me is yet to take their place at the top of Keir Starmer’s government. Instead, they are a star of theLabouropposition, for whom power advances or recedes with every poll and front page. They have just done a spot of electoral marketing, a photo op at a supermarket 100 or so miles from Westminster, and what they’ve brought home is the politics of the staff.“They’d all voted for Boris.”In this parliamentary office of dull green carpet and brown furniture my interviewee wears a mask of disbelief.Workers – backing an Etonian!“One said, ‘He’s a laugh, innee?’ They all laughed.”Fancy giving your vote away socheaply!Faster than you can say “Pavlov’s dog”, I demand the next act. Did you ask how these voters feel about their man Boris now – after the pandemic, the parties, the chaos of Brexit? Are they still laughing? But my frontbencher asked no such thing and, slowly, I see why: it smacks of challenge. For the politician in this shop, it is the staff who are the customers – soon to cast their votes – and the customer is always right. Even on something as basic to a democracy as who deserves your cross, to disagree is so disagreeable.All those clenched jaws and gritted teeth surely helped at last summer’s election, when Labour secured a majority a mile wide and an inch deep. Yet now the British government is defined by its inability to argue. Observers rarely point this out, perhaps because it is masked by Labour’s facility with blank slogans (“Change”) and production line of detailed policies. But fighting? This government is constitutionally incapable of such a thing, because that would involve picking sides and making enemies.Can you think of one group, one section or vested interest with whom ministers have traded blows? Not greedy bankers, extractive private-equity barons or even (that old Whitehall favourite) obstreperous trade unionists. After racking my brains, the Downing Street shitlist comes to: Jeremy Corbyn,Michelle Mone,bats and newts. Lest we forget, this is the government thatsaid it heeded“the concerns that have been raised by the non-dom community”. Thenon-dom community! Who gather not at a mosque or synagogue, but on a bobbing yacht to inculcate a sombre-faced Bridget Phillipson (the UK’s minister for equalities) in their more arcane tax practices.The lack of argument is why all those earnest academics cannot discern an actual Starmerism, why the prime minister’s speeches are such utter blancmange. But it is about to prove highly damaging, perhaps even fatal.In less than a month, the government will unveil a budget that will be huge in scope, and hugely painful. The public is likely to pick up a tab for £20-30bn in tax rises and spending cuts. This comes just a year after the last hugely painful budget, which was the second-largest tax raiser in postwar history and which Rachel Reevesswore never to repeat. The big headline out of prime minister’s questions this week is that the government is preparing to break its election promise not to hike any of the big three money-raisers of income tax, national insurance or VAT. That would make the second time they’ve broken that same promise, after increasing NI payments by employers.Right now is when a chancellor should be out making arguments. They should have spent months – years – arguing that the public realm needs investment, and laying out the stats that show the average British worker is taxed less than counterparts in most of western Europe. This weekend, they should be filling in Laura Kuenssberg about the expensive and arduous mission to fix a broken country. And preparing taxpayers for exactly how they’ll have to cough up (loyal backbenchers flying kites, papers from thinktanks, demands from government commissions). This time? Nothing. As things stand, the big reason for the tax rises and thus for misleading an already-suspicious electorate, will be not to pump money into schools and local services, but to observe fiscal rules imposed by Reeves herself last year. Good luck explaining that one on the doorstep. Nigel Farage couldn’t ask for more.That vacuum where ministers ought to be making their case will instead be filled by the right in both parliament and the press, who will bang on about a lying government (which is fair) and a fiscal crisis (which is nonsense).A few of uswarned long agothat strapping oneself into a budgetary straitjacket to score a point against the party of Liz Truss was as unnecessary as any stunt by Ed Davey, and far more dangerous. As anew pamphletfrom the Fabian Society points out, the fiscal rules have been ripped up by chancellors nine times before.But this lot lack the clarity and firmness even to execute a proper U-turn. The strategy so far is to bitch about “fury” at the Office forBudgetResponsibility for belatedly downgrading its forecasts for productivity – the same OBR that Reeves has made the centrepiece of her budget strategy, even promising a “fiscal lock” law. There’ll also be justified complaints about Brexit’s role in weakening the economy. But government is meant to be the business of identifying problems and proposing solutions. If ministers aren’t going to lay out how to significantly tighten trade relationships with Europe, their comments will amount to little more than well-paid kvetching.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Aides brief anonymously against Sue Gray or civil service chief Chris Wormald and they tauntMPs who resist welfare cutsas being guilty of “persistent knobheadery”. It is “an absolute vipers’ nest,” asone government official saidlast weekend. “This is no way to run a country.”You can blame the professionalisation of politics, which has given us a frontbench that, throughout their careers, have been insulated from public argument. Couple that with the chronic diffidence that afflicts many in Labour regarding the party’s enduring lack of popularity with the public. Take Reeves, first elected to parliament in 2010 when New Labour still ran the party. Across her tenure, Labour has been rejected by the public in its Brownite guise, its soft-left incarnation (under Ed Miliband) and its hard-left form. This is the kind of political training that teaches you to fear the public, and never show them who you are or what you believe.But in its essence, politics is a fight – for your side and your beliefs. Think of Tony Blair and the battle he fought with his own party over clause IV, and then against the public sector trade unions (who left him with “scars on my back”). Consider the example of Gordon Brown recruiting a senior banker to head a commission to write a report to soften up the public for a penny on taxes to pay for the NHS. Think of George Osborne arguing for years for spending cuts. And then look at this government, wasting a historic majority and leaving the door to No 10 flapping wide open for Farage and other chancers.Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsBudgetOpinionRachel ReevesLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

The question that has sparked the uproar: what, exactly, does it mean when an otherwise upstanding young person blurts out the phrase “six-seven”?As you probably know by now if youread,listen toorwatchmajor media outlets from across the political spectrum, the answer is: it doesn’t really mean anything.‘Six-seven’: what does the latest slang mean (and should parents be worried)?Read moreThe phrase appears to have its roots in asong by the Philadelphia rapper Skrilla, perhaps referring to 67th Street; from there, it was used in videos featuring the 6ft-7in NBA player LaMelo Ball, and Taylen Kinney, a 17-year-old basketball star,helped it go viralwhen he used the phrase to rank a drink from Starbucks. It’s often accompanied by upturned palms rising and falling. But the specifics don’t hugely matter. It’s just something people like to say – or did, before adults picked up on it. The same is true of words like “skibidi”, whichMerriam-Webster callsa “nonsense internet term”. Then there are words whose meanings fluctuate, like “sigma”, which can be a compliment orpart of an expressionof confusion, as in “What the sigma?”So if these words don’t have clear meanings, is there any point in saying them? Sociolinguists, who study the social aspects of language, say there certainly is – especially for young people. “This is just human development,” says DrNicole Holliday, an associate professor of linguistics at the University of California, Berkeley. “Part of the psychosocial development of young people is differentiating themselves from their community, from older people, and establishing their own identity.”It looks like ‘brain rot’ from the outside but actually follows the same sociolinguistic logic as every previous generationDr Daria BahtinaDr Daria Bahtina, a sociolinguist and continuing lecturer at the University of California, Los Angeles, says the purpose of language isn’t just “to convey information, but to construct relationships, express attitudes, and signal belonging”.So it’s not just trivialbrain rot: terms like “six-seven”, “skibidi” and “Ohio”, she writes over email, “are fun precisely because they are exclusive and recognitional – the joy lies in getting it.”IYKYK.Since it spreads through social media, “an environment optimized for constant novelty and reaction”, Bahtina writes, “it looks like ‘brain rot’ from the outside but actually follows the same sociolinguistic logic as every previous generation’s creative language play.” Remember when everyone was shouting “23 skidoo!” all the time? Probably not, because it peaked in 1905 and 1906, as Shane O’Neill recently wrote in theWashington Post. But it was a similarly malleable numerical phrase, with meanings ranging from catcalling to suggesting it was time to go.More recently, as Holliday andothershavepointed out, millennials were known to shout 1738, inspired by the 2014Fetty Wap song Trap Queen. “It’srelated to cognac, I think, but nobody knew that when they were in the club – 1738 was just a thing you said,” Holliday says. That community-building can also be regional: words such as “mane” in Memphis, Tennessee, and “jawn” in Philadelphia can refer to many things, but their clearest meaning is: “I’m from this city.”But whatisdifferent about these kids today, Holliday and Bahtina agree, is the way they disseminate slang, and how it behaves as a result. Once, only parents and teachers would have been exposed to the language. But thanks to social media’s speed and public nature, older generations get wind of these phrases quickly and demand explanations. And once adults start writing killjoy articles like this one, the slang loses its power; it’s no longer a marker of an exclusive community of people who get it. That means new words and phrases must rush in to fill the void. “They have to keep outrunning us old people,” Holliday says.The result is that, to their elders, gen alpha and gen Z can appear to be drowning in slang. “And then most of it is almost instantly ‘cringe’” – a word which itself has become cringe, Bahtina notes – because the language quickly goes mainstream. It all happens so fast that it can even pose a problem for kids themselves: when it’s hard to keep up, it can be easy to feel left out.On the other hand, the fact that it’s all happening on a public forum can also create a bond, even between generations. When Holliday, the Berkeley linguistics professor, was running a marathon recently, some kids were holding a sign at the 6.7-mile mark. When she reached it, she yelled “six, seven” to their delight. “Just for a brief moment,” she says, “in our lonely, isolated, algorithm-driven world, I connected with those kids on something that we shared.”Explore more on these topicsYoung peopleOpinionLinguisticsLanguagefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Donald Trump gushed about an “amazing” meeting, scoring it 12 out of 10; Xi Jinping reportedlynotedthat a consensus had been reached, with the two sides needing to finalise follow-up steps rapidly.Mr Trump’s usual trade approach –shout loudly and wave a big stick– faltered when Beijing raised its own bludgeon. No tribute ofgold crownsorNobel nomination pledgeswere on offer from Mr Xi. The US president blinked first – but, predictably, attempted to repackage the underwhelming result as a great success.In fact, it was a necessary de-escalation that essentially turned the clock back. Mr Trump – who once announced tariffs of 145% on China –agreed to cut the average rate to 45%and suspended the tightening of tech-related export controls. China has said that it will buy US soya beans and – most importantly – is holding off on draconian curbs to rare earth exports, which it threatened as a countermeasure. It’s still unclear whether China will get access to Nvidia’s powerful Blackwell chip. Experts say that woulddramatically shrink the US advantage in AI, with obvious economic and security implications.This is a year-long deal and may be no more than a pause. Mr Trump’s trade diplomacy is always erratic: last week, heannouncedthat he would add 10% to tariffs on Canada in retaliation for a provincial political advert. The country’s prime minister, Mark Carney, has just completedhis own swing through Asia; Trumpism is forcing longstanding allies to look for alternatives. Swingeing tariffs on India havepushed it towards China. Yet if the US wants to win in the long term, it will need to boost partnerships.Mr Trump notched up trade deals on this Asian tour, but the underlying problems are ever clearer. No one can count on bilateral ties with Washington any more, and the US is withdrawing from global institutions and forums, while China seeks to boost its role. Meanwhile, US businesses struggle tomake strategic decisionswhen they don’t know what the tariff rate will be next week, never mind next year.Beneath this administration’s shortcomings lie longer-term failings. China has been strategically mapping and tackling economic vulnerabilities; this truce buys it time to continue that work. The US islate to this game. It has just cut acritical minerals deal with Australia, but reducing dependence on Chinese rare earths will be a very long process – asJapan’s experiencehas shown.Yet Beijing’s decision to wield access to rare earths as a weapon has increased concerns about China outside the US too. The G7 summit in Canada is expected tolaunch an alliancepushing back against China’s dominance on Friday. The European Union must also show that it willstand up to Chinese coercion.Similarly, while China has become less reliant on exports to the US since Mr Trump’s first term, other countries are growing increasingly anxious about, and resistant to,dumping. Beijing’s longstanding pledges to rebalance the struggling economy towards domestic consumptionhave yet to be realised; hi-tech industrial self-reliance appears to be the priority.Thursday’s meeting may have brought breathing space. But as underlying contradictions within and between the two behemoths remain unresolved, the dangers are not only to them; they are also to others who put little faith in either side.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Since the 1970s, the UK government has regularly sought to answer this question by pulling together a range of statistics about the people who live there. The aim is to enable funding to be directedwhere it is most needed, and to make possible place-based initiatives alongside those aimed at individuals or households.For a Labour governmenttrailing Reform UK in the polls, the latest data – which is weighted towards income and employment, but also includes health and educational outcomes – should serve as a wake-up call. Virtually all the areas in England either trapped in the “most deprived”, or climbing up the ranks to join them, are in the party’s urban or post-industrial heartlands.A neighbourhood in the Jaywick & St Osyth area of Tendring, near Clacton in Essex, has the top spot on the table, known as the index of multiple deprivation, for the fourth time in a row. Seven of the top 10 places are filled by neighbourhoods inBlackpool. Middlesbrough, Birmingham, Hartlepool, Hull and Manchester also feature heavily. Similar mapping exercises in the devolved nations are carried out separately. While the tools and lexicon of policymaking around deprivation have grown more sophisticated, the reality is that millions of people remain in the same old trap.Work to free them has picked up under this government after the levelling up strategy flopped. Analysis by the Independent Commission on Neighbourhoods shows that investment in the north-east during this parliament will beseven times higherthan it was under Boris Johnson, if current trends continue. Labour’s successor scheme, Pride in Place, will see169 communities in England receive £20m each. Its goal is the kind of tangible improvements – youth clubs, prospering high streets and so on – that could boost trust in politics along with morale, and help lessen the appeal of outrage-fuelled populists.Such spending is urgent and necessary if Labour is to demonstrate its commitment to a renewed public realm. Similar programmes including the New Deal for Communities (under New Labour) andBig Local, funded by the national lottery, have achieved some good results in the past.But the warning contained in the updated index must not be ignored. Neighbourhood-level deprivation, which is a relative measure and far broader than poverty calculated via incomes, is extraordinarily hard to shift. The biggest change to theofficial figures, compared with six years ago, is mostly due to the decision to calculate incomes after rather than before housing costs. The effect is to underscore the devastating impact of high rents in areas including inner London. The result is likely to be higher funding settlements for some of the affected councils. If this helps to focus minds on the urgent need for affordable housing, and support for family finances in the meantime, that will be beneficial. But new priorities must not displace longer-standing problems in post-industrial and coastal areas – such as those featured in the Guardian’sAgainst the Tideseries.Schemes such as Pride in Place can strengthen civil society as well as physical infrastructure. But they must not be viewed as a substitute for policies targeting incomes in these places. If neighbourhoods stuck in deprivation for decades are to have a chance, the children in them must be given opportunities. The latest deprivation data strengthens the case for removing the limits placed on benefits by the Tories, including thetwo-child benefit cap.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Illegal houses in multiple occupation, 24 October). The owners of the HMOs, both property companies, have rented their flats to up to eight single adults over the past 15 years. The flats are registered by the local council as suitable for renting to three unrelated adults.Aditya Chakrabortty’s description of the outside of the HMO he mentions, with its jumble of bags and suitcases, describes the front garden of my block to a T as long as you add in broken furniture and urine-soaked mattresses, which are eventually removed by the housing association. Inside the block, cockroaches can be seen crawling around the front door of one of the HMOs, and all of the block’s kitchens and bathrooms have been invaded by cockroaches that were released when the other HMO was undergoing major renovations.The housing association has ignored numerous complaints from residents about the illegality of the HMOs and the nuisance created by their overcrowded conditions. By calling our complaints “unproven allegations”, it feels free to ignore them. It also refuses to investigate them because it argues that this would disturb the owners’ right “to the quiet enjoyment of their home”. At least our situation is not as distressing as it is for those living in an HMO, but it reflects how hidden many of these properties, with their awful conditions for renters, can be. I hope this powerful opinion piece contributes to the conversation about the shameful state of housing in the UK.Name and address suppliedThe appalling conditions in some HMOs are an outrage, and national and local governments are complicit. The government is happy to receive tax from landlords while denying the resources to regulate a disgusting practice. Indeed, the government is happy to receive the tenants’ income tax in addition.It would seem that the solution to this problem is strict enforcement of standards. If a landlord won’t meet their obligations, the property should be confiscated and the rent used to bring the property up to standard. It could remain in the ownership of the local authority, or if the landlord wished to retrieve their property, they should meet the cost of renovation plus interest.Of course, the courts should be properly funded to supervise this process speedily and fairly, so that if tenants have caused the deterioration of the property they should be liable for repairs. The expectation that such poor practices will be ignored is the reason that they occur on the scale they do.Martin CooperBromley, LondonIt should be noted that tenants in unlicensed HMOs areable to claimtheir rent back for the period that the tenancy is unlicensed. This is a far greater disincentive for landlords than criminal prosecutions. A simple letter setting out the intention to seek this through the courts is often enough.My daughter and the people that she shared with in Peckham, south London, received half their year’s rent from their landlord after sending one short letter and having one virtual meeting with a professional mediator. Organisations such asJustice for Tenantscan assist with this.Victoria GouldStratford-upon-Avon, WarwickshireThank you, Aditya Chakrabortty, for giving a human face to one of the many scandalous housing practices that we have sadly come to tolerate. How did it come to this? The answers are simple. Underfunded local authorities with demotivated workforces that are led by politicians and managers more concerned with targets than citizens being treated fairly. Add an overwhelmed court system and a lack of effective regulation plus a dash of buy-to-let incentives, and we have the perfect recipe for unscrupulous landlords to exploit.The man on the Clapham omnibus does not care that many of his fellow citizens are living in conditions that would not have been acceptable in the 1950s, as long as he does not have to pay more in taxation.

I have two further points for the red book.First, social housing should be a number one priority. An expanded social housing programme will deliver well-paid jobs, reduce the housing benefit bill, homelessness costs for councils and upward pressure on private rents, and stop the rightwing cry that there is no housing for locals.Second, to pay for it, capital gains tax rates should be equalised with income tax rates, which will not breach a manifesto commitment and will bring in£14bn to £15bn.ButRachel Reevesshould be bolder and raise even more for our crumbling public services. As pensioners and landlords do not currently pay national insurance, she should increase all income tax rates by 5p, take 5% off employees’ NI so working people are protected and, at the same time, abolish the upper earnings limit to ensure that the highest-paid contribute more.Phil TateChesterWhere in the Guardian’s budget speech was there any recognition of the vital importance of the long-awaited child poverty strategy due to be unveiled around the time of the budget? The chancellor’s actual speech must give due priority to this, not least because what should be key elements, such as the abolition of the two-child benefit cap (which was supported by both deputy leader candidates), have public spending implications. But also, a clear message needs to go out from the top of the party that tackling child poverty is a priority and central to our vision of a good society in which all children can thrive.Ruth ListerLabour, House of LordsYour proposed fiscal policy is problematic. By far the worst idea is clipping the Bank of England’s wings in relation to inflation, though you couldn’t bear to mention the word in your editorial. The Bank is already under considerable pressure to support the government’s outdated productivist economic narrative by lowering interest rates at a time of medium-level inflation.Inflation is a regressive flat tax on the poor. Making already disadvantaged people help fund the false god of growth by extending the cost of living crisis is the least progressive thing we can do.Tony SamphierBeckenham, LondonYou rightly call for the Bank of England to adopt a tiered-reserve system to save £20bn per year. A further £15bn per year could be raised by restricting pension contribution tax relief to the basic rate, which would be progressive and relatively painless as it would not affect anyone’s take-home pay. Together, these measures could fill the hole in the public finances and provide more than enough to meet theNHS emergency moneyneeded this year.Richard MountfordHildenborough, KentHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

More than 2 million people over the age of 65 are living in poverty.Povertyrates are even higher among those approaching state pension age, which raises concerns about the immediate future, even with the safety net of the triple lock in place. There is also no guarantee that saving money on the triple lock will be put to the benefit of impoverished children.There is merit in debating the future of the triple lock and its sustainability. But let’s not be naive to think that there is a simple solution to this. The haphazard reform of the winter fuel payment tells us that any reform needs need to be considered, planned and implemented with plenty of advance notice to ensure pensioner poverty does not skyrocket as a result.It is also depressing to see that the argument against the triple lock cannot be made without ageist insults. Toynbee writes: “The older the country grows, the more emphatically politics favours the decrepit above the young future who will pay for them.” This depiction of utter dependency and reliance does not reflect the huge contributions that pensioners have made to this country over decades, and continue to make.We need all political parties to show a commitment to reducing poverty for all ages and to discourage narratives that suggest one demographic in society is losing out to the benefit of another.Dr Carole EastonChief executive, Centre for Ageing BetterPolly Toynbee seeks to pit one disadvantaged group against another. Many pensioners also live in poverty. It should surely be possible to end both pensioner poverty and child poverty.In any case, the national pension scheme is a form of intergenerational solidarity. Those in work and their employers contribute to the scheme, and this funds the pensions of the retired. When they in turn retire, another generation of workers will contribute to their pensions.Pensionsare thus a form of deferred wages.As always, the question asked goes a long way to determining the response. The question “What kind of country puts military spending ahead of the eradication of poverty?” would elicit a very different answer.Today’s children living in poverty are likely to be the future pensioners living in poverty unless there is a radical change in national priorities.Dr Steve CushionAssistant branch secretary, London retired members branch, University and College UnionExplore more on these topicsPovertyBudgetPensionsOlder peoplePublic services policylettersShareReuse this content"

The part-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, CEO Omar Berrada and technical director Jason Wilcox were full of optimism. What owner isn’t energised by making a coaching appointment, especially their first? It was a chance for Ratcliffe to put his imprint on United after years of drift under the Glazers.The coach, who had regained the title at Sporting, had youthful vivacity, an admirable track record and emotional intelligence.Ruben Amorim, appointed a year ago this Saturday, was one of the most desired young coaches on the market, which is why Tottenham and Liverpool had also considered him.‘Tough, really tough’: Ruben Amorim on his first year at Manchester UnitedRead moreUnited felt they had stolen a march yet even a year ago, among their opponents, there was scepticism at their elation. “Sporting Lisbon had a great time under him and I’m not saying he wasn’t part of their success but Benfica and Porto had their problems, it’s an easy league and Sporting’s title win was overhyped because of special circumstances,” said one highly respected executive who has appointed a number of successful Premier League coaches. “Amorim left and Sporting still won the league last season. Maybe it was the players?”One year on, it is fair to say the early buoyancy Ratcliffe, Berrada and Wilcox experienced has not been frequently replicated. More often they have looked like three stooges in the directors’ box at Old Trafford, glumly looking down at their protege overseeing another calamity.And yet after three successive wins, including crucially a firstat Anfield against Liverpoolfor almost 10 years, their faith in Amorim now suddenly feels farsighted. They had always maintained that the lowest points – Grimsby, the Europa League final, both defeats at Brentford, the miserable Christmas run of four successive losses – were staging posts on a longer journey.“We can’t react every time we lose and we can’t be celebrating like a cup final just because we win,” said one voice at Old Trafford on the recent renaissance of hope. There is acknowledgment that this is a long and difficult journey. The club believe Amorim is the right person to turn around the United oil tanker and there is determination not to go back to the “rinse and repeat” of the past 10 years.View image in fullscreenAmorim talks to Kobbie Mainoo before Manchester United are knocked out of the Carabao Cup by Grimsby.Photograph: Chris Radburn/ReutersThat’s why, United say, there was no prospect a month ago that Amorim would have been sacked had they lost to Sunderland on the back of the gutless3-1 defeat by Brentford.Ratcliffe compared Amorim’s struggles to Mikel Arteta’s first year at Arsenal and has seemingly promised him three years to turn the club around. There is hope that Anfield will be Amorim’s Mark Robins moment, the iconic FA Cup third-round victory in 1990 in which the striker scored to save Sir Alex Ferguson’s job.A parallel to current dynamics is that the then chair, Martin Edwards, has always insisted that Ferguson’s job was not on the line that day, partly because the most august member of the board, Sir Bobby Charlton, still supported the Glaswegian and could see he was turning the club around.Berrada and Wilcox don’t quite have Charlton’s credentials, even if Wilcox is a Premier League winner, but they are Ratcliffe’s eyes and ears in the football world and are true Amorim believers.Yet there was another member of the executive team who possibly wasn’t as excited to greet Amorim last year. Dan Ashworth, now the FA’s chief football officer, was United’s sporting director when Amorim was appointed. Ashworth left on 8 December. United maintain the two events were unrelated. “Everyone was aligned on Ruben’s appointment, including Dan,” said a United source.Yet it was the failure of Erik ten Hag and the search for a successor that triggered Ratcliffe’s realisation that Ashworth wasn’t the man he wanted to run his club. Once the board decided Ten Hag couldn’t go on, Ratcliffe wanted a bold plan from Ashworth, according to a source familiar with both sides of the story. Yet Ashworth argued this wasn’t time for a risky appointment, that there was a need to rebuild and reform the culture. Hence his shortlist of Premier League managers such as Eddie Howe and Graham Potter. Other sources suggest Thomas Frank was discussed. United insist Gareth Southgate was never an option, though given his closeness to Ashworth and Sir Dave Brailsford, Ineos’s director of sport, it would have been odd not to have discussed him.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Brailsford, said to be the person most likely to speak frankly to Ratcliffe, was very influential at the time, said the source, and Wilcox and Berrada were more fluent in “football corporate speak” than Ashworth.View image in fullscreenHarry Maguire leads Manchester United’s celebrations after a victory against Liverpool at Anfield.Photograph: Poppy Townson/MUFC/Manchester United/Getty ImagesAmorim had been discussed in the summer of 2024, when United were weighing up whether to stay with Ten Hag after his FA Cup win, though Berrada and Ashworth were on gardening leave then. A separate source close to the figures involved says there was wariness at that stage because of his adherence to 3-4-3. United say this is not the case. “They really, really liked him in the summer,” a United source said.Rival sporting directors tend to agree that Amorim’s dogma should have dissuaded United. “He [Ruben] has fallen into the trap of thinking that it’s his system and tactics which are the cause of success,” said one. “Managers are egomaniacs but they have to be egomaniacs to stand in front of young men earning so much and hold the room. Youhaveto get players thinking you are a genius. The problem is they then believe that they are.“Pragmatism is underrated at the top level. If it’s not working, you have to make changes for the short term. When United asked the question: ‘Will you change 3-4-3?’ and he said no, that should have been a red flag.”United sources insist that is a mischaracterisation of Amorim and it is certainly true there are variations in his 3-4-3, not least the direct approach which did for Liverpool and was a tactical triumph. The question is whether there will be more of those and whether anyone will be writing articles marking Amorim’s second anniversary.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedRuben AmorimfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Running back from mid-off, Tahlia McGrath spilled the third of those chances from Rodrigues in the 44th over, while Annabel Sutherland sent down two wides in a wayward 48th over which cost 15 runs.It was left to Amanjot Kaur to reap the rewards of Rodrigues’ staying power, striking the winning runs from Sophie Molineux’s 49th over with nine balls to spare.India beat Australia in historic chase to reach Women’s Cricket World Cup final – liveRead moreThe historic run-chase – the highest ever achieved in women’s ODI cricket – had hung in the balance after Harmanpreet Kaur miscued a pull to midwicket in the 36th over, out for a run-a-ball 89 with 113 runs still needed from 88 balls.Deepti Sharma was then run out after hesitating over a quick single, while Richa Ghosh smashed two sixes but sent up a catch to short third with the equation down to 29 off four overs.Rodrigues, though, remained unbeaten to the end, as India waltzed into a home World Cup final with a five-wicket win, delighting the Mumbai crowd. They face South Africa at the same ground on Sunday.“It was really hard these last 12 months, but this feels like a dream and it’s not sunk in yet,” Rodrigues told Sky Sports – a reference to a tricky period in which she has been in and out of the India XI. Less than two weeks ago, she was dropped for the group-stage match against England, while in the semi-final she was told only five minutes before being sent out that she would be batting at No 3.“I cried every day throughout this tour,” she said. “I was not doing well mentally, going through a lot of anxiety, then being dropped was a big challenge for me.“ But [this innings] was not for me to prove a point, it was for me to win this match for India. We’ve always lost in crunch situations, and I wanted to be there to the end to take us through.”India were clear underdogs going into this game, having limped through the group stages with losses to these same opponents as well as to South Africa and England. That status was only underlined when opener Phoebe Litchfield hit a 77-ball century – the quickest ever in a World Cup knockout match – and India lost both of their openers in the powerplay, in dismissals which epitomised the two teams’ differing success with use of DRS this World Cup.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Mandhana shook her head in disbelief before walking off.“We created pressure, we created opportunities, we just weren’t able to capitalise,” Alyssa Healy, who also dropped Rodrigues, told Sky Sports. “That’s something that Australia really prides themselves on, and we let ourselves down in that regard.” Earlier, Australia’s total of 338 was built around that maiden World Cup hundred from the 22-year-old Litchfield, a quiet half-century from Ellyse Perry and a much noisier one from Ash Gardner.Litchfield unfurled her trademark reverse-sweep, although there was a nervous moment when she tried it on 62 and was given out on-field after the ball ended up in the hands of backward square leg. Litchfield, though, sent the decision upstairs and was reprieved when replays showed it had been a bump ball.That allowed her to progress to her ton eight overs later – but she was bowled trying to ramp Amanjot Kaur in the 28th over, and India fought back in the middle overs to take four Australian wickets for 45 runs. Perry, who had looked set to join Litchfield in the centurion club after scoring her first half-century of the tournament, joined in with the collapse, bowled by a Radha Yadav ball which skidded on to her stumps.Gardner muscled four sixes and brought up a 41-ball fifty to ensure Australia added 38 runs from the final four overs – but she was run out after a muddle with Kim Garth in the 49th, while Deepti Sharma took two wickets with successive deliveries in the 50th over as Australia were bowled out off the penultimate ball of the innings, a limp finish which eventually came back to haunt them.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Cricket World CupIndia women's cricket teamAustralia women's cricket teamWomen's cricketAustralia sportCricketmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

In the Essex town best known these days for being one of the backdrops for the popular BBC comedy series Gavin and Stacey, and where allegiances have often been split between Tottenham and West Ham, Dowman had caught the eye of scouts from London’s biggest academies at the age of six.“He had the pick of clubs,” says Nick Hutt, the chair of Billericay’s youth section, who saw a four-year-old Dowman play. “But the whole family areArsenalsupporters, so they chose Arsenal.”Arsenal’s winning run goes on as Nwaneri and Saka boot Brighton from Carabao CupRead moreLittle more than a decade on, Mikel Arteta is reaping the benefits. Dowman, having set numerous records in Arsenal’s Hale End academy, on Wednesday became the youngest player to start a match for the club. At the age of 15 years and 302 days he left the Emirates entranced by a mesmerising performance inthe Carabao Cup win over Brighton.“A tiny smile, that’s what you get with him,” said a proud Arsenal manager when asked after how the understated Dowman had reacted to news he would surpass his under-18s teammate Jack Porter’s record, established last year in the same competition.The word has been out on Dowman among Arsenal fans since he was invited to train with Arteta’s squad at the start of last year when he turned 14. A meticulous progression plan has been mapped out for the player some insiders describe as the most talented they have seen at his age.Dowman became England Under- 19s youngest player last month and their youngest goalscorer just over a fortnight ago. The next big landmark could be breaking Youssoufa Moukoko’s record (16 years and 18 days for Dortmund) as the youngest player in Champions League history. “He needs to cope with all that because it’s happening very, very fast,” Arteta said.View image in fullscreenA young Max Dowman in the youth team at Billericay Town.Photograph: Nick HuttAccording to Hutt, Dowman has been well prepared to deal with the spotlight by his family. Dowman’s father, Rob, an avid Arsenal fan, was heavily involved in discussions that led to his son signing scholarship terms last week amid interest from other clubs. “Max has always been kind of old for his age,” Hutt says. “Very mature, laid-back and he worked incredibly hard at his football. They’re a very grounded family. His mum, Caroline, and Rob, they keep Max grounded. They’re very humble, nice people, very kind of community-focused. So I’m sure they’ve played an important role in getting him ready for where he is now.”Rob was coaching Dowman’s older brother Ethan’s team at Billericay when he first brought Max to the club’s Saturday morning soccer school. Hutt, asked whether a particular memory stands out from Dowman’s five years in the colts section, says: “Oh, no, there’s too many moments with him. You know what they’re like at that age, when they’re six, seven, eight: they’re really good but there’s no guarantee they’re going to make it or do anything. But Max is just … I think all the time he was at Arsenal he’s been playing a couple of years above his age group, so we knew he had a real chance. But until they actually make the debut, as he didagainst Leeds in August, you’re never really sure.”Quick GuideItoje's pride at cousin's Arsenal breakthroughShow'I have passed on the baton': Itoje's pride at Arsenal starletMaro Itoje has admitted he may have to start taking second billing to Arsenal’s latest starlet – his cousin. Andre Harriman-Annous made his first start for Arsenal on Wednesday as they beat Brighton in the Carabao Cup and Itoje revealed he was “incredibly proud” of the 17-year-old.“I am very happy for him,” said the England captain. “He has worked incredibly hard over the last 10 years. They start so young, these footballers. I remember going to his house and his older cousins were putting him through his paces as a seven-year-old. Everyone is really happy and really proud. His mum has been amazing and is making sure there’s a good team around him.”Asked whether Itoje was no longer the big deal in the family, he said: “I have passed on the baton. I guess we need you media guys to do a better job for us and get some more rugby on the back pages. I want him to fly. He has done amazingly well and long may it continue – not only because he is my cousin but I support Arsenal.

In fact, when Arsenal closed down for the summer, Max would come and train back with his old team at Billericay. He even trained with the men’s first team on a few occasions.”Arsenal snapped up three of Dowman’s Billericay teammates after spotting him in 2015, with two of them – Noah Clements and Marley Frohock – making progress at Hale End, even if it has not been quite as spectacular as Dowman’s.View image in fullscreenMax Dowman on his debut against Leeds in August.Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/Reuters“We’ve got boys at Man City, we’ve got boys at Man United, but they’re really just starting to come through now,” Hutt says. “Lots of boys. We’ve got a few junior schoolboy internationals. Essex is a pretty hotbed of football, so there’s lots of talent coming out of here. Obviously, we’re one of the bigger clubs in the area so that helps.”Dowman, who is due to complete his GCSEs next year, regularly returns to his old stamping ground at Billericay, where Hutt says he is a “hero for a lot of the local children”.“Max shows that a young boy from Billericay can end up playing in the Premier League,” he says. “It gives people somebody to look up to.

Steve Borthwick and members of his coaching staff have had discussions with Brendon McCullum and want their team to make a fast and furious start against Australia in the Quilter Nations Series on Saturday.There is a collective desire within the England camp to make a statement over the coming month and Borthwick and his defence coach, Richard Wigglesworth, have been picking McCullum’s brain on the best ways to encourage a positive mindset. “We met Brendon McCullum and his coaching staff a few weeks ago,” said Wigglesworth. “We had a sit down and a coffee in Manchester which was very enjoyable.Australia will target Freeman at centre in England clash, George Gregan warnsRead more“I asked him a lot around how he changed mindsets in English cricket which was really interesting. But then we got into the technicalities of coaching someone one-on-one and what that looks like. I wouldn’t want to say there was one main thing because we sat for a good period of time and took loads from it, but they’re on to a good thing.“We [also] want to be a team that can win in multiple different ways and adapt because every game is different. We feel we’ve got a dynamic team so we want to play that way.”Despite a sequence of seven successive victories this year England fans are still awaiting the launch of a spectacular new “Borthball” era to compare with theeye-catching cricketing equivalentled by McCullum and Ben Stokes. The next month, however, offers the chance to take a significant step forward with the draw for the 2027 Rugby World Cup set to be conducted in December.Beating the Wallabies on Saturday, hard on the heels of the British & Irish Lions’summer series triumph, would also help to counter Australia’s success in last weekend’sfirst rugby league Ashes Testbefore the start of cricket’s Ashes series in Perth on 21 November. There are several avid cricket fans in the England rugby squad and Wigglesworth believes the “great rivalry” with Australia motivates both teams. “I think both sides really enjoy playing against each other because there’s something there. Hopefully we stick one on the board on Saturday.”View image in fullscreenEngland’s defence coach Richard Wigglesworth, with Steve Borthwick, met Brendon McCullum to pick his brains.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PAWigglesworth was also part of the Lions management who tasted success in Australiain the summer and believes all the English coaches and players involved gained plenty from the experience. He has diplomatically resisted the temptation to consult Geoff Parling, the recent Australia assistant coach now in charge at Leicester, but says the intensity of the tour has had “a big impact” on his coaching approach.“If you’re working with such elite players, you can’t help but learn, because they’re usually the best teachers. I absolutely loved it, learned loads, we had a great time and we won. I think the players have noticed a difference in the lads who were lucky enough to go on a Lions tour. Until you’ve been on one you probably can’t feel like it. And the group who were in Argentina have also definitely grown. So the two have come back together really nicely.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A year ago Australia took advantage of some defensive uncertaintyto win 42-37but the visitors may find fewer holes this time. “We definitely want a dynamic defence,” said Wigglesworth, also hoping to encourage his players to respond positively in adversity.“What I love about the game of rugby is that every game is different and can be won in different ways. Is it wet? What’s the referee doing? All these things go into the melting pot.” The former Saracens and Sale scrum-half is also adamant that empowering the players is the way ahead for England rather than constantly micromanaging them.“What I’m not going to do is go this defence has to change because of me and what I believe. The more we grow together, the more we know what everyone wants from each other and what’s going to make us a really good team. Then the more the players get to take a lead on that. Eventually you get to that sweet spot of empowerment that is productive, not empowerment that is setting them up to fail.”Explore more on these topicsEngland rugby union teamAustralia rugby union teamRugby unionAutumn Nations SeriesnewsShareReuse this content"

In the absence of any actionable information from Fifa before the first round of the pre-sale opened up, they hoped, I guess, that I had inside knowledge.In truth, I only knew that Fifa would be usingthe universally despised dynamic pricing model, and thatthe bid bookfor the 2026 World Cup had promised an average group stage ticket price of $305. Mind you, that was seven and a half years ago and an awful lot of inflation has happened since then. In the bid, Category 4 tickets for the group stage – the cheapest seats available – were priced at $21. (As we would soon learn, the actual price would start at $60, andcategory 4 tickets are almost non-existent.)Could Trump really move World Cup games? The facts behind his threatsRead moreI play over-40 pickup soccer with a group of a few dozen soccer-loving friends in New York’s Hudson Valley. In the group chat, anticipation built for the first round of general ticket sales in early October. Tidbits were traded. Links were shared. It was broadly accepted that the prices would be eye-watering – surely several hundred dollars per ticket, as this wasthe point of a North American World Cup, after all. Nineteen of us entered the Visa pre-sale lottery, as did 4.5 million others. Two of us, including me, won a time slot to buy tickets. It’s hardly a scientific sample at two people, but if our experiences are anything to go by, there are already serious questions around affordability at this World Cup (it makes sense anaffordability-focused political candidatewould make it an issue).The first of us to venture into the time slot stage spent two hours in a countdown queue loop that reset every 10 minutes. When he finally got in, category 4 tickets were sold out. He snagged some category 3 tickets to a round-of-32 knockout match in New Jersey, but his bank blocked the transaction. By the time he had resolved the issue, the system wouldn’t let him reorder those tickets, as it had logged the original, failed transaction as a sale, thus barring him from a second acquisition for the same match. He finally settled for some group-stage tickets instead.Two days later, I also spent several hours in ticketing purgatory before I was finally granted five whole minutes to log in.It was sort of ironic that I got through at all since I was on the fence about taking my family to the World Cup in the first place, afterour most recent outing to a Fifa tournamenthad its ups and downs. But it would be another year on, and World Cups in all their color and noise and sensation are extraordinary things to witness. I’ve been to three, and they are milestones in my life, that left vivid memories I doubt will ever fully fade. I figured I could always ditch the tickets on Fifa’s secondary market (less a 15% fee) if we decided not to go. But I wanted the experience to at least be something we could opt into.When I got a glimpse at the remaining inventory at last, everything in category 3 was gone as well for any game I was interested in – basically whatever was within a three-hour drive. The cheapest tickets left for any game at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey were $465 apiece and somehow also most likely in the upper deck. If we got the maximum of four tickets, that would easily make it a $2,000 day between the tickets, parking and other assorted expenses. And since the draw was still almost two months away, our tickets may yet turn out to be for a game like Qatar v Paraguay – potentially a barnburner on its day, of course, but at that price tag would need to deliver some serious pyrotechnics.I decided against it. Instead, I offered to get anybody else in my men’s league group chat the $465 tickets and transfer them. Out of 28 people in the chat with an interest in World Cup tickets – I went back and polled them, because we’re doing Journalism here – just one took me up on the offer. He had friends coming over from England for the World Cup, after all, and didn’t want to let them down.I ordered him four tickets to a group-stage match at the Meadowlands in category 2 at a total cost of $1,860. “I’m probably gonna regret this,” he said, as he signed off on the purchase.Then kicked off a new kind of kerfuffle: actually transferring the tickets to him.One fruitless attempt after another left the tickets stuck in myFifaaccount. “It felt like genuine progress when, after a week, the website went from aimlessly refreshing when trying to accept, to actually returning an error code,” said the friend.It took almost two weeks for the transfer function to finally work. And when it ultimately did, it left no paper trail at all. The tickets simply vanished from my account and appeared in his, giving me no notice, confirmation or receipt concerning the status of my near-$2,000 purchase.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

More than a million tickets were sold in the first phase, per Fifa, but to whom? And how on earth might fans from other countries, where spending power tends to be lower than in the American middle class – and have to pay for flights and accommodation too – possibly afford to go? Will there be any kind of atmosphere at the games, if it’s just stockbrokers and lawyers and tech bros and sponsors and dignitaries filling the stadiums?Will it be the World Cup for the 1%?We can probably state with more certainty whowon’tbe there: a lot of people really keen on going to this generational event who can’t begin to afford it.

Banka went on to criticise the anti-doping regime in the US, at a time when the government there has withheld crucial funding from Wada’s operations.Olympic athletes say pro-doping Enhanced Games are a betrayal and could lead to deathsRead more“Sometimes we don’t know what to say about this ridiculous idea, because from the ethical point of view, from the moral point of view, how is it possible that people come to agree to compete, taking all these prohibited substances?” Banka said. “It’s completely against everything that we are doing. It’s very dangerous. I hope it will not happen, although there are quite important and rich people who are sponsors of this irresponsible event.”Banka said anti-doping authorities had to be “very strong” in their opposition to the games. “We have to be very united,” he said. “We really want our colleagues from the US to do more to make sure that this event will not happen. There are some legal possibilities they can lobby for. Usada have made general comments, but maybe it’s time to try and convince the people who have financed this that it’s dangerous. That’s [Usada’s] role and responsibility because the event is going to take place in Las Vegas.”The Enhanced Games is scheduled to take place next year at Resorts World in Nevada, with events in swimming, athletics and weightlifting. Marketing itself as “pioneering a new era in athletic competition that embraces scientific advancements to push the boundaries of human performance”, it is backed by funding from an investment group that includes Donald Trump Jr.The event has attracted global headlines and opprobrium in equal measure because of its approach towards PEDs and the $250,000 rewards offered to athletes for breaking official world records, with $1m on offer in 50m freestyle swimming and 100m sprint.The head of Usada, Travis Tygart, has previously called the Enhanced Games “a clown show”, but has also been heavily critical of Wada. In the aftermath of the controversy involving 23 Chinese swimmers, who competed at the Tokyo Olympics despite recording positive drug tests, Tygart said that Wada had “accepted China can play by its own set of rules”. An independent review later found no evidence of bias towards China in Wada’s response. Tygart also supported a decision by the US government to withhold funding from Wada earlier this year, saying it was “the only right choice to protect athletes’ rights and fair competition”.Speaking in London on Thursday, Banka said Wada was “very keen” to work with Usada but that “it has to be based on mutual respect”. He then went on to criticise the US anti-doping regime, noting that the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) is not a signatory to the world anti-doping code.“When we see anti-doping in US, the problem is that this is far from perfect system,” Banka said. “Almost 90% of US athletes are not competing under the world anti-doping code. [Elsewhere] only 308 samples were collected in the six months after the Olympics in 2024. Ask yourself if [the US system] is robust or it requires improvement. Is there a great anti-doping programme in the strongest sporting nation in the world?“China was a fair decision and was used in the US against Wada to destroy its image,” Banka went on. “This is politicisation. There is zero evidence that there was something wrong on Wada’s side. My wish is that instead of politicisation and attacking us, the time is used to address the gaps and strengthen the anti-doping system in the US.”Explore more on these topicsWadaDrugs in sportSport politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Other runners from the yard at single-figure odds include The Lion In Winter (Mile) and Havana Anna (Juvenile Turf Sprint), and the Ballydoyle squadron is, as so often, at the heart of the European challenge at the meeting.O’Brien needs a single success this weekend to take sole control of the record for Breeders’ Cup with 21, one more than the late D Wayne Lukas, who died in June.It would be a remarkable achievement for an overseas trainer to sit ahead of such names as Lukas, Bob Baffert (19) and Chad Brown (19), but he is not the only European trainer with great expectations this weekend.Francis-Henri Graffard, who has already won both the King George VI & Queen Elizabeth Stakes and the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe this year, will attempt to complete the set of the world’s most prestigious mile-and-a-half turf events with three different horses when Goliath goes to post for the Turf. And in the same race, Charlie Appleby’s popular gelding Rebel’s Romance could become only the third horse to win a Breeders’ Cup race three times, and set a new record for earnings by a European-trained horse in the process.Andrew Balding, meanwhile, is hoping to register a win at the meeting for the first time, and has three runners over the two days. Pacific Mission is an outsider for the Juvenile Fillies’ Turf on Friday, while Jonquil (Mile) and the 4-1 shot See The Fire, in the Filly & Mare Turf, will go to post on Saturday.“I was here [at Del Mar] for a summer when I was 20,” Balding, who is now 54, said on Wednesday. “That’s the last time I was here and nothing seems to have changed.View image in fullscreenTrainer Andrew Balding at Del Mar racecourse on Wednesday.Photograph: Steven Cargill/racingfotos.com/Shutterstock“It’s an important event and always has been and I remember as a kid, the first years when it was new and really exciting.“Dad [the trainer, Ian] took Selkirk out to Gulfstream Park and I can remember the buzz and everything about the place, and [the champion sprinter] Lochsong in the Sprint [for her final race in 1994].”Both Pacific Mission and See The Fire have been drawn in unfavourable wide stalls this weekend, which will give their respective jockeys, Colin Keane and Oisin Murphy, plenty of thinking to do.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Thursday tipsShowStratford-On-Avon12.47 Dickens 1.17 Followango 1.47 Brace For Landing 2.17 Quaviste 2.47 Range 3.17 Western Soldier 3.47 Faitique De L’Isle 4.17 Princess Of BalleaBath12.55 Takeitorleaveit 1.25 Heroics 1.55 Platinum Prince 2.25 Rating 2.55 Marching Mac 3.25 Cameley Days 3.55 Roman Spring 4.25 Sub ThirteenNewcastle1.08 Cueros 1.38 Sir Carnegie 2.08 Fairly Fulling 2.38 Chasingouttheblues 3.08 Hostile Hotelier 3.38 Half Shot 4.08 Monte A BordSouthwell4.30 Big Shot Veto 5.00 Birdcall 5.30 Lightning Touch 6.00 Woodstock 6.30 Taranjerine 7.00 Covert Legend 7.30 Springbok 8.00 Imola 8.30 Spun To GoldChelmsford4.45 Reader 5.15 Miss Ayala 5.45 Applesandpears 6.15 Aramis Grey (nap) 6.45 Flowstate 7.15 Juno Star (nb) 7.45 Must Believe 8.15 Wyld BillWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“From that draw, I’ll leave it to the jockeys,” Balding said. “See The Fire needs an end-to-end gallop to aim at and it will be interesting to see her over an extra furlong on Saturday, it might make a big difference.

Sierra Leone and Fierceness, the 1-2 here 12 months ago, are now vying for favouritism at around 3-1, with Japan’s Forever Young, third in that race, at 6-1 and Journalism, the runner-up in the Kentucky Derby, the first three-year-old in the betting at 7-1.Runners from the O’Brien yard dominate the markets for the juvenile turf races and two short-priced favourites – Precise and Gstaad in the Juvenile Fillies’ Turf and Juvenile Turf, respectively – provide Christophe Soumillon with gilt-edged chances to improve what is, on the face of it, a distinctly underwhelming record at the meeting.Shirocco, in the Turf at Belmont Park in 2005, is Soumillon’s only Breeders’ Cup winner to date, and while it was very much a ride to post in the scrapbook – Soumillon dictated the race from second place behind a tearaway front-runner – it seems strange that such a talented and prolific big-race jockey has not added another.Precise and Gstaad are priced up at around 11-10 and 6-5 respectively, so punters can be forgiven for asking whether one Breeders’ Cup winner in 20 years is a sufficiently bankable record on a tight, unforgiving track like Del Mar.The reality, though, is that Soumillon has a career total of just 10 rides at the meeting, and he also suffered a wretched slice of luck in 2020 when he was ruled out at the last minute by a positive Covid test. He could only look on, presumably from self-isolation, as two of his booked rides came home in front.Quick GuideDeath announced of apprentice Tommie JakesShowApprentice jockey Tommie Jakes has died, aged 19, the Injured Jockeys Fund and Professional Jockeys Association have announced.Jakes rode 59 winners over the past three years on the Flat in Britain, including 19 in 2025. His most recent success came aboard George Boughey's Fouroneohfever at Catterick on October 18 and having ridden at Nottingham on Wednesday, he was due to have two booked rides at Chelmsford on Thursday evening.A joint-statement from the IJF and PJA read: \"It is with deep sadness that we report the death of licensed apprentice jockey Tommie Jakes, 19, who tragically died at home this morning near Newmarket.\"Tommie was a much-loved son and brother, and a popular member of George Boughey's racing team. His parents Jeremy and Tonie ask that their privacy is respected at this terrible time.\"In a post on his X account, Boughey said: \"We are heartbroken by the news that our apprentice jockey Tommie Jakes has passed away. Tommie has been an integral and much-loved member of our team. He was not only a hugely talented young rider with so much to look forward to, but an incredibly kind, popular and hard-working young man. We will miss him immensely.\"Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.In an alternative, Covid-free universe, Soumillon’s strike-rate might well be around 30%, so he is probably not a jockey with a Breeders’ Cup problem. After Monday’s post-position draw, however, he has a much more difficult hand to work with, as both Precise and Gstaad have ended up in the worst possible stall, on the wide outside of 13- and 14-runner fields respectively.Precise has at least 9lb in hand of her field on Timeformratings but that could count for little if, as seems likely, she has only a couple of rivals behind her at the first turn.

She has the tactical speed to allow Dylan Browne McMonagle to exploit her draw in stall two and could outrun her price of around 14-1.Soumillon may fare better aboardGstaad (12.25am), who has a little more early speed than Precise, while the fastest pace of all on Friday could well be set by Wesley Ward’sSchwarzenegger(9.45pm)in the Juvenile Turf Sprint. He went through the first quarter in 21.47sec last time out and still clung on to the lead at the wire, so he may be able to overcome a wide draw in 11.The remaining two races on the opening-day card are on the dirt, wherePercy’s Bar (10.25pm)andTed Noffey (11.45pm)should run big races in the Juvenile Fillies’ and Juvenile, respectively.Percy’s Bar lost the Grade One Spinaway Stakes in the stewards’ room last time out after giving Tommy Jo a bump in the stretch, but Tommy Jo was having a hard time getting past her and Percy’s Bar looks a value price for the rematch.Ted Noffey, meanwhile, has two Grade One wins in the book already by a combined margin of nearly 11 lengths and could well be the hottest favourite on the card.Explore more on these topicsBreeders' CupHorse racingHorse racing tipsAidan O'BrienUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Is there any hope of reclaiming a once hyped prospect?Quarterbacks such as Sam Darnold and Baker Mayfield have gone from busts to MVP candidates. The Chargers backup is in the ideal place to make a similar journeyOliver ConnollyThu 30 Oct 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 30 Oct 2025 07.45 EDTShareThe development path for youngNFLquarterbacks is brutal. They get lobbed in at the deep end as franchises try to figure out if their investment was worth it, before being tossed overboard if things go wrong. The league eats its young. The path from potential franchise starter to career backup – or out of the league – has never been shorter.And that path has been expedited almost by design. In part, that’s due to the rookie pay scale, which allows teams to move on from perceived misfires early. It’s also down to a shift in evaluations. Patrick Mahomes, Josh Allen and Lamar Jackson broke the mold for everyone. They redefined what a starting quarterback could look like, the skills needed, and the speed of development.College offenses had become too wide-open, too gimmicky, producing quarterbacks fluent in college football but not dialed into the mechanics of the NFL. So the league tried to fix it itself, drafting the rawest, most athletic prospects imaginable, then worrying about teaching them how to play quarterback later. It ignored that Jackson and Allen (the latter raw, the former not) played in pro-style passing games in college, lessening the learning curve when they entered the league. And trying to find the next Mahomes is like sifting through rec-ball leagues tofind the next Victor Wembanyama.There have been hits and misses. You know the names: Jordan Love, Justin Herbert, Zach Wilson, Anthony Richardson, Justin Fields, Trey Lance. All were chosen to fit the post-Mahomes vision of a modern quarterback.Herbert and Love have been the success stories, though there is nuance. Herbert would be an ideal quarterback in any era – and has himself been the victim of an unstable environment. Love was allowed to slow-cook in the background for three seasons in Green Bay, backing up Aaron Rodgers. The rest have been whiffs. And all of them are candidates to join a new wave of success stories in the NFL: the reclamation project. Three of the early candidates for MVP this season – Sam Darnold, Baker Mayfield and Daniel Jones – are former first-round picks who were discarded by the teams who selected them, only to find success elsewhere with the benefit of a good system and professional experience.Wilson is already potentially in his reclamation chapter, backing up Tua Tagovailoa in Miami. Richardson’s early flashes with the Colts have been tempered by injuries and an allergy to the specifics of the professional game. And then there’s Lance, perhaps the most compelling of them all.Lance was meant to be the future for theSan Francisco 49ers. He fit the mold: 6ft 4in with a live arm and wheels. The 49ers traded three first-round picks and a third-rounder to move up to draft him. Teams don’t traditionally stake that kind of capital on a maybe; they do it when they think they’ve seen the next one.But Lance was always a mystery. He may be the purest expression of the NFL’s Josh Allen hangover – the belief that tools and temperament could overcome inexperience. Lance had started only a little over a season’s worth of games in college, winning a national championship at the lower FCS level before he left for the draft. He threw only 99 passes inhigh school.In college, he played at North Dakota State, a well-oiled machine that runs a stripped-down version of an NFL offense. In theory, that made him more ready than most project-style quarterbacks. In practice, it meant he had barely been tested.Still, the college numbers sparkled: 2,947 passing yards, 30 touchdowns, just one interception; another 1,300 yards and 18 scores on the ground. The 49ers; timing felt right, too. Jimmy Garoppolo was fading from the plan. Drafting Lance was not just a swing for the fences on an unproven prospect. It represented astylistic shift for Kyle Shanahan, the league’s most doctrinaire offensive coach. Shanahan had seen what was happening in Baltimore, Kansas City and Buffalo, and he wanted to keep up. He was looking for a quarterback who could marry together the rhythm-based roots of his offense with more vertical elements on the ground and through the air. Think of the Eagles on their way to the 2023 Super Bowl with Jalen Hurts. Lance, despite his slim resume,fit the bill.It didn’t work. Lance’s rookie flashes were promising, if uneven. By Year Two, Shanahan handed him the keys. Two weeks later, he fractured his ankle and was done for the year. In his place came Brock Purdy. Shanahan pulled the Lance Experiment when it was clear Purdy was more than a fun story, and that he partly offered what the coach was looking for in Lance, but at a fraction of the price.Being a draft “bust” isn’t just about that one player; it’s about the opportunity cost of picking that one player over everyone else. Redraft today, and the Niners could have taken Micah Parsons or Ja’Marr Chase with the third pick. If they’d stood pat in the draft andnottraded up, they could have picked up Mac Jones, Shanahan’sinitial preference in the 2021 draftand now, ironically, the 49ers’ starter while Purdy recovers from injury.Two years removed from his draft, Lance was traded to Dallas for a fourth-round pick – a rounding error compared to the fortune the 49ers spent to get him. He barely played. When he did, he looked frazzled, unable to rev up to the speed of the league. In his final preseason appearance with the Cowboys, he threw five picks. Then, this past offseason, he signed a one-year, $6.2m deal with the Chargers to back up Herbert and put himself through Jim Harbaugh’s Quarterback Finishing School.So far Lance has earned $36m in his NFL career – that means he has cost his teams a little over $7m per start. But if ever there was an ideal spot for Lance to develop, learn and become an asset rather than a dead weight, it’s the Chargers. Sitting behind Herbert, there is no pressure on him to perform, unless there is an injury. Harbaugh is one of the best developers of quarterbacks of his generation. Harbaugh can X and O with anyone. But like O’Connell, he understands that the development goes beyond the field. A year in Harbaugh’s kitchen could put Lance in poll position to be the next man up this offseason.Jim Harbaugh hyping up Trey Lance. Football is so back.pic.twitter.com/iCaz7nOqGhhttps://t.co/90DNZlTljH— Ari Meirov (@MySportsUpdate)August 1, 2025The league’s mistake wasn’t in seeking quarterbacks who could make magic. It was the belief that post-snap magic could serve as a cure all. Mahomes, Allen, and Jackson break defenses not because they color outside the lines, but because they’ve also mastered the subtleties of the position. They follow the script for 80% of snaps, then improvise on the remaining 20%. The NFL, seeing the fireworks, discounted the foundation.Lance is a telling case. The Niners looked at his upside and moved on when it became clear how long it would take for him to be even a competent starter, if he ever could reach that level. They dealt away a young player partly due to his on-field struggles, but also to clear the decks for Purdy.The pendulum is swinging back. Chasing the upside is exciting. But Darnold, Mayfield, and Daniel Jones have proven there’s value in experience – in having an adult in the room. They know how to get in and out of the huddle. They’ve seen every defense. They know where the blitz is coming from. They can change protections, get everyone lined up and ensure the operation runs smoothly. That, at minimum, is the job. But this season, they’ve been more than caretakers; they’ve been difference-makers.Finding the next Darnold or Mayfield is the latest trend. The Jets took their own swing this year, signing Fields after he showed signs of life in Pittsburgh. He fit the model as a former first-rounder who washed out early for a poorly run franchise. But despite a solid outing against Cincinnati last week, Fields doesn’t look like he has the goods.There will be others down the line. Richardson is the most likely. Bryce Young, maybe. Caleb Williams, if the Bears remain lost in the wilderness. Even Trevor Lawrence, if Jacksonville tire of waiting for his potential. Maybe it’s Mac Jones, who was hung out to dry in New England after a solid rookie season. Jones has turned his career around with the Niners, filling in admirably in place of an injured Purdy. He has shown enough this season that there will be interest on the trade market this offseason, though San Francisco will not give him away lightly.From his draft class, Lance has become the forgotten man. Fields and Mac Jones have had a shot to start again. Lance is still waiting. His last meaningful snaps came this preseason, when he scrambled through the Hall of Fame Game and threw two touchdowns. “He hasn’t had a lot of game experience,” Harbaugh said afterward. “We’re trying to give him that, and he acquitted himself well.”Lance is still just 25, younger than Saints rookie Tyler Shough, Bo Nix and Michael Penix Jr. “Twenty-five years old. Just in life, that’s the fat part of the bat. For a quarterback, that’s the fat part of the bat,” Harbaugh says of Lance.The NFL has a way of crushing careers. You’re either the guy or you’re not. But the truth is that careers are rarely linear. Alex Smith took nearly a decade to find the right spot. Geno Smith disappeared, then resurfaced as a quality starter in Seattle. Mayfield was playing scout-team edge-rusher in Carolina before he became the Bucs franchise starter.Lance showed Harbaugh enough in the preseason to win the Chargers’ backup job. He’s played a handful of mop-up snaps this season. If he’s needed down the stretch, he could play himself into a starting role elsewhere next year. Even a year on the bench, working with Harbaugh, offers more stability than he has had since college. He has struggled in the pros, but there’s an interesting player buried somewhere under the rubble.Picking him up as the next reclamation project this offseason would be a nice win for someone.Explore more on these topicsNFLUS sportsLos Angeles ChargersSan Francisco 49ersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It has now handed over 15 bodies.Israel says Hamas has been too slow to hand over the remaining bodies of hostages still inGaza, while Hamas says it will take time to locate and retrieve all of the remains.Families of some of the hostages are desperate to provide a proper burial for their loved ones and fear their remains will be lost for ever beneath the ruins of Gaza.Thousands of Palestinians believed to be dead are still missing amid the vast destruction.Thedispute over the recovery and handover of bodies of hostageshas been one of the difficulties complicating US President Donald Trump’s plan to end the Gaza war for good.Major obstacles still lie ahead, including the future administration of Gaza and the demand for Hamas to disarm. At the same time, the sides have beentrading blame for violating the truce. From Tuesday into Wednesday, Israel retaliated for a Palestinian attack on its troops, which left one soldier dead, with bombardments that Gaza health authorities said killed 104 people.The Gaza health ministry said 46 children and 20 women were among the 104 people killed in the airstrikes. Israel said its strikes had targeted dozens of militants.Witnesses said Israeli planes carried out 10 airstrikes in areas east of Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip, while tanks shelled areas east of Gaza City in the north before dawn on Thursday. No casualties were reported.The Israeli military said it carried out “precise” strikes against “terrorist infrastructure that posed a threat to the troops” in the areas of Gaza where its forces were still deployed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We and our emergency services colleagues remain at the scene and we have launched a full joint investigation into the circumstances surrounding the incident in parallel with the AAIB.“As part of our investigation, we’d ask for anyone with information to get in touch. If you were in the area at the time and saw the events unfold, please contact us. We are particularly keen to hear from those with footage of the helicopter leading up to the crash.”Emergency services were called to Ings Lane, Bentley, at 10.15am on Thursday. Police initially said a number of people had been injured including a man, 70, who had sustained serious injuries. They later confirmed that this man died at the scene.South Yorkshire police said: “Ings Lane is closed while we respond to this incident. Please avoid the area and plan an alternative route where possible. Further updates will be provided when they are available.”Ed Miliband, the MP for Doncaster North, said it was “devastating news” and his “thoughts are with the family and friends of the victim of this terrible incident”.He said his office was in touch with the relevant authorities “and I know the whole of Doncaster will be united in having the victim in their thoughts today”.According to reports, it is believed the helicopter was being used for a private flight that took off from Retford Gamston airport shortly before it crashed. Based on photos, it is believed to belong to Kuki, a helicopter flight school that flies out of Gamston.A spokesperson for Retford Gamston airport confirmed that the aircraft belonged to an onsite tenant and had been involved in an incident.Analysis of the helicopter’s flight path showed it leaving the airfield at about 10am and flying over Doncaster for around seven minutes before stopping suddenly near Bentley.A witness, Lee Needham, who lives in the area,told the BBCthat the helicopter came down close to houses, train tracks, industrial units and electrical pylons. “Whoever was piloting the helicopter more than likely saved numerous lives,” he said.Another witness, Rick, told theYorkshire Posthe “didn’t see it come down but there is a chance he [the pilot] managed to steer clear of all the houses”, while another who lived at the end of the lane near railway lines said all the neighbours “thought it was a train crash” and that the helicopter narrowly missed their houses.Explore more on these topicsSouth YorkshireAir transportEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Some of the property was sold on and has not been recovered.His father, Leslie Gomm, 62, of Fulham, west London, previously pleaded guilty to handling stolen goods for his son’s benefit and was given a one-year conditional release on Thursday. He had been in custody for three-and-a-half months before his sentencing.The prosecution said Gomm did not know the studio was being burgled.Police charged the burglar after examining data from his GPS ankle tag and DNA at the scene, Andrews told the court.Judge Barklem sentenced Middleton-Gomm to 32 months in prison and said: “You were actually wearing a GPS tag that was part of your licence conditions when you were carrying out these offences.”The court heard Middleton-Gomm has 39 previous convictions involving 83 offences, including several house burglaries. The judge added: “Your appalling previous record is of course a serious aggravating factor”.Kathleen Mulhern, defending Middleton-Gomm, said her client had a “significant fall” in 2023 that caused injuries to his spine and pelvis and lasting pain that is treated by a “quite strong” painkiller.The judge confirmed the fall happened “while running away from police, resulting in a metal pole in his back”.Middleton-Gomm had pleaded guilty to two counts of burgling Hirst’s riverside studio.He was also sentenced for two house burglaries on 9 July and 17 July, as well as the attempted burglary of a property on 9 July.The Bristol-born, Leeds-raised artist Hirst came to attention in 1988 when he was a student at Goldsmiths, University of London, where he conceived and curated the group exhibition Freeze.He won the Turner prize in 1995 for work that included his formaldehyde-preserved cow and calf, calledMother and Child, Divided.Lord James Timpson, the minister for prisons, said in a statement released after the hearing: “Our GPS tags send a clear message to offenders: if you break the law, we’ll know where you’ve been and justice will come for you.”More than 22,000 offenders and defendants were wearing an electronic tag as of September 2025.The government plans to tag thousands more criminals during the next three years as part of its policy changes.Explore more on these topicsLondonDamien HirstEnglandCrimenewsShareReuse this content"

His election victory last year effectively ended both prosecutions and left him spoiling for revenge.In the second week of his second presidency he had already directed the removal of top leaders of the Department of Justice (DoJ), the authors write, and “his lieutenants at the White House and DoJ dramatically turned up the heat at the FBI”.Bove, a lawyer who defended Trump in the two federal criminal cases and was on his legal team during hisNew York hush-money trial, was now acting deputy attorney general (he has subsequently been appointed as a federal appeals court judge).Bove told the acting director of the FBI, Brian Driscoll, and his deputy, Robert Kissane, that he wanted a list of agents from the Washington field office who took part in the investigations into the 6 January 2021, insurrection and the classified documents case.“‘We need to do a DoJ review,’ Bove told them, and said it was possible some agents would need to be fired,” the authors report.Driscoll resisted, saying he did not want to provide such a list and did not understand why the justice department needed to review them, pointing out that the FBI had its own internal mechanisms to deal with potential misconduct.But Miller, who has been described as the most powerful unelected person in America, had other ideas. Leonnig and Davis write: “On the evening of Tuesday, January 28, Bove took several calls from Trump’s deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, who had assumed the role of exacting the president’s revenge and delivering the fearsome new headlines to please both Trump and his supporters.“Miller said he had talked with [FBI director nominee Kash] Patel, who was anxious to see more ‘targeted’ officials at the FBI removed from their jobs, to match how swiftly DoJ was firing prosecutors. Patel essentially wanted the FBI firings to happen faster. Miller had pressed Bove to get it done, saying he agreed, according to later reports of Bove’s account.”The following morning, Bove informed Driscoll and Kissane about Patel’s wish and Miller’s order that key FBI personnel who authorized the January 6 and Mar-a-Lago documents investigations be dismissed. Driscoll and Kissane then told the executive assistant directors that mass firings were on the way.“For most, it felt like the world was spinning,” the authors write. “They were career agents, not political followers of one administration or another … They would never mention their political views at work, but this was a Republican-leaning group. One director thought to himself: ‘Hell, several of us voted for Trump.’”On 30 January, after Patel had told his Senate confirmation hearing that he was unaware of any discussions about politically motivated firings at the FBI, Bove again pushed Driscoll and Kissane to provide a list of names of agents involved in the January 6 and Mar-a-Lago cases.Again Driscoll refused, the book continues, citing the bureau’s longstanding practice of protecting agents’ anonymity. “‘I can’t believe you’re fighting me,’ Bove said, sounding insulted.“‘This is people’s careers, and they didn’t do anything wrong,’ Driscoll said.“Bove at one point asked for a far more limited set: how about they start with the names of every FBI agent who had been part of the search of Trump’s bedroom in Mar-a-Lago?“‘I just need a list to cut,’ Bove said, frustration rising in his voice. ‘I just need five or six names because Stephen Miller is breathing down my neck.’”Leonnig, a former Washington Post reporter who is now a senior investigative correspondent at MSNBC, andDavis, an investigative reporter at the Post, observe: “Bove was acting and talking like a man under significant pressure to deliver some scalps to the White House. But Driscoll wasn’t budging. And an increasingly angry Bove wasn’t giving up either.”On 31 January Bove sent Driscoll a memo entitled “Terminations” demanding that he fire seven specific senior leaders and, by Tuesday, 4 February, turn over a list of all agents and supervisors involved in the January 6 investigation.The executive assistant directors left at the end of the week, taking a combined 150 years of FBI experience with them. “When Bove’s deadline arrived at noon on Tuesday, Driscoll had arranged to send him a list of agents – but instead of names, he provided employee ID numbers. Bove was furious. The same day, the FBI Agents Association filed its suit to stop the release of agents’ names.“‘Thisfeels like a resistance,’ Bove said.“‘Because it is,’ Driscoll answered.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpFBInewsShareReuse this content"

It also has a high thermal emittance, meaning it effectively dissipates heat to outer space when the sky is clear. Its properties are known as passive radiative cooling.Hot in the city: can a ban on dark roofs cool Sydney?Read more“The paint, even during the day when the sun is out, can be cooler than the air around it,” said the study’s lead author, Prof Chiara Neto of the University of Sydney.The coolness of the painted surface also means that vapour from the atmosphere readily condenses on its surface – similar to dew forming overnight on a car.“This material is able to extend the period over which dew can form by at least a couple of hours,” Neto said. “Instead of having dew forming only … say, four to six hours on a good night, you can extend that to eight or 10 hours.”Sign up to get climate and environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a free newsletterIn a study, published in the journal Advanced Functional Materials, the researchers tested a prototype for six months on the roof of the Sydney Nanoscience Hub, pairing the cool paint with a UV-resistant topcoat that encouraged dew droplets to roll down into a receptacle.As much as 390 millilitres per sq metre per day could be collected for about a third of the year, the scientists found. Based on that water capture rate, an average Australian roof – about 200 sq metres – could provide up to 70 litres on days favourable for collecting dew, they estimate.“It would complement existing provisions of water, whether that be the grid or rainwater,” Neto said, suggesting the system could be used in buildings in remote locations, or where there was little access to groundwater.“The cooling aspect and the water go hand in hand when we talk about impact,” she said.View image in fullscreenProf Chiara Neto and Dr Ming Chiu with an aluminium panel coated in water-based cool roof paint.Photograph: Chiara Neto/University of SydneyView image in fullscreenDiagram showing how water is captured.Photograph: Chiara Neto/University of SydneyIn well-insulated buildings, a 6C decrease in roof temperature “might result in a smaller fraction of that cooling being reflected in the top level of the house”, Neto said, but greater temperature reductions would be expected inmost Australian houses, “where insulation is quite poor”.She said the coating could also help reduce the urban heat island effect, in which hard surfaces absorb more heat than natural surfaces, resulting in urban centres being1C to 13Cwarmer than rural areas.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Its organic form, methylmercury, is particularly dangerous to unborn babies and can move through the food chain building up in insects, fish and birds.Britain is lagging behind the rest of the world on phasing out mercury dental fillings, with 43 countries having already banned mercury amalgam, including the EU, Sweden, Norway, Tanzania, Uganda, Indonesia and the Philippines. Northern Ireland will outlaw mercury fillings from 2035 but no such ban is planned in the rest of Britain.According to new analysis by the Rivers Trust and Wildlife and Countryside Link, more than 98% of fish and mussels tested in English rivers and coastal waters contain mercury above safety limits proposed by the EU, with more than half containing more than five times the recommended safe level.“Mercury can have really detrimental impacts on wildlife and is known to build up in the food chain, affecting species from fish and otters to buzzards,” said Dr Rob Collins, director of policy and science at the Rivers Trust. “With almost all fish in English rivers and coastal waters above proposed safety levels, the government needs to speed up action on mercury pollution.”Mercury from dental fillings enters the environment mainly through crematorium emissions, which release vaporised metal into the air when people with amalgam fillings are cremated. The mercury then settles on land and washes into rivers and seas.View image in fullscreenThere is concern about the levels of mercury in fish and shellfish, such as mussels.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianAccording to Environment Agency data, crematoriums are the second-largest source of mercury emissions to air after fuel combustion. Power stations contribute about 846kg mercury emissions to air, followed by crematoria, with 593kg, road transport, 228kg, domestic combustion, 194kg and cement processes, 140kg.“Banning mercury fillings is an easy and cost-effective way to cut pollution, helping to make our rivers cleaner and boost struggling wildlife,” said Richard Benwell, chief executive of Wildlife and Countryside Link. “A global deal will be on the table in November – the UK should stop dragging its heels and commit to a phase-out.”At the upcoming Minamata convention on mercury in November 2025, governments will debate a global phase-out of dental amalgam by 2030. African nations including Botswana and Burkina Faso are leading the call, while UK groups are urging Defra to support the proposal and bring forward Northern Ireland’s 2034 timeline to match.But the British Dental Association chair, Eddie Crouch, said: “Dental amalgam is tried and tested material and pulling the plug without a transition period would effectively bankrupt NHS dentistry. Amalgam separators are already in use in every dental practice in Britain to manage this risk. We would encourage crematoria to make use of available technology to do the same.”Campaigners say the financial justifications for keeping amalgam are outdated. Mercury fillings have already been restricted for pregnant women and children owing to developmental risks, and countries such as Germany have replaced them with safer alternatives at only marginally higher cost, they say.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

In 2024, 253 of 338 crematoriums took part, and many now used full abatement systems, cutting emissions well beyond Defra’s 50% target set in 2012.Birkinshaw said the FBCA was awaiting updated guidance “expected to require all crematoria to abate all their mercury emissions within three years of publication”, adding that the sector was “committed to reducing this harmful emission in the shortest time possible”.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentPollutionDentistsnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s hard to fathom how a peaceful protester can receive more prison time than many of theinsurrectionistswho tried to overturn an election,” said Trevor Stankiewicz, researcher at Climate Rights International.“Punishing peaceful protest out of proportion has a chilling effect on free speech and basic rights … You can’t imprison your way out of the climate crisis,” Stankiewicz.Smith pleaded guilty to a lesser charge and served a 60-day sentence.She was also sentenced to 24 months of supervised release, as well as 150 hours of community service and fines totaling $4,062. Smith was barred from entering Washington, and from all museums and monuments for two years.Martin did not accept a plea deal and was found guilty on both counts after a four-day trial.Climate activists see the jail sentence as part of a broader judicial crackdown on climate and environmental activists in the USand across the world,as governments accused of failing to take action to curtail climate catastrophe increasingly target those protesting.An investigation by the Guardian last yearfound fossil fuel lobbyists were involved in drafting US state laws to impose harsher penalties on nonviolent activists protesting against the expansion of fossil fuels.Martin and Smith have said that the action was not intended to harm the artwork, rather to confront what they see as the US refusal to tackle the escalating climate crisis.“When I was asked to do this action, it was a no-brainer. I come from an art background and the little dancer is so beautiful and she represents the children of the world that are under major threat because of the climate emergency. So, I could not resist the opportunity to turn her beautiful, vulnerable, symbolic self into a message [against] fossil fuels,” Martin said earlier this year.“This verdict sends a strong message to the thousands of people who come to DC each year to demonstrate and be heard,” said Edward R Martin, a US attorney in Washington, in April. “Free speech is a constitutional right. But when you take illegal action, such as causing damage to an art exhibit at the National Gallery, you are crossing a line … we will not tolerate anyone defacing our city to get attention for their cause.”Prosecutors had sought a five-year sentence for Timothy Martin.In sentencing, Judge Amy Berman Jackson gave Martin credit for time served, and said he should be released in 12 months. He must also pay $4,250 in restitution, serve two years of supervised probation and complete 150 hours of community service – 20 hours of which must involve cleaning graffiti.Explore more on these topicsWashington DCClimate crisisLaw (US)ProtestArtnewsShareReuse this content"

His partner, Ann Newman, paid tribute to him on Thursday as donations to help pay for his funeral flooded in.“We are heartbroken to announce the tragic loss of our beloved Wayne Broadhurst, a hardworking man who dedicated his life to serving his community through his work in waste collection,” she said, adding that his life had been “tragically cut short during a completely unprovoked knife attack”.Since the fundraiser was launched on Wednesday, more than £36,000 has been raised, which Newman said would go towards funeral costs, support for his relatives and “helping to honour his life in the way he deserves”.She said: “No one ever expects to face something like this. Thank you for your kindness, generosity and support as we come together to remember Wayne and celebrate the love he gave to so many.”Broadhurst worked for Greener Ealing, which operates environmental services for the borough’s council. On Wednesday its managing director, Katarina Pohancenikova, said: “Our thoughts and deepest condolences are with Wayne’s family, friends and colleagues during this incredibly difficult time.

They will not hesitate to take such action as is necessary to enforce those boundaries.”The couple are understood to have issued summary proceedings as a faster alternative to substantive privacy proceedings, which can take one to two years. The order also instructs Paris Match to pay the couple’s legal costs.William views the privacy of his family as of paramount importance and has sought to shield his wife and children from media intrusion.The couple was awarded €100,000 (£92,000) in damages in 2017 after a French magazine printed topless pictures of Catherine sunbathing on a private terrace. A French court ruled the images used by Closer – taken as the couple holidayed in Provence in 2012 – had been an invasion of their privacy. The royals are understood to have donated the money to charity. The judge also fined Closer’s editor and owner €45,000 each – the maximum amount allowed.Explore more on these topicsPrince WilliamCatherine, Princess of WalesMonarchyPrivacyFranceMagazinesEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

As an organisation which works to protect children from people such as yourself we therefore ask you to make a donation to us.”The email, which was signed “Paedophile Hunters”, provided the number and sort code for a bank account and demanded that the man pay the money into it in order to not publicise the allegations against him.The man’s partner later received a text message that said he had to reply to the initial email before the end of the day. The couple decided against paying the money and contacted the police.Thompson told the man she would investigate the matter but instead wrote in her crime report that he did not want to pursue a criminal complaint. She also told “a number of lies” in entries into her notebook, which included falsifying the number used to text the man’s partner in order to hide the fact that it was her own.After this, Thompson sent the man another email with the subject line “I’m so sorry”, which read: “I came to drop something off for my mum and overheard you talking. I never told a soul and never intended to.” The court heard that this was sent as “a further attempt by Thompson to cover her tracks”. She then told the man that his blackmailer couldn’t be traced.When Thompson left her team in 2023, her caseload was transferred to another officer, who, upon being told by the man about the original blackmail plot, found that Thompson had not properly investigated it. When the officer checked the number that the man’s partner had received the threats from, he discovered that it matched the one Thompson had used on her police vetting form. She was subsequently arrested and charged.Explore more on these topicsCrimeSouth YorkshirePolicenewsShareReuse this content"

The official women’s body for the party, Lib Dem Women, have expressed “grave concerns” at both the substance of the announcement and the manner it was communicated. Some Lib Dem MPs are understood to be perplexed at the sudden turnaround.Voting in elections for posts on internal committees as well as the role of Lib Dem president began on Tuesday. Members were informed on Monday that after legal advice the rules governing quotas in place to ensure fair representation of women on those committees were changing.A statement on the Lib Dem website said this was necessary “to make them compliant with the Equality Act 2010, in the context of the supreme court judgment”.The quotas now apply to sex at birth rather than lived gender, meaning women’s quotas now exclude transgender women and men’s quotas exclude transgender men. A party spokesperson said that the changes would include quotas for LGBT+ people including trans people on three larger committees.The Guardian understands that at least five transgender or non-binary candidates will be directly affected by this decision and that one is seeking legal advice.In a letter to the Lib Dems’ chief executive, Mike Dixon, the returning officer David Crowther and the party leader, Ed Davey, the LGBT+ group registered their strong objections, stating: “The party has taken a stance here which is explicitly trans-exclusionary. This is a clear contradiction of the views expressed by the party at multiple successive conferences.”Lib Dem Women have also written to Dixon, reaffirming their commitment to inclusive feminism. Chair Donna Harris wrote: “We stand firmly for the right of all women to participate equally in the party and society.” While acknowledging the legal advice received by the party, Harris added that she believed the response was “disproportionate and unnecessary.”At September’s Lib Dem conference, delegates voted not to debate a motion from the group Liberal Voice for Women that called for a similar rule change to reflect the supreme court judgment.A spokesperson for Liberal Voice for Women said: “We are pleased the party has sought legal advice about diversity quotas following the supreme court ruling. Women are routinely under-represented on Lib Dem committees and it is important places expressly reserved for women do not go to male candidates.”“Whilst we think there are some remaining issues with the quotas, the fact the party has changed these quotas - despite some strong opposition - cements the position that the Lib Dems accept April’s supreme court ruling.”The chair of LBGT+Liberal Democrats, Charley Hasted, said they were disappointed that the party had not explored alternative solutions such as suspending the use of quotas until there was legal clarity.Lucas North, on behalf of Young Liberals, condemned the changes, which they said “were announced on the eve of poll and are in conflict with the clearly expressed wishes and values of Liberal Democrat members”.The MP group is also understood to have been unhappy at the handling of the decision and perceived lack of consultation with the wider membership.Writing in Lib Dem Voice, the MP for Eastbourne, Josh Babarinde, said it was “gut-wrenching” to see how the supreme court ruling was reverberating through the party. “We’ve got to do more to support our trans and non-binary candidates and ensure they feel safe and valued making contributions to public life,” he said.A Liberal Democrat spokesperson said: “Liberal Democrats will continue to champion the rights of trans people and allow them to live their lives free from fear and discrimination. Like all organisations, we’re waiting to see the new guidance from the EHRC. We have urged the government to publish it quickly and provide much needed clarity.”Explore more on these topicsLiberal DemocratsTransgenderGendernewsShareReuse this content"

The defendant’s attorney, TaTaNisha Reed, told local television news stationABC 7 News Detroit: “I was trying to figure it out. Like, am I seeing what I think I’m seeing? Especially with a police officer.”The hearing continued as normal after the revelation and after Jackson had moved the camera.A chief judge and Perkins’ boss at the 36th district courts, William McConico,told 7 Newsthat Jackson was known as a “a very professional police officer”.“I spoke with Judge Perkins, because I wanted to know, you know, what went through his mind with how he handled the case,” McConico said “He was stunned, obviously. He was shocked. Officer Jackson is a person he’s known.”In a statement tothe Detroit News, the Detroit police department apologized for Jackson’s lack of trousers.“TheDetroitpolice department requires its officers to represent themselves in a dignified and professional manner while attending court proceedings,” said Todd Bettison, the police chief. “The involved officer’s actions are not representative of the professionalism of this department and will be appropriately addressed to maintain the public confidence and efficient operation of this department.”Explore more on these topicsDetroitUS policingLaw (US)newsShareReuse this content"

Officers ordered the driver to leave the area, according to the statement.“As the driver began to pull away, the car stopped and attempted to run officers over by reversing directly at them without stopping,” Tricia McLaughlin, the DHS’s assistant press secretary, said in a statement.Democratic contender for Congress indicted over Chicago ICE protestsRead more“An ICE officer, fearing for his life, fired defensive shots at the vehicle. The subject fled the scene and abandoned his vehicle.”The shooting was the second such incident in the Los Angeles area in recent weeks. Last week, federal agents shot a Los Angeles man who livestreamsUS immigrationenforcement operations on social media.Officials said at the time that Carlitos Ricardo Parias, aTikTokcreator with a large following, attempted to ram federal agents’ vehicles after agents surrounded him and boxed in his car. Officers shot him in the elbow while a ricochet bullet hit a deputy US marshal in the hand.In Phoenix on Wednesday, an ICE officer shot at a vehicle that officials had tried to stop. The driver began to drive away and officials said the officer was in the vehicle’s path,ABC 15 reported.The shootings come as the Trump administration attempts to significantly expand its deportation operations across the US. The government is reportedlymoving to overhaulICE leadership in order increase the pace of removals.Meanwhile, conditions in ICE facilities are troubling. The Guardianreported this weekthat US immigration officials are increasingly holding people in small and secretive facilities for days and in some cases weeks, a violation of federal policy. At least 16 people died in ICE facilities betweenJanuary and September.Deportation operations have upended communities across the US, particularly in southern California, where the fear of raids and removal has left residents on edge and in some cases fearful to leave their homes.The homeland security department said in its statement that Thursday’s shooting “was another example of the threats our ICE officers are facing day-in and day-out as they risk their lives to enforce the law and arrest criminals”.“ICE officers now face a 1,000% increase in assaults against them, including cars being used as weapons, and death threats against our agents are up 8,000%,” McLaughlin said. “Let me be clear: anyone who assaults, impedes, obstructs, or threatens the lives of federal officers will be arrested and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)US policingUS immigrationTrump administrationLos AngelesWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

However, experts later argued that specimen, known as the Cleveland skull, was actually a juvenile T rex.Now the study by Zanno and colleagues,published in the journal Nature, revealsNanotyrannus lancensiswas indeed a species in its own right that lived at the same time andinhabited the same ecosystems as T rex.What’s more, the team say the skeleton of a juvenile dinosaur named Jane found in the Hell Creek Formation in 2001 is not a young T rex either but a new species ofNanotyrannus.“Our study suggests some specimens previously argued to represent juveniles of T rexare insteadNanotyrannus,” Zanno said.She said the results had important implications. “For decades, palaeontologists have unknowingly usedNanotyrannusspecimens as a model for teenage T rex to understand the biology of Earth’s most famous dinosaur – studies of its locomotion, growth, diet and life history. Those studies need a second look,” she said.Prof Steve Brusatte, of the University of Edinburgh, who was not involved in the work, said that for many years in his research on tyrannosaurs he had considered a set of smaller skeletons found in the same rocks as T rex fossils to be T rex juveniles.“I think new evidence from this exquisite new specimen in the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences shows that I was wrong – at least in part,” he said, adding that the analysis of the duelling tyrannosaur offered “solid evidence”Nanotyrannuswas real.But Brusatte said he was not convinced there were multiple species ofNanotyrannus, while he also pointed out that the multitude of fossilised T rex adults that had been unearthed suggested there should be fossilised juveniles too.“So I’m not yet ready to proclaim every smaller tyrannosaur skeleton to beNanotyrannus,” he said. “Some of these must be juvenile T rexes, and I think it is ultimately going to be very hard to tell apart adult or near-adultNanotyrannusfrom teenage T rex.”Explore more on these topicsDinosaursFossilsnewsShareReuse this content"

I will never forget the line that I had, but I couldn’t get it out. It was: ‘I’m sure you’ve all grasped the fundamental paradox of precrime methodology.’ That was the line that started the scene.“I remember one of the [crew] coming up and saying, ‘Do you want to go and take a breath of fresh air?’ And I remember thinking: ‘If I go out and take a breath of fresh air, then I’ll be under more pressure when I come back in.’”After 46 takes, Farrell finally managed it. “Tom wasn’t very happy with me,” he said.Three years after the incident, Farrell checked himself into a rehab centre to try to cure an addiction to drugs and alcohol, doing the same again in 2018 as a “preemptive measure”.In his latest film, Ballad of a Small Player, Farrell plays a high-stakes gambler hiding out in the casinos of Macau.Farrell’s character in Minority Report is meant to be entirely sober, but many actors have shot scenes in which they’re meant to be drunk whileactuallydrunk, in an attempt at authenticity.These include Fred Astaire, who shot his “drunken dance” scene in Holiday Inn seven bourbons down; Robert Shaw, who was so intoxicated before filming his key monologue in Jaws that he had to be carried to the set; and Nicolas Cage in Leaving Las Vegas, in which he plays a self-destructing alcoholic.View image in fullscreenRobert Shaw went method during Jaws.Photograph: THA/AlamyBilly Bob Thornton, too, adopted method acting techniques while shooting Bad Santa, about a permanently intoxicated Father Christmas, saying: “I drank about three glasses of red wine for breakfast … Then I switched over to vodka and cranberry juice, and then I had a few Bud Lights. By the time I got to that scene there, I barely knew I was in a movie.”However, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher forged a template for Farrell on the set of the Empire Strikes Back, arriving on set fresh from partying with Eric Idle and the Rolling Stones. “I remember that we never went to sleep,” said Fisher, “so we weren’t hungover – we were still drunk when we arrived in Cloud City the next day. We don’t really smile a lot in the movie, but there we’re smiling.”Cruise, meanwhile, is known for his strict work ethic and sober professionalism. In 2020, leaked audio of the actorberating crew memberson the seventh Mission: Impossible movie for potentially breaking social distancing guidelines went viral.View image in fullscreenHappier days … Cruise at the Cannes premiere of Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning.Photograph: Michael Buckner/Variety/Getty ImagesAdmonishing two technicians for standing too close to each other in front of a monitor in Leavesden, Cruise said: “We are the gold standard. They’re back there in Hollywood making movies right now because of us. Because they believe in us and what we’re doing. I’m on the phone with every fucking studio at night, insurance companies, producers and they’re looking at us and using us to make their movies.“We are creating thousands of jobs, you motherfuckers. I don’t ever want to see it again. Ever!”The actor later defended his outburst, saying that he wanted to ensure that production on the film did not shut down. “I said what I said,” he told Empire. “There was a lot at stake at that point.”In the UK,Taking Action on Addictionprovides links to different support services.

Wall Street estimated that AWS would bring in $32.42bn in net sales in the third quarter, with the company reporting actual revenue of $33bn.“AWS is growing at a pace we haven’t seen since 2022,” CEO Andy Jassy said in a statement accompanying the earnings report.Amazon reveals cause of AWS outage that took everything from banks to smart beds offlineRead moreThe strong third-quarter earnings, which exceeded analysts’ expectations, led the company’s stock to spike up about 9% in after-hours trading.The earnings report highlighted Amazon’s desire to compete with other companies that have managed to capitalize more aggressively on the AI boom. Amazon’s stock has lagged behind some rivals in big tech, and its e-commerce business hasbeen more susceptibleto the effects of the Trump administration’s sweeping and unpredictable tariff policies than firms more focused on software.The tech company, worth some $2.4tn, revealed that it easily beat Wall Street expectations through growth in its cloud computing services. Market analysts had predicted that Amazon would report $1.58 earnings per share and a net sales revenue of $177.82bn. The company reached $180.17bn in revenue and $1.95 earnings per share.AWS has faced increasing competition from alternative providers such as Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure, with the latter’s partnership with OpenAI andreports of strong growthin its cloud business driving up its share price.Yet AWS is still a backbone of much of the modern internet, with an inadvertent show of its power taking place earlier this month when a glitch in the company’s cloud computing took websites, apps, tech products and critical communications systems, such as electronic hospital records, offline. The outageaffected millions of people and lasted hours, underscoring how reliant many parts of everyday life are on Amazon’s products.During the earnings call, Amazon’s executives touted the incorporation of AI tools such as the Rufus shopping assistant into its platforms and services. They also mentioned efforts to grow its Zoox robotaxi business, stating that they would begin testing the autonomous driving service in Washington DC later this year.At Amazon headquarters, the company confirmed plans earlier this week tolay off 14,000 corporate workers, while further job cuts are expected throughout the company. The tech company publicly announced the cuts in a post on its website titled “Staying nimble and continuing to strengthen our organizations”, which referenced advancements in AI and claimed the company wanted to “operate like the world’s largest startup”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The company showed steady financial growth and a strong bottom line despite slow progress onartificial intelligence. The report comes just days after the companyhit a $4tn market valuefor the first time.“Today, Apple is very proud to report a September quarter revenue record of $102.5 billion, including a September quarter revenue record foriPhoneand an all-time revenue record for Services,” Apple’s CEO, Tim Cook, said in a statement. Despite high overall iPhone sales, the company’s revenue in China from the smartphone came in below Wall Street estimates.Cook also forecast 10% to 12% revenue growth in the quarter ending in December, typically Apple’s biggest of the year.The slate of new iPhones, in particular the iPhone 17 and 17 Pro, has reinvigorated demand for Apple’s products, especially in China, where sales had been lagging behind projections. Demand for the ultra-thin iPhone Air remains the subject of speculation, with some analysts saying that the company has reduced production of the device and others asserting it has not.“While the market remains fixated on AI adoption and monetization, Apple proves that the old recipe still works – at least for another quarter – with solid sales growth in its legacy products and services, supported by a better-than-feared global economy, driving solid revenue expansion,” said Thomas Monteiro, a senior analyst at Investing.com.Apple reported $102.47bn in revenue, up 8% year over year, compared with analysts’ estimates of $102.24bn. The company also beat Wall Street’s expectations for its “other products” and services revenue. For iPhone revenue, Apple notched a slightly lower $49.03bn compared with estimates of $50.19bn. In after-hours trading, Apple’s stock rose slightly.John Belton, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, said the positive estimates are due to increasing iPhone sales along with a price increase with the device’s newest model. “The most bullish data point coming out of Apple’s last earnings report was the iPhone revenue number,” Belton said. “The double-digit growth represented the best iPhone growth in at least three years.”The strong revenue comes even as Apple has lagged behind other tech companies in releasing artificial intelligence products. The company has yet to fully roll out an AI product to compete with companies like Meta, Google and Microsoft. Apple has also struggled with the up-and-down tariffs that Donald Trump haslevied on China and India, where the vast majority of the company’s manufacturing takes place.Nevertheless, Apple’s stock has risen over the past few weeks, inflating the company’s market cap, one of only three companies worldwide worth more than $4tn. Both Nvidia and Microsoft have also hit that milestone.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At the time it said the rules, which took effect in January, meant there would be “no nasty surprises” for consumers.The rules forced telecoms firms to set out clear details of any expected rises throughout the duration of their deals.It came after a 2023Guardian investigationexposed “greedflation” in the telecoms sector, with millions of people facing mid-contract rises in monthly payments of up to 17.3%.Earlier this week, Martin Lewis, the founder of MoneySavingExpert.com, said the move by O2 “feels to me a bit like it makes a mockery of Ofcom’s new ‘pounds and pence’ consumer protection regime”.He added: “The worry is, now O2 has opened the door to this behaviour, other mobile firms will feel less worried about following suit.”Ofcom said it wanted customers to have certainty about their monthly mobile bills so they could plan their household budgets, which was why it had banned unpredictable price rises linked to inflation and instead required firms to tell customers upfront in pounds and pence about any increases in their contract.It said: “We are disappointed by O2’s decision. This goes against the spirit of our rules, which are designed to ensure greater certainty and transparency for customers when they sign up.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It has offered tips on its website on how to do this.Lewis said that while all affected mobile customers could leave penalty-free, “we know few will – most will likely just have to suck up a rise that was more than they were told when they signed up”.O2 has been approached for comment. Ittold BBC Newsthat it had not gone against the regulations and that Ofcom’s rules “do not prevent companies from increasing annual price changes – for example, to invest in improving networks”.The company said it spent £700m a year on improving infrastructure, and that customers could leave their contracts without a penalty.Explore more on these topicsO2OfcomTelecommunications industryConsumer affairsMobile phonesnewsShareReuse this content"

The company is thought to be looking to raise at least $60bn.A stock market float would give OpenAI another route to raising cash, supporting ambitions by the chief executive,Sam Altman, to splash trillions of dollars on building datacentres and other forms of infrastructure needed for the rapid buildout of its chatbots.During a staff livestream on Tuesday, Altman was reported to have said: “I think it’s fair to say it [an IPO] is the most likely path for us, given the capital needs that we’ll have.”An OpenAI spokesperson said: “An IPO is not our focus, so we could not possibly have set a date. We are building a durable business and advancing our mission so everyone benefits from AGI.”AGI stands forartificial general intelligence, which OpenAI defines as “highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, it completed a lengthy restructuring process this week thatturned its main business into a for-profit corporation. While it is still technically controlled by the non-profit entity, the move makes it easier for OpenAI to raise capital while also laying the groundwork for an IPO.The deal also gave Microsoft a stake of about 27% in the for-profit company, with OpenAI valued at $500bn under the terms of the deal. News of the restructuring helped push Microsoft’s valuationabove $4tnfor the first time.OpenAI reportedly posted revenue of $4.3bn in the first half of this year, with an operating loss of $7.8bn, according to the tech news site the Information.The massive valuations will do nothing to allay fears that the AI industry is operating in a bubble. Officials at the Bank of England this month flagged the growing risk that tech stock prices pumped up by the AI boomcould burst, saying equity markets were “particularly exposed should expectations around the impact of AI become less optimistic”.OpenAI’s chief financial officer, Sarah Friar, reportedly told colleagues that the company was aiming for a 2027 listing, according to the sources cited by Reuters, while some advisers said it could come the year before.Explore more on these topicsOpenAIIPOsSam AltmanStock marketsnewsShareReuse this content"

One of his goals for the series, he says, is that “what I was wearing would get progressively more interesting”, which is ridiculous because in the very first episode he’s wearing a vivid, asymmetrical shawl that in some places reaches the floor, and he looks like a wizard who might seem chaotic but is actually very powerful.“Sheila [Greenwell, one of two judges, along with Di Gilpin] made that forLa Fetiche,” he says, referring to the avant garde house of knitwear. “Later on I wear some stuff byHope Macaulay, a Northern Irish textiles designer, thenBoy Kloves, right out of Central Saint Martins, then towards the end, two archival Stella McCartney looks.”The traitors got rid of people who probably would have figured it outIt’s not his first modelling rodeo, because who could forget theGillette campaignlast year, which is where many of us first learned the phrase “thirst trap”? But no question, it’s novel to see him wearing so many clothes. He loves being a “blank canvas”, but isn’t considering a second act as a model: “I think I’ve missed the boat – I’m 31.” Elite athletes have bizarre, truncated careers, even the ones who aren’t divers (yes, that is a “trunks” joke, thank you for noticing). But Daley is ready for his next act.Before we get to the wool, fresh in our minds, of course, isCelebrity Traitors, in which he was brutally “murdered” very early on in a tactical move by the traitors to put the heat on Kate Garraway. “They got rid of people who probably would have figured it out,” he says, not even mock grimly, with an athlete’s chagrin that he didn’t medal.View image in fullscreen‘I think I’ve missed the modelling boat’ … Daley’s first outfit for The Game of Wool.Photograph: Jamie Simpson/Channel 4It must be painful to watch the other faithfuls be so rubbish at it, I suggest. Frankly, it was vexing from the start. “Around that first round table, you’re either waiting to be touched or not wanting to be touched. It’s really intense. When I wasn’t a traitor, I was annoyed. You can think, ‘Just play the game and have fun and see where we get.’ But as an athlete, I like to be in control.”He’d also been looking forward to smashing the challenges. “As a viewer, you’re thinking, ‘I don’t really need to see all this.’ But as a participant I wanted to be jumping out of helicopters.” Instead he has had to watch from an armchair while his fellow faithfuls run really slowly and have conniptions when they get sprayed with water. It must be maddening, which would indeed explain this idea: “I think what they should have considered is a resurrection. Bringing someone back from the dead after, like, the first four murders.” Did he suggest that to the producers? “Yes. They said no.”I found The Game of Wool brutal to watch in a different way. Its contours are familiar: 10 contestants, at close quarters, knitting competitively under intolerable time pressure, getting picked off by the judges one by one. It sounds like Bake Off, but knitters are different; they’re sensitive. Holger, a German tailor, is painfully perfectionist and feels each necessary sloppy patch-up job like a blow. Meadow and Isaac point blank refuse to hug anything out. Dipti cries when she sees a dog. Ailsa is so into the story of wool, reaching back through centuries, that you worry she’ll reach the end of the thread one day, and have a terrible moment of “is that it?” Simon, a former soldier turned construction worker, is so people-pleasing you want King Charles to send him a telegram or something: “Relax, everyone already likes you.”Stephanie has a passion for Chelsea pensioners, but off screen, “the thing that she’s known for making is anatomically correct vulvas”. Why does she make those, I ask, the possibilities unfurling endlessly. (Sexual awakening workshops? Gynaecologist training? Corsage for lesbian wedding?) “That’s the amazing thing about knitting and crochet,” says Daley. “If you put your mind to making something, if you can see it, imagine it, you can make it.” Yes, sure, but why? “I can’t pretend to know why.”All the contestants are too pure for this world, which is maybe what drew them to knitting in the first place. It is, paradoxically, very stressful to watch. Yet Daley, who took up knitting just before lockdown because his coach said he had to find a hobby that didn’t involve rushing around all weekend, makes such a strong case for it that I ended up buying his first book, Made with Love, about the basics of knitting and crochet.View image in fullscreen‘Just play the game’ … Daley with Ruth Codd and Jonathan Ross in The Celebrity Traitors.Photograph: Euan Cherry/BBC/Studio Lambert/Euan CherryWhen I meet him in central London, Daley has flown in that morning from Los Angeles, where he lives with his husband, the screenwriter and producerDustin Lance Black, and their two sons, Robbie, who’s seven, and Phoenix, who’s two and a half. Daley doesn’t get jet lag because he doesn’t have time, he says, and the energy comes off him like steam – you can almost see it. He used to bite his nails, and he couldn’t sit still, but craft has solved all that.He started off making a scarf for his mum, and before too long he’d made a wool chandelier. I asked what Black thought about that. “He said, ‘Only you could take something that I suggested as a hobby and make it into something bigger than a hobby.’” It’s no joke, marrying an Olympian, but I was thinking specifically about the chandelier. You start off married to one kind of person, and suddenly they’re festooning your fittings with wool: it’s got to be an adjustment? “Oh, the chandelier was his idea.”Sorry to harp on – and this is my fixation, Tom Daley is too seasoned in the world of contest to ruminate on Traitors – but didn’t it also annoy him, after he’d been murdered, when they used his diving career as a quiz question and got the answer wrong themselves? The group were asked how many dives he’d done in his Olympic career, 96 or 102. “It’s actually 97, because I did a re-dive in London 2012. It’s a question that comes up in pub quizzes because it catches people off guard.” He won’t admit to actual annoyance, but he definitely noticed.After the 2020 Tokyo Olympics (which of course were held the following year, because of Covid), Daley retired in his head, but didn’t say so publicly. He took two years off, then un-retired himself to compete in the 2024 Paris Olympics, having realised he wasn’t ready to stop. Hetook silverin the synchronised 10 metre event, adding a fifth medal to the gold and three bronzes he already had – a record for a British diver – and then accidentally left it in the Olympic village. It had to be sent on after him when he went home. He’s so incredibly competitive, you can imagine him doing that in subconscious protest that it was the wrong colour.View image in fullscreen‘My child refused to get into the water’ … Daley at the Paris Olympics in 2024.Photograph: Sarah Stier/Getty ImagesHe already lived in the US by then – it was an obvious decision, since his husband is American and they had lived in London for the first 10 years of their relationship. But it’s also a vexed decision, in the Trump era, and “it’s just for now, anyway; we’ll see what happens with democracy”. They wanted to get their sons settled in time for elementary school. Robbie isn’t into sport, he’s into Lego and playing the drums, which is fine. Phoenix is the sporty one, “but we took him to his first swimming lesson, and, of course, it was my child that refused to get into the water”. Daley is relaxed about neither child becoming a diver, world-class or any other kind, but they do have to learn to swim. “It’s really important for children. Come on. It’sCalifornia.”It remains plain weird for him not to be a diver any more: “I’ve been an athlete since I was seven years old. There’s always been a goal to strive for. There’s nothing like a sporting goal.” He has no shortage of ideas: he wants to produce TV, and is working up projects with his husband’s counsel (Black has been making films for 25 years). But he’s pretty fixed on bringing knitting back to the masses, getting kids to sit still and be off their phones, and bringing the calm of repetitive action to a world of frazzled adults.A ripping yarn: Olympian Tom Daley opens knitting exhibition in JapanRead more“I think people will be surprised by the nostalgia, and how much it means to someone when you give them something handmade,” he says.

The most recent example is far sweeter than the term “gatecrasher” might suggest: the Lord of the Rings actor Elijah Wood, who surprised a bride and groom during their wedding ceremony in Hobbiton, a set from the films, in Matamata, New Zealand.We last ranked celebrity wedding-crashers a decade ago,by how welcome they’d be at the average wedding; given how often it seems to happen, we’re due another go. In the case of Wood, everyone was screaming, he came in politely and left quickly, and he was the only one not wearing hobbity clothes – so, as gatecrashers go, we can confidently say he was very, very welcome. 10/10.Beyoncé and Jay-Z surprise a brideWhile on vacation in Portofino, Italy,Beyoncé and Jay-Z surprised a brideat her wedding in 2014 and posed for photos with her. But frankly, who the hell wants to stand next to one of the most beautiful women in the world, in a bikini, on their wedding day?

In 2012, John and Frances Canning, who had selected Manchester town hall as their wedding venue, heard the queen was going to be in town on the same day as part of her diamond jubilee celebrations and sent a wedding invite to Buckingham Palace. The palace politely declined on her behalf – andthen the queen rocked up anyway, Philip in tow, and derailed everything with royal pomp.

But the Witcher is preoccupied. The winds of change howl around his thigh boots and perturb the weave of his wig. “Your silence is especially loud today, Witcher,” observes sidekick Milva (Meng’er Zhang), as the Witcher – who, for the purposes of drama/HMRC, is also known as Geralt of Rivia – frowns at another horse. But the Witcher/Geralt doesn’t want to talk about why he doesn’t want to talk. Not because the most recent instalment of the beloved Netflix series with which he shares a name saw his family rent asunder by the forces of darkness (although, to be fair, this probably hasn’t helped). But because the wandering monster-hunter has awoken in season four of The Witcher to find he is no longer being played by Henry Cavill, upon whose mountainous shoulders rested the first three seasons of this unapologetically preposterous fantasy-drama. Instead, Geralt is now Liam “Younger Brother of Chris” Hemsworth, who used to be in Neighbours. In a very real sense: strewth.The metamorphosis clearly weighs heavily on Geralt, who spends the first episode of the new series flaring his nostrils and peering anxiously into the middle distance, as if concerned Harold Bishop might suddenly appear from behind a shrub and club him with a mace. The maverick’s malaise is understandable: Cavill’s are big thigh boots to fill, the actor’s granite-jawed charisma providing an often deeply confusing show with its near-monosyllabic anchor. But now, with Cavill off to brood in pastures new, the final two series of The Witcher (the oversized rubber axe is poised to fall at the end of season five) must look to Hemsworth’s flaring nostrils for their protagonism. How fares the extraordinarily violent fantasy-drama in the wake of such a seismic regeneration, my liege? Let us clamber aboard a faux-medieval horse and head into the rugged wilds of season four to search for clues.The last time we saw Geralt, he was trudging off to search for his adopted daughter and witcher-in-training, Ciri (Freya Allan), who had been rescued from her nomadic kidnappers by hey-nonnying brigands the Rats. Meanwhile, Yennefer (Anya Chalotra), Geralt’s sorceress squeeze, had launched her own search for Ciri, largely via a portal system called, with devastating perspicacity, The Portal System.View image in fullscreen‘They scowl and punch their way through storylines’ … Ciri (Freya Allan), Geralt (Liam Hemsworth) and Yennefer (Anya Chalotra) in season four of Netflix’s The Witcher.Photograph: PRAnd now? The plot continues in much the same vein, with screen time divided more or less equally between Geralt, Ciri and Yennefer as they scowl and punch their way through storylines thick with impenetrable geopolitics, dialogue of the “the north quails before us” variety and mud-spattered extras keen to divest themselves of their intestines.While Ciri finds companionship with sympathetic “Rat”, Mistle (Christelle Elwin),Geralt, Milva and insufferable bard Jaskier (Joey Batey) are joined in their journey east by Zoltan (Danny Woodburn), an amiable dwarf with an explosive beard and wisecracking parrot (sample quip: “asshole”). Elsewhere, there are rumblings of more and worse wars, as dastardly Nilfgaardians point at maps and ferrety mages scheme in candlelit vestibules.The tone remains wildly uneven, lurching as it does between steeple-fingered Game of Thrones-y glumness and those early-90s Saturday afternoon series in which an uncommunicative hunk wanders between small communities, rescuing imperilled innocents from baddies while learning about the true meaning of friendship. Similarly uneven is Geralt II’s accent. Poor Geralt II’s accent. “He hasn’t been the same since his injuries,” warns Jaskier with no little understatement as his companion’s vowels once again escape their restraints and make for Erinsborough. Our hero does his best to compensate by mumbling incomprehensibly while making his nostrils flap like enraged windsocks. “Grrrnnngh”, he says. “Grrrnnngh destiny rrmmph.” Alas, no amount of wounded grunting can detract from the fact that Hemsworth, bless his pleather britches, is no Henry Cavill.While his predecessor invested Geralt I with a gruff likability, Geralt II is less “valorous man-mountain grappling with responsibilities beyond our ken” and more “bollard in a wig”. Will fans embrace this lunkish scowler? It’s still early days, of course, but whether The Witcher will survive the replacement of its brooding load-bearer remains to be [unintelligible grunting].The Witcher season four is on NetflixExplore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewFantasy TVreviewsShareReuse this content"

One wonders if they should have kept the temporary moniker, which befits the show better than its actual title; though I Love LA does go to Erewhon, it’s less a love letter to the city, nor a portrait of its precarious creative class, than a glossy, prestige brand bet on Sennott, an internet It Girl with a distinctly modern indistinction between actor and celebrity, and the popular, chaotic, very online sensibility that she embodies.Down Cemetery Road review – Emma Thompson is magnificent in this thriller from Slow Horses’ creatorRead moreThe logic of the project flowed downhill: Sennott, one of the few internet-bred comedians with real movie mettle (see:Shiva Baby,I Used To Be FunnyandBottoms), given eight whole episodes; HBO, continually losing younger viewers to YouTube, appealing to extremely online zillennials; the chattering class, starved for a truly good young-adult comedy – FX’sAdults, released earlier this year, didn’t cut it – eager for a successor to the messy, self-absorbed and totally absorbing women of Sex and the City, Girls and Insecure. All can agree: nothing gets people talking like a confident and maddening woman on TV.Sennott’s Maia certainly fits the bill, at once compelling and insufferable. We meet her on her 27th birthday in Girls-esque fashion – during unremarkable sex with her boyfriend – with a west-coast twist (She’s so laser-focused on her own pleasure that she blithely ignores an earthquake. Also, it’s 7am.). An aspiring talent manager living in Los Feliz, she’s a distinctly Sennottian blend of contradictions, for better and worse – at once hyper-self aware and delusional, histrionic yet dead-eyed, overtly sexual but girlish. She stretches her vowels like taffy, singes the end of every sentence with vocal fry, over-gesticulates as if perpetually before front-facing camera.At her best – usually, in short videos or scene-stealing line deliveries, Sennott’s teetering balance of clownish self-deprecation and cool-girl deadass-ness is sublime; I could watch one18-second biton LA, in which she twirls like a deranged Siren – “you don’t have an eating disorder? Get one, bitch!” – on an endless loop. Maia is a more jarring creation, whose deadpan petulance blurs the line between provocatively annoying and off-putting; like Meg Stalter, another internet-bred comedian recently given star billing in Lena Dunham’smiddling TV return, Too Much, Sennott attempts to ride a shtick designed for the quick hits and attention deficits of the internet through episode-length television. There’s turbulence – it takes several episodes for Maia to downshift from sketch trope to character, an initial barrier to entry for a promising series that rewards patience.Like Sennott, Maia and her friends graduated from New York University and settled in LA as part of the city’s upwardly mobile creator class. Charlie (Jordan Firstman) is a celebrity stylist in WeHo’s ruthlessly judgmental gay scene, with a preternatural and cynical gift for social climbing that belies an inner yearning for connection. Alani (True Whitaker, daughter of Forest), is a well-meaning but clueless nepo baby with a made-up job at her father’s production company and an unlimited credit line, the Dionne to Maia’s Cher.Girls gone bad: Lena Dunham’s Too Much is just not good enoughRead moreAnd then there’s Maia’s ex-best friend Tallulah (a stellar Odessa A’Zion), a New York Instagram baddie – her Kardashian-esque cleavage situations become more perilous by the episode – who blazes back into Maia’s life, and the series, like a comet. Husky-voiced, dangerously beautiful and brimming with energy, Tallulah has theje ne sais quoiquality of a star. (So does A’Zion, already gathering buzz for her starring turn opposite Timotheé Chalamet in the upcoming Marty Supreme). Maia, naturally, becomes her manager.The business of internet celebrity, and the navel-gazing world of Hollywood, is a tricky combination for a show – social media dynamics, niche, turbocharged and generally uninteresting to those outside it, are notoriously difficult to capture on screen. It takes a bit for I Love LA to find its footing. Earlier episodes have a mechanical quality, a Madlibs of stark lines (“reputations died in 2017”), LA references (Courage Bagels) and zillennial touchstones: Paris Hilton’s Stars Are Blind, the Hannah Montana movie, the casting of Gossip Girl’s Leighton Meester as Maia’s (girl)boss and Josh Hutcherson, of Bridge to Terabithia and The Hunger Games fame, as her sweet normie boyfriend Dylan. (Hutcherson, as expected, makes him endearing.) Loving LA, it seems, means enduring a lot of bluster.But the hooks are there, as are the visuals – it’s refreshing to see a comedy pilot given the artful, emotionally intuitive treatment of director Lorene Scafaria. (Subsequent directors, including Sennott, Bill Benz and Kevin Bray, maintain the lived-in aesthetic.) Midway through the season, I found my usually rigid guard against influencers down – charmed by Charlie’s unexpected connections, pained by Tallulah’s flops, frustrated by Maia’s staggering absorption but nonetheless rooting for her. Tickled by the show’s sharp ironies and increasingly textured portrait of this particular rung on the fame ladder, craving another chapter. The endless embarrassments and boundless opportunities of celebrity can seem, by season’s end, not too different from that of being alive, particularly in one’s 20s. It’s a bumpy ride, but they’re just getting started.I Love LA starts on HBO in the US on 2 November, on HBO Max in Australia on 3 November and on SkyComedyin the UK on 5 NovemberExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewTV comedyHBOComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Opening in Zanzibar in the aftermath of independence, his 11th novel, Theft, spans half a century as it documents the lives of Karim, Fauzia and Badar. We learn how young Karim is treated as “an afterthought” by his mother, Raya, who divorces her much older husband and leaves her son behind to start a new life.Mother and son are reunited several years later in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, where Raya has married a pharmacist named Haji. Karim, who grows up to be handsome, intelligent and more than a little conceited, gets a scholarship to study in the city and meets Fauzia, who is training to be a teacher and is keen to avoid the fate of other “mute daughter[s] laid out for deflowering”.

Generally, the feelings are intense, but the stakes are low; it’s all very formative for the individual character, but it can feel a bit trivial to anyone else. In fact, reading an account of someone’s university days is surely only one or two stages removed from having to hear about the dream they had last night.So my heart initially sank at Heart the Lover’s cover promise that our main character would soon be “swept into an intoxicating world of academic fervour, rapid-fire banter and raucous card games” – good grief, save me from the raucous card games! But obviously the caveat here is what it always is: a good writer will make it matter. I had faith, therefore, that everything would be all right, since Lily King is an exceptionally good writer. Indeed, she could probably write a book-length account of her most recent dream and I would still rush to read it.King is a well-established name in the US, and it’s about time she reached a wider audience over here. In her hands, this story of first love between college kids is vivid, moving and witty. It unspools into a searching exploration of loss, mortality and the inexorability of time. “It’s just this long tender farewell to youth,” the narrator says early on, referring to a short story she has read. King’s novel got me straight in the heart. It hurt.The narrator is not named until the end, although if you’ve read King’s brilliant previous novelWriters & Loversyou’ll know her name already. Heart the Lover is a companion of sorts to that book, both a prequel and a sequel, while also capable of standing on its own. There is just one slightly perplexing reveal – which I won’t spoil – that may feel like a rewriting of history to fans of Writers & Lovers, though I think most readers will be in a forgiving mood.The novel is awash with literary references – and actually it’s a delightWe begin as the narrator meets Sam, and then his best friend Yash, in her senior year of college (let the academic fervour, quick-fire banter and raucous card games commence: the book’s title is a reference to one of these card games). It looks set to be a classic love triangle, but this is not the angle King is most interested in, and what we get instead is a two-hander, a more focused love story. Despite this, the book has a rich cast of background characters, each of whom King presents with precision and care. At the midway point comes a time jump, and the second half of the story presents middle age butting up against the echoes of youthful intensity, with the shifting of relationships and character over time. Characteristically, King pays attention not just to what we lose, but to what we gain.The novel is awash with literary references, and yes, I may have balked at the aforementioned “academic fervour”, but actually it’s a delight: this is a book in love with the experience of reading, precise about the way certain stories and ideas powerfully affect us at particular stages in our lives. “You know how you can remember exactly when and where you read certain books?” the narrator says. “A great novel, a truly great one, not only captures a particular fictional experience, it alters and intensifies the way you experience your own life while you’re reading it.” King maintains a lovely balancing act: she is an unapologetic English major (a type as much as a biographical feature), but her books, tightly plotted and compulsively readable, are for everyone.The first half might be seen as a “young” book, excellent on the intensity and desire and energy of youth. It then becomes a grown-up novel: wearier, more poignant, and yet still – and this is not a decision every writer would have made – hopeful. The arc of the story suggests bleakness, but the delivery resists it. To say farewell to youth, according to King, is not to say farewell to love, or to hope. “Isn’t love a form of hope?” the narrator asks at one point. We may be left feeling melancholy at the end of Heart the Lover, but, crucially, we are not disheartened.Havoc by Rebecca Wait is published by Riverrun.Heart the Lover by Lily King is published by Canongate (£18.99).

Yet, ironically, it seems as if thisRoyal Shakespeare Company production from 2013has not aged well itself.Wendy (Hannah Saxby) is the protagonist here, grieving for a young dead brother who she seeks to find and bring back from Neverland. Despite the reframing, she remains strangely tame, duly playing at being “mother” to the Lost Boys, full of uncertainty, self-deprecation and guilt for most of the play. So, when she suddenly decides to form a sisterhood with Tink (Charlotte Mills) and Tiger Lily (Ami Tredrea) – “let’s go kick some pirate bum” – it comes from nowhere, and feels thoroughly latched on. Mrs Darling (Lolita Chakrabarti) is also given more agency, wresting freedom in her marriage and talking of the Suffragettes, but it is rather removed from the main drama.Peter Pan (Daniel Krikler) is given his own inner crisis that looks strangely like hormonal desire. He seems much more a teenager than a boy and has the urges of one too, clearly hot-crushing on Wendy, offering her shy kisses and calling her “babe”. It sits oddly within the story of a boy who refuses to grow up: this one seems as if he is losing that battle and it is icky to witness.According to the programme, the production has been “developed and expanded over the years”. Directed by Jonathan Munby, it is quite the theatrical monster now, with dazzling lights and a sea of video projections (designed by Taiki Ueda) that saturate the stage in waves. There is impressive aerial work and the Jolly Roger sails monumentally on to the stage more than once.View image in fullscreenBuccaneering … the Jolly Roger in Wendy & Peter Pan at the Barbican theatre.Photograph: Manuel HarlanIt should all arrest the senses but seems like a cheap sugar-rush of spectacle that does not hit the spot. Actors rush around, often shouting or screeching their lines so that they really do seem like adults playing at being children too energetically. The accompanying music, by Shuhei Kamimura, sounds like a generic “buccaneer action film” score and is uncouthly cranked up for every sword fight.There is good movement (choreographed by Lucy Hind) that slows down the frenetic pace; and some minor characters such as Hook’s right-hand man, Smee (Scott Karim), along with Tredrea’s subtly played Tiger Lily, bring some charm along with a dangerously roving crocodile (Harrison Claxton, with excellent physicality).It is not enough to redeem proceedings. Despite the pace, it drags. What might, in its original state, have been radical now appears like a soulless stage juggernaut – a mix of big optics Christmas and pantomime. Captain Hook (Toby Stephens) channels pure panto baddie (while philosophising on ageing) and Tink seems like its cockney fairy. When one character emphatically asks, “They’re behind me, aren’t they?” the pantomime is complete.At Barbican theatre, London, until 22 NovemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreElla HicksonJM BarriereviewsShareReuse this content"

In Elisabeth Gunawan’s Prayers for a Hungry Ghost, for her theatre companyKiss Witness, it is folded in with another staple figure of storytelling: the double. The play centres on non-identical twin sisters and explores, through a supernatural family drama and a mix of theatre, dance, video and puppetry, the dynamics and dysfunctions of the immigrant experience.The girls’ father (Daniel York Loh) has left Hong Kong to forge an apparently successful life in the US, a place where he has never seen so much food. Their mother is absent and unidentified, but seems to haunt the stage in the form of a silent background figure (Tang Sook Kuan) who sometimes shadows the action or helps with props.View image in fullscreenHeads will roll … Elisabeth Gunawan in Prayers for a Hungry Ghost.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianLittle Sister (Jasmine Chiu) is the golden child, integrating into society and ascending its ranks to become a celebrated classical pianist. Big Sister (Gunawan) is the big problem, a discordant foil to her sister’s harmonious trills and turns, unsatisfactorily partnered with a second-rate doctor – a hollow puppet with a grotesque detachable head who sees her as second-best to her unattainable sister – and eventually mutating into a hungry ghost herself, with blackened mouth and distended belly, screeching her agonised poetry.The staging echoes the work’s own themes, using mirrors, shadows and projections, and doubling live and recorded voices until the words feel only tenuously tethered to the characters who speak them. The audience becomes implicated too, occasionally lit or addressed directly, as if to reveal our own ghostly presence in these scenes.The work is part of the Barbican’s theatre development programme, and it feels very much in development: the pacing can be ponderous, scenes are somewhat bolted together and there’s a sense that Gunawan has bitten off more than she can chew. Still, I applaud its guts and vision, one that shows Big Sister not as the problem child but as the child of a situation that enmeshes them all, though she is the one made monstrous by its malfunctions.At the Pit, Barbican, Londonuntil 1 November.

He wants us to feel our bodies in space, to use them to understand the world, each other and the digital realm. It’s a lofty vision that the 55-year-old choreographer has long been investigating through the creation of dance works, but also by collaborating on academic research, working with new technology, and in fashion, film and music such as hit showABBA Voyage.McGregor is an artist, but also an entrepreneur, a man who makes things happen, and it’s fantastic to see a major exhibition dedicated to a choreographer as part of Somerset House’s 25th anniversary as an arts venue. This is no retrospective though. You won’t be guided through McGregor’s three decades of work and you’re unlikely to see a live dancer (members of the company will occasionally be in residence). Instead, there are a series of installations made by McGregor’s collaborators from the technology and design spheres, some of which need the visitor’s own body to trigger them.View image in fullscreenMaking things happen … Wayne McGregor’s Infinite Bodies at Somerset House.Photograph: Andrea RossettiOne of these is the artificially intelligent movement archiveAISoma, developed with Google, where you can record an eight-second dance visualised by a slightly clunky stick figure, from which AI will extrapolate new movement. It’s fleetingly fun, even if the result looks fairly random. The idea is to jog the creative process of a dancer stuck for inspiration. Is it any better than Merce Cunningham’srolling of the dice? Well it’s certainly a lot more expensive. But is this what Cunningham would be doing if he were alive today? Maybe. As a visitor, I preferredRandom International’s Future Self: 10,000 LED lights hanging in a column which light up in response to your movement to make a glittering shadow, as if your spectre’s trapped inside. It’s a poetic effect: we are starlight.Is there enough here, enough “wow” moments, to rock our world (or truly get inside McGregor’s art)? Sometimes idea and process are richer than output – and you can see McGregor’s own neatly written notebooks for a glimpse behind the scenes. There’s also a room of movement-sensitive mirrors, like a clan of miniature paparazzi turning their gaze on you, a 2003 film by director Olivier Megaton featuring a young McGregor that looks like David Cronenberg meets Daft Punk, plus McGregor’s own forays into visual art-making in 3D-printed sculpture – a crouched figure (from his piece Far) glimpsed through the frame of another installation, is a highlight.To see what all McGregor’s conceptualising leads to, in terms of choreographic creation, you’ll need to visit On the Other Earth, the UK premiere of a cutting-edge immersive 360-degree film, watched with 3D glasses inside a black cylindrical screen (15 minutes walk away from the exhibition, on a separate ticket). An hour spent standing in the dark will certainly make you more aware of your own body’s (creaky) sensations, but the effects are undoubtedly impressive, whether digital manipulations or just lifesize bodies up so close you can really see the detail. In the theatre, McGregor’s dancers, barely clad humans in their absolute prime, can seem like perfectly honed machines, “bodies” rather than people, and this closeup view is a corrective to that.Without seeing On the Other Earth, the exhibition alone might feel rather abstract. It’s cool, in both senses: “Oh, that’s cool”, and also emotional distance, despite our physical presence – that’s the paradox in the work. But Infinite Bodies is full of questions and genuinely innovative; the work of a creator brimming with bold ideas.At Somerset HouseandStone Nest, London, until 22 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsWayne McGregorDanceInstallationVideo artArtreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a book that captures not just the hypocrisies of one elite, Thatcher-loving family but the hypocrisies of a whole era, with power and politics bristling beside the hedonistic explosion of 1980s gay culture.Maybe it needs an entire series (as in the case ofAndrew Davies’s TV adaptation), but Jack Holden, whose 2021 playCruisetraversed similar ground, makes a robust go of it here. He arrives at the dark heart of the book while filleting and mixing the order of things so that the timeline of the central three sections is shorter and slicker, but also less intensely lived.The focal point is the ruling-class Fedden family, whose bumptious patriarch Gerald (Charles Edwards) is a newly elected Tory MP, and in whose Kensington Gardens household the middle-class, timidly gay Oxford graduate Nick Guest (Jasper Talbot) becomes, well, a guest.Nick is the observing insider/outsider of this entitled milieu. Talbot – a fast rising star – plays him with a good balance of young-fogey bookishness and sweetly innocent daring. His break-out reflections on beauty, which are key to the story, do not feel jarring on the whole, and his final monologue, in which he asserts the value of beauty as a primary force in his life, is one of the play’s most moving.Michael Grandage brings fantastic directorial polish and pace and the cast are excellent, from Alistair Nwachukwu as Nick’s wryly funny, working-class boyfriend Leo, to Arty Froushan as the uber-rich Wani, who is engaged to a woman but in a secret relationship with Nick. “Are you a poof? asks Cat (Ellie Bamber), the fragile daughter of the Feddens, with unacknowledged offence, before adding: “I love poofs.” As do her family, on the face of it, though this is an age in which the gay community are slyly othered even by those who seem nonchalantly accepting.View image in fullscreenInnocent daring … Talbot with Leo Suter as Toby Fedden.Photograph: Johan PerssonChristopher Oram’s set is light on its feet, seamlessly taking us from the Feddens’ lavish party to Leo’s kitchen table, while the soundtrack – the Communards, New Order, Frankie Goes to Hollywood – captures the synth-edged club culture of the time. It is all engaging, with elegantly executed social satire.But what a lot of story, and feelings, to fit in. Nick’s dance with Gerald’s friend, the “great lady” Margaret Thatcher, comes early so that his devil’s pact with Conservatism seems to come too soon in the wake of his announcing his liberal(-ish) credentials to Leo. And in its portrayals of sex, the play does not quite capture the raw, explicit nature of Hollinghurst’s book. It is somewhat truncated in its love stories too. There is gorgeous chemistry between Leo and Nick, and a more arch electricity when Wani and Nick get together over a toilet cistern and lines of cocaine.But we do not really enter into these relationships fully. So the devastation of the Aids crisis is felt – but not in the gut. Still, something incendiary is built up by the end, when the upper-class snobberies and casual homophobia become clear to see, if not the racism. The strength of this production lies in its deft parallels with The Great Gatsby (a comparison also made when Hollinghurst’s book was published). Nick is not just a Guest but a Carraway figure; not a part of this spoiled, privileged crew but not apart from them either,while the Feddens really are like Tom and Daisy, crashing into other people and moving on without casualties of their own.We hear early on how an MP has caused a scandal by being caught with a young male sex worker. It provides a neat bookend with Gerald’s double scandal at the end, which typifies the venality of the Tory party of that era. But he refuses to see this scandal on a par with Nick’s sexual exposures. “You grasping little ponce,” he spits, and we finally see his bigotry bared.So: a reminder of then, a warning for our age of rising intolerance, and an adaptation well worth seeing.At theAlmeida theatre, London, until 29 NovemberExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreAlan HollinghurstAlmeida theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

The British pop star will perform her fifth album front to back in a series of theatrical venues around the UK next March.West End Girl appears to tell the story of the dissolution of Allen’s marriage to Stranger Things actor David Harbour in chronological order, from her accepting an open relationship against her wishes to finding that the agreed terms have been flouted – although Allen told British Vogue that while it was inspired by her marriage, “that’s not to say it’s all gospel”. The couple are believed to have split at the end of 2024.The album has received widespread acclaim, including a five-star review from the Independent and four stars from the Guardian’s Alexis Petridis, who praised its “boldness and the quality of its songwriting”.The apparent disclosures – whether poetic licence or otherwise – have generated headlines since the album’s surprise release on 24 October. The woman known on the albumas Madeline– a Jolene-style figure – has apparently revealed herself to the Mail on Sunday. The New York City brownstone apartment where Allen and Harbour lived – which they once revealed on an Architectural Digest video – is on the market.In new interviews, Allen discussed how difficult dating had been after the dissolution of her second marriage and admitted that she had been banned from dating app Hinge on suspicion of being a Lily Allen impersonator.Three songs from West End Girl (the maximum possible from an album) are expected to chart in the UK Top 40 tomorrow: in the midweek charts, Pussy Palace was at no 17, the title track at 18 and Madeline at 29.

It’s sensual, visceral and, she says, totally intuitiveThu 30 Oct 2025 04.00 EDTShareAcouple of summers ago I was in a club in Manchester, dancing alone in the dark, when bodies suddenly flooded the dancefloor. Androgynous men and women all dressed in skin-tight, skin-coloured lace. Their lithe limbs and torsos flinched and flickered; they slithered and strutted. They were alluring and unhuman, sexy and weird. I was in the middle of ROSE, an immersive dance collaboration between record label Young and Sharon Eyal, an Israeli choreographer now based in France, who has become one of the most in-demand on the contemporary dance scene over the last decade. In her works that have come to the UK – Killer Pig, OCD Love, Saaba and more – Eyal’s strangely intoxicating choreography taps into the sensibility of nightclubs and catwalks, as well as something much more primal in the gathering of bodies to move as one together.There is something intimidating about these dancers and their distorted bodies, gorgeously confident and coolly aloof; I wondered whether Eyal herself would be intimidating, too. She doesn’t do a lot of interviews. But on video call from her home outside Paris she smiles. She’s a little guarded, enigmatic, hard to get a handle on. Not the kind of artist who wants to explain her work (like Margot Fonteyn, who when once asked about something she’d performed, said: “I told you when I danced it”).“What does it mean to you?” Eyal counters, when I ask about the title of the piece she’s about to bring to London, Into the Hairy. I garble something about textures and murkiness and monsters and creatures (Chewbacca springs to mind, though I don’t mention that). “Amazing, beautiful. You have it all,” she says. Clearly, every answer would be the right answer.The root of it all, really, is music (especially dark, minimal, ravey beats), and all the choreography originates in Eyal’s own body. Born in Jerusalem in 1971, Eyal has been dancing for as long as she can remember, and started lessons at four. “I was a very hyperactive girl. I didn’t sleep, I didn’t eat. It was problematic. And the moment that my parents found dancing, I was much more calm and a better person, maybe,” she smiles. I ask her how dancing made her feel. “I don’t know how to answer this question,” she says. “It’s just, I’m more me. I can be more myself when I’m dancing and creating. I’m not thinking about what it means, just that I have to do it.”Eyal danced with Tel Aviv-based company Batsheva for 18 years, but she was always creating her own movement, always a choreographer. She set up her own company in 2013. Everything you see on the stage starts with Eyal herself improvising, which is then mapped on to the dancers. “I love to give my movement to the dancers and feel their interpretation,” she says. Each movement idea could be slowed down, reversed or repeated – there is a lot of repetition – just as a composer might do with a musical motif. From a small amount of source material, Eyal will play with composition and timing and layering up movement. “The most, most important, is timing,” she says. “For me, timing is everything. It’s almost like a movie for me,” she says, and I picture her in the studio like a director in an edit suite, getting the cuts just right.Caius Pawson, the founder of record label Young, who worked with Eyal on ROSE, told me over email about witnessing her process. “I’ve never experienced anything like it,” he wrote. “No thinking, no rationale, no explanation. It all seems to come from within. Pure heart. She’s open to everything, yet totally sure of what she loves. Precise in her choices but always tender.”View image in fullscreenBody talk … Into the Hairy.Photograph: Katerina JebbPawson wanted to put Eyal’s dancers into a club setting to bring dance’s visceral impact to audiences up close. The company has also performed at Bold Tendencies, the south London arts organisation based in a multistorey car park turned performance space. Eyal’s works are co-credited with her husband and creative partner Gai Behar, who is a former producer of parties and multimedia events on the Tel Aviv club scene. You can tell the couple have spent some time on dancefloors by the worlds they create on stage (Eyal is often pictured with dramatic eyeliner and blurred lipstick, which is a kind of 3am-on-the-dancefloor look), though the dance itself is as disciplined and highly technical as classical ballet.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I want to see the struggle, the fragilityOn the wall behind where Eyal is sitting there’s a large canvas of two figures entwined in an embrace. It’s Eyal and Behar, given to them as a wedding gift. “It’s beautiful, no?” she beams, like someone still very much in love. The couple have worked together for 22 years but it’s unusual for Behar, who isn’t a choreographer, to be co-credited as a dance creator. Yet it sounds as if he’s essential to the work. “His eyes are very different to mine but he has very good taste,” says Eyal. She calls him “the cleaner” because he helps finesse the choreography and focus her ideas, honing the finished dances.Behar is half French, which is partly why they moved here, nearly four years ago. Eyal has also renamed the company, formerly L-E-V, now Sharon EyalDance, or S-E-D. The new works, Into the Hairy and Delay the Sadness, which premiered in Germany in September, are different to the pieces I’ve seen before, she tells me. Something’s shifted. “It’s becoming more precise, more clean, more pure, more minimalistic,” she says, all in order to intensify the emotion. “For me, less is much, much more.” It’s a different chapter, Eyal says. Why, I ask, what has changed? “Life,” she says, and smiles, Mona Lisa-ish.Eyal has talked about the aim of her choreography being “total feeling”. “Total feeling is to be 100% in the moment,” she says, the physical, the emotional, all in. “I think I’m a person like that: when I’m doing something, it’s all my heart.” It’s not just being in your element, she says, it’s becoming the element, the danceristhe music,isthe movement.View image in fullscreenYou want it darker … Sharon Eyal.Photograph: Davit GiorgadzeBut that total feeling isn’t only a pleasurable one. “I don’t like it when a dancer feels very comfortable,” says Eyal. “It’s just not interesting for me. I want to see the struggle, I like to see the fragility, I love to see the challenge.” She wants them to delve into their own darkness. “In the end, I want them to enjoy, and suffer a bit also.” She gives a little laugh. “When you’re going through a deep feeling in yourself, I believe people can connect to it.” When Eyal raves about the music of electronic producer Koreless, AKA Welshman Lewis Roberts, who worked on Into the Hairy, she singles out “the disturbing feeling” of his music alongside its texture, nuance and melody. A comment under one of Koreless’s tracks on YouTube describes his music as being like having a brain massage, and Eyal is very happy with that idea.Eyal often harnesses the power of unison in her works, a couple of dozen bodies moving tightly in sync. “The power of unison is the power of loneliness,” she says, perhaps counterintuitively. “As much as you are in a big group, you become even more alone.” She coaches her dancers not just to dance together, “but really to feel together”. “A lot of times I’m saying to the dancers: you have to feel like you’re looking to the same star, or you’re from the same planet.”Is she thinking about the outside world when she’s in the studio, with these ideas of togetherness and loneliness? “I’m thinking about everything, all the time,” she says. “My creation is not outside my life. But I’m not talking about society and stuff like that. I’m talking about human feeling and physicality and sensitivity. I’m not such a philosophical person,” says Eyal. “I’m intuitive. That’s why it’s very hard for me to describe. It’s really something that’s coming from my urge.”That’s the thing about Eyal. It’s about the doing, not just directing others what to do. “For me it’s also about the dancing itself. I need to move to do it,” she says. And so does that mean as you get older and you change, the movement changes with you? “Yeah. And when I cannot do it any more, maybe I can’t create any more.”Or maybe you’ll be 90 and developing a whole new way of moving? “Let’s see,” she says, happily. “I hope so.”Into the Hairyis at Sadler’s Wells, London, 13 to 15 November;Delay the Sadnessis touring to Azerbaijan, Austria and France in November.Explore more on these topicsDancefeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s about love; I get excited whenever I see something that reminds me of him. I like to buy him clothes in particular – I think it gives him a little confidence boost. Even though I already like his sense of style, it’s my way of showing I care.I earn more money than him, so it’s not a big deal to get him gifts. I know not everyone expresses love through presents, but if I can afford it, why not? But when he doesn’t wear something I’ve given him, especially after I’ve put thought into it, I feel hurt.This summer, I bought him a pair of jeans. But I noticed he wasn’t wearing them, and asked if he liked them. He came downstairs the next day wearing them, saying: “Hey, I’ve got your jeans on!” That made me feel stupid.It felt as if he was only wearing them because I had asked. Part of me felt happy, but another part felt as if he was doing it to shut me up. I don’t expect him to wear everything immediately or to perform gratitude, but when weeks go by and I never see him wearing my gifts, I start to wonder if he liked them in the first place.I want him to look his best, so I have opinions about what suits him. He could look amazing if he upgraded his wardrobeI want him to look his best – so, yes, I have opinions about what suits him. One time, I tried to get rid of his Crocs. I hate them. Axel got really annoyed. Maybe I overstepped a bit. He said I was trying to erase his personality, but I wasn’t. I just wanted him to see what I see: that he could look amazing if he upgraded his wardrobe slightly.Axel has got great style when he wants to, and I get frustrated when he sticks to the same few things out of habit. I suppose that’s because he doesn’t take as much interest in fashion as I do and doesn’t have as much money to invest in his wardrobe.But, from my end, sometimes it’s not about the clothes at all; it’s about wanting to feel that my gestures are appreciated. I love that Axel is independent and stubborn; it’s part of what makes him him. But I also wish he’d see that when I buy him things, I’m just trying to connect with him.The defence: AxelI’ve been single so longI’m not used to people buying me things– and I don’t like being told what to doI think Bella’s habit of buying me things and then getting annoyed when I don’t wear them is unhealthy. No one should be forced to use a gift whenever the giver wants. That detracts from the meaning of a gift, which is supposed to be altruistic.With the jeans, I just hadn’t got round to wearing them because it was very hot this summer.But when she asked if I liked them, I put them on the very next day.Bella then accused me of only wearing them to placate her, which was kind of true. But my thinking is: don’t ask me to wear something you bought and then accuse me of not really wanting to wear it. None of that makes sense.I should be able to choose when to wear my clothes. Bella is being very sweet when she buys me things, but I don’t want to feel pressured. She said I was ungrateful when I brought this up, but it’s really not that.Bella also makes a lot more money than me, and it isn’t a big deal for her to splurge on new items. But I don’t have that many clothes, and I’m used to wearing the same old outfits. It takes me a bit of time to adjust to having new things in my wardrobe.Sometimes if Bella has a good idea, my initial reaction is to refuse to do it, because I don’t like being told what to doI’m also not used to people buying me things, as this is my first relationship. There’s probably also a bit of me being stubborn. When Bella tried to get rid of my Crocs, I didn’t react well.I actually really like the jeans she got me, but sometimes if she has a good idea, my initial reaction is to refuse to do it, just because I’ve been single for so long and I don’t like being told what to do.

Receiving gifts becomes stressful when there are expectations attached. Maybe using the money to do fun things together would bring more of the connection Bella is looking for?Kirsty, 41Axel does seem grateful and is reflective about his reactions, and while Crocs should only be worn at the beach or when gardening, if there is an ulterior motive behind any present it spoils the gesture. Ultimately, it is reasonable for a recipient to enjoy a gift how they see fit.Jack, 24It’s one thing getting your partner to throw away their Crocs, but forcing a whole wardrobe change is a step too far. It would’ve been nice if Axel had acknowledged the gift unprompted, but that is his prerogative. Both of them need to build healthy habits around gift giving and receiving.Sebastian, 28Bella is treating Axel like a Ken doll. He has expressed his feelings clearly, and they should be respected. Can she find other ways of giving him a treat that recognise his preferences? Some concert tickets, perhaps, or a weekend away?Judith, 78Axel should be more grateful for the gifts he receives. Bella’s motivations aren’t entirely pure, but whose are? She’s giving him beautiful clothes and the least Axel could do is deign to wear them.Jenny, 46Now you be the judgeIn our online poll, tell us: does Axel need a dressing down?The poll closes on Wednesday 5 November at 9am GMTLast week’s resultsWe askedwhether Mara should buy new crockery and cutlery24%of you said yes –Mara is guilty76%of you said no –Mara is innocentJoin Guardian journalists atYou be the judge – live!As part of a specialGuardian Live eventon Wednesday 26 November, Georgina Lawton will be hosting an IRL version of this column.

Break away from the ice bucket this winterAs the nights draw in, there’s no reason that the season’s bold, ripe, room-temperature wines need only be red …Hannah CrosbieThu 30 Oct 2025 09.00 EDTShareThe Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.We’ve all heard of chilled reds by now, right? Even so, it was only relatively recently that they became part of our drinking lexicon, and modern British drinkers realised that bringing down the temperature of certain reds by a few degrees made them sing and deliver charmingly pronounced, bright, fresh fruit notes. So much so that I now can’t think of drinking a light French red any other way.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.But what if I told you the same can be true for – wait for it – bold, warmer whites? Common knowledge dictates that we serve all white wine from an ice bucket, chilled to within an inch of its life – it’s just what we do – but in reality that can kill a wine, particularly if it’s a powerful and/or aromatic example. Over- or needlessly chilled wine often prevents us from picking up on much of its aromas and, considering that much of what we taste is what we smell, you’re mostly going to end up tasting an unpleasant mouthful of alcohol and acid.I propose we start enjoying our whites a little warmer than is customary, at room temperature even when we’re sat around a roaring fire. And I can’t think of a better time of year to explore such an approach. Think about what you want from a wine in the autumn and winter months. Do you want it to be higher in alcohol, generous and ripe? In which case I would ask why anyone thinks you necessarily need to drink a red wine to achieve that.So if you fancy turning to a warming, ripe white to keep your insides warm over the colder months, where should you start? Well, it’s a good idea to be aware of the grapes and regions that are likely to yield bigger, bulkier white wines. As we know, the same grape can yield many different wine styles. Chardonnay, for example, can create anything from an enormous, oaky, American-style wine to a linear, mineral chablis. In fact, those wines are often so unrecognisable from each other that beginners often won’t know they’re made from the exact same grape.In terms of chardonnay, you’ll be looking for examples from places with warmer climes. Take the aforementioned US, which has a reputation for powerful chardonnay, or seek out wines from the south of France, Australia and South Africa. That said, all these regions are capable of producing lighter, fresher styles, too, so consult the label before you buy.I’d also keep an eye out for sauvignon blanc from any of those same areas (again, check the label first), chenin blanc from South Africa, and Rhône whites made from marsanne and roussanne for bold, peachy flavours; gewürztraminer is another grape that can offer aromatic, oily cuvées, as are sémillon, viognier and pinot gris (unlike its zesty Italian twin, pinot grigio).Four whites for winterWildstone Roussanne£9.50 Waitrose, 13.5%. Honeyed, aromatic and unmistakably Rhône.Taste the Difference New Zealand Pinot Gris£11 Sainsbury’s,12.5%. I love that we’re seeing more widely available pinot gris.

The cook has the job of getting through that tough skin before finding the tender flesh, and they give off their best only after slow cooking. But it’s worth it. They are great culinary chameleons, able to soak up and marry well with ingredients as diverse as gruyere, chipotle, rosemary, sage and nutmeg. Their smoky, sweet flavours are just right for the season of turning leaves.Confusion reigns, however, about the difference between a pumpkin and a squash. It is a difficult area, and often local usage dictates what is a squash and what is a pumpkin. Both are members of the same family and, although the terms are often used interchangeably, pumpkins are usually the jack-o’-lantern shape we associate with Halloween, with thick, orange skins, while squashes can be smooth, warty, striped, stippled, their skins as green and shiny as old leather books, pale yellow, flame orange or delicate amber. They come in myriad shapes – acorns, turbans, melons and curled, snake-like creatures – and sizes.Each year, I display them before I cook them: a row is lined up on the kitchen table; a great big rougevif d’etampes, a French variety that looks like Cinderella’s carriage and acts as a doorstop between kitchen and living room; little miniature ones with cute names such as munchkin, jack-be-little and baby boo sit among the candles on the mantelpiece. Their flesh, once cooked, can be as smooth as that of avocados or baked quince, the flavour as sweet as corn, or, admittedly, simply bland, if you end up with a bad specimen.The important matter for the cook is to find a variety you like, be it a pumpkin or a squash. The best all-rounder, to my mind, is crown prince. It’s an elegant grey-blue, the sort of colour you might find on a chart of historic paints, with not a hint of the vivid golden flesh inside. The ubiquitous butternut squash always has a sweet flavour and melting flesh, while the chubby, yellow-and-green-striped sweet dumpling and delicata are both excellent for stuffing and baking. Cut off the tops of these little ones and, once you’ve scooped out and discarded the seeds and fibres, fill them with mushrooms, cream and cheese, a part-cooked stuffing of wild and brown rice, dried cranberries and smoked bacon, or chopped cooked spinach and ricotta. Replace the lids and roast them wrapped in foil to stop the sweet juices from running out into the roasting tin and burning.Even if I’m going to puree the flesh, I either roast wedges or saute chunks in butter first, rather than boiling them. You need to drive off about one-third of their moisture to intensify their taste and, anyway, pumpkin flesh loves butter, olive oil and cream; you will seldom eat a low-calorie pumpkin dish.The Italians cook pumpkin and squash in risotto, or mash the flesh, sweeten it with crushed amaretti and use it to stuff pasta. The Belgians cook acarbonnadeof beef and beer in a hollowed-out pumpkin; in south-west France, they roast wedges with goose fat and thyme. In America, there’s an endless list of pumpkin and squash pies and tarts, both sweet and savoury. I love savoury pumpkin tarts filled with salty cheeses – gorgonzola, gruyere or feta. The oldest pumpkin seeds were found in Mexico, and they make one of the most ancient pumpkin recipes,calabaza en tacha, or candied pumpkin, which is part of the Día de los Muertos (Day of the Dead) celebrations. Cooked in brown sugar, orange juice and cinnamon (it’s delicious with star anise, too), it’s sometimes eaten for breakfast.Then there is pumpkin soup. Using a base recipe of chopped pumpkin or squash sweated in butter with chopped leeks and simmered in stock, I turn out endless variations every autumn. Add a good splash of bourbon, scatter the top with smoked bacon and serve it under a melting cheese crust or season with pickle juice, paprika and dill (a gorgeous Austrian idea).I didn’t see a pumpkin until I was about 23, so they are still a novelty to me. I still see the image of the girls in Laura Ingalls Wilder’s Little House on the Prairie books using them as stools to sit on in the attic. American friends, who find pumpkin and squash so mundane, exclaim, “Oh, you and your pumpkins”, but I will always love them. With pumpkins, the only limit is the cook’s imagination.This is an edited extracted from Around the Table: 52 Essays on Food & Life, by Diana Henry, published by Mitchell Beazley at £20.

During this time his stability has provided me with a base to grow and expand in the most wonderful ways. Now I feel suffocated. He is a wonderful person but has no interest in ever leaving his home town to try something new (I’m an immigrant). His only interests are pubs and football and when we go abroad hewants to spend most of his time in the pub, which infuriates me.I have a dream of travelling the world, becoming a writer and living in a van. I treasure solitude and have a very rich inner life. I don’t think I actually want any sort of romantic relationship again. I see past the mundane and genuinely believe that we can live a different, lighter way should we choose. He is very conventional and has no interest in even sticking his head above the parapet. I don’t think this is a “bad” way to live, I just think it’s not the only way to live. I don’t want to be on my deathbed (in hopefully 50 years’ time), regretting missing out on an adventure because I cared for a man. Wewant completely different things out of life.I can’t read anyone’s body language and I feel flirt-illiterate. How do I meet new people? | Leading questionsRead moreHowever, if I leave it will break his heart and mine. He is a good man who deserves a womanwho shares his vision for life. I’m really sad that it can’t be me.Eleanor says:Once when I worked a call centre job, I rang Mr So-and-so looking for Mrs So-and-so. “Not here. Divorced. Moved out,” said the voice on the end of the line. I clapped my fist to my forehead at my desk and apologised profusely. He was unperturbed and laughed reassuringly: “It’s fine! A happy marriage wouldn’t have ended in divorce.”I don’t know if that stands as a universal rule, but you see what he’s saying. It was already bad. That’s why they got divorced. It’s not the divorce that made it bad.When we’re thinking of leaving a good, loving person, it’s easy to go into paroxysms by thinking the decision is basically, “How can I justify doing this terrible thing to them?” Can I unilaterally move them from a great world (loving relationship, everything’s peachy) to a bad world (lonely, heartbroken)? How could I do that to someone so kind?But the truth is he’s already not in the good world. If he’s in a relationship with someone who doesn’t know whether they want to be with him, his world is not currently great. The breakup would hurt tremendously, yes. He would be lonely. And he’d learn those harsh realities about your relationship. But they alreadyarethe reality. They might have been true for a while.I wonder whether deep down you think that too. Your starting question was, “How do I break up with a man who loves me?” not, “ShouldI break up with a man who loves me?” You’re not sure about the decision. But at the same time, when you think about the person he should be with, you say with total clarity, “It can’t be me”. It sounds as though you might have already made your decision.If you want the permission that it’s OK to hurt a good person: it is. It’s actually no favour to stay.People can tell if you’re reserved about being with them. Just as you’re lamenting the life you could have without him, there is a life he could have without you; maybe with someone who thinks romantic relationships are really important, or who loves how much he loves his home town, or who’d eagerly go to the pub when they travel together.I’ve been in a sexless marriage for 35 years. What can I do? | Leading questionsRead moreIf you’re genuinely not sure, though, I get that too. Thinking about leaving can give you irritation goggles, but at the same time you know it won’t just be the irritations that go. When he takes his pubs and his home town he’ll also take the kindness, the stability. Often the annoying bit and the lovable bit are two sides of the same trait; the things about him that make you feel safe could be the same things that make you feel constrained, so that when you lose one you find out how much you valued the other.But if what’s happening is you’ve realised you have genuine incompatibilities but you aren’t sure whether they “justify” the blow of leaving, I think it can help to remember: they’re already true. If you’re not compatible, that’s why you break up. It’s not the breakup that makes you incompatible.*Letter has been edited for lengthAsk Eleanor a questionExplore more on these topicsRelationshipsLeading questionsAustralian lifestyleDatingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The external screen is a smidgen larger thanks to thinner bezels, and the inside and outside screens are slightly brighter than before. The Fold is a great shape when closed for phone-based tasks and can comfortably fit two full-size apps side by side on the excellent internal screen when open.However, the Pixel is heavy and looks chunky compared withSamsung’s impressively thin and light Z Fold 7. It is 258g, which you can feel in use and the pocket, while being significantly thicker than a normal phone and the latest rivals.View image in fullscreenQi2 charging support in the back opens up compatibility with a wide variety of magnetic accessories, including the excellentTwelve South Curve Nanostand (left) and theQDOS SnapStand Qi2 charger(right).Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Fold has the same Google Tensor G5 chip as the rest of the Pixel 10 line with 16GB of RAM and at least 256GB of storage. It performs just as well as thePixel 10 Pro, feeling rapid in use and capable of handling most tasks without breaking a sweat. Those seeking the highest frame rates in high-end games are better served by rivals with Qualcomm’s top Snapdragon chip, however.As with all foldables, the battery life of the Fold varies a lot depending on which screen you use most. On light days with about five hours of active screen use spread equally between the inside and outside displays, mostly on wifi, the Pixel managed about 38 to 40 hours between charges. On heavier days on 5G with more inside screen use, it lasted about 28 hours, ending the day with 25% left in the tank.

Tapping it brings the app back into full view.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Fold runs the same Android 16 software as the rest of thePixel 10 Pro line, which introduces a bold and colourful appearance plus lots of cutting-edge AI tools crammed into almost every corner of the phone.Some of the highlights include the Gemini chatbot, which can see and hear what you do, interact with your apps and is generally quite useful, plus a new real-time translation system for phone calls that replicates the caller’s voice.Magic Cue is the standout feature, which is a little helper that runs in the background on your device, processing your data from various Google apps and popping up with timely information when you need it. It understands context, so when a friend texts to ask about when your flight lands it will suggest your flight details from your calendar so you can paste them straight into your conversation, or when you call a business it will show your order details from Gmail right in the phone app. It is low-key great.It also has a few modifications to make the most of the big internal screen. A task bar at the bottom of the display makes putting apps into split screen easy. You can also resize apps beyond the border of the screen, similar to theHonor Magic V5andOnePlus Open, which adds a bit of flexibility to running two apps side by side.The Fold also comes with a subscription forGoogle AI Profor a year, worth £19 a month, granting access to more powerful Gemini AI models and 2TB of cloud storage for photos, files and email.

Google’s night mode is still the best in the business when it gets really dark. The ultra-wide camera is solid, while the 5x optical zoom telephoto camera can meaningfully close the distance to objects. The latter can be a bit soft on detail in less than ideal light. Just like theregular Pixel 10the camera shoots good photos and video most will be pleased with, but it can’t match thePixel 10 Pro line, which for this price you might expect.The Fold has a few tricks of its own, including various shooting modes using both screens or propped up at angles when partly folded, plus the ability to shoot selfies with the main camera. The handy Made You Look feature shows an animation on the outside screen that reacts when your child looks its way and smiles, keeping their attention long enough for you to shoot a photo, although unfortunately it uses one of the selfie cameras, not the primary camera, so it’s more for fun than a great photo.PriceThe Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold costs from£1,749(€1,899/$1,799/A$2,699).For comparison, thePixel 10costs£799,Pixel 10 Procosts£999, thePixel 10 Pro XLcosts£1,199, theSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 7costs£1,799and theHonor Magic V5costs£1,699.99.VerdictThe Pixel 10 Pro Fold is a minor update to the already good9 Pro Fold from last year, but one that could have a bigger impact down the line. As the first properly dust-resistant foldable it sets a new durability benchmark, slowly bringing the devices up to par with standard slab phones.The inside screen is still necessarily softer than a regular hardened glass to allow it to fold, however, so you must still be careful with it. A fingernail can leave a permanent mark if you press hard enough.The added Qi2 magnetic accessory and charging support is just as good in the Fold as it is inother Pixels. The phone is rapid, has reasonable battery life, runs great software and has the best cutting-edge AI around. The cameras are good for a foldable, too, although can’t match the best normal phones.The Pixel does a great job of balancing being a regular phone when closed and a great tablet when open, but it is fat and heavy compared with the dramatically thinner and lighterSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 7.Pros:a phone and tablet in one, dust and water resistant, Qi2 magnetic accessory and charging, great tablet screen, good performance, good cameras with 5x zoom, packed with AI including Magic Cue, Google AI Pro included for a year, seven years of software updates.Cons:extremely expensive, more fragile and costlier to repair than a regular device, thick and heavy, cameras can’t match regular Pixel 10 Pro, battery life could be better, fewer power-user features than rivals.View image in fullscreenThe Pixel 10 Pro Fold is about the same width and height as a regular phone when closed.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsPixelGoogleAlphabetSmartphonesTablet computersAndroidMobile phonesreviewsShareReuse this content"

He’s been coming here three nights a week for the past 12 years, but even he looks a little uneasy as he arcs his torch like a searchlight against the knotted walls of elm and beech trees which embrace us on all sides, looking so thick that they might be the boundary of the known world.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Marius motions with his torch towards several pairs of slender beech trees, eerie in their symmetry, branches intertwined to form arches – portals or stargates, you might speculate, were you possessed of a particularly febrile imagination. “Many came in here and never came out. But don’t worry,” he adds, turning to me with a grin. “Our tours have a 100% return rate.”Reports of strange happenings here date back centuries – the forest is named after a local shepherd who is said to have vanished in the distant past, along with 200 of his sheep. But Hoia-Baciu came to international attention in 1968, when a military technician named Emil Barnea photographed what he described as a UFO hovering above a circular clearing in the centre of the forest. In the decades since, Hoia-Baciu has drawn yogis, shamans, ufologists and paranormal investigators from across the world, curious to experience the strange energies said to echo through the forest.View image in fullscreen‘Home of Dracula’ … Bran Castle, in Transylvania’s Carpathian mountains.Photograph: Jeremy Woodhouse/Getty ImagesIt may be one of the world’s premier pilgrimage sites for lovers of the paranormal, but the forest is under threat. The western suburbs of Cluj-Napoca – a modern tech hub of more than 400,000 people, described as the Silicon Valley of eastern Europe – are encroaching, and developers are pushing for permission to clear the trees to build apartment blocks. Barring a few hectares home to locally rare Mediterranean oak trees, the forest is not officially protected, but Marius hopes that the company he co-founded – theHoia-Baciu Project– will help to change that, encouraging the authorities to recognise the forest’s value as a tourist attraction. The company offers day and night walks in the forest, yoga sessions, paranormal lectures, treasure hunts and escape games – and even, for the particularly intrepid, overnight camping.As twigs and autumn leaves snap and crunch beneath our boots, Marius recounts some of the folk tales and alleged paranormal happenings here. One famous story describes a five-year-old girl disappearing during a family picnic, only to rematerialise five years later with no memory of what had happened to her, having not aged a day, her clothes shy of the slightest speck of dirt.Some people claim to hear disembodied whispers through the trees, or feel hands grabbing or pushing themMore common reports describe mobile phones and camera equipment inexplicably shutting down on entering the woods, while emotional responses range from full-blown dread to states of ecstasy. Some people report seeing strange rashes on their skin, hearing disembodied whispers through the trees, or feel hands grabbing or pushing them, even when sure they are alone.Marius pulls an iPad from his rucksack and shows me the UFO images which catapulted Hoia-Baciu to international attention in the 1960s. Grainy and monochrome, they appear to show a button-like flying saucer hovering above the trees. He flicks through dozens of other photographs taken in the years before and since, with similar saucer-like objects, glowing orbs or wraith-like apparitions. Enigmatic photographs of this nature have been a fixture of paranormal research for more than a century, not much use as evidence, but it’s worth noting that Barnea did not stand to profit from publishing his photographs – on the contrary, he lost his job in the military, with the communist government not looking kindly on anything with a supernatural tang. “Many of the old researchers who investigated the forest ended up in psychiatric wards,” Marius says. “Did the communist regime put them there? Or did something really happen to them, here in the forest?”View image in fullscreenAn evening walking tour of Hoia-Baciu.Photograph: Hoia Baciu ProjectWhile many of the stories may be unverifiable, there is much before my eyes that is undeniably strange. All around are trees whose trunks are bent and twisted into fantastical shapes. Some bulge outwards at the base, their crowns disappearing into the black night, so they resemble giant meat hooks hanging from the heavens. Others droop like melted candles, or are bent in strange, spiralling patterns. Various suggestions have been given to explain the deformed trees: that hurricane winds could have bent the saplings, or naturally high radiation levels in the soil account for their crooked growth. But scientific investigations have turned up no satisfactory evidence.Marius’s tours allow visitors to take part in a little scientific inquiry of their own. As we approach the clearing in the trees where Barnea took his famous UFO photographs, he hands me an EMF meter, a stalwart of ghost-hunting kits which measures electromagnetic fields. “We’re entering the most active part of the forest,” he says. “See what you can find.”The trees suddenly stop dead as we emerge into a perfect circle. The only greenery is the short grass beneath our feet; it’s clear that it hasn’t been mown, and appears that this strange clearing is natural, not the work of human hands.Wielding my EMF meter, I sweep the clearing like a detectorist, excited when the needle ticks madly back and forthWielding my EMF meter, I sweep the clearing like a detectorist, briefly excited when the needle begins to tick madly back and forth, only for my vibrating phone to indicate that the electromagnetic disturbance was just an incoming text message. Despite spending several hours in the forest, and being genuinely baffled by the twisted trees and the strange clearing, I haven’t seen anything I’d describe as supernatural. Perhaps the forest is a blank canvas, on to which people project their own fears and desires.Transylvania generally is a place which stirs the imagination, where the border is blurred between fact and folklore. In rural Romanian communities belief persists instrigoi(“screamers”) – undead, shapeshifting bloodsuckers, who rise from their graves to terrorise local communities.View image in fullscreenMisty and spooky: Hoia Baciu wood.Photograph: Pal Szilagyi Palko/AlamyBram Stoker’s famous vampire Count Dracula is forever associated with Transylvania, and Bran Castle – a Saxon monolith perched on a rocky outcrop in the Carpathian Mountains around four hours’ drive south of Hoia-Baciu – is keenly marketed as “Dracula’s Castle”. While it bears little resemblance to the shadowy ruin described as Dracula’s dwelling, and there is no evidence that it inspired Stoker, it’s still a major attraction for fans of all things gothic and ghoulish – particularly around Halloween, when the castle hosts costumed parties.But even myth-shrouded Transylvania – literally, “the place beyond the forest” – feels solid and predictable compared to these eerie woods, which seem to be, for reasons radioactive, atmospheric or simply folkloric, a nexus for human imaginative power. “In Hoia-Baciu,” Marius says, “the line between reality and imagination is very thin.”Daniel Stables is the author ofFiesta: A Journey Through Festivity(Icon Books, £20).

But what really happened to her? For the last three years, Thorp has been finding outEmine SanerThu 30 Oct 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 30 Oct 2025 05.19 EDTShareIt has been more than 20 years since 14-year-old Charlene Downes went missing in Blackpool. Last captured on CCTV on a Saturday night in November 2003, Charlene still hasn’t been found, and the truth of what happened to her remains unsolved. Nicola Thorp, an actor, writer and broadcaster, who grew up in the town, describes Charlene’s disappearance, considered to be murder, as “a wound for Blackpool”. Over the last couple of decades, the case has been clouded by rumour, far-right rhetoric and police failures. In a new podcast,Charlene: Somebody Knows Something,she has set out to clear up some of the speculation, and expose how Charlene was repeatedly failed by those around her.Many in the town, she says, still believe the two men who were first tried in 2007 – a retrial was ordered, which then collapsed amid “grave doubts” about the evidence – got away with murder. That in itself, she says, is an obstacle to finding out who is really responsible.In that trial, it was alleged the men disposed of Charlene’s body by making her into kebab meat. That was the story that Thorp remembered from her teen years in Blackpool. “It was just this salacious, shocking story that people spoke to each other about, the ‘kebab girl’,” says Thorp. A few years ago, Thorp decided to look up the story to see if it had been true and was furious that Charlene had been reduced to such a lurid tale, a piece of meat.View image in fullscreenNicola Thorp … ‘Having read the descriptions the police officers gave of the girls at the time, it was appalling.’Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianThere were other elements of Charlene’s story that appalled her. The persistent racist narrative around the two Middle Eastern men who stood trial (they would go on to be awarded compensation for false imprisonment). That there was evidence that Charlene may have been a victim of the town’s grooming gangs, butcould also have been targeted by abusers closer to home. That far-right antagonists continue to capitalise on the disappearance of Charlene. (In January, Elon Musk retweeted a post about Charlene, which repeated the kebab story, including the names of the two accused men, which has been viewed more than 5.7m times.) And worst, that there has been no justice.Thorp, known for her role as Nicola Rubinstein on Coronation Street, has a history of campaigning for women’s rights. While working as a temp in 2016 for the accountancy firm PwC, she was sent home forrefusing to wear high heels; she started a petition, which more than 150,000 people signed, and appeared in front of a commons select committee to highlight sexist dress requirements. Following her terrifying experience of being stalked online by a man who was sentenced to prison for the offence in 2023, Thorp campaigned to allow victims to be given the identity of their stalkers, a change the government announced at the end of last year. If she was to work on something about Charlene Downes, she thought, it had to have a campaigning edge.Class played into it in the press. Would they have called a middle-class girl ‘kebab girl’? I don’t think soIt took three years to put the eight-part podcast together. Her research would bring her into contact with Charlene’s family (with some deeply uncomfortable conversations), potential new leads, police, far-right activists and an intense Facebook group intent on uncovering the truth for Charlene, from which she would later be banned. Programmes that had previously been made about the case, she felt, either weren’t long enough to reveal the complexity of Charlene’s difficult background and the police investigation, or were distasteful and sensationalist. A podcast series, she hoped, might “bring people out of the woodwork”.Thorp, 36, and Charlene lived less than a mile from each other, though, to Thorp’s memory, never met. Thorp remembers the missing posters plastered around the town, but looking back, even this was mishandled. “The poster was her school photo when she was 11, so people were looking for an 11-year-old girl, not a 14-year-old.”Thorp and Charlene were similar in some ways – the same age, with a shared love of the boyband Westlife – but had very different lives. Thorp’s family run a Blackpool rock factory, and her home life was stable; Charlene’s family had beenunder the watch of social services, and her younger brother would be taken into care soon after her disappearance. How much did class play into the investigation? “[It was] everything,” says Thorp, when we speak at the Guardian’s offices. “It gets me upset thinking about it, but having read the descriptions that the police officers gave of the girls at the time, it was appalling.” They were considered to be “child prostitutes” and worse. “Charlene was classed as a runaway and [her disappearance] wasn’t taken seriously for several days. Class played into it in the press, too. Would they have called a middle-class girl ‘kebab girl’? I don’t think so. Misogyny and class is what this entire story really is about – and race, in the case of the perpetrators of some of the grooming.”View image in fullscreenFunny Boyz fast food shop in Blackpool. Its owner was accused of murdering Charlene, but later cleared.Photograph: Peter Lomas/ShutterstockThe two men who faced trial in 2007 were takeaway owner Iyad Albattikhi, accused of killing her, and his business partner Mohammed Reveshi (who speaks to Thorp in the podcast), accused of helping him dispose of her body. But a first jury failed to return a verdict. A retrial the following year was abandoned because of doubts over evidence, including secret tapes that purported to be conversations of Albattikhi joking that Charlene had been turned into kebab meat, even though they were virtually inaudible. The investigation is still open, and there is a £100,000 reward for information that leads to a conviction.In conversations with Charlene’s parents, a troubling picture of their home life emerges. Thorp has a lot of empathy for Karen and Robert Downes, who are desperate for answers, and they spoke to her, though Robert did become abrasive when questioned about the men who spent time around the house, known as his “drinking acquaintances”. “There’s a great deal of complexity around the family and their relationship with Charlene that’s really nuanced and upsetting. They are still her family,” she says, acknowledging their devastating loss, “butthey were the people who could have stopped the life that Charlene was subjected to.”Even in the podcast, people will come forward who have nothing to add and just want to insert themselves in the storyBoth her parents have been vilified online, and their relationship with the Facebook campaign group has broken down. That group, as depicted by Thorp, is fascinating. It has more than 4,000 members, holds memorials for Charlene, and has employed private investigators to pursue the case. What does Thorp think motivates them?“I think the motivation comes from a good place. The group leader is a really engaging, passionate, charismatic person who clearly cares about this case, and is this kind of rallying force.” Thorp admits to being hooked on it in the beginning. “Like, ‘Yeah, I want justice for Charlene, fuck the authorities. I want to join you.’ That gradually started crashing down, and I realised, this is a bit fraught. There were tensions within the group, but also it became this question of who owns Charlene’s story?” Thorp says she was coming under pressure to share every bit of information she found out in the course of the podcast. “It’s a parasocial relationship, but to have a parasocial relationship with this missing girl, there’s unhealthy elements of it. But I think Charlene represents, to a lot of people in that group who might have been victims of abuse themselves: ‘If I can get justice for Charlene, I can get justice for myself.’ I can’t knock that.”View image in fullscreenNicola Thorp speaking to Charlene’s mother, Karen Downes, for her podcast.Does she agree with the police officer she interviews that online sleuths hinder investigations? “I think, in the same way [as in] any coverage, even in the podcast, people will come forward who have got nothing to add and just want to insert themselves in the story.” But what troubles her about this case, and the Facebook group, is the hostility towards potential witnesses – Thorp interviewed one who was accused by the group of being a liar, or of having false memories. “It could stop a genuine witness from coming forward and speaking to police … They might first of all go to the Facebook group, and then if they get knocked back there, they give up.”Police said at the time that Charlene was one of a number of girls who were being sexually exploited by men who worked at a cluster of takeaways in the town. This summer, Charlene’s mother, Karen, said she welcomed a national inquiry into grooming gangs. As a teenager, Thorp was aware that the street of takeaways was considered dangerous and had long known not to hang around in that area. “It was just a kind of ‘don’t go down that alleyway’. When I got older, I realised my parents were sheltering me from some parts of life in Blackpool.”A lot has been made, not unjustifiably, of the grooming that Charlene, among other girls in Blackpool, is said to have been a victim of by a group of takeaway workers, who are mostly of Asian heritage, but Thorp points out: “The white men who abused Charlene have not been widely reported on. They’re ignored.” This includes a man, Ray Munro, who was staying with the family at the time of Charlene’s disappearance and was about to be sentenced for child sex offences. (Charlene’s parentshave saidthey didn’t know Munro was a sex offender at the time.) He may not have been the only one, but Charlene’s fathertold the Timeshe wasn’t aware of any of his acquaintances being paedophiles.There are multiple girls, now women, who at the time didn’t want to tell the police what was going onIn the course of her reporting, Thorp met Tommy Robinson, the far-right activist, at a memorial for Charlene. She had long conversations with the podcast team about whether to platform him. “I felt it was important to show him and how he speaks about these things and ways in which he can be convincing to people if they are not being told the truth. Charlene’s family had been essentially let down, and here’s this ‘nice bloke’ on the phone, in Karen’s words, saying, I’ll give you money for the campaign. That’s how the far right win.”The far right’s resurgence frightens her. Last year, just a few weeks before their Blackpool wedding, her then-fiance, the actor Nikesh Patel, with whom she has a baby daughter and who is of Indian heritage, drove Thorp to cover one of a number of riots that had broken out following themurders of three childrenin Southport, and the misinformation about the attacker being a Muslim asylum seeker. A protester spotted Patel in the car and yelled at him to get out; he managed to lock the doors and drive away. There have been other incidents. She was picked up by a taxi recently, “and got told that I’m lucky that I live in an area where there aren’t many Asians. I said, ‘Well, there’s two in my house.’ He just came out with it. Racism has become emboldened in the UK.” She is scared, she says. “I think we should all be.”View image in fullscreenNicola Thorp in Blackpool, where she grew up less than a mile from Charlene Downes. The two girls never met.She would be happy to see an inquiry into the police handling of Charlene’s case, “not just because of the grooming that she faced at the hands of men who worked in takeaways, but the incredible police failure surrounding it”. Thorp has had her own experience with the police that enraged her. Around the time of the MeToo movement, Thorp reported being sexually assaulted. “In the interview, being asked by the police, ‘What’s it like to work on Coronation Street? What were you wearing? How much had you had to drink? Had you had a sexual relationship with him before?’ All of this stuff where you’re made to feel guilty – and I’m somebody who works in this area, so I could advocate for myself. It’s the only system we’ve got, so we have to make it better, because it’s the only way we can lock up these abusive men.”For the podcast, Thorp spoke to women who had been groomed at the time of Charlene’s disappearance, who said they had been told by investigating police that they would be put into care if they didn’t testify against the men involved. “The women said obviously what they did was very different, but the feeling they got from the police was the same as the men who were grooming them, which is your value is based on what you can do for me.”The belief that she and the police share is that there is witness evidence yet to be unearthed that could be vital, including the identity of a man said to have given Charlene £70 on the day she disappeared. “There are dozens of suspects in this case, but there are also multiple girls, now women, who at the time didn’t want to tell the police what was going on, because the ones who did were threatened, or girls were interviewed with their mum and dad present and wouldn’t want to say what had been going on. They may now feel able to talk about it, whether that’s to me, to the police, to a friend, and actually, it never goes any further than that.”When Thorp and her producer were trying to get the series commissioned, they were told, she says, “‘no more dead women’. I said, women are still being killed, and we can’t just say no more stories. What you need to do is tell stories about women who have been killed and how that happened, how they’ve been failed, and how we can call on the justice system to make changes.”The series is gripping, with all the hallmarks of the genre, including reveals and cliffhangers that come with ethical questions about true crime as entertainment. Thorp was, she says, “hyper aware” of that. “We want to educate people about what really happened, and the warning of how, if you let something like a kebab theory take charge of the investigation, then the truth is lost, and the opportunity to get justice for Charlene is potentially lost. I didn’t want this to be for entertainment’s sake. At the heart of this is a call to action, I hope, for people to bring information forward.”Charlene: Somebody Knows Something is out now and available on all podcast platforms.Explore more on these topicsCrime#MeToo movementChild protectionDomestic violenceYoung peoplefeaturesShareReuse this content"

These include credible reports of mass killings in various locations and summary executions during house-to-house searches and as civilians have tried to flee the city.“Communications have been cut off. The situation is chaotic. In this context, it is difficult to estimate the number of civilians killed. Despite commitments to protect civilians, the reality is that no one is safe in El Fasher. There is no safe passage for civilians to leave the city.”Pobee added: “External support is enabling the conflict. Weapons and fighters continue to flow into Sudan, further contributing to the already desperate situation.”Tom Fletcher, the under-secretary general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator, told the meeting: “El Fasher, already the scene of catastrophic levels of human suffering, has descended into an even darker hell.”Fletcher condemned thereported killing of nearly 500 peopleat the Saudi maternity hospital and said tens of thousands were fleeing to Tawila, where civilians, mostly women and children, faced extortion, violence and abduction.In a statement, the security council said recent developments in El Fasher had had a devastating impact on the civilian population and that council members “condemned reported atrocities being perpetrated by the RSF against the civilian population, including summary executions and arbitrary detentions”.The UN session was likely to be uncomfortable for the United Arab Emirates, the RSF’s key external backer, but diplomatic calls for the UN to recognise it had a responsibility to protect people from a deliberate genocide, as opposed to merely condemning a breach of international humanitarian law, were sparse.In the UK, the Foreign Office minister Stephen Doughty told MPs in the House of Commons: “The reports of mass atrocities against civilians and the forced displacement caused by the RSF advances in El Fasher are both horrifying and deeply alarming.”Calum Miller, the Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson, called for a ban on all UK arms sales to the UAE until it was proven that any such previous exports had not been transferred to Sudan for use by the RSF.The Guardianreported on Tuesdaythat British military equipment used by the RSF had been found on battlefields in Sudan, according to documents seen by the UN security council.Doughty admitted UK-made military equipment had been found in Sudan but distinguished “items” from “weaponry”, telling MPs: “We are aware of reports of a small number of UK-made items having been found in Sudan, but there is no evidence in the recent reporting of UK weapons or ammunition being used in Sudan.”The UAE has repeatedly denied allegations it gives military support to the RSF.Kate Ferguson, a co-director of Protection Approaches, a UK charity working to tackle identity-based violence and mass atrocities, said: “We need an emergency coalition of conscience to drive an immediate global effort to protect civilians and end the atrocities – and demonstrate to the UAE that enabling deliberate destruction of populations is not tolerated.“In the face of countless warnings, the international community has failed to uphold its collective responsibilities to protect El Fasher from genocide.”Human Rights Watch called for targeted sanctions to be imposed on the UAE leadership, while the US Democratic senator Chris Van Hollen called on his fellow senators to pass his bill banning US arms sales to the UAE.Last month the Quad – an external group comprising the US, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the UAE, responsible for overseeing diplomacy surrounding the conflict – outlined a roadmap for peace but it has not been implemented.It called for an initial three-month humanitarian truce to allow for rapid aid delivery, followed by a permanent ceasefire, and concluding with a nine-month transitional period leading to “an independent, civilian-led government with broad-based legitimacy and accountability”.Explore more on these topicsSudanUnited NationsAfricaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

She was busy treating patients, including an elderly woman who needed a blood transfusion, when the attack began.“They killed six wounded soldiers and civilians in their beds – some of them women,” she says. “I don’t know what happened to my other patients. I had to run when they stormed the hospital.”Khalil, 27, was shot in the right foot and thigh as RSF fighters took control of the nearby military headquarters. She fled the city and walked for a day, injured and without food, to reach the town of Garney. “On the way, they took my phone and money. I was left with nothing,” she says.MapMore than 1,000 people – including women and children – walked for two days to reach the town of Tawila in NorthDarfurafter fleeing El Fasher, which was captured after an 18-month siege.Tawila, about 34 miles (55km) west of El Fasher, is under the control of theSudanLiberation Army faction led by Abdul Wahid Mohamed al-Nur (SLA-AW).On Tuesday, the Joint Forces – who are allied with Sudan’s army – accused the RSF of killing more than2,000 civilianssince the fall of the city. The UN said there were videos showing “dozens of unarmed men being shot or lying dead, surrounded by RSF fighters”.Q&AWhat is happening in Sudan?ShowFighting broke outin Khartoum, Sudan’s capital, on 15 April 2023 as an escalating power struggle between the two main factions of the military regime finally turned deadly.On one side are the Sudanese armed forces, who remain broadly loyal to Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the country’s de facto ruler. Against him are the paramilitaries of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a collection of militias who follow the former warlordGen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti.The RSF was initially founded by the former dictatorial ruler Omar al-Bashir as an Arab counterinsurgency militia called theJanjaweed, which quickly became synonymous with widespread atrocities. In 2013, Bashir transformed the group into the RSF, deploying them to crush a fresh rebellion in South Darfur.The conflict has plunged Sudan into“one of the worst humanitarian nightmares in recent history”, according to UN officials. It has created theworld’s worst displacement crisis, scattering more than 10 million people internally and 4 million who have fled into neighbouring countries, putting mounting pressure on Chad and South Sudan.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.According to witnesses, thousands more civilians remain trapped by the RSF and allied militias in Garney, south-west of El Fasher. Many are former soldiers from the Sudanese army, the Joint Forces and other armed groups that had been fighting alongside the army. They are reportedly being held because they cannot afford ransom demands of between 5m and 10m Sudanese pounds (£6,000 to £12,000), according to survivors who made it to Tawila. Those unable to pay have been detained for days, and in some cases released only after becoming gravely ill.The SLA-AW has reportedly allowed government troops fleeing El Fasher to enter Tawila on condition they surrender their weapons.View image in fullscreenAdam Yagoub, who narrowly escaped being killed after being captured by three militiamen on camels near Garney.Adam Yagoub, 28, a driver from Sennar in central Sudan, narrowly escaped being killed after being captured by three militiamen on camels near Garney.“They wanted to cut my head off with a knife,” he tells the Guardian, showing his arm, which one of the fighters hit with the butt of an AK-47 rifle. “Then one of them recognised me – his brother had worked with me – and begged them not to kill me. We were 18 people who left El Fasher together, but only eight made it to Tawila. I think the others are dead.”Yagoub says he saw 22 bodies near what he called a “fake well” used by the RSF and allied militias between Garney and Tawila. “It’s a trap,” he says. “People walk all day without water, and when they reach it, the militias are waiting. They killed 22 men there and took the bodies away to hide them.”Another nurse who escaped El Fasher South hospital after the attack on Sunday said RSF fighters entered through one gate and opened fire on patients in the emergency ward, killing at least eight. “We fled through another gate, but they hit me on the head with a rifle,” he says.In a video statement on Wednesday, the head of the RSF,Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, said that any soldier or officer who had “violated the right of any person” would be held accountable.Many of those who escaped El Fasher spent hours hiding near the army’s artillery unit before fleeing west under cover of darkness. Already displaced families from the city’s Abu Shouk camp were forced to move again, seeking refuge in the Daraja Oula neighbourhood before eventually heading for Tawila.Thousands trapped in El Fasher siege on ‘edge of survival’, says reportRead moreThose captured by the RSF in Garney were reportedly given water mixed with flour to revive them after they had walked for a day without supplies. Survivors said people were then separated by gender and perceived affiliation: men suspected of being fighters were detained, while some civilians were released or freed after paying ransoms.The SLA-AW has deployed additional fighters around Tawila “to protect those fleeing El Fasher and to prevent clashes if the RSF pursues armed groups who have retreated with their weapons”, a local commander said.It is understood that elements of the Sudanese army and allied groups continue to resist in the Jebel Wana area, north-west of El Fasher, after losing control of the city.Médicins Sans Frontières (MSF) says it is facing a large influx of people to its clinic in Tawila hospital.“More than 1,000 people arrived [from El Fasher] at night on foot and in trucks, after an extremely dangerous journey. Many were in a state of great weakness suffering from malnutrition and dehydration,” says MSF project coordinator Sylvain Penicaud.Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentDarfurSudanAfricaMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

At least 25 people have been killed, according to latest updates.InJamaica, authorities confirmed four bodies had been recovered on Wednesday. Two people were found dead in the Black River area, the other two in the Gallon Beach district. Melissa slammed into Jamaica as a record-breaking and destructive category 5 storm with sustained winds of 185 mph before being downgraded to a category 3 when it hit Cuba with winds of 120 mph, according to the US National Hurricane Center.Hurricane Melissa was downgraded to a category one storm late on Wednesday, with maximum wind speeds of 90mph before it hits the south east or centralBahamas.Disaster Assistance Response Team personnel from across the US were on their way toJamaica, theBahamasand theDominican Republic, where they will also attend to issues in neighbouringHaiti, three US state department officials have told the Associated Press. They were expected to arrive in the next 24-48 hours.Jamaican officials said buildings on the island had suffered structural damage, roads were still impassable and power outages continued to be widespread. Airports were set to reopen on Thursday for emergency relief flights after damage there was said to be superficial.At least 241 communities remained isolated and without communications following the storm’s passage across Santiago province, according to preliminary local media reports, affecting as many as 140,000 residents.Across eastern Cuba, authorities evacuated around 735,000 people as the storm approached. Most remained in emergency centers. Cuban president Miguel Diaz-Canel said the country had suffered extensive damage and warned residents against letting down their guard as rains continued to lash the region.ShareUpdated at19.21 EDT"

In nearby Haiti, residents of a small town were mourning the death of 25 people swept away in floods.The most intense tropical cyclone to hit Jamaica in nearly two centuries, Melissa is one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes observed since record-keeping began. Climate scientists say human-caused global heating has contributed to therapid intensification of modern-day storms.View image in fullscreenDamage caused by the hurricane in Mandeville.Photograph: Ina Sotirova/The GuardianMany Jamaicans woke up on Wednesday without power, with reports of whole neighbourhoods submerged. The prime minister, Andrew Holness, has declared the country a disaster area, giving authorities extra powers such as issuing mandatory evacuation orders for flooded regions and preventing price gouging.Massive damage was reported across the island, much of it in the westernmost parts, where the category 5 cyclonic storm moved diagonally across ground at a slow pace, ripping roofs from buildings and flipping over cars. Photos showed a tree ripped out of the ground by the roots and roads submerged by gravel and earth.Jamaica’s minister of local government, Desmond McKenzie, said the hurricane was “one of the worst experiences that [Jamaica] has ever encountered”.1:10Hurricane Melissa leaves trail of devastation in Jamaica – video“Our infrastructure has been severely compromised,” he said. “The entire [Island of] Jamaica has felt the brunt of Melissa.” There are close to 15,000 people in shelters and more than 530,000 without electricity, in a country of 2.8 million.In Mandeville, the capital and largest town in the parish of Manchester, residents were thankful that they were not as badly hit as other parts of the island, even if serious damage was visible.The city’s streets were strewn with the detritus the hurricane left in its wake – fallen trees blocked roads, some homes had their roofs missing and power lines had been downed.Timelapse video of storm as it passes through the CaribbeanOne resident, Jack Gardner, 43, said the hurricane was “very deadly” but that his home had stayed up.“I wasn’t scared,” he said. “I get used to the storms.” Gardner said he had lived through storm Gilbert in 1988 as a child, storm Ivan in 2004, and storm Beryl, which hit Jamaica last year. Storms are named only when they are expected to have a severe impact.Another resident of Mandeville, Lisa Henry, also said she had not been scared. “I was mostly praying,” said the 35-year-old. “I just passed the school, Manchester High, and the top [had been] ripped up,” she said. “Yes, it’s going to take back the country.”View image in fullscreenDamage from Hurricane Melissa near St Elizabeth, Jamaica.Photograph: Natricia Duncan/The GuardianHenry works as a carer for an elderly woman, but said the woman “was not much aware of what was really going on, what was taking place”.Janet Lewis, a shop owner from the parish of Clarendon, which neighbours the hard-hit parish of St Elizabeth, appealed for help for Jamaica. The roof of her shop and adjoining house was blown off. “It was terrible, terrible, very terrible. The rain and the constant, constant, strong, strong breeze just took the roof off from above me and dropped it on the side of the house … In one of the rooms everything caved in. It has affected my business. Jamaica needs help,” she said.Jamaica’s government was still assessing the extent of the damage on Wednesday, but the UN’s resident coordinator in the country said there was “tremendous, unprecedented devastation”.“We have people living in shelters across the country,” said Dennis Zulu in a press briefing, “and at the moment, what we are seeing in preliminary assessments is a country that’s been devastated to levels never seen before”.Alexander Pendry, the global response manager at the British Red Cross, also said early indications suggested Melissa was an “unprecedented catastrophe for the island”.The priority of the Jamaica Red Cross, he said, was to bring aid to people as soon as possible. “Tragically, experience tells us that the impact on communities and individuals will be shattering and long lasting,” he added.Jamaica’s transport minister, Daryl Vaz, said authorities were rushing to make sure airports could reopen as soon as it was safe and practical to get aid into the country. During a visit to Norman Manley international airport in the capital city, Kingston, the minister said he was aiming for relief flights to be able to land as early as Thursday.“The devastation is unimaginable,” he said. “Every hour is an hour lost, and we don’t have the time.”Despite not being hit directly by the hurricane, other Caribbean countries have been affected. Authorities in Haiti said 25 people had been killed in floods. La Digue River, in the coastal town of Petit-Goâve, overflowed its banks, flooding homes and sweeping away adults and children.Jean Bertrand Subrème, the mayor of Petit-Goâve, said dozens of homes had collapsed and people were still trapped. “I am overwhelmed by the situation,” he added, as he pleaded with the government to help rescue victims.Four deaths have been reported in Jamaica and one in the Dominican Republic, where another person remains missing.View image in fullscreenPeople sleep at a school turned into a shelter in Les Cayes, Haiti during the extreme weather.Photograph: Patrice Noel/ReutersA category 5 hurricane is the highest on the Saffir-Simpson scale, with sustained winds exceeding 157mph (250km/h), but the US National Hurricane Center reported that Melissa carried sustained wind speeds of 185mph (298km/h) when it hit Jamaica.Even after losing some power and being downgraded to a category 3 storm, Melissa could be catastrophic forCuba.Hurricane Melissa: a visual guide to the storm devastating Jamaica and CubaRead moreCuba’s president, Miguel Díaz-Canel, said on Wednesday that Melissa had wreaked “extensive damage” after it made landfall overnight on the island country’s southern coast.“It has been a very difficult early morning,” Díaz-Canel said on social media. “Extensive damage and Hurricane Melissa is still over Cuban territory. I urge our people not to let their guard down, to maintain discipline and to remain safely sheltered.”More than 735,000 people have been evacuated from their homes after forecasters warned the low-pressure system would unleash catastrophic damage in Santiago de Cuba, the island’s second-largest city. A major hotel in the city had its windows shattered, and roof parts brought down.Melissa is expected to cross the island throughout the morning and move into the Bahamas later on Wednesday. It is now a category 2 hurricane, although it remains extremely dangerous, with 100mph winds that can cause serious damage to even well-constructed frame homes and cause nationwide power cuts.Weather map showing the hurricane’s pathClimate scientists have saidthe intensification of Hurricane Melissa– with winds doubling from 70mph to 140mph in just a day – is probably a symptom of the rapid heating of the world’s oceans, part of the human-driven climate crisis.Many Caribbean leaders have called on rich, heavy-polluting governments to provide reparations in the form of aid or debt relief to tropical island countries.The Associated Press and Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsHurricane MelissaJamaicaAmericasCubaExtreme weatherClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

Trump said Chinese imports would now be subject to a 47% tariff, down 10 percentage points.TheTrump administrationannounced plans to restrict the number of refugees it admits into the United States next year to the level of just 7,500 – and those spots will mostly be filled by white South Africans.The low number represents a dramatic drop after the US previously allowed in hundreds of thousands of people fleeing war and persecution from around the world.New York’s governor, Kathy Hochul, has declared a state of emergency to raise $65m to help food banks as federal funding for the national food stamps program is set to expire on Saturday due to the government shutdown.The move comes after Oregon and Virginia also declared emergencies to make funds available to cover the anticipated short fall in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap), which provides food aid to nearly 42 million people.US Treasury secretary Scott Bessent on Thursday said that the US would enact a one-year suspension of Entity List restrictions that make it harder for Chinese firms to use affiliates to buy off-limits technology.The moratorium comes after President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping were able to discuss big picture issues with great respect at their meeting earlier in the day in South Korea, Bessent said in an interview on Fox Business Network.Share"

Nevertheless the outline of a broader long-term diplomatic relationship is visible, with announced reciprocal visits by each leader within a year. That is very different to whatChinahawks in Congress were hoping when Trump came to power, and will set alarm bells off on both sides of the aisle.One of the difficulties has been that Trump’s strategic objectives in launching the trade war were not articulated – the balance between protecting traditional US manufacturing, ring-fencing modern technology-based industries critical to US national security, punishing Chinese trade practices, or more broadly generally overpowering China as a competitive threat, were fudged. Gradually the battle morphed in some US administration minds from a trade war into a geopolitical trial of strength between the two world’s superpowers, a trial that left the whole world awaiting its outcome.As a result it has been a turbulent six months, involving undulating tariffs, export curbs, threats, counter-threats, deferral and monopolies inquiries, interspersed with five rounds of trade talks ranging though Madrid, London, Geneva, Stockholm and Kuala Lumpur, culminating in two hours of direct talks between Trump and Xi, the first meeting between the two men since 2019.Through most of the crisis US tariffs on Chinese goods have averaged 55%. That was well below the effective total embargo level of 145% that Trump once threatened, but still high enough to pose a severe stress test to the resilience of the Chinese economy, a test it has passed.What emerged from Thursday’s meeting will require time to digest. In reality this is only a framework agreement and, as Canada is discovering, such agreements have the potential to unravel at a moment’s notice. Moreover, in examining trade deals it is normally said the devil lies in the detail, but with a Trump trade deal the devil often lies in the lack of detail.Much of it amounts to a return to the status quo. China has agreed to defer for at least a year the potentially crippling new restrictions on the export of rare-earth materials. China will once again buy US soya beans. Beijing has agreed to do more to control the export of precursor chemicals used to make fentanyl, the synthetic opioid that has triggered a crisis of overdose deaths in North America, the supposed cause of 20% tariffs. In return Trump has agreed to halve that 20% levy, taking the average of US tariffs down to 45%, still higher than India. He has also suspended expanded restrictions on export controls.Trump, on the plane home from South Korea, was evasive about the US role in loosening licence applications for shipments of Nvidia’s artificial intelligence chips to China, saying the subject of the new most powerful chip, the Blackwell, did not come up, and it was a matter for China and Nvidia. National security hawks in Washington will be watching.The terms for the Chinese firm ByteDance’s divestment of TikTok America will be announced separately, including the size of ByteDance’s continuing stake, and control of the algorithm.On Trump’s account, fears that he was about to abandon Taiwan were also misplaced. The subject did not feature, he said implausibly.More importantly over the past six months both sides have learned about the other’s leverage and vulnerabilities, including which trade weapons work best. For the US it will be disturbing the extent to which China was able to divert US-bound exports to other mainly Asian markets once the US tariffs struck. Those who predicted China would spill into a crisis will have been sobered by a stock market that has risen by 34% in dollar terms, double the rise for the S&P 500 index. China’s trade surplus is likely to be larger than last year’s. Meanwhile US inflation figures, driven by tariffs, crept up to a politically perilous 3%.Chinese restrictions on buying US soya beans, a $12bn (£9.1bn) market, were also effective. It sent politically critical US midwest farming interests towards penury as Brazil filled the market gap.Above all, after a US commerce department rule-change in September, which by some accounts added 10,000 Chinese firms to Washington’s list of sanctioned companies, Beijing massively retaliated by expanding the scope of its export controls on rare earths, the elements essential for hi-tech manufacturing including cars, batteries and military equipment.If implemented fully, it would give China the ability to restrict the production around the world of all kinds of productsthat depend on only a small trace of rare earths sourced from China. The vast controls, announced on 9 October and due to have come into force in November worldwide, underscored the US failure to shed its supply chain reliance on China’s near monopoly on refining these rare-earth products.In a laughably hypocritical bid to rally the world against this China “bullying”, Jamieson Greer, America’s trade representative, on 15 Octobercomplained: “China’s announcement is nothing more than a global supply-chain power grab.” America discovered that bullies could be bullied back, something it might have foreseen.By one account, the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, examining the imminence of the precipice, persuaded Trump that the price of confrontation was proving too high, leading the two sides to the mutual withdrawal this week.The truce is only for a year, but that may be to China’s advantage. It buys Xi time to push China further ahead in the technologies of the future, including green technology and manufacturing, the field it now dominates, and the centrepiece of the new five-year economic plan.Equally importantly, China hopes it will be seen by other countries as the responsible and restrained global power not seeking confrontation, but strong enough to withstand US coercion. At a minimum the clash in leadership cultures is total. Xi is an exponent of the war of position, and Trump the war of manoeuvre in which instinct triumphs over consistency or strategy. For the moment the positional warrior is winning, or at least not losing.This article was amended on 30 October 2025 to correct the spelling of Scott Bessent’s surname.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpXi JinpingUS foreign policyTrump tariffsChinaInternational tradeGlobal economyanalysisShareReuse this content"

That process will begin immediately.”Donald Trump and Xi Jinping hold meeting in South Korea amid hopes for trade deal – live updatesRead moreThe post came less than an hour before Trump met the Chinese president,Xi Jinping, in South Korea on Thursday morning in an effort to come to a trade war truce. The meeting was the first between the two since 2019.The United States last held a full nuclear weapons test in 1992, and China andRussiaare not known to have held any such tests since the same era. Trump’s reference to “on an equal basis” left it unclear what weapons testing could take place, or whether he was referring to displays of power similar to those recently conducted by Russia.Since 1998, no country other than North Korea is confirmed to have conducted a full explosive nuclear test. But nuclear-armed countries such as the US have subsequently carried out simulated nuclear explosions using high-powered computers, as well as related nuclear physics experiments, tests of nuclear-capable missiles, warhead mechanisms and “subcritical” tests of nuclear materials to ensure their arsenals remain viable.Pentagon officials did not immediately respond to questions about the announcement from Trump.Speaking on Air Force One after his meeting with Xi, Trump said he would “like to see” denuclearisation, adding that the US was “talking to Russia about that”.“AndChinawould be added to that if we do something,” he said, without elaborating.On Thursday China’s foreign ministry told a regular press conference that Beijing hoped the US would honour the non-proliferation treaty “and take actions that contribute to regional peace, rather than the opposite”.“We would like to emphasise that China remains committed to the path of peaceful development, pursuing defensive national security policies and friendly diplomatic policies,” said a spokesperson, Guo Jiakun.The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said on Sunday thatRussiahad successfully tested its “unique” nuclear-propelled Burevestnik cruise missile, which can carry a nuclear warhead. The Kremlin described it as part of efforts to “ensure the country’s national security”. Trump laterdescribed Putin’sannouncement as “not appropriate”. Sergei Ryabkov, a close aide to Putin, told Russian media that Moscow had notified the US in advance about the test.The timing of Russia’s Burevestnik testing is notable, coming amid the Kremlin’s intensified nuclear posturing and a break in US-Russia talks over the war in Ukraine.On Wednesday, Putin said Russia had also tested a Poseidon nuclear-powered super torpedo that military analysts say is capable of devastating coastal regions byexploding a nuclear warhead and triggering vast radioactive ocean swellsthat would swamp and contaminate cities.Trump also falsely noted in his Truth Social post that the US had more nuclear weapons than any other country, a claim he repeated during his Air Force One press conference.Russia currently has the most confirmed nuclear weapons, with more than 5,500 nuclear warheads, while the US has 5,044 nuclear weapons, according to theInternational Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons.The last full nuclear test by the US, codenamed “Divider,” was carried out on 23 September 1992 at what is now called the Nevada National Security Site. The president at the time, George HW Bush, announced a moratorium on underground nuclear testing that same year. The US still, however, has the ability to resume tests at the Nevada National Security Site.In response to Trump’s post, the Nevada congresswoman Dina Tituspostedon X: “Absolutely not. I’ll be introducing legislation to put a stop to this.”Despite repeated statements from both Moscow and Washington about wanting to halt the arms race, little progress has been made. The Kremlin has recently criticised Trump’s push to develop a missile shield – known asthe Golden Dome–which he claimswould make the US impervious to attack.During his first term,Trump reportedly sought to increase the US nuclear arsenal “tenfold”.In December 2016, he tweeted: “The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes.”Additional reporting by Helen Davidson in Taipei and Jason Tzu Kuan LuExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsRussiaNuclear weaponsChinaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

That had “provided the necessary conditions” for their meeting on Thursday, he added.What are rare earths and critical minerals – explained in 30 secondsRead moreAccording to China’s commerce ministry, the agreement reached in Kuala Lumpur included a 10% reduction in Trump’s so-called “fentanyl tariff” imposed on Chinese goods, along with reciprocal measures by Beijing to suspend export controls.After their meeting, the two shook hands and Trump immediately boarded Air Force One to return to Washington. He later told reporters the Chinese leader had agreed to work “very hard” to prevent the production of fentanyl, a synthetic opioid drug that has caused a surge of deaths among Americans. In return, Trump said he would lower fentanyl-linked tariffs from 20% to 10%, thereby lowering overall tariffs from 57% to 47%.Trump had suggested their discussions in the city of Busan could last three or four hours but the men parted after an hour and 40 minutes, with Xi preparing to attend the Apec leadership summit, which begins on Friday in nearby Gyeongju. Nevertheless, Trump described the meeting as a 12 on a scale of one to 10.View image in fullscreenThe US trade representative Jamieson Greer and Donald Trump speak to journalists onboard Air Force One.Photograph: Andrew Harnik/Getty ImagesThe US president said China would end its restrictions on rare earth exports and buy American soya beans. The rare earths agreement would last one year and be negotiated annually in the expectation that it would be renewed, he said.China bought its first cargoes of US soya beans in several months, Reuters reported the day before the talks.“All of the rare earth has been settled,” Trump said. “And that’s for the world, worldwide, you could say this was a worldwide situation, not just a US situation. There is no roadblock at all on rare earth. That will hopefully disappear from our vocabulary for a little while.”The US president said they had agreed to work together on Ukraine, adding that the war “came up very strongly” as an issue. “We talked about it for a long time, and we’re both going to work together to see if we can get something,” he said. He acknowledged China buys a lot of Russian oil but added that topic was not really discussed.Another issue that was not discussed was Taiwan. Earlier, both men ignored a question about the self-governing democracy, amid concern in Taipei that Trump may be willing to make concessions to Xi who has vowed to “reunify” it with the mainland.Shortly before the talks with Xi – their first face-to-face meeting in six years – Trump predicted he would have a “successful meeting” as the two men began thehighly anticipated trade talks.View image in fullscreenXi’s motorcade drives past a crowd as he arrives to attend the Apec summit, outside Gimhae airport in Busan, South Korea.Photograph: Ahn Young-joon/APSpeaking to the media at the start of their meeting at Gimhae airbase, Trump said: “We’re going to have a very successful meeting.” But he added: “He’s tough negotiator – that’s not good,” before patting the Chinese leader on the back.Trump and Xi talks could end months of global economic chaosRead moreLikening the US-China relationship to an ocean-going vessel, Xi said the countries should “stay on the right course” and “be partners and friends”.He added: “The world is confronted by many tough problems … China and the US can jointly shoulder our responsibility as major countries and work together to accomplish more great and concrete things for the good of our two countries and the whole world.”As they and their delegations sat opposite each other at the negotiating table, Xi noted that he and Trump had not met for several years – their last summit was in 2019 – but had spoken on the phone and exchanged letters since Trump returned to the White House.Xi said that he and Trump “don’t always see eye to eye with each other”, adding that it was “normal for world’s two biggest economies to have frictions now and then”.He added: “A few days ago … our two economic and trade teams reached basic consensus on addressing our respective major concerns and made encouraging progress. I am ready to continue working with you to build a solid foundation for China and the US.”View image in fullscreenPeople watch a news programme in Taipei showing the meeting between Trump and Xi.Photograph: I-Hwa Cheng/AFP/Getty ImagesThe optimism in Busan was in stark contrast to the recent exchanges of aggressive rhetoric over trade that had threatened to set the US and Chinese on an economic collision course, with potentially disastrous consequences for the global economy.The trade war reignited this month after Beijing proposed to dramatically expand its curbs on exports of rare earth minerals, vital components in the manufacture of everything from smartphones to fighter jets.In response, Trump vowed to retaliate with additional 100% tariffs on Chinese exports, and with other steps including potential curbs on exports to China that are made with US software.Trump hinted this week he would reduce US tariffs on Chinese goods in exchange for a commitment by Beijing to stem the flow of ingredients needed to make fentanyl.Minutes before meeting Xi, Trump said in a social media post that he had ordered the Pentagon tostart nuclear weapons testingon a level with China and Russia. But he did not respond to a reporter’s question about the decision as he and Xi began their summit.“Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our nuclear weapons on an equal basis,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post that specifically referenced Russia and China.Additional reporting by Helen Davidson in Taipei and Lillian YangExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpXi JinpingChinaSouth KoreaAsia PacificApec summitUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

It also has a high thermal emittance, meaning it effectively dissipates heat to outer space when the sky is clear. Its properties are known as passive radiative cooling.Hot in the city: can a ban on dark roofs cool Sydney?Read more“The paint, even during the day when the sun is out, can be cooler than the air around it,” said the study’s lead author, Prof Chiara Neto of the University of Sydney.The coolness of the painted surface also means that vapour from the atmosphere readily condenses on its surface – similar to dew forming overnight on a car.“This material is able to extend the period over which dew can form by at least a couple of hours,” Neto said. “Instead of having dew forming only … say, four to six hours on a good night, you can extend that to eight or 10 hours.”Sign up to get climate and environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a free newsletterIn a study, published in the journal Advanced Functional Materials, the researchers tested a prototype for six months on the roof of the Sydney Nanoscience Hub, pairing the cool paint with a UV-resistant topcoat that encouraged dew droplets to roll down into a receptacle.As much as 390 millilitres per sq metre per day could be collected for about a third of the year, the scientists found. Based on that water capture rate, an average Australian roof – about 200 sq metres – could provide up to 70 litres on days favourable for collecting dew, they estimate.“It would complement existing provisions of water, whether that be the grid or rainwater,” Neto said, suggesting the system could be used in buildings in remote locations, or where there was little access to groundwater.“The cooling aspect and the water go hand in hand when we talk about impact,” she said.View image in fullscreenProf Chiara Neto and Dr Ming Chiu with an aluminium panel coated in water-based cool roof paint.Photograph: Chiara Neto/University of SydneyView image in fullscreenDiagram showing how water is captured.Photograph: Chiara Neto/University of SydneyIn well-insulated buildings, a 6C decrease in roof temperature “might result in a smaller fraction of that cooling being reflected in the top level of the house”, Neto said, but greater temperature reductions would be expected inmost Australian houses, “where insulation is quite poor”.She said the coating could also help reduce the urban heat island effect, in which hard surfaces absorb more heat than natural surfaces, resulting in urban centres being1C to 13Cwarmer than rural areas.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And if that’s all it takes, then the laws are worthless.“Obviously more than that’s going to be required [to get an exemption] but exactly what’s going to be required – that’s the big question.”The Labor Environment Action Network (Lean) co-convener Louise Crawford also wanted the exemption “tightened” to avoid “unintended consequences”.Questioned at the press club about the provision, Watt again cited defence and national security as the type of projects that the “rarely used” power could apply to.When asked why the legislation did not explicitly prohibit the exemption from being used for fossil projects, Watt left the door open to changes.“If others want to raise those kind of things over the course of the debate, we’ll listen to them as we will to every other proposal,” he said.While praising the bill as a “big step” forward for nature and business, Henry was disappointed the carve-out for native forest logging and the so-called “continuous use exemption” that allows agricultural land clearing to bypass federal assessment were not removed.Watt has promised native forest logging would be captured under proposed new environment standards but has no plans to touch the land-clearing exemptions.Environment groups including the Australian Conservation Foundation, Greenpeace, World Wildlife Fund and Wilderness Society all criticised the exemptions as they warned the bill contained too many loopholes to properly protect nature.The Wilderness Society’s Sam Szoke-Burke said the bill was “riddled with loopholes that would enable rampant deforestation and species extinctions to continue at pace”.Crawford said LEAN would continue to its long-running campaign for the EPBC Act to be stripped of all exemptions.But she said members were determined for the legislation to pass after several failed attempts, including in the Albanese government’s first term, to fix the John Howard-era nature laws.“We believe there’s enough good in this bill, it is time to get on with it,” she said.The Coalition and the Greens, which are both opposed to the bill in its current form, joined forces in the Senate on Thursday to refer the bill to a five-month inquiry.Labor could still pass the laws this year if it struck a deal with either side.The Greens’ environment spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young, said she was open to negotiating with Labor but stressed the current bill “leaves nature for dead” and would “make things worse for nature and the climate”.“It will take environment protections backwards while fast-tracking approvals for business,” she said.Explore more on these topicsAustralian politicsDeforestationLogging and land-clearingConservationTrees and forestsnewsShareReuse this content"

That beats the spire of Ulm Minster in Germany, which tops out at 161.53 metres.The Sagrada Familia has not formally laid claim to the title but the numbers are there to compare: it is now 1.38 metres (4ft 6in) taller than the church in Baden-Württemberg.And it is still growing.

Only one of its towers was finished when he died.Work has sped up over recent decades as the basilica became a major international tourist attraction with people around the world enthralled by Gaudí’s unique aesthetic that combines Catholic symbolism and organic forms.The money from entrance fees is used to fund the construction. Last year, 4.9 million people paid to visit.Work on the church’s elaborate facades and decorating its interior will continue for several years. It is expected to be completely finished around a decade from now, church officials said this year.Next year will be the 100th anniversary of the death of Gaudí. The church plans to hold several events to celebrate his legacy.Explore more on these topicsBarcelonaSpainAntoni GaudíArchitectureEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

They will not hesitate to take such action as is necessary to enforce those boundaries.”The couple are understood to have issued summary proceedings as a faster alternative to substantive privacy proceedings, which can take one to two years. The order also instructs Paris Match to pay the couple’s legal costs.William views the privacy of his family as of paramount importance and has sought to shield his wife and children from media intrusion.The couple was awarded €100,000 (£92,000) in damages in 2017 after a French magazine printed topless pictures of Catherine sunbathing on a private terrace. A French court ruled the images used by Closer – taken as the couple holidayed in Provence in 2012 – had been an invasion of their privacy. The royals are understood to have donated the money to charity. The judge also fined Closer’s editor and owner €45,000 each – the maximum amount allowed.Explore more on these topicsPrince WilliamCatherine, Princess of WalesMonarchyPrivacyFranceMagazinesEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

But even if Wilders’s PVV party does edge ahead, he appears to have no viable route to a majority.Dutch electionsAll major mainstream parties have ruled out governing with the anti-Islam firebrand, whose PVV won 37 seats in 2023 then led a chaotic rightwing coalition that lasted less than a year before he torpedoed it in a row over his draconian immigration plans.Wilders nonetheless insisted on Thursday that he should take the lead in forming a new government if the PVV ultimately emerged with the most votes, saying parties should be “crystal clear” about which was the largest in parliament.“As long as there’s no 100% clarity on this, no D66 scout can get started,” he posted on social media. “We will do everything we can to prevent this.” Jetten also said the largest party should “have the initiative”.Whichever party finishes first, Wednesday’s election was a momentous win for D66, a 60-year-old pro-European party with liberal economic views but a progressive stance on most social issues, whose biggest previous seat tally was 24 and which had just nine seats in the outgoing parliament.View image in fullscreenGeert Wilders faces defeat in the parliamentary elections despite his party matching the number of seats of Rob Jetten’s centrist party.Photograph: Sem van der Wal/ANP/AFP/Getty ImagesSarah de Lange, of the University of Leiden, said D66 had been boosted by a “positive, hopeful, can-do campaign, which all our research shows voters prefer to negativity”, and by voters wanting to “signal their wish for a stable, centrist coalition”.Leonie de Jonge, of the University of Tübingen, said the party was helped by its ability to appeal to both centre-left and centre-right voters, and by Jetten himself, who would become the country’s first out gay prime minister.A one-time athlete who competed for the Dutch youth team and a former climate minister, Jetten was “the anti-Wilders”, de Jonge said. Post-election surveys showed voters appreciated a message they described as “positive, calm and constructive”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What is their verdict now?Read moreUnder the proportional Dutch system, 0.67% of the vote yields one MP, a bar that was cleared by 15 of the 27 parties contesting the election. No single party ever wins a majority, and the country has been governed by coalitions for more than a century.Analysts suggested that the most likely constellation for the next government would be a broad D66-led coalition including the night’s other big winners, the Christian Democrat CDA, plus the liberal-conservative VVD and the centre-left GL/PvdA.The CDA, who under their youthful leader, Henri Bontenbal, also campaigned for a return to “decent”, “responsible”, “respectful and on-topic” politics after the most extreme government in recent Dutch history, nearly quadrupled its seat tally to 18.The VVD, which – like the other three members of the chaotic PVV-led cabinet – had fallen sharply in the polls before the vote, in the end managed to salvage a respectable result, finishing third on 22 seats, only two down on its previous tally.The party, long led by the former prime minister Mark Rutte, is now headed by a former refugee from Turkey, Dilan Yeşilgöz-Zegerius, whose future as party leader appeared in doubt before the vote but can now hope to be part of a centre-right government.The GL/PvdA, however, suffered a disappointing night, tumbling from 25 seats to 20. The party’s leader, Frans Timmermans, a former European Commission vice-president, said he was quitting Dutch politics.That broad “grand” coalition would have 86 seats, a majority of 10. An alternative formation – a more rightwing alliance of D66, VVD, CDA and the radical right JA21 – had earlier appeared possible but would have only 75 seats, one short of a majority, and was anyway not D66’s favoured option.However, analysts said a coalition involving GL/PvdA could take a long time to negotiate, with the conservative VVD in particular having long insisted it would not govern with the centre-left party. “Timmermans’ departure may make that easier,” de Lange said. Dutch coalitions can take months to negotiate.Wilders’ setback did not mark a defeat for far-right populism in theNetherlands, cautioned de Jonge, noting that two other far-right parties, Forum for Democracy (FvD) and JA21, had made significant gains.“This is not peak populism,” she said. “As a bloc, the far right gained one seat.” With trust in politicians at an all-time low, the next government faced a “hell of a job to pick up the pieces” and meet major challenges such as housing, climate change and migration, de Jonge said.Explore more on these topicsNetherlandsGeert WildersRob JettenEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The 38-year-old could be forgiven on Thursday for wondering when he will get the keys.Such is the nature of Dutch politics that confirmation will not come for weeks or even months. But after a general election in which Jetten’s liberal-progressive D66 party made huge gains, he appears almost certain to be the Netherlands’ next prime minister.Speaking to an ecstatic crowd of supporters on Wednesday night, Jetten said the backing for his pro-European, pro-climate party marked the end of the far right’s stranglehold over Dutch politics – and showed the rest ofEuropethat the centre can hold.View image in fullscreenRob Jetten, the D66 party leader, responds to the results of the House of Representatives elections  on Wednesday.Photograph: Hollandse Hoogte/Shutterstock“We have turned the page on [Geert] Wilders,” he said as crowds waved the Dutch flag. The mainstream parties, he added, had proved it was “possible to beat the populist movement and to beat the extreme right”.Democrats 66 was formed in 1966 by a group of dissatisfied Dutch activists in the Hotel Krasnapolsky in Amsterdam for every Dutch person “unsettled by the serious devaluation of our democracy”.For many voters, the words seem to have resonated particularlystrongly nearly six decades laterafter the first national government in which Wilders, the leader of the far-right, populistFreedom party (PVV) was at the centre of power.Geert Wilders faces shutout as centrists hail huge gains in knife-edge Dutch electionRead moreThat government collapsed after just 11 months, with Wilders pulling the plug in a row over his draconian anti-immigration plans which his three partners described as confected and “super-irresponsible”. The experience appears to have proved to be a salutary lesson for some of his supporters, with the PVV’s number of seats apparently falling from 37 to 26 – the same as Jetten’s D66.As all the other main parties have ruled out working with Wilders, whichever of D66 and PVV comes out on top, it looks almost certain Jetten will become prime minister.“I always thought he had it in him,” said Frank van der Endt, the chair of the D66’s national talent committee, on a jubilant night with 700 campaigners in Leiden.Those who know Jetten well say he is “the real deal” – a genuine optimist not afraid of a tough debate and a down-to-earth pragmatist who can unite a splintered political scene. He worked as a manager at the ProRail national track network before going into politics and met his partner, the Argentinian hockey player Nicolás Keenan, in a supermarket. He would be the Netherlands’ first out gay prime minister.View image in fullscreenRob Jetten takes a selfie with supporters after the televised EenVandaag election debate in Rotterdam on Monday.Photograph: Remko de Waal/EPAAfter not quite breaking through under Sigrid Kaag, D66’s former leader, in 2021, the party learned from the populist toolkit with a simple Obama-esque “yes we can” (“het kan wél”)message.“The democratic centrist parties have a tendency to make their message very cerebral, whereas populists make it emotional, exciting, with a clear hero – themselves – and a clear enemy: the political elite,” said Roy Kramer, the author of Why Wilders Does Win, at the October conference. “I say: start with common sense with the people in the middle.”That was the tone of the campaign and although some doubted whether the party of civil servants could be avolkspartij(people’s party), Jetten was the one to try. An appearance on the TV gameshow The Smartest Person introduced Jetten to millions. In debates he was polished and ruthless when attacking Wilders.View image in fullscreenThe leading candidates, from left: Dilan Yeşilgöz-Zegerius (VVD), Geert Wilders (PVV), Rob Jetten (D66) and Henri Bontenbal (CDA) before the start of the final debate in The Hague.Photograph: Remko de Waal/EPA“Rob has an incredibly positive story,” said Eindhoven’s deputy mayor, Robert Strijk, on election night. “And I think that is what the Netherlands has been yearning for after the past years where everything was negative, criticism, hate. He came with hope.”Jetten said in a speech that he needed to unite the country where divisions had grown between those withoverpriced assetsandthose struggling to find a homeand where there was a battle for the densely populated space.Speaking after exit polls that initially gave D66 the most seats, he said: “We might be the biggest in these results, but we know that millions of Dutch people today chose other parties.“I feel a great responsibility in the period ahead, not just to be there for the D66 voter, but for all of the other Dutch people who made the effort to go to the polling booth and make use of their democratic duty … and that means leadership from all of the political forces in that political middle to seek cooperation.”View image in fullscreenRob Jetten talks to journalists after the Dutch parliamentary election vote in The Hague on Thursday.Photograph: Simon Wohlfahrt/AFP/GettyHis words were generous and collaborative: the anti-Wilders rhetoric. He also kept to the optimism of his campaign, talking not just about what was going wrong in Dutch society but everything that was going right: low national debt, a well-functioning economy and relatively low unemployment, despite a housing crisis and low trust in politics.D66’s former party chair, Victor Everhardt, said: “He has a story, a vision – and we need someone who can lead us to the future.

It has now handed over 15 bodies.Israel says Hamas has been too slow to hand over the remaining bodies of hostages still inGaza, while Hamas says it will take time to locate and retrieve all of the remains.Families of some of the hostages are desperate to provide a proper burial for their loved ones and fear their remains will be lost for ever beneath the ruins of Gaza.Thousands of Palestinians believed to be dead are still missing amid the vast destruction.Thedispute over the recovery and handover of bodies of hostageshas been one of the difficulties complicating US President Donald Trump’s plan to end the Gaza war for good.Major obstacles still lie ahead, including the future administration of Gaza and the demand for Hamas to disarm. At the same time, the sides have beentrading blame for violating the truce. From Tuesday into Wednesday, Israel retaliated for a Palestinian attack on its troops, which left one soldier dead, with bombardments that Gaza health authorities said killed 104 people.The Gaza health ministry said 46 children and 20 women were among the 104 people killed in the airstrikes. Israel said its strikes had targeted dozens of militants.Witnesses said Israeli planes carried out 10 airstrikes in areas east of Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip, while tanks shelled areas east of Gaza City in the north before dawn on Thursday. No casualties were reported.The Israeli military said it carried out “precise” strikes against “terrorist infrastructure that posed a threat to the troops” in the areas of Gaza where its forces were still deployed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Israeli military confirmed the raid and said it was attackingHezbollahinfrastructure when it fired at a “suspect”. It said the incident was under review.Lebanon’s state media said Israeli forces “stormed the Blida municipality building, where employee Ibrahim Salameh was sleeping, and enemy soldiers proceeded to kill him”. In the room where Salameh had been sleeping, mattresses were soaked with blood and bullet holes dotted the walls, according to the Agence France-Presse.A lasting peace between Israel and Palestine? We’ve heard that before – the result was more bloodshed | Jason BurkeRead moreThe killing led to widespread anger in Lebanon over repeated violations of Lebanese sovereignty. In the hours after the raid, Israel carried out airstrikes in Labouneh, in south-west Lebanon, and Israeli drones could be heard flying low over Beirut.The Lebanese president, Joseph Aoun, condemned the raid and ordered the Lebanese army to confront Israeli soldiers in any future incursions on Lebanese territory. In a statement, Aoun instructed the army to “confront any Israeli incursion into liberated southern territory, in defence of Lebanese territory and the safety of citizens”.The raid and the killing occurred despite a November 2024 ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel which mandated the withdrawal of Israeli forces and the cessation of hostilities between both parties.Israel carries out near daily airstrikes on south Lebanon and the Bekaa valley despite the agreement, which it says is directed at preventing the rebuilding of Hezbollah. It has kept Israeli soldiers at five locations within Lebanon. Hezbollah has said it complies with the terms of the ceasefire deal.The hours-long raid came as tensions between Israel and Lebanon grew, with a flurry of diplomatic activity in Beirut and foreign envoys pushing the Lebanese government to fully disarm Hezbollah.The Lebanese government has in the past said it must not rush the disarmament of Hezbollah, which it has said it is committed to, to avoid sparking a civil war.On Wednesday the US envoy Morgan Ortagus said Washington hailed the “decision to bring all weapons under state control by the end of the year”, during a visit to the border city of Naqoura where indirect negotiations with Israel were previously held.Explore more on these topicsLebanonHezbollahIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

They have endured unimaginable hardship but can now begin to rebuild their lives through studying in our world class universities.“That is why we are supporting the evacuation of dependants of students on scholarships who are eligible to study here under the immigration rules on a case-by-case basis.”Dr Nora Parr, an academic who has been coordinating efforts to support the students, said the announcement brought the government’s evacuation policy into line with existing visa rules and would help only four students, leaving a further 25 on master’s courses still ineligible to rescue their families.“For the Gaza student initiative to be truly successful, ministers must exercise discretion so that highly qualified professionals seeking further training to rebuild their devastated communities do not have to choose between gaining tools for the future and their family’s safety,” Parr said.Under immigration rules covering international students, the families of those taking research degrees are eligible for student dependant visas if they have proof of funding to cover living costs of £7,600 a year in London and about £6,000 outside London. Since 2024 those on undergraduate or taught courses have not been eligible.Fighting continues in Gaza despite the ceasefire agreement, with Israelcarrying out military strikesearlier this week that killed more than 100 people, including children.One 26-year-old student, who had been offered a funded place for a master’s degree in health at theUniversity of Oxford, said he refuses to be evacuated from Gaza unless his wife and three-month-old daughter accompany him.“I couldn’t leave them behind in Gaza City, where life has become a daily nightmare. I was offered a lifeline, but what kind of life would it be if I escaped while they remained trapped in this horror? I held on to hope that if I waited, we might be allowed to leave together,” he said.So far, about 75 students have arrived since the government began allowing evacuations from Gaza for those with full scholarships last month, including a group of 17 who arrived this week.Earlier this month a cross-party group of more than 100 MPswrote to the government, highlighting the students’ plight and urging ministers to allow those with families including young children to be able to bring them.In one case, a PhD student at the University of Glasgow was unable to evacuate her family despite her scholarship covering their full housing and living costs.The Refugee Council and the University of Oxford were among those to have protested against the government’s decision.Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: “It is excessively harsh to tell students fleeing the appalling devastation in Gaza that while they can study safely here, they must leave their loved ones behind. No one should be forced to choose between their education and their family.”Explore more on these topicsInternational studentsHigher educationGazaPalestineImmigration and asylumForeign policyStudentsnewsShareReuse this content"

No 10 wasinitially unable to explainwhy Starmer believed an apology from the chancellor was sufficient.But after a chaotic day, the lettings agency employed by Reeves said it was to blame for not applying for the licence, and apologised for the error.Emails subsequently released by Downing Street between the agency and Reeves’s husband, Nicholas Joicey, a senior civil servant, supported this version of events.Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, argued that this did not close the matter and called for Starmer to hold a full investigation. But with Southwark council saying it had no plans to take action against Reeves, her position seemed secure.Starmer confirmed there would be no further action after consulting with his independent adviser on ministerial standards, Laurie Magnus. In a letter to Reeves, he said: “I still regard this as a case of an inadvertent failure to secure the appropriate licence, which you have apologised for and are now rectifying … I see no need for any further action.”The departure of Reeves would have been a devastating blow for Starmer. The chancellor is pulling together a budget, to be announced on 26 November, that is seen as crucial to the prospects of his government.It would also have been the second loss of a key minister in recent months, after Angela Raynerstood down as deputy prime minister and housing secretaryin September over another property-related controversy, in her case the underpayment of stamp duty on an £800,000 seaside flat.The row over Reeves’s property affairs began on Wednesday evening with the publication of letters between her and Starmer abouther failure to pay for a £945 “selective licence” before she let the home, as required in some parts of Southwark.In her letter, Reeves said she had been unaware of the need for a licence, and that she had applied as soon as she was made aware.In his reply, Starmer said that, having consulted Magnus, he was satisfied the breach was “inadvertent” and that given her prompt action once she knew about the licence, an apology was sufficient.Downing Street refused to say whether Magnus had seen any evidence to support Reeves’s claim of having made an inadvertent mistake, or had taken her word for it.No 10 declined to say whether Reeves contravened the ministerial code or had potentially broken the law. Badenoch argued that if Reeves was fined she should be dismissed, citing Starmer’s argument after Boris Johnson’s fine for breaching Covid rules that “lawbreakers cannot be lawmakers”.In an early piece of good news for Reeves, Southwark released a statement saying that while it could not comment on individual cases, it pushed for enforcement action such as fines only when someone did not apply for a licence within 21 days of being warned they needed one, or if a property was found to be in an unsafe condition.No 10 later announced that Magnus had reopened his examination of the case after new information emerged in emails to and from Joicey.Shortly afterwards, Harvey & Wheeler, an estate and lettings agency based in Dulwich, south London, said it took responsibility for the lack of licence. While owners of properties usually applied for these, it said, in this instance a now-departed staff member offered to do so on Reeves’s behalf and then did not.In a statement, the company said that “in an effort to be helpful” the then property manager offered to apply for a licence on behalf of Reeves’s family, but did not and then left the company just before the tenancy began.“Unfortunately, the lack of application was not picked up by us as we do not normally apply for licences on behalf of our clients; the onus is on them to apply. We have apologised to the owners for this oversight,” it said. “We deeply regret the issue caused to our clients as they would have been under the impression that a licence had been applied for.”View image in fullscreenA redacted email chain supported the statement released by the lettings agency.Photograph: No 10The emails released later by Downing Street between the agency and Joicey supported this narrative.A message from the agent to Joicey read: “I will do the selective licence once the new tenant moves in as I won’t need to do this just yet. At the moment as we are only applying for a council licence.”In response, Joicey asks the agency to “please, do go ahead” and obtain the licence, plus an electrical safety test, asking if any more administrative tasks needed to be completed.In a new letter to Starmer, Reeves wrote that the agency had accepted responsibility, adding: “Nevertheless, as I said yesterday, I accept it was our responsibility to secure the licence. I also take responsibility for not finding this information yesterday and bringing it to your attention.“As I said to you today, I am sorry about this matter and accept full responsibility for it.”A Tory party spokesperson said: “Last night Rachel Reeves said ‘she had not been made aware of the licensing requirement’. Today, we find out that Reeves was alerted to the need for a licence in writing by the estate agents.“Having been caught out, the chancellor is now trying to make the estate agents take the blame … With more information coming to light every few hours, the prime minister needs to grow a backbone and start a proper investigation.”Explore more on these topicsRachel ReevesKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

In the book she claimed the prince “believed that having sex with me was his birthright”.Andrew has always denied claims he had sex with Giuffre when she was 17, and settled a civil case with her for a reported £12m with no admission of liability.Giuffre’s family said on Thursday that “today, she declares a victory” and that she had “brought down a British prince with her truth and extraordinary courage”.Buckingham Palace said in a statement: “Prince Andrew will now be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor.“His lease on Royal Lodge has, to date, provided him with legal protection to continue in residence. Formal notice has now been served to surrender the lease and he will move to alternative private accommodation. These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him.“Their majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse.”Royal Lodge – or mini-palace? The 30-room house caught up in the Prince Andrew scandalRead moreIt is understood that Andrew will move to a property on the private Sandringham estate in Norfolk, to be privately funded by the king.His ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, will also move out of Royal Lodge and will sort out her own living arrangements.Formal notice was given to surrender the lease at the Royal Lodge on Thursday and it is understood that Andrew’s move to Sandringham will take place “as soon as practicable”. He will receive a private provision from the king, with any other sources of income to be a matter for the former duke.The removal process applies to the titles of Prince, Duke of York, Earl of Inverness, Baron Killyleagh and the style His Royal Highness. The honours affected are Andrew’s Order of the Garter and Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order. He hadceased to use the HRH style in 2022but it had not been formally removed.As daughters of the son of a monarch, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie retain their titles in line with King George V’s letters patent of 1917.The king is understood to have acted now because while Andrew continues to deny the accusations against him, it is felt that there have been serious lapses of judgment.The royal family had announced on 17 October that Andrew wouldvoluntarily stop using the title Duke of Yorkand give up his honours as a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order and Royal Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter.But MPs proceeded to call for Andrew to be formally stripped of his titles. The public accounts select committee this weekwrote to the Treasury and crown estateto demand more information about the circumstances of the terms of his residence at the 30-room Royal Lodge and why he was required to pay only a peppercorn rent.Although the dukedom could be abolished through an act of parliament, it is understood that Charles did not wish to prevent parliament from focusing on urgent national issues.The dukedom of York is a peerage. The king is sending royal warrants to the lord chancellor to secure the removal of the dukedom from the peerage roll, and the title of prince and style of Royal Highness. The subsidiary titles of Inverness and Killyleagh are similarly affected.The move is understood to have taken place in consultation with the relevant government authorities. The government supports the decision.In a statement to the BBC, Giuffre’s family said: “Today, an ordinary American girl from an ordinary American family brought down a British prince with her truth and extraordinary courage.“Virginia Roberts Giuffre, our sister, a child when she was sexually assaulted by Andrew, never stopped fighting for accountability for what had happened to her and countless other survivors like her.“Today, she declares a victory. We, her family, along with her survivor sisters, continue Virginia’s battle and will not rest until the same accountability applies to all of her abusers and abetters, connected to Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.”Sky Roberts, Giuffre’s brother, commended the king for “setting a precedent” and thanked him for the mention of “victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse” in the statement, but said Andrew should be put “behind bars”.Giuffre alleged she was forced to have sex with Andrew three times – once at the convicted sex trafficker Maxwell’s home in London, once at Epstein’s address in Manhattan, and once on the disgraced financier’s private island, Little St James. Andrew has always denied the allegations.The Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, said it must have been “very difficult” for the king to take the steps against his sibling, but that it was right for the public not to tolerate sexual abuse allegations.The culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, told BBC Question Time that removing Andrew’s titles was a “really brave, important and right step” by the king, which sends a “powerful message” to sexual abuse victims.The Democratic congressman Suhas Subramanyam, who has previously called for Andrew to testify before a US Congressional committee about his links to Epstein and Maxwell, urged Andrew to give evidence.He said: “It’s clear that Prince Andrew has information about Epstein’s crimes and he must do more than just give up titles or hide from the public spotlight. He owes it to the victims to share everything he knows about Epstein’s criminal operation and come before the oversight committee.“Regardless, we will continue to pursue the files and all the evidence, no matter how rich and powerful the perpetrators involved.”Explore more on these topicsPrince AndrewKing Charles IIIMonarchyEd DaveyJeffrey EpsteinnewsShareReuse this content"

Ascending the throne at 73, Charles always knew he would play a caretaker role for the monarchy and so could not allow rot to set into an institution that lives and dies by public consent.The damage that Andrew’s association with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell continued to inflict on the reputation of the royal family was simply too much for the king not to actas he did on Thursday evening. Charles has been described by his biographer Catherine Mayer as “loyal to a fault. Sometimes to the point of fault,” but this was too much.The queen’s longevity always meant that Charles’s reign would be relatively short and therefore one of his most important tasks would be to bequeath the institution to Prince William in reasonable repair. William is relatively popular with the public and for Charles to leave him with a festering crisis for the sake of the feelings of his younger brother, recentlycaught lying about his continued association with Epstein, made no sense.It emerged this month that Andrew had emailed Epstein in 2011 after a picture of him with his arm around the teenager Virginia Giuffre, who he is accused of having sex with when she was 17, was published in 2011. He previously claimed he had cut off contact with the sex offender by this point, but instead he is alleged to have told Epstein that “we are in this together”.Then when the BBC this week reminded the world of a picture taken in the garden of Royal Lodge, the Windsor home Andrew is being turfed out of, which featured not only Epstein and Maxwell, both convicted child sex offenders,but also the convicted rapist Harvey Weinstein, it cannot have been difficult to decide to deliver the final blow. Charles decided that neither he nor the institution of the royal family could be “in this together” ever again with Andrew.But this was not just the action of the chief executive of an institution sometimes called “the firm”. This was a family matter and therefore emotionally charged. The queen is said to have doted on Andrew, and his astonishing self-assurance has been attributed by some to that mothering by the queen, who is said to not have offered the same indulgences to her older children. Charles would no doubt have had his late mother’s views in mind when he signed off Thursday night’s statement announcing the “formal process to remove the Style, Titles and Honours of Prince Andrew”, that “notice has now been served to surrender the lease” on Royal Lodge and that “these censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him”.In the simplest terms the issue also seemed to boil down to a question of whose side are you on.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Over the Partygate scandal in particular, he called for Boris Johnson to quit over his rule-breaking. “You cannot be a lawmaker and a lawbreaker and it’s time to pack his bags,” he said.After Durham police launched an investigation into whether he had broken lockdown rules himself over having abeer and curry at a campaign event, he took a huge political gamble and said he would quit if he was found guilty. Luckily for him, he was not.At the time, and perhaps not entirely helpfully for the Labour leader who voters already thought was a bit uptight,Lisa Nandy described him as “Mr Rules”, leaning into the contrast between Starmer’s apparently high ethical standards and Johnson’s carelessness.Since taking power, the boomerang appears to have swung back towards the prime minister with a vengeance. Maintaining such levels of probity, not just for himself but for his cabinet, was always going to be an impossible task, especially in the flawed world of politics.But few foresaw that it would be Starmer himself who would be the first to undermine his own position, when his failure to see that acceptingfree glasses, clothes and Taylor Swift ticketscould break what little belief there was that his government would be different.Since then, the scandals have come thick and fast, although they have varied in degree of severity. Louise Haigh wasforced to resign as transport secretarylast November after it emerged she had been convicted of fraud over a missing work phone in 2014.Tulip Siddiqquit as a Treasury ministerin January after accepting the government was being harmed by the furore over her close ties to her aunt, the ousted prime minister of Bangladesh now accused of corruption.The departure of Starmer’s deputy, Angela Rayner, in September after she breached the ministerial code over herunderpayment of stamp dutyon her £800,000 seaside flat was the most serious blow yet.Yet Starmer has always been clear there would be no special treatment. “People will only believe we’re changing politics when I fire someone on the spot. If a minister – any minister – makes a serious breach of the rules, they will be out. It doesn’t matter who it is, they will be sacked,” he told his biographer Tom Baldwin before the election.When it emerged on Wednesday thatRachel Reeves, second only to the prime minister in seniority, could be in hot water it sent a collective shudder round the top of government. If the chancellor were to go, the whole Starmer project could come tumbling down.Downing Street, having apparently learned from the Rayner row, acted decisively, announcing that the chancellor had admitted to“inadvertently” breaking housing rulesby renting out her south London home without the specific £945 licence required by the local council.Not only that, but the prime minister had already spoken to Reeves, consulted his ethics adviser, Laurie Magnus, and decided that further investigation into the matter was “not necessary”, all within hours of the Daily Mail story breaking.Early on Thursday morning, government insiders were confident that Reeves, while having made a mistake, had an excuse: she had not been informed by her lettings agency that her home was a designated area which required a licence. She had quickly rectified the error by applying for one.But Kemi Badenoch, whose Tory researchers are thought to be behind the story, was determined to get a scalp. “This whole thing stinks. The prime minister needs to stop trying to cover this up, order a full investigation and, if Reeves has broken the law, grow a backbone and sack her,” she posted.Downing Street initially failed to draw a line under the story by refusing to say whether Magnus had seen any evidence to support the claim Reeves had made an “inadvertent” mistake, or if she had contravened the ministerial code or broken the law in breaching Southwark council rules.View image in fullscreenA redacted email chain supported the statement released by the lettings agencyPhotograph: No 10Fortunately for Reeves, she had receipts. Her husband dug out emails from the lettings agency they used to rent out their home. Just before they were published, the agent issued a statement saying it had apologised to the couple for an “oversight” that meant they failed to obtain a licence.The chancellor appears to be in the clear, although there are still questions over why her story changed overnight: from her being unaware that a licence was necessary, to the agency having told them it would apply on their behalf.Also, the law clearly states it is the owner – rather than the lettings agent – that is legally responsible for applying. It is also unclear how the couple failed to notice almost £1000 had not left their bank account.While the misdemeanour is relatively minor when compared with numerous ones committed during previous Tory administrations, Reeves’s brush with the standards regime underlines the challenges of Starmer’s position on ethics.His ambition of restoring broken public faith in the political classes, gradually worn down after years of scandals, may be understandable. But the pitfalls of taking the moral high ground – as the boomerang comes back round – are clear: people are fallible.Explore more on these topicsRachel ReevesLabourKeir StarmerPartygateEthicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

His election victory last year effectively ended both prosecutions and left him spoiling for revenge.In the second week of his second presidency he had already directed the removal of top leaders of the Department of Justice (DoJ), the authors write, and “his lieutenants at the White House and DoJ dramatically turned up the heat at the FBI”.Bove, a lawyer who defended Trump in the two federal criminal cases and was on his legal team during hisNew York hush-money trial, was now acting deputy attorney general (he has subsequently been appointed as a federal appeals court judge).Bove told the acting director of the FBI, Brian Driscoll, and his deputy, Robert Kissane, that he wanted a list of agents from the Washington field office who took part in the investigations into the 6 January 2021, insurrection and the classified documents case.“‘We need to do a DoJ review,’ Bove told them, and said it was possible some agents would need to be fired,” the authors report.Driscoll resisted, saying he did not want to provide such a list and did not understand why the justice department needed to review them, pointing out that the FBI had its own internal mechanisms to deal with potential misconduct.But Miller, who has been described as the most powerful unelected person in America, had other ideas. Leonnig and Davis write: “On the evening of Tuesday, January 28, Bove took several calls from Trump’s deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, who had assumed the role of exacting the president’s revenge and delivering the fearsome new headlines to please both Trump and his supporters.“Miller said he had talked with [FBI director nominee Kash] Patel, who was anxious to see more ‘targeted’ officials at the FBI removed from their jobs, to match how swiftly DoJ was firing prosecutors. Patel essentially wanted the FBI firings to happen faster. Miller had pressed Bove to get it done, saying he agreed, according to later reports of Bove’s account.”The following morning, Bove informed Driscoll and Kissane about Patel’s wish and Miller’s order that key FBI personnel who authorized the January 6 and Mar-a-Lago documents investigations be dismissed. Driscoll and Kissane then told the executive assistant directors that mass firings were on the way.“For most, it felt like the world was spinning,” the authors write. “They were career agents, not political followers of one administration or another … They would never mention their political views at work, but this was a Republican-leaning group. One director thought to himself: ‘Hell, several of us voted for Trump.’”On 30 January, after Patel had told his Senate confirmation hearing that he was unaware of any discussions about politically motivated firings at the FBI, Bove again pushed Driscoll and Kissane to provide a list of names of agents involved in the January 6 and Mar-a-Lago cases.Again Driscoll refused, the book continues, citing the bureau’s longstanding practice of protecting agents’ anonymity. “‘I can’t believe you’re fighting me,’ Bove said, sounding insulted.“‘This is people’s careers, and they didn’t do anything wrong,’ Driscoll said.“Bove at one point asked for a far more limited set: how about they start with the names of every FBI agent who had been part of the search of Trump’s bedroom in Mar-a-Lago?“‘I just need a list to cut,’ Bove said, frustration rising in his voice. ‘I just need five or six names because Stephen Miller is breathing down my neck.’”Leonnig, a former Washington Post reporter who is now a senior investigative correspondent at MSNBC, andDavis, an investigative reporter at the Post, observe: “Bove was acting and talking like a man under significant pressure to deliver some scalps to the White House. But Driscoll wasn’t budging. And an increasingly angry Bove wasn’t giving up either.”On 31 January Bove sent Driscoll a memo entitled “Terminations” demanding that he fire seven specific senior leaders and, by Tuesday, 4 February, turn over a list of all agents and supervisors involved in the January 6 investigation.The executive assistant directors left at the end of the week, taking a combined 150 years of FBI experience with them. “When Bove’s deadline arrived at noon on Tuesday, Driscoll had arranged to send him a list of agents – but instead of names, he provided employee ID numbers. Bove was furious. The same day, the FBI Agents Association filed its suit to stop the release of agents’ names.“‘Thisfeels like a resistance,’ Bove said.“‘Because it is,’ Driscoll answered.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpFBInewsShareReuse this content"

Officers ordered the driver to leave the area, according to the statement.“As the driver began to pull away, the car stopped and attempted to run officers over by reversing directly at them without stopping,” Tricia McLaughlin, the DHS’s assistant press secretary, said in a statement.Democratic contender for Congress indicted over Chicago ICE protestsRead more“An ICE officer, fearing for his life, fired defensive shots at the vehicle. The subject fled the scene and abandoned his vehicle.”The shooting was the second such incident in the Los Angeles area in recent weeks. Last week, federal agents shot a Los Angeles man who livestreamsUS immigrationenforcement operations on social media.Officials said at the time that Carlitos Ricardo Parias, aTikTokcreator with a large following, attempted to ram federal agents’ vehicles after agents surrounded him and boxed in his car. Officers shot him in the elbow while a ricochet bullet hit a deputy US marshal in the hand.In Phoenix on Wednesday, an ICE officer shot at a vehicle that officials had tried to stop. The driver began to drive away and officials said the officer was in the vehicle’s path,ABC 15 reported.The shootings come as the Trump administration attempts to significantly expand its deportation operations across the US. The government is reportedlymoving to overhaulICE leadership in order increase the pace of removals.Meanwhile, conditions in ICE facilities are troubling. The Guardianreported this weekthat US immigration officials are increasingly holding people in small and secretive facilities for days and in some cases weeks, a violation of federal policy. At least 16 people died in ICE facilities betweenJanuary and September.Deportation operations have upended communities across the US, particularly in southern California, where the fear of raids and removal has left residents on edge and in some cases fearful to leave their homes.The homeland security department said in its statement that Thursday’s shooting “was another example of the threats our ICE officers are facing day-in and day-out as they risk their lives to enforce the law and arrest criminals”.“ICE officers now face a 1,000% increase in assaults against them, including cars being used as weapons, and death threats against our agents are up 8,000%,” McLaughlin said. “Let me be clear: anyone who assaults, impedes, obstructs, or threatens the lives of federal officers will be arrested and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)US policingUS immigrationTrump administrationLos AngelesWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

But Republican senators Susan Collins of Maine, Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul of Kentucky, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska joined the opposition party.The vote comes as Trump is wrapping up a week in Asia, where he struck a deal with China to lower tariffs on Chinese goods into the country and get China to buy up US soya beans, a pain point of the trade wars that had farmers on edge, among other concessions.Despite the opposition in the Senate, the House is unlikely to take any similar action. House Republicans created a rule earlier this year that will block resolutions on the tariffs from getting a floor vote.The tariff resolutions are a rebuke to the tariffs themselves and to Trump overstepping his authority and bypassing Congress. Senator Tim Kaine, a Democrat from Virginia, told reporters that the symbolic opposition should catch the president’s attention.“I did learn in the first Trump term that the president is responsive to things like this. When he sees Republicans starting to vote against his policies, even in small numbers, that makes an impression on him and can often cause him to alter his behavior,” Kaine said.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsUS SenateUS politicsDonald TrumpEconomic policyGlobal economynewsShareReuse this content"

Prices for the holiday’s most popular candy treats are rising, spooked by Donald Trump’s tariffs and climate change.Candy prices are estimated to increase by 10.8% this year, according tonew analysisfrom progressive groups the Century Foundation and the Groundwork Collaborative, with some popular chocolate-based treats seeing price upticks of at least 20%. The price increases could mean popular candy like Tootsie Rolls and Hershey’s chocolate and variety packs are a few dollars more expensive than just a year ago.Chocolate candies are especially at risk of higher prices because of a years-longcocoa shortagethat has caused the price of cocoa to triple over the last few years. Climate-related rain and damage to cocoa crops in west Africa – the biggest exporter of cocoa beans – have caused cocoa to peak at more than $12,000 per ton in 2024. Though prices have since gone down to about $6,000 per ton, they are still much higher than prices seen in 2020, when cocoa was $2,300 per ton.Bar graph showing percentage increases in more than 15 cocoa and candy treatsl“Our food system is really global,” said Alex Villacis, a food economist at the Ohio State University. “Something that is happening in west Africa will ultimately have an impact on your front porch this Halloween season.”The rising price of cocoa is only one part of the story on candy prices. Donald Trump has placed tariffs on the biggest exporters of chocolate to the US. Imports from the Ivory Coast, the largest producer of cocoa, are taxed with a 21% tariff. Ecuador, the second-largest producer, faces a 15% tariff.Hershey’s, the largest chocolate manufacturer in the US, said in the spring that tariffs couldcostthe company more than $100m and that it would have toraise pricesamid soaring cocoa costs.While the companyclarifiedthat the “change is not related to tariffs or trade policies”, it has beenaskingthe Trump administration to make a tariff exemption for cocoa. Other business groups have recently asked the Trump administration fortariff exemptionson cocoa, along with other agricultural products that are hard to source in the US.Because the cocoa plant can only be grown in tropical climates, the only two US places that can produce cocoa – and do so in extremely small quantities – are Hawaii and Puerto Rico. Even if chocolate is manufactured in the US, as Hershey’s is, the base cocoa ingredient has to be sourced from abroad.How companies price their products can include an extremely opaque mix of factors, including consumer demand and expectations. A recentsurveyfrom the National Retail Federation (NRF) found that 79% of shoppers are expecting Halloween prices to be higher this year compared with last.Researchfrom Villacis and other economists show that demand for candy, especially chocolate, remains high even when prices go up. Such strong demand can give producers more power in passing on price increases to consumers, even in subtle ways.“Chocolate producers have two options: they can either just pass this additional cost to the final consumer or they can absorb this higher cost as a loss,” Villacis said. “Something in between that we have been observing is a subtle form of what we call ‘shrinkflation’. In this case, what we have seen is not that they are making their products smaller, but they are reformulating the products in the sense that they are putting less cocoa and trying to replace cocoa with other things like almonds or more milk.”Halloween costume ideas from the pros who dress Heidi Klum, Chappell Roan and moreRead moreShrinkflation became something of an internet trend over the last few years as companies tried to subtly adjust the sizes of their products, causing consumers tonoticeslightly smaller sizes while prices stayed the same. For candy, it could look like more products made of white chocolate, which contains no cocoa.“It’s not really clear how companies are approaching this right now, but we’ve all had this moment to get used to some of the tactics that they’re using to pass along price increases to consumers,” said Angela Hanks, chief of policy programs at the Century Foundation, adding that “companies take advantage of a moment where people expect prices to increase and pre-emptively increase them”.For example, Walmart in May said that price increases started showing up for certain products starting in late April as the company was preparing for tariffs, even before the levies went into effect.“We’re wired to keep prices low, but there’s a limit to what we can bear, or any retailer for that matter,” Walmart’s CFO, John David Rainey,toldthe Associated Press at the time.Despite the higher prices, consumers are expected to continue shelling out for their fix of sweets. The NRF estimated that total Halloween sales, from candy to decorations and costumes, will reach $13.1bn, a new record after reaching a peak of $12.2bn in 2023.Datafrom the National Confectioners Association showed that Halloween candy sales made up 18% of all confectionery retail sales in 2024.“Chocolate products are really embedded into American holiday culture,” Villacis said. “As economists, we cannot help noticing how each candy bar tells a story of global trade. It’s a constant reminder that economics touches everything in our lives.”Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsHalloweenUS economyChocolateTariffsEconomicsFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The company is thought to be looking to raise at least $60bn.A stock market float would give OpenAI another route to raising cash, supporting ambitions by the chief executive,Sam Altman, to splash trillions of dollars on building datacentres and other forms of infrastructure needed for the rapid buildout of its chatbots.During a staff livestream on Tuesday, Altman was reported to have said: “I think it’s fair to say it [an IPO] is the most likely path for us, given the capital needs that we’ll have.”An OpenAI spokesperson said: “An IPO is not our focus, so we could not possibly have set a date. We are building a durable business and advancing our mission so everyone benefits from AGI.”AGI stands forartificial general intelligence, which OpenAI defines as “highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While it is still technically controlled by the non-profit entity, the move makes it easier for OpenAI to raise capital while also laying the groundwork for an IPO.The deal also gave Microsoft a stake of about 27% in the for-profit company, with OpenAI valued at $500bn under the terms of the deal.

Not only are several of Trump’s shutdown moves blatantly anti-worker, but legal experts say many of them violate federal law.Take the Trump administration’s abrupt decision to effectively cut off funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) beginning this Saturday. That’s the food stamp program used by millions of workers and their families – a total of42 million people, one-eighthof the US population.Last Friday, the administration said it wouldn’t let the Department of Agriculture’s $5bn-pluscontingency fund be usedto ensure continued food benefits after 1 November. Nutrition experts and Snap recipients warn that thiswill result in increased hungerin the world’s richest nation. The administration cut off funding by asserting that the contingency money could only be used for natural disasters, and it did so even though it had said just before the shutdown began that thecontingency fund could be usedto finance Snap benefits.Democrats finally have some leverage in the shutdown fight. They should use it | Robert ReichRead moreJB Pritzker, the governor of Illinois, slammed the move, saying that working families “are about togo without food assistancebecause Trump and congressional Republicans want to score political points and refuse to reach a deal.” Pritzker added: “They can find the money to pay masked federal agents wreaking havoc in our communities but not help people in need put food on the table.”Cutting off food stamps will hurt millions of low-wage workers as well as seniors, veterans and many other vulnerable Americans. “People receive Snap in every part of the countryand in every state,” said Sharon Parrott, president of the Center of Budget and Policy Priorities, a progressive thinktank. “It is quite something to be sitting on billions of dollars that could be used for food assistance for people who need help and to refuse to release it.”This past Tuesday,two dozen states sued the Trump administration, asserting that the Snap cutoff was unlawful. David A Super, a federal budget expert at Georgetown University, told the New York Times that “nothing in the law imposes that limit” of using contingency funding only for natural disasters. He added: “This [funding cutoff] is blatantly lawless.”The government shutdown began on 1 October, after Democrats blocked legislation to finance the government unless Trump and Republicans agreed, as part of any deal, to take an important step to help working Americans – extending subsidies that help 22 million Americans pay for Obamacare. Trump refused.The Snap cutoff is just one of the anti-worker moves Trump has taken during the shutdown. He alarmed 670,000 furloughed federal workers bythreatening not to provide them with backpay. After previous government shutdowns, the hundreds of thousands of furloughed federal employeesalmost always received retroactivepay for the time the shutdown lasted. Not only that, during Trump’s first term, hesigned the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act, which was understood to guarantee backpay to federal workers furloughed during shutdowns.But during the current shutdown, Trump suddenly backtracked on that legislation and threw an unwelcome curveball to the 670,000 furloughed workers. He warned them that there isno guaranteethey will receive backpay for the four-plus weeks they have been furloughed.This was widely seen as “a strong-arm tactic” to pressure congressional Democrats to agree to reopen the government and drop their demand to extend Obamacare subsidies. Senator Patty Murray of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the Senate appropriations committee, called this Trump tactic illegal and “another baseless attemptto try and scare & intimidate workers”. She wrote on X: “The letter of the law is as plain as can be – federal workers, including furloughed workers, are entitled to their backpay following a shutdown.”In a draft memo, the Trump White House indicated that only workers it deemed essential – like military personnel and air traffic controllers – may be automatically entitled to backpay. In a slap at the 670,000 furloughed workers, Trump told reporters that backpay was iffy for federal workers, saying it “depends on who you’re talking about” and there were “some people that really don’t deserve to be taken care of”.In another anti-worker move, Trump and Russell Vought, the director of the White House office of management and budget, seized on the shutdown to announcepermanent layoffs of 4,000 federal workers. They did this after Trump called the shutdown an “unprecedented opportunity” to revamp the government and cut “Democrat agencies”. In previous shutdowns, furloughed workers weren’t laid off; they returned to their jobs when the government reopened.On Tuesday, Susan Illston, a federal district court judge in San Francisco, extended an injunctiontemporarily blocking the layoffs. She calling them capricious and a form of “political retribution’ and said that such mid-shutdown layoffs were “unprecedented in our country’s history”.Everett Kelley, the president of the American Federation of Government Employees, a union representing 800,000 federal and Washington DC government workers,called the layoffs illegal. “Federal workers are tired of being used as pawns,” Kelley said. He added: “It is disgracefulthat the Trump administration has used the government shutdown as an excuse to illegally fire thousands of workers who provide critical services to communities across the country.”Trump’s biggest enemy isn’t the media. It’s poor people  | Ross BarkanRead moreWe shouldn’t be at all surprised that Trump has pursued new anti-worker policies during the shutdown, considering that he has embraceddozens of anti-worker policiesduring his nine months back in office. Notwithstanding his repeated promises to help miners, Trumphalted enforcement of a regulationthat protects coalminers from a devastating, often deadly lung disease. Enraging labor leaders, Trump has moved to strip collective bargaining rights frommore than 1 million federal workers. Hescrapped the minimum wage requirementthat federal contractors pay their employees at least $17.75 an hour; as a result, many full-time workers will see their wages fallby more than $9,200 a year. Trumpfired the chair of the National Labor Relations Board(NLRB), leaving the country’s top labor agency without a quorum to protect workers from companies’ unlawful anti-union tactics.Meanwhile, Trump has slashed regulations on oil companies and crypto-billionaires to help them increase profits. Trump “talks a good game of being for working people, buthe’s doing the absolute opposite,” said Liz Shuler, president of the AFL-CIO, the main US labor federation. “This is a government that is by, and for, the CEOs and billionaires.”For weeks now, Trump could have easily ended the shutdown by doing a straightforward favor for America’s working class. But he has refused to do so because he doesn’t want to be seen as bending in any way in his showdown with the Democrats. Trump could end the shutdown in an hour or two by telling congressional Republicans: “Let’s do the working class a solid by extending Obamacare subsidies.” That would be a boon to millions of workers because without the extension, Obamacare premiums willmore than double on averagefor 22 million Americans.All this shows that Trump has acted coldly, cruelly and calculatingly toward working-class Americans during the shutdown. Any president who truly cared about American workers, any president who wanted to reduce their worrying and their pain, would, during the shutdown, be doing the opposite of what Trump has done.Steven Greenhouse is a journalist and author, focusing on labor and the workplace, as well as economic and legal issuesExplore more on these topicsUS politicsOpinionUS federal government shutdown 2025Donald TrumpTrump administrationUS federal government shutdownsWorkers' rightscommentShareReuse this content"

And I was like ‘I don’t know if that’s true or not,’” she said. “And then I put in ‘what formation should you play to beat NWSL teams?’ and it spurted out every team in the league and what formation you should play. And for two teams, it went ‘you should play a back five.’ So I did. No joke, that’s why I did it.”Harvey declined to name which teams she used the tactic for, but women’s soccer analyst Kim McCauleypointed outthat the Reign first played with a back five in April against Orlando Pride, a game they lost 1-0 while generating about 0.5 more expected goals than usual.The Reign have played with a back five at multiple other points this season, which has seen a marked improvement in results compared to 2024. Harvey and the Reign finished second from bottom in NWSL last season, but are fourth in the league – good enough for a playoff place – heading into the final day of the regular season this weekend.Harvey said that she and her coaching staff “researched it, we did a deep dive on it, we thought about how we could play it,” before acting on ChatGPT’s suggestions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Is there any hope of reclaiming a once hyped prospect?Quarterbacks such as Sam Darnold and Baker Mayfield have gone from busts to MVP candidates. The Chargers backup is in the ideal place to make a similar journeyOliver ConnollyThu 30 Oct 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 30 Oct 2025 07.45 EDTShareThe development path for youngNFLquarterbacks is brutal. They get lobbed in at the deep end as franchises try to figure out if their investment was worth it, before being tossed overboard if things go wrong. The league eats its young. The path from potential franchise starter to career backup – or out of the league – has never been shorter.And that path has been expedited almost by design. In part, that’s due to the rookie pay scale, which allows teams to move on from perceived misfires early. It’s also down to a shift in evaluations. Patrick Mahomes, Josh Allen and Lamar Jackson broke the mold for everyone. They redefined what a starting quarterback could look like, the skills needed, and the speed of development.College offenses had become too wide-open, too gimmicky, producing quarterbacks fluent in college football but not dialed into the mechanics of the NFL. So the league tried to fix it itself, drafting the rawest, most athletic prospects imaginable, then worrying about teaching them how to play quarterback later. It ignored that Jackson and Allen (the latter raw, the former not) played in pro-style passing games in college, lessening the learning curve when they entered the league. And trying to find the next Mahomes is like sifting through rec-ball leagues tofind the next Victor Wembanyama.There have been hits and misses. You know the names: Jordan Love, Justin Herbert, Zach Wilson, Anthony Richardson, Justin Fields, Trey Lance. All were chosen to fit the post-Mahomes vision of a modern quarterback.Herbert and Love have been the success stories, though there is nuance. Herbert would be an ideal quarterback in any era – and has himself been the victim of an unstable environment. Love was allowed to slow-cook in the background for three seasons in Green Bay, backing up Aaron Rodgers. The rest have been whiffs. And all of them are candidates to join a new wave of success stories in the NFL: the reclamation project. Three of the early candidates for MVP this season – Sam Darnold, Baker Mayfield and Daniel Jones – are former first-round picks who were discarded by the teams who selected them, only to find success elsewhere with the benefit of a good system and professional experience.Wilson is already potentially in his reclamation chapter, backing up Tua Tagovailoa in Miami. Richardson’s early flashes with the Colts have been tempered by injuries and an allergy to the specifics of the professional game. And then there’s Lance, perhaps the most compelling of them all.Lance was meant to be the future for theSan Francisco 49ers. He fit the mold: 6ft 4in with a live arm and wheels. The 49ers traded three first-round picks and a third-rounder to move up to draft him. Teams don’t traditionally stake that kind of capital on a maybe; they do it when they think they’ve seen the next one.But Lance was always a mystery. He may be the purest expression of the NFL’s Josh Allen hangover – the belief that tools and temperament could overcome inexperience. Lance had started only a little over a season’s worth of games in college, winning a national championship at the lower FCS level before he left for the draft. He threw only 99 passes inhigh school.In college, he played at North Dakota State, a well-oiled machine that runs a stripped-down version of an NFL offense. In theory, that made him more ready than most project-style quarterbacks. In practice, it meant he had barely been tested.Still, the college numbers sparkled: 2,947 passing yards, 30 touchdowns, just one interception; another 1,300 yards and 18 scores on the ground. The 49ers; timing felt right, too. Jimmy Garoppolo was fading from the plan. Drafting Lance was not just a swing for the fences on an unproven prospect. It represented astylistic shift for Kyle Shanahan, the league’s most doctrinaire offensive coach. Shanahan had seen what was happening in Baltimore, Kansas City and Buffalo, and he wanted to keep up. He was looking for a quarterback who could marry together the rhythm-based roots of his offense with more vertical elements on the ground and through the air. Think of the Eagles on their way to the 2023 Super Bowl with Jalen Hurts. Lance, despite his slim resume,fit the bill.It didn’t work. Lance’s rookie flashes were promising, if uneven. By Year Two, Shanahan handed him the keys. Two weeks later, he fractured his ankle and was done for the year. In his place came Brock Purdy. Shanahan pulled the Lance Experiment when it was clear Purdy was more than a fun story, and that he partly offered what the coach was looking for in Lance, but at a fraction of the price.Being a draft “bust” isn’t just about that one player; it’s about the opportunity cost of picking that one player over everyone else. Redraft today, and the Niners could have taken Micah Parsons or Ja’Marr Chase with the third pick. If they’d stood pat in the draft andnottraded up, they could have picked up Mac Jones, Shanahan’sinitial preference in the 2021 draftand now, ironically, the 49ers’ starter while Purdy recovers from injury.Two years removed from his draft, Lance was traded to Dallas for a fourth-round pick – a rounding error compared to the fortune the 49ers spent to get him. He barely played. When he did, he looked frazzled, unable to rev up to the speed of the league. In his final preseason appearance with the Cowboys, he threw five picks. Then, this past offseason, he signed a one-year, $6.2m deal with the Chargers to back up Herbert and put himself through Jim Harbaugh’s Quarterback Finishing School.So far Lance has earned $36m in his NFL career – that means he has cost his teams a little over $7m per start. But if ever there was an ideal spot for Lance to develop, learn and become an asset rather than a dead weight, it’s the Chargers. Sitting behind Herbert, there is no pressure on him to perform, unless there is an injury. Harbaugh is one of the best developers of quarterbacks of his generation. Harbaugh can X and O with anyone. But like O’Connell, he understands that the development goes beyond the field. A year in Harbaugh’s kitchen could put Lance in poll position to be the next man up this offseason.Jim Harbaugh hyping up Trey Lance. Football is so back.pic.twitter.com/iCaz7nOqGhhttps://t.co/90DNZlTljH— Ari Meirov (@MySportsUpdate)August 1, 2025The league’s mistake wasn’t in seeking quarterbacks who could make magic. It was the belief that post-snap magic could serve as a cure all. Mahomes, Allen, and Jackson break defenses not because they color outside the lines, but because they’ve also mastered the subtleties of the position. They follow the script for 80% of snaps, then improvise on the remaining 20%. The NFL, seeing the fireworks, discounted the foundation.Lance is a telling case. The Niners looked at his upside and moved on when it became clear how long it would take for him to be even a competent starter, if he ever could reach that level. They dealt away a young player partly due to his on-field struggles, but also to clear the decks for Purdy.The pendulum is swinging back. Chasing the upside is exciting. But Darnold, Mayfield, and Daniel Jones have proven there’s value in experience – in having an adult in the room. They know how to get in and out of the huddle. They’ve seen every defense. They know where the blitz is coming from. They can change protections, get everyone lined up and ensure the operation runs smoothly. That, at minimum, is the job. But this season, they’ve been more than caretakers; they’ve been difference-makers.Finding the next Darnold or Mayfield is the latest trend. The Jets took their own swing this year, signing Fields after he showed signs of life in Pittsburgh. He fit the model as a former first-rounder who washed out early for a poorly run franchise. But despite a solid outing against Cincinnati last week, Fields doesn’t look like he has the goods.There will be others down the line. Richardson is the most likely. Bryce Young, maybe. Caleb Williams, if the Bears remain lost in the wilderness. Even Trevor Lawrence, if Jacksonville tire of waiting for his potential. Maybe it’s Mac Jones, who was hung out to dry in New England after a solid rookie season. Jones has turned his career around with the Niners, filling in admirably in place of an injured Purdy. He has shown enough this season that there will be interest on the trade market this offseason, though San Francisco will not give him away lightly.From his draft class, Lance has become the forgotten man. Fields and Mac Jones have had a shot to start again. Lance is still waiting. His last meaningful snaps came this preseason, when he scrambled through the Hall of Fame Game and threw two touchdowns. “He hasn’t had a lot of game experience,” Harbaugh said afterward. “We’re trying to give him that, and he acquitted himself well.”Lance is still just 25, younger than Saints rookie Tyler Shough, Bo Nix and Michael Penix Jr. “Twenty-five years old. Just in life, that’s the fat part of the bat. For a quarterback, that’s the fat part of the bat,” Harbaugh says of Lance.The NFL has a way of crushing careers. You’re either the guy or you’re not. But the truth is that careers are rarely linear. Alex Smith took nearly a decade to find the right spot. Geno Smith disappeared, then resurfaced as a quality starter in Seattle. Mayfield was playing scout-team edge-rusher in Carolina before he became the Bucs franchise starter.Lance showed Harbaugh enough in the preseason to win the Chargers’ backup job. He’s played a handful of mop-up snaps this season. If he’s needed down the stretch, he could play himself into a starting role elsewhere next year. Even a year on the bench, working with Harbaugh, offers more stability than he has had since college. He has struggled in the pros, but there’s an interesting player buried somewhere under the rubble.Picking him up as the next reclamation project this offseason would be a nice win for someone.Explore more on these topicsNFLUS sportsLos Angeles ChargersSan Francisco 49ersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Banka went on to criticise the anti-doping regime in the US, at a time when the government there has withheld crucial funding from Wada’s operations.Olympic athletes say pro-doping Enhanced Games are a betrayal and could lead to deathsRead more“Sometimes we don’t know what to say about this ridiculous idea, because from the ethical point of view, from the moral point of view, how is it possible that people come to agree to compete, taking all these prohibited substances?” Banka said. “It’s completely against everything that we are doing. It’s very dangerous. I hope it will not happen, although there are quite important and rich people who are sponsors of this irresponsible event.”Banka said anti-doping authorities had to be “very strong” in their opposition to the games. “We have to be very united,” he said. “We really want our colleagues from the US to do more to make sure that this event will not happen. There are some legal possibilities they can lobby for. Usada have made general comments, but maybe it’s time to try and convince the people who have financed this that it’s dangerous. That’s [Usada’s] role and responsibility because the event is going to take place in Las Vegas.”The Enhanced Games is scheduled to take place next year at Resorts World in Nevada, with events in swimming, athletics and weightlifting. Marketing itself as “pioneering a new era in athletic competition that embraces scientific advancements to push the boundaries of human performance”, it is backed by funding from an investment group that includes Donald Trump Jr.The event has attracted global headlines and opprobrium in equal measure because of its approach towards PEDs and the $250,000 rewards offered to athletes for breaking official world records, with $1m on offer in 50m freestyle swimming and 100m sprint.The head of Usada, Travis Tygart, has previously called the Enhanced Games “a clown show”, but has also been heavily critical of Wada. In the aftermath of the controversy involving 23 Chinese swimmers, who competed at the Tokyo Olympics despite recording positive drug tests, Tygart said that Wada had “accepted China can play by its own set of rules”. An independent review later found no evidence of bias towards China in Wada’s response. Tygart also supported a decision by the US government to withhold funding from Wada earlier this year, saying it was “the only right choice to protect athletes’ rights and fair competition”.Speaking in London on Thursday, Banka said Wada was “very keen” to work with Usada but that “it has to be based on mutual respect”. He then went on to criticise the US anti-doping regime, noting that the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) is not a signatory to the world anti-doping code.“When we see anti-doping in US, the problem is that this is far from perfect system,” Banka said. “Almost 90% of US athletes are not competing under the world anti-doping code. [Elsewhere] only 308 samples were collected in the six months after the Olympics in 2024. Ask yourself if [the US system] is robust or it requires improvement. Is there a great anti-doping programme in the strongest sporting nation in the world?“China was a fair decision and was used in the US against Wada to destroy its image,” Banka went on. “This is politicisation. There is zero evidence that there was something wrong on Wada’s side. My wish is that instead of politicisation and attacking us, the time is used to address the gaps and strengthen the anti-doping system in the US.”Explore more on these topicsWadaDrugs in sportSport politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

On Blake Snell’s first pitch of the game, Schneider turned on a 97mph fastball and drove it over the left-field wall. Two pitches later, Vladimir Guerrero Jr followed with another blast to nearly the same spot. It marked the first time in World Series history that consecutive home runs opened a game, stunning the Dodger Stadium crowd before most had found their seats.Yesavage then went to work. He struck out five consecutive batters between the second and third innings to set a rookie record before Kiké Hernández finally broke the streak, and the shutout, with a solo homer in the bottom of the third to make it 2–1. That was as close as Los Angeles would get.In the fourth, Daulton Varsho tripled down the right-field line after Teoscar Hernández misplayed the ball, and Ernie Clement lifted a sacrifice fly to bring him home for a 3–1 lead. The Dodgers’ offensive struggles deepened from there.

Seranthony Domínguez and Jeff Hoffman each worked a scoreless inning to close it out, combining for three strikeouts while preserving the rookie’s masterpiece.“I’m kind of blown away by what he did,” Toronto manager John Schneider said.The Dodgers, who shuffled their lineup in search of a spark by moving Will Smith to the two-spot and dropping Mookie Betts to third, again found little traction.Shohei Ohtaniwent 0-for-4 and is now hitless in seven at-bats since reaching base a World Series-record nine times in Game 3.“We’ve got to make some adjustments,” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. “We’ve been in elimination games, a core group of these guys, and we’ve got to find a way to win a game. That’s it.”Now up 3–2, Toronto return home with two chances to secure their first title in 32 years.

In the absence of any actionable information from Fifa before the first round of the pre-sale opened up, they hoped, I guess, that I had inside knowledge.In truth, I only knew that Fifa would be usingthe universally despised dynamic pricing model, and thatthe bid bookfor the 2026 World Cup had promised an average group stage ticket price of $305. Mind you, that was seven and a half years ago and an awful lot of inflation has happened since then. In the bid, Category 4 tickets for the group stage – the cheapest seats available – were priced at $21. (As we would soon learn, the actual price would start at $60, andcategory 4 tickets are almost non-existent.)Could Trump really move World Cup games? The facts behind his threatsRead moreI play over-40 pickup soccer with a group of a few dozen soccer-loving friends in New York’s Hudson Valley. In the group chat, anticipation built for the first round of general ticket sales in early October. Tidbits were traded. Links were shared. It was broadly accepted that the prices would be eye-watering – surely several hundred dollars per ticket, as this wasthe point of a North American World Cup, after all. Nineteen of us entered the Visa pre-sale lottery, as did 4.5 million others. Two of us, including me, won a time slot to buy tickets. It’s hardly a scientific sample at two people, but if our experiences are anything to go by, there are already serious questions around affordability at this World Cup (it makes sense anaffordability-focused political candidatewould make it an issue).The first of us to venture into the time slot stage spent two hours in a countdown queue loop that reset every 10 minutes. When he finally got in, category 4 tickets were sold out. He snagged some category 3 tickets to a round-of-32 knockout match in New Jersey, but his bank blocked the transaction. By the time he had resolved the issue, the system wouldn’t let him reorder those tickets, as it had logged the original, failed transaction as a sale, thus barring him from a second acquisition for the same match. He finally settled for some group-stage tickets instead.Two days later, I also spent several hours in ticketing purgatory before I was finally granted five whole minutes to log in.It was sort of ironic that I got through at all since I was on the fence about taking my family to the World Cup in the first place, afterour most recent outing to a Fifa tournamenthad its ups and downs. But it would be another year on, and World Cups in all their color and noise and sensation are extraordinary things to witness. I’ve been to three, and they are milestones in my life, that left vivid memories I doubt will ever fully fade. I figured I could always ditch the tickets on Fifa’s secondary market (less a 15% fee) if we decided not to go. But I wanted the experience to at least be something we could opt into.When I got a glimpse at the remaining inventory at last, everything in category 3 was gone as well for any game I was interested in – basically whatever was within a three-hour drive. The cheapest tickets left for any game at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey were $465 apiece and somehow also most likely in the upper deck. If we got the maximum of four tickets, that would easily make it a $2,000 day between the tickets, parking and other assorted expenses. And since the draw was still almost two months away, our tickets may yet turn out to be for a game like Qatar v Paraguay – potentially a barnburner on its day, of course, but at that price tag would need to deliver some serious pyrotechnics.I decided against it. Instead, I offered to get anybody else in my men’s league group chat the $465 tickets and transfer them. Out of 28 people in the chat with an interest in World Cup tickets – I went back and polled them, because we’re doing Journalism here – just one took me up on the offer. He had friends coming over from England for the World Cup, after all, and didn’t want to let them down.I ordered him four tickets to a group-stage match at the Meadowlands in category 2 at a total cost of $1,860. “I’m probably gonna regret this,” he said, as he signed off on the purchase.Then kicked off a new kind of kerfuffle: actually transferring the tickets to him.One fruitless attempt after another left the tickets stuck in myFifaaccount. “It felt like genuine progress when, after a week, the website went from aimlessly refreshing when trying to accept, to actually returning an error code,” said the friend.It took almost two weeks for the transfer function to finally work. And when it ultimately did, it left no paper trail at all. The tickets simply vanished from my account and appeared in his, giving me no notice, confirmation or receipt concerning the status of my near-$2,000 purchase.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And who, in the end, will be there when the games get underway?A World Cup preying on Fomo: Fifa’s 2026 ticket scheme is a late-capitalist hellscapeRead moreIf even those with the interest and the disposable income and the time and the logistical means of getting to a game hesitate at those prices, who are the real customers? More than a million tickets were sold in the first phase, per Fifa, but to whom? And how on earth might fans from other countries, where spending power tends to be lower than in the American middle class – and have to pay for flights and accommodation too – possibly afford to go? Will there be any kind of atmosphere at the games, if it’s just stockbrokers and lawyers and tech bros and sponsors and dignitaries filling the stadiums?Will it be the World Cup for the 1%?We can probably state with more certainty whowon’tbe there: a lot of people really keen on going to this generational event who can’t begin to afford it. A teacher I know is desperate to get tickets – any kind at all – for her soccer-besotted son. She’d been asking for updates about where and how to buy them for at least a year, maybe two. When I told her what the tickets I briefly had access to were selling for, she winced and shook her head sadly. “No…,” she said. “No.”Leander Schaerlaeckens’ book on the United States men’s national soccer team, The Long Game, is out in the spring of 2026.

The part-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, CEO Omar Berrada and technical director Jason Wilcox were full of optimism. What owner isn’t energised by making a coaching appointment, especially their first? It was a chance for Ratcliffe to put his imprint on United after years of drift under the Glazers.The coach, who had regained the title at Sporting, had youthful vivacity, an admirable track record and emotional intelligence.Ruben Amorim, appointed a year ago this Saturday, was one of the most desired young coaches on the market, which is why Tottenham and Liverpool had also considered him.‘Tough, really tough’: Ruben Amorim on his first year at Manchester UnitedRead moreUnited felt they had stolen a march yet even a year ago, among their opponents, there was scepticism at their elation. “Sporting Lisbon had a great time under him and I’m not saying he wasn’t part of their success but Benfica and Porto had their problems, it’s an easy league and Sporting’s title win was overhyped because of special circumstances,” said one highly respected executive who has appointed a number of successful Premier League coaches. “Amorim left and Sporting still won the league last season. Maybe it was the players?”One year on, it is fair to say the early buoyancy Ratcliffe, Berrada and Wilcox experienced has not been frequently replicated. More often they have looked like three stooges in the directors’ box at Old Trafford, glumly looking down at their protege overseeing another calamity.And yet after three successive wins, including crucially a firstat Anfield against Liverpoolfor almost 10 years, their faith in Amorim now suddenly feels farsighted. They had always maintained that the lowest points – Grimsby, the Europa League final, both defeats at Brentford, the miserable Christmas run of four successive losses – were staging posts on a longer journey.“We can’t react every time we lose and we can’t be celebrating like a cup final just because we win,” said one voice at Old Trafford on the recent renaissance of hope. There is acknowledgment that this is a long and difficult journey. The club believe Amorim is the right person to turn around the United oil tanker and there is determination not to go back to the “rinse and repeat” of the past 10 years.View image in fullscreenAmorim talks to Kobbie Mainoo before Manchester United are knocked out of the Carabao Cup by Grimsby.Photograph: Chris Radburn/ReutersThat’s why, United say, there was no prospect a month ago that Amorim would have been sacked had they lost to Sunderland on the back of the gutless3-1 defeat by Brentford.Ratcliffe compared Amorim’s struggles to Mikel Arteta’s first year at Arsenal and has seemingly promised him three years to turn the club around. There is hope that Anfield will be Amorim’s Mark Robins moment, the iconic FA Cup third-round victory in 1990 in which the striker scored to save Sir Alex Ferguson’s job.A parallel to current dynamics is that the then chair, Martin Edwards, has always insisted that Ferguson’s job was not on the line that day, partly because the most august member of the board, Sir Bobby Charlton, still supported the Glaswegian and could see he was turning the club around.Berrada and Wilcox don’t quite have Charlton’s credentials, even if Wilcox is a Premier League winner, but they are Ratcliffe’s eyes and ears in the football world and are true Amorim believers.Yet there was another member of the executive team who possibly wasn’t as excited to greet Amorim last year. Dan Ashworth, now the FA’s chief football officer, was United’s sporting director when Amorim was appointed. Ashworth left on 8 December. United maintain the two events were unrelated. “Everyone was aligned on Ruben’s appointment, including Dan,” said a United source.Yet it was the failure of Erik ten Hag and the search for a successor that triggered Ratcliffe’s realisation that Ashworth wasn’t the man he wanted to run his club. Once the board decided Ten Hag couldn’t go on, Ratcliffe wanted a bold plan from Ashworth, according to a source familiar with both sides of the story. Yet Ashworth argued this wasn’t time for a risky appointment, that there was a need to rebuild and reform the culture. Hence his shortlist of Premier League managers such as Eddie Howe and Graham Potter. Other sources suggest Thomas Frank was discussed. United insist Gareth Southgate was never an option, though given his closeness to Ashworth and Sir Dave Brailsford, Ineos’s director of sport, it would have been odd not to have discussed him.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Brailsford, said to be the person most likely to speak frankly to Ratcliffe, was very influential at the time, said the source, and Wilcox and Berrada were more fluent in “football corporate speak” than Ashworth.View image in fullscreenHarry Maguire leads Manchester United’s celebrations after a victory against Liverpool at Anfield.Photograph: Poppy Townson/MUFC/Manchester United/Getty ImagesAmorim had been discussed in the summer of 2024, when United were weighing up whether to stay with Ten Hag after his FA Cup win, though Berrada and Ashworth were on gardening leave then. A separate source close to the figures involved says there was wariness at that stage because of his adherence to 3-4-3. United say this is not the case. “They really, really liked him in the summer,” a United source said.Rival sporting directors tend to agree that Amorim’s dogma should have dissuaded United. “He [Ruben] has fallen into the trap of thinking that it’s his system and tactics which are the cause of success,” said one. “Managers are egomaniacs but they have to be egomaniacs to stand in front of young men earning so much and hold the room. Youhaveto get players thinking you are a genius. The problem is they then believe that they are.“Pragmatism is underrated at the top level. If it’s not working, you have to make changes for the short term. When United asked the question: ‘Will you change 3-4-3?’ and he said no, that should have been a red flag.”United sources insist that is a mischaracterisation of Amorim and it is certainly true there are variations in his 3-4-3, not least the direct approach which did for Liverpool and was a tactical triumph. The question is whether there will be more of those and whether anyone will be writing articles marking Amorim’s second anniversary.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedRuben AmorimfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In the first, an impressive Portugalbroke down the Americansin a 2-1 win for the visitors. Emma Hayes played an almost entirely different, much younger lineup in the rematch, and the Americans returned the favor, 3-1. A somehow even younger lineup in the third gamesteamrolled a limp New Zealand, 6-0. The Portugal games offered many lessons; the Football Ferns were less scary than 11 jack-o’-lanterns would be, so that third match was more of a fun romp than a true test.Here are some takeaways from the window:Emma Hayes: ‘I don’t think coaches are always thought about as human beings’Read moreThe youth is ready nowThe USWNT that played the first Portugal match lacked the qualities that have defined the team at its best: scrappy determination, physical dominance, and ruthless ball progression. All of those were much more evident in the second match, where the young starters played with a more traditional mentality than the more experienced players who played in the first.This contrast was especially evident in the midfield. In the first match, the combination of Sam Coffey, Lindsey Heaps, and Rose Lavelle was no match for Kika Nazareth and the rest of the Portuguese side. Instead of playing with grit and dynamism, they were porous and uncreative (barring some hopeful combinations between Lavelle and attacking players Alyssa Thompson and Catarina Macario).Lily Yohannes, Claire Hutton, and Jaedyn Shaw (18, 19, and 20 years old, respectively) were fantastic in the second match. The trio solved pressure and moved the ball quickly to accelerate the attack. Each had memorable plays – Yohannes splitting four defenders with precision, Hutton calmly twirling away from a defender to switch fields, Shaw sending a back-heel to assist Olivia Moultrie’s second goal – but the most notable aspect of the performance was more mundane. Simple pass sequences routinely broke lines of Portuguese players, stemming counterattacks before they could start.Against New Zealand, it was the green attacking wingers, Michelle Cooper and Emma Sears, who made the biggest impression. Cooper ate up space and fed two assists to help Sears on her way to her hat-trick.Former mainstays are invaluable for their experience and leadership, But it’s clear that sentimentality must not be a barrier to decentering them. If the retirement celebrations for Alex Morgan and Alyssa Naeher before the first game didn’t nail home the message enough, the performances show it clearly: a new generation is ready to push for spots on this team.Naomi Girma is missedView image in fullscreenNaomi Girma has been a key leader for the US under Emma Hayes.Photograph: Ray Bahner/ISI Photos/USSF/Getty ImagesPortugal’s high press exposed disorganized defensive units in both matches, emphasizing the absence of injured central defender Naomi Girma. The Chelsea ace has only appeared for the national team four times in 2025, as injuries have plagued her first year in the WSL. Hayes said that once Girma builds up more club playing time she’ll be called in for national team duty, and that day can’t come soon enough.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionLily Yohannes on developing at Ajax, moving to Lyon, and a ‘surreal’ US debutRead moreA strong center-back pairing, and a strong stopper in front of them, frees up the full-backs to push up and provide width on the attack. We saw glimpses of this in the second game, where a combination of Jordyn Bugg, Emily Sonnett, and Hutton was strong enough to free up Avery Patterson (this time, on her favored right flank) and Lilly Reale to push deep into Portugal’s defensive third. Still, the defensive performance left a lot to be desired; the US were lucky to get away with conceding only once. (Considering the third game’s ultra-inexperienced back line would be apples-and-oranges here; Bugg and Emily Sams, playing in an unusual full-back position, were fantastic in the progression, but they didn’t have much to defend.) Girma’s return will bring a desperately needed steadiness and flowing connectivity to the back.The ongoing question in goal doesn’t help matters. Phallon Tullis-Joyce, who is in stunning form for Manchester United, looked shaky in the first match despite making a few impressive saves. Claudia Dickey was fine in games two and three but was tested far less than Tullis-Joyce. No keeper has cemented their name between the posts, and even when they do, they’ll need time to build up national team experience before they can truly bring leadership to the back.Aerial ability is a weaknessThe US lacked aerial presence across the first two games. All three of Portugal’s goals came from high crosses – two from corners, and one from an arcing ball from Beatriz Fonseca. Going the other way, crosses only resulted in one of the US’s goals against Portugal: a low corner from Ally Sentnor that bounced once before Coffey hammered it home. The US got two goals from set pieces in the New Zealand game, but neither of them were aerial: a short corner played all the way around the box resulted in a goal for Macario, and Coffey floated a free kick into the box that was headed off the post by a New Zealand defender into Sears, who sealed her hat-trick with the tap-in. In all three games, too many quality balls through the air went unanswered.From Touray to Chácon: six standouts from the Under-17 Women’s World CupRead moreHayes told reporters that aerial prowess has more to do with timing than height, so that may point to future efforts to improve the squad’s ability in the air. If they can’t figure out how to be effective targets on offense, they’ll need to dial down the volume of crosses they send in and find alternative routes to goal. On defense, however, failure to strengthen their aerial presence will only make opponents look to exploit the glaring weakness.The team needs time, but that’s no excuseAfter the first disastrous match, Hayes emphasized that much of the team’s disconnection could be blamed on the long period of time since the last camp. It’s a fair point, and it’s safe to assume that had she put forward the same lineup for the second game they would have improved. But the second lineup didn’t need to play a whole game to build remarkable chemistry against a tough opponent.Everyone on the team does need time to mesh with each other, but that can’t and shouldn’t be an excuse for poor playing for much longer. There’s no need for Hayes to keep forcing combinations that don’t work when there are better options that have natural chemistry.After the youngsters’ excellent showing in the second game, Hayes told reporters that she sees them as the “present and the future for the program,” yet she is hesitant to throw uber-young players into senior international play without adequate preparation. That consideration is respectable, but it shouldn’t bar her from building her lineups to be the best they can be. The 2027 World Cup is looming ever closer, and it’s time to begin shaping the roster that she’ll take to Brazil.Explore more on these topicsUSA women's football teamUS sportsWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

At the age of 15 years and 302 days he left the Emirates entranced by a mesmerising performance inthe Carabao Cup win over Brighton.“A tiny smile, that’s what you get with him,” said a proud Arsenal manager when asked after how the understated Dowman had reacted to news he would surpass his under-18s teammate Jack Porter’s record, established last year in the same competition.The word has been out on Dowman among Arsenal fans since he was invited to train with Arteta’s squad at the start of last year when he turned 14. A meticulous progression plan has been mapped out for the player some insiders describe as the most talented they have seen at his age.Dowman became England Under- 19s youngest player last month and their youngest goalscorer just over a fortnight ago. The next big landmark could be breaking Youssoufa Moukoko’s record (16 years and 18 days for Dortmund) as the youngest player in Champions League history. “He needs to cope with all that because it’s happening very, very fast,” Arteta said.View image in fullscreenA young Max Dowman in the youth team at Billericay Town.Photograph: Nick HuttAccording to Hutt, Dowman has been well prepared to deal with the spotlight by his family. Dowman’s father, Rob, an avid Arsenal fan, was heavily involved in discussions that led to his son signing scholarship terms last week amid interest from other clubs. “Max has always been kind of old for his age,” Hutt says. “Very mature, laid-back and he worked incredibly hard at his football. They’re a very grounded family. His mum, Caroline, and Rob, they keep Max grounded. They’re very humble, nice people, very kind of community-focused. So I’m sure they’ve played an important role in getting him ready for where he is now.”Rob was coaching Dowman’s older brother Ethan’s team at Billericay when he first brought Max to the club’s Saturday morning soccer school. Hutt, asked whether a particular memory stands out from Dowman’s five years in the colts section, says: “Oh, no, there’s too many moments with him. You know what they’re like at that age, when they’re six, seven, eight: they’re really good but there’s no guarantee they’re going to make it or do anything. But Max is just … I think all the time he was at Arsenal he’s been playing a couple of years above his age group, so we knew he had a real chance. But until they actually make the debut, as he didagainst Leeds in August, you’re never really sure.”Quick GuideItoje's pride at cousin's Arsenal breakthroughShow'I have passed on the baton': Itoje's pride at Arsenal starletMaro Itoje has admitted he may have to start taking second billing to Arsenal’s latest starlet – his cousin. Andre Harriman-Annous made his first start for Arsenal on Wednesday as they beat Brighton in the Carabao Cup and Itoje revealed he was “incredibly proud” of the 17-year-old.“I am very happy for him,” said the England captain. “He has worked incredibly hard over the last 10 years. They start so young, these footballers. I remember going to his house and his older cousins were putting him through his paces as a seven-year-old. Everyone is really happy and really proud. His mum has been amazing and is making sure there’s a good team around him.”Asked whether Itoje was no longer the big deal in the family, he said: “I have passed on the baton. I guess we need you media guys to do a better job for us and get some more rugby on the back pages. I want him to fly. He has done amazingly well and long may it continue – not only because he is my cousin but I support Arsenal. It is a double whammy.”Robert KitsonPhotograph: David Price/Arsenal FCWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The Dowmans have had a long association with Billericay Town, who play in the Isthmian League Premier Division in England’s seventh tier. Rob Dowman’s father was a goalkeeper for the youth team and Rob played for the club in his childhood before joining the coaching staff.Billericay briefly found themselves in the media spotlight when the Essex businessman Glenn Tamplin signed several former professionals, including Jamie O’Hara and Jermaine Pennant, during his brief spell at the helm. Rob Dowmanjoined the consortiumthat took over when Tamplin departed in 2019 and played a major part in extending the youth section, which has 55 teams, before leaving when he set up his own insurance company.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Max’s two older siblings, Ethan and Imogen, worked behind the bar. It was a real family affair. And Max would always be around the club. In fact, when Arsenal closed down for the summer, Max would come and train back with his old team at Billericay. He even trained with the men’s first team on a few occasions.”Arsenal snapped up three of Dowman’s Billericay teammates after spotting him in 2015, with two of them – Noah Clements and Marley Frohock – making progress at Hale End, even if it has not been quite as spectacular as Dowman’s.View image in fullscreenMax Dowman on his debut against Leeds in August.Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/Reuters“We’ve got boys at Man City, we’ve got boys at Man United, but they’re really just starting to come through now,” Hutt says. “Lots of boys. We’ve got a few junior schoolboy internationals. Essex is a pretty hotbed of football, so there’s lots of talent coming out of here. Obviously, we’re one of the bigger clubs in the area so that helps.”Dowman, who is due to complete his GCSEs next year, regularly returns to his old stamping ground at Billericay, where Hutt says he is a “hero for a lot of the local children”.“Max shows that a young boy from Billericay can end up playing in the Premier League,” he says. “It gives people somebody to look up to.

The forward bought the property from the former Manchester United executive vice-chair Ed Woodward, who had fans at the gates showing their displeasure during his time at Old Trafford. “Because of the protest outside, everybody was worried, so I said: ‘Don’t worry I’ll buy it, get the price down,’” Borini jokes.The former Italy international has a business mind and knows a good deal when it comes along. Joining Salford, however, was certainly not about the money. Following his departure from Sampdoria, where he endured a difficult final season after being ostracised, Borini wanted to play for the love of the game. He returned to his wife Erin’s native north-west, where they had their Cheshire home, and searched for work.After time at a Professional Footballers’ Association training camp for unemployed players, Borini was allowed to train at Salford to stay in shape and a month later, on 17 October, he signed until January after an injury to one of the strikers. “I said to the club: ‘Do what you can. I’m not going to negotiate over a contract and a few hundred a year or day. It’s about playing football, it’s about you giving me the opportunity and me giving you the same opportunity to get promoted.’”The 34-year-old has played for Chelsea, Liverpool and Milan and was an unused substitute in the 2012 European Championship final, but he was the one chasing Salford, aware of their enhanced status thanks to their co-owners Gary Neville and David Beckham. Others with his reputation and CV might have waited for the calls to come. An offer from Sydney arrived but the family upheaval was deemed too much.View image in fullscreenFabio Borini by the ‘Italian padel’ courts he has helped to build at Worsley Sports Club.Photograph: Joel Goodman/The GuardianBorini’s friendship with Salford’s assistant coach, Alex Bruce, helped to open the door there. “They said: ‘You come and train, give a little bit to the group, be around the guys and help us through in a way to understand if we’re doing the right things or the wrong things and you get fit,’” Borini says. “Then an opportunity came along [to sign] and I said I want to play football. It doesn’t really matter the league or context, it’s about football. Salford is being built to be a proper football club. It’s not like they’re throwing money around for no reason … it’s football people doing a football club.”Borini has played under some of the great Champions League-winning coaches, including Carlo Ancelotti, José Mourinho and Luis Enrique. Salford’s head coach, Karl Robinson, is Liverpudlian, like Borini’s wife.“He’s a lot worse than my wife,” says Borini of understanding Robinson’s accent. “He is very open to conversation, which is a clever way to approach it. I see him chatting to players all the time. He picks one or the other one and just asks a question or makes a silly joke, which is enough to break the ice from a distance–Ancelotti was doing that.”Borini, having ticked off the Merseyside, Milan, Tyne-Wear and Rome derbies, made his debut in a Greater Manchester one, coming on in a 1-0 win against Oldham in front of 4,000 people. “The buildup to the game, the preparation and even the tension for the game is different but then once you get to the stadium, the vibration I call it, the feelings, are the same because it’s always the same game,” says Borini. “I made a joke after the game that there’s a few elbows flying off the ball here that normally don’t happen.”Borini and his family feel at home in England’s north-west. Daughter Stella has just started school and son Lando arrived in July. Knowing the area well, Borini and his wife have offered advice totheir old friend Gianluigi Donnarummaon moving to the area. The players spent more than two years together at San Siro and have been reunited in Manchester, at opposite ends of the pyramid.View image in fullscreenFabio Borini wins a header for Salford against Oldham.Photograph: Phill Smith/MI News/NurPhoto/Getty ImagesBorini wants to play for two or three more seasons but knows he is in the twilight of his career. He is studying global football business management with the hope of becoming a sporting director or chief executive. “I like to be in charge,” he says with a smile.He has started a business, Padel 16, opening four courts at Worsley Sports Club in Salford. There are lawn bowls and a cricket club on site, too. “I did try bowls in a different club close to me, which I like; it’s not bad. Cricket? No.” Padel has become a popular pastime among footballers.

But my wife has been in touch with his wife to help them out, giving him some tips on where to live – usual stuff which we always like when people did it with us. And we know how difficult it is, especially for someone like Gigi, who I know pretty well. Even if he looks like he’s a big lad, he is quite shy, he doesn’t know much English. It is difficult to move again and obviously being in the team straight away gives you less time to sort out all the other things. So my wife did all the bits, but I will invite them over for good wine. He knows that he can come to mine and eat good Italian food.”The road to Wembley for Salford and Borini starts at home to League One Lincoln City in the FA Cup first round on Saturday, with Borini poised for his first start after cameos in victories against Oldham and Gillingham. Borini has fond memories of reaching theLeague Cup final in 2014with Sunderland, scoring the opener. Manchester City ended up winning the trophy but the strike earned Borini cult status at the Stadium of Light, enhanced by his knife-in-mouth celebration. He was spotted in theaway end at Old Traffordthis month among his adoring fans and maintains a close connection.View image in fullscreenSunderland’s Fabio Borini celebrates after opening the scoring in the 2014 League Cup final against Manchester City.Photograph: Eddie Keogh/Reuters“Sat? No. Standing a lot,” he says of his Old Trafford trip. “It was different. It was definitely a fulfilling experience. Sometimes you have to hold your emotions a little bit because you have a lump [in your throat]. It has been almost 10 years since I left and I saw two people wearing my shirt and they didn’t know I was coming, so that’s fantastic. It is good because you see that happening with the iconic players. You don’t expect it with me, that I’m still playing. But it was fun.”Borini and Erin donated their wedding gifts and money earned from selling photographs of the big day to a celebrity magazine to stem cell transplant charity Anthony Nolan. Borini remains philanthropic, working closely with Still I Rise,which has schools for vulnerable children in seven countries and was founded by the Nobel Peace Prize nominee Nicolò Govoni. “My mum always passed me his books, explaining what he was doing, and then you get the emotional connection of doing things the right way. He slated a few bigger organisations [regarding] how they do charity, and I like his ways: he is direct, he doesn’t care who he goes against, as long as it’s honest.”Euphoric moments such as the one at Wembley are why Borini is still going, desperate not to lose the love of the game. “I squeezed the lemon and got all the juice out,” he says of his career. “I fulfilled everything I could possibly, probably overachieved at times for what I possess because I knew and I know players that are a lot more talented than me and reach a lot less or for less time. I’m happy with what I did. You want to finish your career with no regrets and I think I’m doing that.”Explore more on these topicsSalford CityLeague TwointerviewsShareReuse this content"

There was immediate concern around the young forward from Sarina Wiegman and her teammates. “It doesn’t look good,”the England manager saidafter the game. “We don’t know yet but I’m not very positive about what I’ve seen.”It has been a whirlwind year for the striker who is on loan at Brighton from Arsenal this season. She made her Lionesses debutin the Nations League against Belgiumin April, scoring just 41 seconds after coming on to the pitch. She was included in Wiegman’s squad for this summer’s Euros, playing a crucial role in England’s success. She made headlines for her late equalisers –in the 81st minute against Swedenand96th minute against Italy– to help her nation secure back-to-back titles and was named the Uefa’s young player of the tournament.She has featured heavily for Brighton this season, playing almost every minute in their WSL campaign and scoring one goal. The club posted a statement on social media saying: “We can confirm that Michelle Agyemang sustained a ruptured ACL injury in England’s match against Australia on Tuesday.”It added: “Michelle will miss the remainder of the season and we are in contact with her parent club Arsenal and will work together to determine a treatment and rehabilitation programme for Michelle.

TheBianconerihad not, in fact, lost him down the back of the sofa, but instead relieved him of his dutiesafter an eight-game winless run.That was their longest dry stretch since 2009. Claudio Ranieri got the boot back then, and it was no surprise to see Tudor meet the same fate now. Juventus had failed to score a goal in his final four matches, culminating in a1-0 loss to Lazioon Sunday night. “I’m living in the present,” he insisted afterward. “I don’t give a stuff about the future.” Yet it came for him the next day all the same.Did he ever stand a chance? Appointed to replace Thiago Motta on a short-term deal last March, Tudor achieved the objective set for him: securing Champions League qualification. Still, Juventus’s decision to extend his contract felt like it was made of expediency more than conviction.McTominay’s form cools Conte’s fire after tempestuous week for Napoli | Nicky BandiniRead moreAfter the season ended, Juve had less than a month to prepare for the Club World Cup. By the time they let go of sporting director Cristiano Giuntoli – who carried the can for appointing Motta and poor choices in the transfer market – then replaced him Damien Comolli, that was down to a couple of weeks.Tudor was reluctant to continue through the summer tournament without knowing he had a longer-term contract in place. Comolli, who took up his position on 1 June, can hardly have explored every option as thoroughly as he would have liked before extending the manager’s deal on the 13th.Does he regret that choice now? Comolli has had to scramble on a tighter timeframe to replace Tudor this week. Juventus are expected to confirm the appointment of the former Italy manager Luciano Spalletti imminently. In the meantime, Massimo Brambilla, head coach of their NextGen side, led the first team against Udinese on Wednesday evening.“I had one training session,” Brambilla told Dazn. “Two days with the team in total. On Monday morning I led a practice for the under-23s, then in the afternoon I came here.”View image in fullscreenDusan Vlahovic leaps for joy after scoring an early penalty against Udinese on Wednesday.Photograph: Daniele Badolato/Juventus FC/Getty ImagesHe must have done something right. Juventus broke their winless streak with a 3-1 victory. They were aided by some generous defending, Udinese giving away penalties early and late on that were converted by Dusan Vlahovic and Kenan Yildiz respectively. Still, this was the most threatening they had looked going forward in weeks.Brambilla’s main innovation was to allow Vlahovic to start in a front two, a dynamic which has often seemed to suit him better, playing alongside Loïs Openda where typically Tudor had preferred a lone striker. The selection of Filip Kostic and Andrea Cambiaso as wing-backs also set a more attacking intent for a side that has often used Pierre Kalulu – previously a central defender – on the right.The greater impact may simply have been a different tone. Tudor cut an increasingly agitated figure in recent weeks, his exasperation at every wrong touch made explicit by reactions on the touchline. Allied to the frustrations of supporters – some of whom whistled at the Juventus squad when they came out to warm up on Wednesday – it made a heavy atmosphere for the players.It was not always thus. Juventus began this Serie A season with three straight wins. The third was abarmy, brilliant 4-3 victory over rivals Inter– believed by many to be the best team in the country. For an encore, Tudor’s sidedrew 4-4 against Borussia Dortmundin the Champions League.The impression was of a team imperfect but irresistibly alive. Where Motta had done too much, failing in his attempts to implement the fluid positional interchange that brought him success with Bologna, Tudor was keeping it simple with man-to-man football and direct lines of attack.View image in fullscreenKenan Yildiz (left) has been Juventus’ most consistent performer in attack this season.Photograph: Alberto Lingria/ReutersAs quick as they came, though, the goals dried up. Juventus signed Openda and Jonathan David this summer to add depth to their attack but Tudor’s preferred 3-4-2-1 had them rotating with Vlahovic as the No 9. Nobody had time to catch their rhythm. The most consistent performer in the attack has been the 20-year-old Yildiz but even he has had hot and cold moments swapping between No 10 and the left wing.Tudor did eventually change to a back fouragainst Como, then a 3-5-2 against Lazio, but results only got worse. In every shape, his team wanted to press high but often allowed itself to become stretched.The manager was frequently tetchy, accusing the press of exaggerating every negative result. Before the game against Como he sought to frame Juventus almost as an underdog, claiming his opposite number Cesc Fàbregas had been given all the players he wanted in the summer while his own options were far more restricted.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Almost a quarter of that went on Douglas Luiz, Nicolás González and Teun Koopmeiners. The first two playing elsewhere and the latter is yet to show anything close to the form that he did for Atalanta.But Juventus were making poor choices long before they appointed Giuntoli two years ago. Many still point to the €100m signing of a 33-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo as the moment when a club who dominated Italian football through the 2010s lost sight of what had made them successful. But the Portuguese did score more than 100 goals in three seasons. Vlahovic, signed for €80m at the start of 2022, has 63 to date.It will fall to Spalletti to make sense of a squad whose overall potential still feels hard to assess. There are some gems here – Yildiz most of all, but also Khéphren Thuram and Francisco Conceição as talents to develop.

He coached Yildiz in the NextGen side and hailed the player’s development. “He’s grown in his physicality and self-awareness,” said the coach. “But he always had quality and personality.”If only Juventus had shown the same patience with some of their other NextGen talents, where might they be? Instead, they sold many to fund the purchase of players who have flopped. Dean Huijsen now starts for Real Madrid. Matias Soulé is the star of a Roma team joint-first in the league, six clear of Juve.Spalletti cannot undo these mistakes. He arrives with a point to prove after beingsacked by Italy, the chip he has long worn on his shoulder only deepened by a feeling that he was treated unfairly by both the Italian Football Federation and the nation’s press.His coaching credentials are strong – the man wholed Napoli to their first Scudetto in 33 years, who before that won a league title with Zenit in Russia and authored great tactical innovations before all that at Roma. Still, the task before him is significant. Juventus’s problems run deeper than the identity of the man on the bench.PosTeamPGDPts1Napoli98212Roma96213Inter Milan911184AC Milan97185Como96166Bologna96157Juventus93158Cremonese91149Atalanta961310Udinese9-41211Torino9-61212Lazio841113Sassuolo8-11014Cagliari8-2915Parma9-5716Lecce9-7617Verona9-9518Pisa8-7419Fiorentina9-8420Genoa9-93Explore more on these topicsJuventusSerie AEuropean club footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Steve Borthwick and members of his coaching staff have had discussions with Brendon McCullum and want their team to make a fast and furious start against Australia in the Quilter Nations Series on Saturday.There is a collective desire within the England camp to make a statement over the coming month and Borthwick and his defence coach, Richard Wigglesworth, have been picking McCullum’s brain on the best ways to encourage a positive mindset. “We met Brendon McCullum and his coaching staff a few weeks ago,” said Wigglesworth. “We had a sit down and a coffee in Manchester which was very enjoyable.Australia will target Freeman at centre in England clash, George Gregan warnsRead more“I asked him a lot around how he changed mindsets in English cricket which was really interesting. But then we got into the technicalities of coaching someone one-on-one and what that looks like. I wouldn’t want to say there was one main thing because we sat for a good period of time and took loads from it, but they’re on to a good thing.“We [also] want to be a team that can win in multiple different ways and adapt because every game is different. We feel we’ve got a dynamic team so we want to play that way.”Despite a sequence of seven successive victories this year England fans are still awaiting the launch of a spectacular new “Borthball” era to compare with theeye-catching cricketing equivalentled by McCullum and Ben Stokes. The next month, however, offers the chance to take a significant step forward with the draw for the 2027 Rugby World Cup set to be conducted in December.Beating the Wallabies on Saturday, hard on the heels of the British & Irish Lions’summer series triumph, would also help to counter Australia’s success in last weekend’sfirst rugby league Ashes Testbefore the start of cricket’s Ashes series in Perth on 21 November. There are several avid cricket fans in the England rugby squad and Wigglesworth believes the “great rivalry” with Australia motivates both teams. “I think both sides really enjoy playing against each other because there’s something there. Hopefully we stick one on the board on Saturday.”View image in fullscreenEngland’s defence coach Richard Wigglesworth, with Steve Borthwick, met Brendon McCullum to pick his brains.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PAWigglesworth was also part of the Lions management who tasted success in Australiain the summer and believes all the English coaches and players involved gained plenty from the experience. He has diplomatically resisted the temptation to consult Geoff Parling, the recent Australia assistant coach now in charge at Leicester, but says the intensity of the tour has had “a big impact” on his coaching approach.“If you’re working with such elite players, you can’t help but learn, because they’re usually the best teachers. I absolutely loved it, learned loads, we had a great time and we won. I think the players have noticed a difference in the lads who were lucky enough to go on a Lions tour. Until you’ve been on one you probably can’t feel like it. And the group who were in Argentina have also definitely grown. So the two have come back together really nicely.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A year ago Australia took advantage of some defensive uncertaintyto win 42-37but the visitors may find fewer holes this time. “We definitely want a dynamic defence,” said Wigglesworth, also hoping to encourage his players to respond positively in adversity.“What I love about the game of rugby is that every game is different and can be won in different ways. Is it wet? What’s the referee doing? All these things go into the melting pot.” The former Saracens and Sale scrum-half is also adamant that empowering the players is the way ahead for England rather than constantly micromanaging them.“What I’m not going to do is go this defence has to change because of me and what I believe. The more we grow together, the more we know what everyone wants from each other and what’s going to make us a really good team. Then the more the players get to take a lead on that. Eventually you get to that sweet spot of empowerment that is productive, not empowerment that is setting them up to fail.”Explore more on these topicsEngland rugby union teamAustralia rugby union teamRugby unionAutumn Nations SeriesnewsShareReuse this content"

The Portuguese has won 21 and lost 19 of his 52 games – a 40% victory rate.“It was a journey, a big journey,” he said of his first 12 months. “It was tough, really tough, good moments and bad moments. I learned a lot that is really important. I found out that even in my lower moments I can stick with the things I believe and that is a good thing for anyone to understand. Today the answer is different from three weeks ago. One of the biggest honours of my life to be here and I want to continue here for many years.”Ruben Amorim’s year at United: renaissance of hope on a long, difficult journeyRead moreUnited have won their past three Premier League matches,against Sunderland,LiverpoolandBrighton. On Saturday they travel to Nottingham Forest, led by Sean Dyche, who will take charge of his third game. In August, when not working as a manager, Dyche claimed he could perform better than Amorim with United’s squad. “I bet I could win more games with that squad playing a 4-4-2,” he said.Amorim shrugged off Dyche’s comments. “Maybe it’s true that if we play 4-4-2 we win more games,” he said. “But I always said that I have a way of playing that is going to take a while, but in the future it’s going to be better. I can look at Sean Dyche as a manager and as a pundit. If you are a pundit and you don’t say very strong things, I don’t want to watch you. So I understand that it’s a completely different job. I know that Sean Dyche is really smart and he knows how to play the game.“He also understands that it is one thing when we are seeing the game and talking about the game, the other thing is to coach a team. I have nothing to say, I just want to win the next game.”Lisandro Martínez, who has not played since sustaining a knee injury in February, has resumed full training. Amorim said: “He wants to go to [play in] this one [Forest] – he’s not going to. He’s done training with us but we changed some things in the exercises, so slowly he’s going to get better.” Amorim said he was not certain whether Harry Maguire would be fit.Jason Wilcox has suggested United’s3–1 loss at Brentfordon 27 September caused him to particularly scrutinise Amorim’s performance. The defeat came after Chelsea had been beaten and Amorim spoke of needing to finally win two consecutive league matches.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s an opportunity. I just knew that was the case already, so it hasn’t been a distraction or frustration. You often get dealt a set of cards and and while you may shuffle the deck a little bit or try to steal a card from somewhere else, if those cards aren’t available, you shuffle what you’ve got and try to put out your best hand.“And we feel that we’ve got a hand that can challenge England - but we know how good they are and that might not be enough, but we’re certainly going to give it a try.”Asked whether Rugby Australia could have paid for the players’ release, Schmidt added: “No, I don’t think you can. While the Premiership clubs get a payout from the Rugby Football Union, there is a boundary for foreign players to be allowed to play. It wasn’t a case of paying money to get someone released.”Still, he couldn’t resist a gentle dig at England counterpart Steve Borthwick, who had suggested Australia had an advantage because they had been together for four months while he had only had four sessions with his players.“We’ve had two sessions, actually,” smiled Schmidt. “We’ve just come from Japan where we made 13 changes. Cohesion-wise, and also in terms of fatigue, we’ve had 15 Test matches across 22 weeks in nine countries, and 10 different time zones. So I’d be happy to swap that for four trainings, to be honest.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sometimes you’ve got to hold your hand up and say they’ve been the better team.”India chase down record total to stun champions Australia and reach World Cup finalRead moreThe problem is that England keep coming across better teams, and in the past two years they have lost bilateral ODI series to West Indies, Australia, West Indies again, India, South Africa and now New Zealand, while winning only on the one occasion they got to play West Indies at home.“We’ve got five, six, maybe seven batters who would get into almost every team in the world,” Brook said. “They just haven’t performed well enough. It’s disappointing. It’s disappointing for the fans, who want to watch us because they know that we play such an exciting brand of ricket. It was only a couple of games agoagainst South Africa when we got 400, so we’re not a million miles away. It’s just about a couple of scores here and there and then we nail it down, and hopefully we do find that template we can keep going forward with.”England’s batters have underperformed so badly in this series that Jamie Overton, the No 8, outscored all of them but Brook in the first game and all of them including Brook in the second, without himself reaching 50.The team’s struggles in the format are such that they have dipped to eighth in the world rankings, with West Indies and Bangladesh close behind.If they are still likely to qualify for the 2027 World Cup, continued poor results could insert an embarrassing kink into the process. Places will be given to the top eight teams in the rankings on 31 March 2027, excluding co-hosts South Africa, currently sixth, and Zimbabwe, who are 11th. The next two teams on the list will be forced to battle through a 10-team qualifying tournament to claim a spot.England’s fixtures over the next 13 months are unlikely to offer many easy ranking points. Before February 2027 they will play three-game series against India and Sri Lanka at home, and away in Sri Lanka, Australia, South Africa and Pakistan – the latter as part of a tri-series also featuring Sri Lanka (again).Including Saturday’s final fixture against New Zealand they have 20 ODIs scheduled before the qualifying deadline, of which 14 are away and all are against sides currently ranked in the top six. Meanwhile both Bangladesh and West Indies, ninth and 10th in the rankings, play the majority of their games at home, with the former having multiple opportunities to boost their points total in series against theoretically lesser opponents, with five games against Zimbabwe and six against Ireland.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Also curious was their route from Hamilton, wherethe second game in the serieswas played on Wednesday, to Wellington: though there were six direct flights between the cities on Thursday, the most obvious route and the one the home side took, England instead drove for two hours in the wrong direction before taking a longer flight from Auckland. The trip took them about five and a half hours, while their opponents were checking in to their new hotel after only three.Explore more on these topicsEngland cricket teamHarry BrookNew Zealand cricket teamCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

We would also like to support his teammate who was bowling in the nets – this accident has impacted two young men and our thoughts are with he and his family as well.”Cummins said the details were still “fairly scant” given the trauma suffered by the people involved. “A group of boys were having a practice session and a boy was hit with a ball that was thrown with a sidearm and hit him in the neck, in a similar sort of accident like Phil Hughes suffered,” Cummins said.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

There will be a time to do something, we just need to make sure that we focus on the people who are directly impacted in the immediate time.”Safety measures have been introduced since Hughes’s death that now require all batters facing fast or medium-pace bowling inCricketAustralia-sanctioned competitions to wear both a helmet that meets the latest standard and a neck protector.While the same rules apply for helmets in community cricket, junior and grassroots competitions have avoided the mandate for neck protectors, which are seen within some circles as restrictive and uncomfortable. There are also no explicit requirements for safety equipment when facing sidearms.The governing body issued guidelines for community cricket in 2023, “strongly recommending” that everyone wear a neck protector alongside a helmet, however it stopped short of a mandate. Its own frequently asked questions document covered why there was no mandate.“CA recognises that there needs to be a transition period for participants to develop understanding about how to play with neck protectors, fit and measure them so they are appropriate to play in, and the potential cost associated with them,” it stated.A leading neck protector known as Stemguard costs $70 for adults and $45 for children and clips on to the back of helmets.Cricket Australia chair, Mike Baird, flagged on Thursday that the rules would be reviewed. “Clearly there are things that we have to learn from this, but right now we are concerned about the family and trying to support them in every way,” he said.Explore more on these topicsCricketCricket AustraliaAustralia sportMelbourneVictorianewsShareReuse this content"

Other runners from the yard at single-figure odds include The Lion In Winter (Mile) and Havana Anna (Juvenile Turf Sprint), and the Ballydoyle squadron is, as so often, at the heart of the European challenge at the meeting.O’Brien needs a single success this weekend to take sole control of the record for Breeders’ Cup with 21, one more than the late D Wayne Lukas, who died in June.It would be a remarkable achievement for an overseas trainer to sit ahead of such names as Lukas, Bob Baffert (19) and Chad Brown (19), but he is not the only European trainer with great expectations this weekend.Francis-Henri Graffard, who has already won both the King George VI & Queen Elizabeth Stakes and the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe this year, will attempt to complete the set of the world’s most prestigious mile-and-a-half turf events with three different horses when Goliath goes to post for the Turf. And in the same race, Charlie Appleby’s popular gelding Rebel’s Romance could become only the third horse to win a Breeders’ Cup race three times, and set a new record for earnings by a European-trained horse in the process.Andrew Balding, meanwhile, is hoping to register a win at the meeting for the first time, and has three runners over the two days. Pacific Mission is an outsider for the Juvenile Fillies’ Turf on Friday, while Jonquil (Mile) and the 4-1 shot See The Fire, in the Filly & Mare Turf, will go to post on Saturday.“I was here [at Del Mar] for a summer when I was 20,” Balding, who is now 54, said on Wednesday. “That’s the last time I was here and nothing seems to have changed.View image in fullscreenTrainer Andrew Balding at Del Mar racecourse on Wednesday.Photograph: Steven Cargill/racingfotos.com/Shutterstock“It’s an important event and always has been and I remember as a kid, the first years when it was new and really exciting.“Dad [the trainer, Ian] took Selkirk out to Gulfstream Park and I can remember the buzz and everything about the place, and [the champion sprinter] Lochsong in the Sprint [for her final race in 1994].”Both Pacific Mission and See The Fire have been drawn in unfavourable wide stalls this weekend, which will give their respective jockeys, Colin Keane and Oisin Murphy, plenty of thinking to do.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Thursday tipsShowStratford-On-Avon12.47 Dickens 1.17 Followango 1.47 Brace For Landing 2.17 Quaviste 2.47 Range 3.17 Western Soldier 3.47 Faitique De L’Isle 4.17 Princess Of BalleaBath12.55 Takeitorleaveit 1.25 Heroics 1.55 Platinum Prince 2.25 Rating 2.55 Marching Mac 3.25 Cameley Days 3.55 Roman Spring 4.25 Sub ThirteenNewcastle1.08 Cueros 1.38 Sir Carnegie 2.08 Fairly Fulling 2.38 Chasingouttheblues 3.08 Hostile Hotelier 3.38 Half Shot 4.08 Monte A BordSouthwell4.30 Big Shot Veto 5.00 Birdcall 5.30 Lightning Touch 6.00 Woodstock 6.30 Taranjerine 7.00 Covert Legend 7.30 Springbok 8.00 Imola 8.30 Spun To GoldChelmsford4.45 Reader 5.15 Miss Ayala 5.45 Applesandpears 6.15 Aramis Grey (nap) 6.45 Flowstate 7.15 Juno Star (nb) 7.45 Must Believe 8.15 Wyld BillWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“From that draw, I’ll leave it to the jockeys,” Balding said. “See The Fire needs an end-to-end gallop to aim at and it will be interesting to see her over an extra furlong on Saturday, it might make a big difference. She’s very high class on her day, the only thing is, it’s the end of a long season.”What had promised to be one of the best ever runnings of the Breeders’ Cup Classic lost one of its stars on Wednesday when Sovereignty, the Godolphin-owned Kentucky Derby winner and the probable favourite, was ruled out by Bill Mott, his trainer, as he is suffering from an infection.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Friday tipsShowUttoxeter12.25 La Conquiere 12.55 Heeztheboy 1.25 Just Golden 1.55 Maximum Offers 2.30 The Long Walk 3.05 Junker D’Allier 3.40 Tigers Moon 4.15 Plains DrifterNewmarket12.40 Opera Wave 1.10 Man Of Vision 1.40 Thunder Star 2.12 Spicy Marg (nap) 2.47 Castle Rock 3.22 Play Me 3.57 HibernateWetherby12.47 The Four Sixes 1.17 Blue Carpet 1.47 High Dancer 2.20 Ammes 2.55 Thistle Ask (nb) 3.30 Princess Milania 4.05 Duel Au SoleilSouthwell4.10 Betelgeuse 4.45 Lady Milton 5.15 Caballo Grande 5.45 Lakers 6.15 Juno Star 6.45 Desert Spring 7.15 Al Arbeed 7.45 Tonal 8.15 Back From DubaiWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Prior to Sovereignty’s scratching, the field for Saturday’s showpiece had been expected to include the first three home in this year’s Kentucky Derby as well as the first three from last year’s Classic. Sierra Leone and Fierceness, the 1-2 here 12 months ago, are now vying for favouritism at around 3-1, with Japan’s Forever Young, third in that race, at 6-1 and Journalism, the runner-up in the Kentucky Derby, the first three-year-old in the betting at 7-1.Runners from the O’Brien yard dominate the markets for the juvenile turf races and two short-priced favourites – Precise and Gstaad in the Juvenile Fillies’ Turf and Juvenile Turf, respectively – provide Christophe Soumillon with gilt-edged chances to improve what is, on the face of it, a distinctly underwhelming record at the meeting.Shirocco, in the Turf at Belmont Park in 2005, is Soumillon’s only Breeders’ Cup winner to date, and while it was very much a ride to post in the scrapbook – Soumillon dictated the race from second place behind a tearaway front-runner – it seems strange that such a talented and prolific big-race jockey has not added another.Precise and Gstaad are priced up at around 11-10 and 6-5 respectively, so punters can be forgiven for asking whether one Breeders’ Cup winner in 20 years is a sufficiently bankable record on a tight, unforgiving track like Del Mar.The reality, though, is that Soumillon has a career total of just 10 rides at the meeting, and he also suffered a wretched slice of luck in 2020 when he was ruled out at the last minute by a positive Covid test. He could only look on, presumably from self-isolation, as two of his booked rides came home in front.Quick GuideDeath announced of apprentice Tommie JakesShowApprentice jockey Tommie Jakes has died, aged 19, the Injured Jockeys Fund and Professional Jockeys Association have announced.Jakes rode 59 winners over the past three years on the Flat in Britain, including 19 in 2025. His most recent success came aboard George Boughey's Fouroneohfever at Catterick on October 18 and having ridden at Nottingham on Wednesday, he was due to have two booked rides at Chelmsford on Thursday evening.A joint-statement from the IJF and PJA read: \"It is with deep sadness that we report the death of licensed apprentice jockey Tommie Jakes, 19, who tragically died at home this morning near Newmarket.\"Tommie was a much-loved son and brother, and a popular member of George Boughey's racing team. His parents Jeremy and Tonie ask that their privacy is respected at this terrible time.\"In a post on his X account, Boughey said: \"We are heartbroken by the news that our apprentice jockey Tommie Jakes has passed away. Tommie has been an integral and much-loved member of our team. He was not only a hugely talented young rider with so much to look forward to, but an incredibly kind, popular and hard-working young man. We will miss him immensely.\"Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.In an alternative, Covid-free universe, Soumillon’s strike-rate might well be around 30%, so he is probably not a jockey with a Breeders’ Cup problem. After Monday’s post-position draw, however, he has a much more difficult hand to work with, as both Precise and Gstaad have ended up in the worst possible stall, on the wide outside of 13- and 14-runner fields respectively.Precise has at least 9lb in hand of her field on Timeformratings but that could count for little if, as seems likely, she has only a couple of rivals behind her at the first turn. At that point, her chance depends on luck rather than judg ment and at such short odds, it makes sense to look for an each-way alternative.View image in fullscreenPacific Mission, See The Fire and Jonquil train on the track during morning workouts prior to the Breeders’ Cup meeting.Photograph: Orlando Ramirez/Getty ImagesQueen Of Hawaii (11.05pm, all times GMT)has gone under the radar a little in the run-up to Friday’s race, but Joseph O’Brien, her trainer, has an impressive Breeders’ Cup record, with three winners in the last three years, and she has progressed by the race so far, presumably with this target in mind. She has the tactical speed to allow Dylan Browne McMonagle to exploit her draw in stall two and could outrun her price of around 14-1.Soumillon may fare better aboardGstaad (12.25am), who has a little more early speed than Precise, while the fastest pace of all on Friday could well be set by Wesley Ward’sSchwarzenegger(9.45pm)in the Juvenile Turf Sprint. He went through the first quarter in 21.47sec last time out and still clung on to the lead at the wire, so he may be able to overcome a wide draw in 11.The remaining two races on the opening-day card are on the dirt, wherePercy’s Bar (10.25pm)andTed Noffey (11.45pm)should run big races in the Juvenile Fillies’ and Juvenile, respectively.Percy’s Bar lost the Grade One Spinaway Stakes in the stewards’ room last time out after giving Tommy Jo a bump in the stretch, but Tommy Jo was having a hard time getting past her and Percy’s Bar looks a value price for the rematch.Ted Noffey, meanwhile, has two Grade One wins in the book already by a combined margin of nearly 11 lengths and could well be the hottest favourite on the card.Explore more on these topicsBreeders' CupHorse racingHorse racing tipsAidan O'BrienUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The Pixel 10 Pro Fold builds on last year’s excellent9 Pro Foldby doing away with gears in the hinge along its spine allowing it to deal with dust, which has been the achilles heel of all foldable phones until now, gumming up the works in a way that just isn’t a problem for regular slab phones.But, as with all foldable phones, the Pixel is very expensive, costing £1,749 (€1,899/$1,799/A$2,699), sitting far above the £1,199Pixel 10 Pro XLand rubbing shoulders with the equally priceySamsung Galaxy Z Fold 7.View image in fullscreenGoogle says the new gearless hinge of the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is capable of surviving more than 10 years of folding.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianImproved durability aside, not a lot has visibly changed on the outside since thePixel9 Pro Fold. The external screen is a smidgen larger thanks to thinner bezels, and the inside and outside screens are slightly brighter than before. The Fold is a great shape when closed for phone-based tasks and can comfortably fit two full-size apps side by side on the excellent internal screen when open.However, the Pixel is heavy and looks chunky compared withSamsung’s impressively thin and light Z Fold 7. It is 258g, which you can feel in use and the pocket, while being significantly thicker than a normal phone and the latest rivals.View image in fullscreenQi2 charging support in the back opens up compatibility with a wide variety of magnetic accessories, including the excellentTwelve South Curve Nanostand (left) and theQDOS SnapStand Qi2 charger(right).Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Fold has the same Google Tensor G5 chip as the rest of the Pixel 10 line with 16GB of RAM and at least 256GB of storage. It performs just as well as thePixel 10 Pro, feeling rapid in use and capable of handling most tasks without breaking a sweat. Those seeking the highest frame rates in high-end games are better served by rivals with Qualcomm’s top Snapdragon chip, however.As with all foldables, the battery life of the Fold varies a lot depending on which screen you use most. On light days with about five hours of active screen use spread equally between the inside and outside displays, mostly on wifi, the Pixel managed about 38 to 40 hours between charges. On heavier days on 5G with more inside screen use, it lasted about 28 hours, ending the day with 25% left in the tank. That’s not terrible but is some way behind the best rivals or big-screen slab phones, including thePixel 10 Pro XL.View image in fullscreenA full charge takes 90 minutes, hitting 50% in 30 minutes with a 30W or greater USB-C power adaptor (not included). It also supports 15W Qi2 wireless charging.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianSpecificationsOutside screen:6.4in FHD+ 120Hz OLED (408ppi)Inside screen:8in 120Hz OLED (373ppi)Processor:Google Tensor G5RAM:16GBStorage:256GB, 512GB or 1TBOperating system:Android16Camera:48MP wide, 10.5MP ultrawide, 10.8MP 5x telephoto; two 10MP selfie camerasConnectivity:5G, eSim, USB-C, wifi 7, NFC, Bluetooth 6, UWB, Thread, GNSSWater resistance:IP68 (1.5 metres for 30 minutes)Dimensions folded:155.2 x 76.3 x 10.8mmDimensions unfolded:155.2 x 150.4 x 5.2mmWeight:258gAndroid 16, Magic Cue and GeminiView image in fullscreenWhen running two apps on screen at once, one can be pushed beyond the edge to make more space. Tapping it brings the app back into full view.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Fold runs the same Android 16 software as the rest of thePixel 10 Pro line, which introduces a bold and colourful appearance plus lots of cutting-edge AI tools crammed into almost every corner of the phone.Some of the highlights include the Gemini chatbot, which can see and hear what you do, interact with your apps and is generally quite useful, plus a new real-time translation system for phone calls that replicates the caller’s voice.Magic Cue is the standout feature, which is a little helper that runs in the background on your device, processing your data from various Google apps and popping up with timely information when you need it. It understands context, so when a friend texts to ask about when your flight lands it will suggest your flight details from your calendar so you can paste them straight into your conversation, or when you call a business it will show your order details from Gmail right in the phone app. It is low-key great.It also has a few modifications to make the most of the big internal screen. A task bar at the bottom of the display makes putting apps into split screen easy. You can also resize apps beyond the border of the screen, similar to theHonor Magic V5andOnePlus Open, which adds a bit of flexibility to running two apps side by side.The Fold also comes with a subscription forGoogle AI Profor a year, worth £19 a month, granting access to more powerful Gemini AI models and 2TB of cloud storage for photos, files and email. The phone will receive updatesuntil October 2032.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenThe recycled aluminium frame feels high quality and solid.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe batteryis rated to lastin excess of 1,000 full charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity. The phone is repairable by Google, third-party shops or self-repairwith manualsandparts due to be available.The Pixel 10 Pro Fold contains 29% recycled materials by weight including aluminium, cobalt, copper, glass, gold, plastic, rare-earth elements, tin and tungsten. The company breaks down thephone’s environmental impactin its report and willrecycle old devicesfor free.CameraView image in fullscreenThe camera app has multiple modes but it is easiest to shoot photos with the Pixel closed like a regular phone.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe 10 Pro Fold has a very similar camera set up to last year’s 9 Pro Fold and the newPixel 10, including a 48-megapixel main, 10.5MP ultra wide and a 10.8MP 5x telephoto camera, which out-zooms folding phone rivals, plus two 10MP selfie cameras.The main camera shoots good photos across a range of conditions, although it can suffer from a little blur and grain at lower light levels. Google’s night mode is still the best in the business when it gets really dark. The ultra-wide camera is solid, while the 5x optical zoom telephoto camera can meaningfully close the distance to objects. The latter can be a bit soft on detail in less than ideal light. Just like theregular Pixel 10the camera shoots good photos and video most will be pleased with, but it can’t match thePixel 10 Pro line, which for this price you might expect.The Fold has a few tricks of its own, including various shooting modes using both screens or propped up at angles when partly folded, plus the ability to shoot selfies with the main camera. The handy Made You Look feature shows an animation on the outside screen that reacts when your child looks its way and smiles, keeping their attention long enough for you to shoot a photo, although unfortunately it uses one of the selfie cameras, not the primary camera, so it’s more for fun than a great photo.PriceThe Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold costs from£1,749(€1,899/$1,799/A$2,699).For comparison, thePixel 10costs£799,Pixel 10 Procosts£999, thePixel 10 Pro XLcosts£1,199, theSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 7costs£1,799and theHonor Magic V5costs£1,699.99.VerdictThe Pixel 10 Pro Fold is a minor update to the already good9 Pro Fold from last year, but one that could have a bigger impact down the line. As the first properly dust-resistant foldable it sets a new durability benchmark, slowly bringing the devices up to par with standard slab phones.The inside screen is still necessarily softer than a regular hardened glass to allow it to fold, however, so you must still be careful with it.

It’s that personalisation aspect – they’re saying: it understands me, my parents don’t.”The research, based on a survey of boys in secondary education across 37 schools in England, Scotland and Wales, also found that more than half (53%) of teenage boys said they found the online world more rewarding than the real world.‘DeepSeek is humane. Doctors are more like machines’: my mother’s worrying reliance on AI for health adviceRead moreThe Voice of the Boys report says: “Even where guardrails are meant to be in place, there’s a mountain of evidence that shows chatbots routinely lie about being a licensed therapist or a real person, with only a small disclaimer at the bottom saying the AI chatbot is not real.“This can be easily missed or forgotten about by children who are pouring their hearts out to what they view as a licensed professional or a real love interest.”Some boys reported staying up until the early hours of the morning to talk to AI bots and others said they had seen the personalities of friends completely change after they became sucked into the AI world.“AI companions personalise themselves to the user based on their responses and the prompts. It responds instantly. Real humans can’t always do that, so it is very, very validating, what it says, because it wants to keep you connected and keep you using it,” Chambers said.The announcement from character.ai came after a series of controversies for the four-year-old California company, includinga 14-year-old killing himselfin Florida after becoming obsessed with an AI-powered chatbot that his mother claimed had manipulated him into taking his own life, and a USlawsuitfrom the family of a teenager who claim a chatbot manipulated him to self-harm and encouraged him to murder his parents.Users have been able to shape the chatbots’ characters so they could tend to be depressed or upbeat, and this would be reflected in their responses. The ban will come into full effect by 25 November.Character.aisaidit was taking the “extraordinary steps” in light of the “evolving landscape around AI and teens” including pressure from regulators “about how open-ended AI chat in general might affect teens, even when content controls work perfectly”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: cameranest/ShutterstockHow did an obscure district in a neglected state become India’s byword for digital deceit?BySnigdha PoonamThu 30 Oct 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 30 Oct 2025 17.38 EDTShareOn the surface, the town of Jamtara appeared no different from neighbouring districts. But, if you knew where to look, there were startling differences. In the middle of spartan villages were houses of imposing size and unusual opulence. Millions of Indians knew why this was. They knew, to their cost, where Jamtara was. To them, it was no longer a place; it was a verb. You lived in fear of being “Jamtara-ed”.Over the past 15 years, parts of this sleepy district in the eastern state of Jharkhand had grown fabulously wealthy. This extraordinary feat of rural development was powered by young men who, armed with little more than mobile phones, had mastered the art of siphoning money from strangers’ bank accounts. The sums they pilfered were so staggering that, at times, their schemes resembled bank heists more than mere acts of financial fraud.In a short period, scam calls became an almost universal experience in India. With every innovation in India’s digital marketplace – smartphones, digital wallets, e-commerce, crypto – Jamtara’s scams expanded their target area. In New Delhi, India’s policymakers boasted about “Digital India” and the spread of modern telecom infrastructure. But, for the majority of Indian citizens, the digital revolution became synonymous with Jamtara scams. Netflix even made a TV series about the district, with the tag line “Sabka Number Aayega”. You could read that as “everyone will get a call” or as “your number will be up”. Jamtara’s scammers took immense pride in duping the rich and famous. Conning a film star or a parliamentarian wasn’t just about financial gain; it was a triumph that elevated their own standing.From 2015 onwards, police from various states descended on the district. Arrests became common – but bail was easy to secure. Cases took ages to close, and conviction rates weren’t high enough to stem the flood of scams. A few weeks before flying to Jharkhand to report on this phenomenon, I visited Delhi’s state-of-the-art cybercrime police station. The deputy superintendent showed me a video on his phone that captured the unapologetic opulence of a scammer’s house: a vividly painted bungalow with sprawling balconies and art deco styling, each section a splash of nursery-bright colours, of strawberry pink and pistachio green. His disbelief was evident in the breathless commentary that accompanied the video.I wanted to understand how an obscure district in a neglected state became India’s byword for digital deceit. Initially, I thought this would be a story about the dark promise of technology and the lure of easy money. But over weeks of reporting, what emerged was a portrait of two Indias colliding – one chasing material progress, the other bent on survival. And in their collision was born the kind of ambition that can drive those with nothing to lose into criminality, while entrenched inequalities make it impossible for them to turn back.‘The numbers don’t dial themselves,” Jitu* wanted me to know. We were sitting in my borrowed car at the edge of a dusty road in his village, about 50 miles from Jamtara. It was a sweltering day in May, the hottest month, and Jitu was wearing a peach-coloured T-shirt, shorts and well-worn slippers. His face was nearly round, with soft features and gleaming eyes. He looked friendly and smiled effortlessly. He didn’t look like a seasoned grifter minting money from India’s most notorious scam.Jitu was, nevertheless, the “chief scammer” of the village – a title he wore with pride. Naturally, he said, that meant he was kept busy all day. But out of respect for my guide, a local reporter, he would answer a few questions. Respect, it turned out – how it was given, whether it could undermine age-old hierarchies, whether it could be turned into power or money – was central to how the Jamtara scammers operated.In 2012, Jitu had been in school when some older boys who had transferred in from Jamtara “saw something” in him. They showed him how to generate potential targets for scams. Jitu was singled out because he already had the respect of his peers. Unlike most others in school, his father ran a small business. His family identified as Dalits, historically disadvantaged in India, and weren’t middle class in any recognisable way – but he paid his own school fees and always had a bit of pocket money. This meant he was cool enough to hang out with boys much older than him, who gave him the respect due to someone who was good at sports and had money for ice-cream.Map of India showing Jharkhand and JamtaraThe turning point in Jitu’s life, however – as with everyone in his generation – came when his father bought him a phone. It was an early, no-frills Samsung handset, but Jitu, who was 15, took it to school the very next day. In this remote part of Jharkhand, known as Santhal Pargana, whose six districts include Deoghar and Jamtara, sweeping changes are rare. When they come, the impact is earth-shattering. If you ask someone in Delhi or Mumbai, they will tell you the moment that India set itself on a new course was 1991, when it liberalised its economy and foreign capital poured in. But people in rural Jharkhand and places like it across India will insist that the transformative moment came more than a decade later, when mobile phone towers popped up across the country.“At the end of 2012, we heard for the first time of a young man in the village being picked up in a case of cybercrime,” Murari Lal, a local social worker, told me. “We couldn’t understand what was going on. The police were saying,ATM se paisa marta hai.[‘He steals money from ATMs.’] But we wondered what stealing money had to do with mobile phones.”Aman named Sitaram Mandal could have explained. Nearly everyone I met in Santhal Pargana had something to say about him. Their accounts, along with extensive media coverage of his career, offered glimpses into his remarkable journey. If anyone created Jamtara’s signature 21st-century industry, it was him.In 2011, after leaving school in his small Jamtara village, Mandal boarded a train to Mumbai. Over the next five years, Mandal worked at a roadside eatery, a railway station retailer and finally a shop where people bought top-ups for their mobile phones. It was that last job where he learned the particular skill that made his fortune: clearing strangers’ bank accounts using a mobile phone. The thing that pulled him in immediately was that he did not have to break into the victim’s phone or their bank account. They gave you access willingly; you only had to lie.Mandal, in his stint at the mobile recharge shop, found himself learning the manipulative tactics used by fraudsters to extract confidential information from unsuspecting individuals. But he couldn’t do it alone. So, he found himself making the return journey to his birthplace, training several youngsters in his social circle, and building an army of “ATM thieves”, as they were called then. ATMs were as new to rural India as mobile telephony; the dark side of the digital revolution arrived as swiftly as its benefits. The easier it was to access your bank account, the easier it was to scam you out of it.View image in fullscreenA scene from the Netflix show Jamtara: Sabka Number Ayega.Photograph: NetflixMandal’s method began, of course, with a phone call. The voice on the line would be tinged with urgency; it was the bank calling, they would say and issue a dire warning: there was a problem with the target’s bank account. To those unaccustomed to modern banking and increasingly complex know-your-customer (KYC) regulations, this was all too believable. “Your ATM card is about to become inactive,” they would then declare, dialling up the sense of urgency.Under the guise of verifying the victim’s identity, they asked a stream of questions, such as the person’s date of birth and address. By the end, they had harvested every detail they needed: card numbers, pins, three-digit CVV number. Simultaneously, an accomplice would be navigating the victim’s bank account online, armed with the freshly gleaned information. To finalise the illicit transfer of funds to their account, they required one last piece of the puzzle: a one-time password (OTP) sent by the bank to the victim’s phone via SMS. “To complete the KYC process, you must read out the six-digit code sent to your mobile number,” they instructed with authoritative calm. Overwhelmed by anxiety by this point, the victim recited the six digits as if they were items on a grocery list. With this, the fraudulent bank transfer was executed to perfection.Following Mandal’s example, Jitu trained many of his friends and acquaintances, effectively passing on the techniques throughout his community. “That scheme changed the lives of so many people,” he said, closing his eyes as if to relive the glory days of a decade earlier. But the scam had its limitations. The victim needed to be using an ATM card; he needed to be ignorant as well as trusting; he needed to have money in his bank account and a high daily transaction limit. That wasn’t always the case. Fortunately, after a brief lull, new possibilities arose.“In 2014, the BJP won the elections, and Narendra Modi became the prime minister.” Jitu was smiling now, and not without reason. Full of reformist energy, the PM launched a bold mission to digitalise India’s economy. “Mobile apps began to be developed. They were meant to make life easier for the kind of people who had voted for him then. Professionals. Businessmen. People in the cities. People like you,” Jitu continued his lecture. “Suddenly, there was much more than just ATM cards: banking apps, digital wallets, instant lending.”Many of the comfortably well-off Indians I knew who voted for the BJP in 2014 hoped for an economic miracle that would free India, once and for all, from its moribund, statist past. Modi, positioning himself as a dynamic face of market-oriented leadership, was the answer for a burgeoning middle class that credited their upward mobility to individual effort – they called it “merit”. They disdained the old socialist-leaning elite, and in Modi, a man of humble origins, they saw a reflection of themselves. Curtly, they dismissed the continuing importance of the centuries-old systems that built and maintained privilege in India and that facilitated their own access to education, capital and other resources. Any mention of caste produced a fit of anger. Every man for himself became the implicit motto for the Modi era.When Modi’s tenure as prime minister began, life in the villages began to change to some extent. Many people in and around Kherbari, a village about 70 miles north of Jamtara, were grateful to him for welfare schemes that helped them build concrete houses, acquire gas cylinders and collect free food grains. Most of them expected nothing more from the government; little, if anything, was granted beyond the fundamental provisions. For those with loftier life goals, the mobile was the miracle, not Modi.Between them, Jitu and his friends were phoning hundreds of people every day. If the target accepted the call, the scammer could choose from various options:View image in fullscreenJamtara railway station, November 2022.Photograph: cameranest/ShutterstockI am calling from your bank.I am calling from your credit card company.I am calling from your digital wallet startup.I am calling from your mobile service provider.The scammers’ friends and family didn’t see them as cyberthieves. They regarded them as a league of highly skilled workers. Over the next few years, “chor”, or thief, was gradually dropped from their title. The villagers who spoke to me only used the word “cyber” to refer to the scammers. It conveyed the message without emphasising the criminality.This semantic shift mirrored the broader acceptance of scamming as a profession. More and more people transitioned from traditional but less profitable occupations like agriculture and manual labour to the more lucrative and less effortful domain of mobile phone scams. “Scamming,” Murari Lal, the social worker, told me, “became the new farming. The fathers try a different crop every season; the sons, a different con.”One day Jitu showed me how one of his scams worked. Sitting in the front seat of the car, he methodically arranged two mobile phones on his lap. On one, he launched a gambling app that simulated a traditional three-card game. To play, you needed to transfer some cash to your game account, and you were allowed to ping someone else’s digital wallet to ask for a top-up. This meant that you could use the game to ping random wallets attached to random phone numbers to ask for cash.To demonstrate, Jitu pinged his digital wallet on the other phone from his game screen on the first. The second phone popped up a notification that someone was asking for 4,999 rupees (£42).That, he said, was where his game began.This is how the conversation would run when he rang the person who received the top-up request: “Sir, you have received a notification for a 4,999 rupee cashback from your mobile wallet company. It’s something we are doing, keeping in view the hardships faced by our users in the pandemic. If you open the app now, you will see the amount 4,999 rupees flashing on the home screen. Below that, you will see two options: ‘deny’ or ‘proceed’. To claim the amount, you must press ‘proceed’.”This was the point at which Jitu would hope that the victim, through oversight or distraction, would mistakenly authorise a transfer away from his own wallet, instead of to it, without fully understanding the context.“You have done that successfully. The next page will ask you to enter the one-time password sent by your bank to facilitate the transfer of this amount to your account. Did you do that?”Another point at which the victim could back out.Sometimes they did. Often enough they didn’t. Or the cyber-chor could walk away with the 4,999 rupees. But Jitu wouldn’t, of course. Why would he?“Sir! I am very sorry; I have made a huge mistake. You must have received another SMS from your bank saying 4,999 rupees has been deducted from your account. It’s all my fault – I pressed the wrong button at my end. Sir, please don’t raise a complaint. I will get into trouble. The company will fire me right away. I will have to sleep on the street. My family will starve.”View image in fullscreenThe pond where Jitu said most of his discarded phones ended up.Photograph: Snigdha Poonam“Give me a chance to fix this blunder. I will send you a refund plus the original cashback. I am initiating this process. On your homepage, you will see a new amount, 9,999 rupees. Below you will see two options: ‘deny’ or ‘proceed’. To claim the money, you must press ‘proceed’.”This charade would continue until the victim realised he had been repeatedly scammed, Jitu told me, casually placing the two tools of his trade back on the car’s dashboard. Leaning back in his seat, he emphasised the importance of spontaneity. “You must come up with a number while being on the call. It could be 2,458 or 6,978. That’s the amount you tell them they have won – as a discount, a cashback, a surprise gift.” He emphasised that hesitations are fatal. “I choose to stick to the same number: 4,999.”The other trick is to sound completely fearless. “I request them to call up the bank and ask to speak to me. I urge them to record the phone call. I say to them: ‘If you have any doubts about my credentials, go to the police with the recording.’ That’s usually all it takes to kill any suspicions.”While revealing his methods, Jitu was neither sheepish nor boastful. He seemed to take just as much pride in swiftly dispatching his task as a competent individual in any sector. I asked him if he ever felt guilty cheating gullible strangers out of what could well be their hard-earned money. He answered promptly that there were infinite ways in which a cyberthief paid for his bad deeds. “He doesn’t have a moment of peace, for one. Even as I am conducting a scam call, I am thinking of where I will throw the sim card, and where I will hide the cell phone.” Perpetual anxiety was his punishment.The village pond was visible from the car’s window. Jitu pointed in that direction and said that, in the end, that was where most of his scam phones wound up. The scammers exploit the natural landscape at every step, making calls from secluded, overgrown fields, burying their mobile phones in trenches beside streams and retreating up the hills during police raids.This protective geography is also what kept this part of India poor. A short walk from Jitu’s village, the Rajmahal Hills – a mountain range that spans an area about 1,000 sq miles and is older than the Himalayas – begin. Dark forests grow around rugged rocks and water rushes everywhere: even 20 years ago, venturing into these villages wasn’t as straightforward as it is today. Back then, to access them, one would have needed to hire a boat on a day when dark clouds weren’t looming on the horizon.Since the turn of the millennium, this isolation has changed somewhat. Eighteen roads have been built, and the community pooled money to build another school. But official statistics for the region make for difficult reading. More than half of its 10.8 million people live below the poverty line, and 35% are “extremely poor”. That’s comparable to the most isolated parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Dalits like Jitu, who make up 11% of the population, are disproportionately deprived.The next day, I went to the cybercrime police station in Deoghar, where a press conference was scheduled to take place. A pack of reporters (all men) and I trooped into the British-era estate, with its high-ceilinged rooms arranged around a central courtyard. In the courtyard, the constables had lined up 15 men who were to be paraded in front of the reporters. The men had clearly been picked up in the dead of night, for most of them wore pyjamas, shorts and sleeveless vests. The constables fussed over them with the meticulous care typically reserved for fashion models prepping for a runway – arranging them according to height and straightening their postures.In an orderly procession, they were led to the office of the superintendent. There, they were rearranged in two rows behind the senior officer’s desk. Two rows of mobile phones were placed on the table in the same formation as the men standing in the back. The event commenced with the superintendent coughing into the mic. He proceeded to read a press release: “Based on a secret tip, simultaneous raids were conducted in various villages, and 14 people wanted in cybercrime cases have been arrested,” he began. “These cybercriminals used to pose as customer care executives and service providers to obtain sensitive information from the people …”He then read out their names. All suspects had the same surname, one that is common among some of the local Dalit communities.The policeman was from an upper caste, so I was sceptical when he told me that their inquiries often lead them to the homes and hideouts of three specific communities: Dalits, Muslims and the Other Backward Classes (OBCs), a collective term the government of India uses to classify hundreds of marginalised castes.View image in fullscreenDelhi cybercrime police after busting a call centre syndicate operating from Jamtara in April 2023.Photograph: Hindustan Times/Getty ImagesJitu, however, confirmed to me that caste and community affiliations really do anchor the regional fraud networks. “It starts at the training stage itself,” he explained over the phone one day. Since assuming the title of “mastermind”, he said he has primarily trained young Dalit men in and around his village, who live close to each other and at a safe distance from the violence and intimidation they would face in upper-caste districts. In the villages where Muslims outnumbered Dalits and OBCs, the mastermind was likely to be one among them.When I asked my reporter guide, a Brahmin, if upper-caste Hindus were in fact under-represented in this most profitable of vocations, he took me to his own village, home to more than 200 families. As we drove down the main street, he showed me the sturdy homes in which the upper-caste elite lived. They had a stranglehold, he explained, over the traditional modes of money-making: owning vast tracts of fertile land, securing government contracts for local infrastructure projects, and controlling the extraction of coal from the earth and sand from the riverbanks. These were not people with scruples, he said, since these professions are shorthand for the exploitation of farm workers, bribes to government officials and income from illegal mining. Instead, they needed to protect their assumed sense of superiority. “Most have qualms about associating with lower castes and Muslims,” he said. If you spot a person with an upper caste surname, such as Pandey, on a police charge sheet, you can tell they are down on their luck, he told me.Back at the police station, as the superintendent took questions from the press, the suspects stood completely still, their eyes fixed on the row of reporters. I stood directly opposite the man on the extreme left, the only one wearing a proper T-shirt. A pithy slogan ran across his chest: “Your Limit Is You.”The police had tracked down scammers thanks to local informers. But who were these informers? The accused often pointed fingers at upper-caste people from their villages who had shown their displeasure at lower-caste families’ displays of wealth. Not all of them could be passing on information, but there was no doubt that plenty of resentment had built within their ranks. As I went around the villages, the tension was impossible to ignore.In one village, landlord Bunty Singh* regularly reported boys riding off motorbikes. Once the most influential family, the Singhs now faced competition from Dalit families who had raised their status through cyberfraud. Their men once worked on his farms and their women rolled tobacco in the courtyard of his bungalow. He sold the harvest at a wholesale market and the hand-rolled tobacco to a factory. Some days, he paid the workers; other times, he sent them back with grain for their kitchens and straw for their roofs. Now, some of those families have become millionaires, he said with an air of intolerable woe. “Their daily transactions would shock you. These days you see large currency notes either in the wallet of a politician or a cyber-chor.”That politicians became fabulously wealthy through corruption was a foregone conclusion; much harder to accept was the idea of marginalised people using similar means. While we were having this conversation, Singh kept an eye on the road, noting every person and vehicle that passed by. He pointed out some of the men riding motorbikes, detailing their position in the local network of cyberfraud. This one is a mastermind; that one is still at school; the one in the backseat has just come out on bail. He asked me if I wanted the names of every cyberthief active in his village. I declined his offer.Singh had reported many of these “boys” to the police, but most were released on bail. Enough members of the local upper-caste elite were indirectly profiting from the scams themselves.In another nearby village, I met a Brahmin who sold construction supplies to the newly wealthy “cyber” families. He claimed they were building grand houses. “They have towering gates, Italian marble and air-conditioned bathrooms. The idea is that even if there is a raid and the police take away everything, they will still have the house.” He narrated the tragic story of a client burying illicit cash in a sandpit after receiving word of a police raid, only to have it stolen by neighbours.The supplier himself did not let caste stand in the way of genuine connections. After closing his shop, he told me, he hung out at the village tea stalls where cyber-chors often narrated their escapades. “Even going to jail is part of the adventure. Money is not the only reason they take the risk of arrest. There is alsomaza[fun] in what they do.” Being a Brahmin, he argued he couldn’t make scam calls himself, but he took pride in the number of “rock star” cyber-chors he personally knew.While cheating strangers, Jitu was able to peer into their lives. On the other end of the line, many of his victims lived in bustling cities, worked in air-conditioned offices and spent their money on luxury goods. Some of his victims would certainly have had to struggle to get where they were. Yet he suspected that few truly understood what it meant to be trapped in one’s circumstances.This, however, wasn’t the justification he and his accomplices gave themselves for stealing. They simply believed that if they didn’t claw their way toward a better life, no one else would do it for them. And if others suffered along the way, that was just the collateral damage of trying to wrestle free from fate.Using the income he earned from the scams, Jitu opened a supply shop in the village. “My wife set up a tailoring business from home.” Their two sons didn’t just go to a good school but also acquired a private tutor, an upper-caste retired schoolteacher who comes to his home to teach them nursery rhymes. “She is not an ordinary woman. Her son is a pilot, and her daughter is a doctor,” said Jitu.When Jitu was making serious money, he felt like the master of his own destiny. He expressed that the way his victims did: through ordering a laundry list of luxury goods – phones, clothes, shoes – for himself and his family. “We didn’t always keep those things at home. That would have attracted too much attention. Instead, I entrusted some of those items to the Brahmins in my village. They agreed to store them on the condition that they could keep some items for themselves. It was a mutually beneficial agreement. The police would never suspect them, no matter what phones they use or what clothes their women wear.”View image in fullscreenCybercrime police in Delhi after arresting members of a scam-call syndicate operating from Jamtara in April 2023. (Faces pixellated by Guardian imaging.)Photograph: Hindustan Times/Getty ImagesFor Jitu’s associates, the lavish lifestyle that fraud permitted them was one that would not be remarked upon were they from upper-caste families. But to be safe, they needed the complicity of those they were trying to displace. “The level at which you see yourself is not the level at which others see you.” This dichotomy was a constant struggle for him. “If the police believe my level is to carry a budget phone worth 20,000 rupees, they will be alarmed to see me carrying a flagship model priced at 50,000 rupees.” By contrast, he said to me: “If I gave you a silk outfit, you could walk around the whole village wearing it, and no one would think it was bought with scam money. That’s why every cyber-chor needs upper-caste friends.”Over the past few years, as police raids have become a daily affair in these villages, a spin-off economy has emerged to help the scammers evade the law. Schoolchildren earned pocket money for watching the entry points to the village. Busybodies took protection money from the scammers to keep their names off the police radar. Police officers accepted bribes to avoid making arrests, and mediators openly quoted their fees for arranging bail. At the district court in Deoghar, advocates dropped cases involving murder and rape to represent cybercrooks; a single bail plea meant a fee of 25,000 rupees, cash in hand.When all other avenues failed, political representatives came to the rescue of cyberthieves. From council officials to members of parliament, local politics was increasingly tied to digital scams. The relationship was mutually beneficial: money earned from the scams funded electoral campaigns and power linked to political office shielded the perpetrators from arrest.Cyberscams, and the wealth, fame and notoriety they brought in their wake, had disrupted the caste hierarchy in unforeseen ways. For upper castes in the region, some of those disruptions were more potent than others. Dalit individuals refusing to work in their homes, farms or factories posed an inconvenience – but that could always be remedied. If some refused, others would eventually step in.Far more troubling was the realisation that lower-caste individuals no longer relied on them as gatekeepers. Armed with a growing mastery of mobile technology, one of the most transformative tools in today’s world, they were reshaping their lives in ways the upper castes struggled to comprehend. Left behind, many clung to caste pride as their only solace.Jitu found that his relationships with upper-caste people were becoming strained. He sensed a growing hostility from some. “Think about this: long after India was liberated from colonial rule, we were still serving upper-caste people. Our women cleaned their cattle sheds, and our men disposed of their dead cattle. For generations they treated us as slaves. But today, we have become aware of our rights,” he said. “This angers them. They give our names at the police stations.” A caste battle was under way, he said, and he was prepared to fight. “We will not be trapped back in slavery in the name of tradition.”In 2019, Jitu contested the post of the president of Kherbari’s Dalit community and won unopposed. Shortly after, he hosted a grand lunch for the visiting chief of an organisation that rejected the patronage of upper-caste-dominated parties to strive for political power for Dalits. Hundreds of people from the lower castes came to pay their respects. The upper-caste elites watched from a distance.View image in fullscreenThe NDCCII building in New Delhi, home to Indian’s national cybercrime division.Photograph: Sidheeq/CC BY-Sa4.0Two weeks later, in an overnight raid that no cyberthief saw coming, the local police arrested Jitu and put him in jail. After 93 days, he came out a man questioning his life choices. His mood, when we met after his release, was doleful. “We, the cyber-chors, know how to make money. What we don’t know is what to do with the ill-gotten wealth. A professional might make 40,000 rupees a month. He has clear ideas for how to spend it. He pays the rent and the school fees, buys gifts for parents once a year during the festive season, saves for his daughter’s wedding. For us scammers, it is different: if we have one good day, we make 50,000 rupees. Just sitting in the field. It distorts proportion. People go berserk buying things. If you make a lot of money, your wife basks in the luxuries that come with it. She will ask you to take her to the market. She will make you buy the priciest objects. She won’t share those things with her mother-in-law. She will rarely allow your mother to buy something for herself with your money. But if you die, your mother is left to suffer while your wife marries someone else.”I could not stop him midway to ask what brought on this diatribe against the wives of cyberthieves. We were sitting in our usual spot, in my rented car parked on the path leading out from his village. In spite of the air-conditioning in the car, Jitu was drenched in sweat. Every ping on my phone made him jump in his seat.After he went to jail, his mother had dug a pit in the field behind their house and buried a total of 50 phones. When he pulled them out three months later, he found rainwater had rotted their internal circuits. “What else could it be but an omen?” He paused, looking at his hands as if they were still smeared with mud. “This work is not easy,” he resumed in a pensive tone, his voice growing heavier with every word.‘Sir, are you using the PhonePe Wallet app?”“I am. What is this about?”“Sir, the company is offering a cashback of 4,999 rupees …”“Chutiya [asshole], don’t waste my time.”Ransomware hunters: the self-taught tech geniuses fighting cybercrimeRead moreJitu’s scam calls had been shorter lately. He had dug out his stash of phishing phones and returned them to regular use. But “business” was increasingly uncertain. At first, he blamed himself. “I used to be very clever. That’s how I pulled off all those scams for years on end. But after coming out of jail, my brain began to slow down.”Talking to his peers in the village, he realised he wasn’t the only one failing to reel in targets. They were still making money from the scams, but compared to what they illicitly earned in the previous years, there had been a downturn. “We made a killing when the time favoured us. The spate of good luck is passing,” he said, perched in his usual spot in my hired car’s front seat. “The public is becoming aware,” he said, dropping his voice to a horrified whisper. “They are watching YouTube videos where they show you the whole scam playing out. Their new phones can detect scam calls.”One day, Jitu and I walked over to a one-room house at the far end of a field. He was once again feeling gloomy. His heart sank when he thought about friends and relatives who have died over the years, he said. “In this business, we can never tell how long we have got.” Karma, he said, would confront him like it did every man who lived. It was only a matter of time. But still, he had to keep going, keep finding new scams. His wife had to be kept happy; his sons had to be educated. Perhaps, if the occasion arose, votes would have to be bought.

Donald Trump gushed about an “amazing” meeting, scoring it 12 out of 10; Xi Jinping reportedlynotedthat a consensus had been reached, with the two sides needing to finalise follow-up steps rapidly.Mr Trump’s usual trade approach –shout loudly and wave a big stick– faltered when Beijing raised its own bludgeon. No tribute ofgold crownsorNobel nomination pledgeswere on offer from Mr Xi. The US president blinked first – but, predictably, attempted to repackage the underwhelming result as a great success.In fact, it was a necessary de-escalation that essentially turned the clock back. Mr Trump – who once announced tariffs of 145% on China –agreed to cut the average rate to 45%and suspended the tightening of tech-related export controls. China has said that it will buy US soya beans and – most importantly – is holding off on draconian curbs to rare earth exports, which it threatened as a countermeasure. It’s still unclear whether China will get access to Nvidia’s powerful Blackwell chip. Experts say that woulddramatically shrink the US advantage in AI, with obvious economic and security implications.This is a year-long deal and may be no more than a pause. Mr Trump’s trade diplomacy is always erratic: last week, heannouncedthat he would add 10% to tariffs on Canada in retaliation for a provincial political advert. The country’s prime minister, Mark Carney, has just completedhis own swing through Asia; Trumpism is forcing longstanding allies to look for alternatives. Swingeing tariffs on India havepushed it towards China. Yet if the US wants to win in the long term, it will need to boost partnerships.Mr Trump notched up trade deals on this Asian tour, but the underlying problems are ever clearer. No one can count on bilateral ties with Washington any more, and the US is withdrawing from global institutions and forums, while China seeks to boost its role. Meanwhile, US businesses struggle tomake strategic decisionswhen they don’t know what the tariff rate will be next week, never mind next year.Beneath this administration’s shortcomings lie longer-term failings. China has been strategically mapping and tackling economic vulnerabilities; this truce buys it time to continue that work. The US islate to this game. It has just cut acritical minerals deal with Australia, but reducing dependence on Chinese rare earths will be a very long process – asJapan’s experiencehas shown.Yet Beijing’s decision to wield access to rare earths as a weapon has increased concerns about China outside the US too. The G7 summit in Canada is expected tolaunch an alliancepushing back against China’s dominance on Friday. The European Union must also show that it willstand up to Chinese coercion.Similarly, while China has become less reliant on exports to the US since Mr Trump’s first term, other countries are growing increasingly anxious about, and resistant to,dumping. Beijing’s longstanding pledges to rebalance the struggling economy towards domestic consumptionhave yet to be realised; hi-tech industrial self-reliance appears to be the priority.Thursday’s meeting may have brought breathing space. But as underlying contradictions within and between the two behemoths remain unresolved, the dangers are not only to them; they are also to others who put little faith in either side.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Thanks to Donald Trump’segotistical diplomacy, rare earths can again flow one way, soya beans the other, and less of the chemicals used to make fentanyl in between. No matter that the war was Trump’s own idea and seems to have been a stunt. The stunt is over. Trump has played his favourite game of dealmaker, much to the discomfort of millions.Meanwhile Britain still cannot make up its mind if China is its enemy. In 2008 British officials visited the Beijing Olympics authorities to discuss the next games in London in 2012. The government told them to “raise”human rights issues, about which the British government was most concerned. I am told the Chinese reacted with sympathy at the Britons’ embarrassment at broaching the matter, and then everyone got down to business. Soon China was a friend, certainly to David Cameronand George Osborne.Not today. China is now a much-enhanced world power, and in the eyes of some, a threat to Britain’s national security. The recent confusion over whether two British officialswere Chinese spieshas largely and absurdly revolved around whether the Chinese “threat” was greater to a Tory governmentthan to a Labour one. China was clearly recruiting spies everywhere, as do most countries. It sought a huge London embassy,befriended Prince Andrewand required Boris Johnsonto send two aircraft carriersto patrol the South China Sea.Pompous countries crave enemies. They have large military empires heavily reliant on them, empires fiendishly resistant to dismantling. After the fall of the Soviet Union a senior advisor to Russian leader Mikhail Gorbachevjoked to American officials: “We are going to do a terrible thing to you – we are going to deprive you of an enemy.”Who is the US’s new enemy? The answer is clearly China. But as Trump has found, it is an enemy with which it is hard to come to terms. It does not send its armies overseas. As it challenges the US for world economic supremacy, it snaps the bond once thought to hold capitalism in the arms of democracy. It gets richer and richer. China’s Brics-plus alliance with India and othershas overtakenthe G7 in world trade. The Beijing policy expert Henry Wang evenmooted this weekthat a China-led Brics force could police a ceasefire border in Ukraine. It would be a sensational intervention.GK Chesterton wrote that “those who appeal to the head rather than the heart … are necessarily men of violence. We speak of ‘touching’ a man’s heart, but we can do nothing to his head but hit it.”Trump could yet be that blow to the head. He is forcing Nato to ask itself what it is really about. He is telling the world not to rely on the US to police its conflicts, in the manner trumpeted by Kennedy, Johnson and the two Bush presidents. Washington may be about to turn in on itself and deny its manifest destiny to set the world to rights. After all, it was founded to turn its back on the arguments infesting the outside world.Since Britain, too, enjoyed global fantasies, it of all nations should understand this. It cannot refuse to come to terms with the new Beijing. Yes,Chinadoes terrible things to its minorities. It denies freedom of speech and neurotically spies on foreign states. In the new age of artificial intelligence, China is clearly out to rival the US.Since this rivalry will probably encompass attacks on other countries’ cybersecurity, it makes sense for any country to guard its digital space. Whether that extends to embassy buildings is a matter for experts. But clearly, to locate a foreign embassy justfive minutes’ walkfrom a centre of global financial intelligence is a bad idea. China must understand this. Would it let MI6 erect a headquarters overlooking Tiananmen Square?Britain is no longer a superpower and must deal with superpowers, as must all second-division states. But in one respect it is unique. Its soft power is probably equal to none, notably its cultural and teaching assets. It haseducated more world leaders– apparently 50 – and takes in more Chinese studentsthan any other countryincluding the US. It also welcomes half a million Chinese tourists a year, many drawn byaspects of British popular culture. We do not measure soft power, but its influence cannot be negligible – and is certainly profitable.It is therefore absurd that the British government is planning to splurge billions more on defending Britain from a purely notional third world war. At the same time it is slashing the budget of its overseas cultural institution, the British Council. The council is being forced towithdraw from 60 countriesand sell its entire property portfolio.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Zohran Mamdani illustrates a different pathThu 30 Oct 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 30 Oct 2025 08.02 EDTShareAyoung political outsider with a fairly scant record becomes a sensation in a Democratic primary, capturing hearts and minds with a populist message and a disarming charm that translates well into vertical video. His success surges him to the head of the race, and as election day nears, he seems poised to pull off an upset victory that topples one of his district’s most hated and entrenched political machines.It’s a tale of two primaries: the New York City mayoral race, in which the 33-year-old state assembly memberZohran Mamdanidefeated the disgraced former governorAndrew Cuomo, and the Maine Senate race, where the political outsider and oyster farmer Graham Platner attracted national attention with a viral campaign.But one of these races has gone much better than the other. In New York, Mamdani has worked to consolidate citywide support following his landslide primary victory, and though he has become a figure of national controversy as Republicans and some Democrats smear him for his race and religion, he has managed to secure broad buy-in from city stakeholders. Mamdani’s opponents, meanwhile, have struggled to create a sense of outrage and scandal around the mayoral contender: despite millions poured into the race from billionaires intent on keeping the Democratic socialist out of office, opposition research into Mamdani seems to be coming up empty. Recently, theNew York Posttried, somewhat feebly, to create a scandal out of the fact that Mamdani referred to an older, female relative as his “aunt”, even though technically, she was a distant cousin.Zohran Mamdani represents the future of the Democratic party | Robert ReichRead morePlatner’s case looks different. Earlier this month, after Maine’s governor, Janet Mills, entered the Democratic Senate race with the backing of party leaders, a series of increasingly unflattering revelations about Platner’s past behavior came to light. In a series of since-deleted Reddit posts, some from as recently as 2020, Platner made a series of incendiary comments. Heclaimed that Black people don’t tip(“I work as a bartender and it always amazes me how true the stereotype is,” he wrote. “Every now and again a black patron will leave a 15-20% tip, but usually it [sic] between 0-5%”) and suggested women who have been sexually assaulted wereresponsible for their own attacks, writing, according to the Washington Post: “If you’re so worried about it to buy Kevlar underwear you’d think you might not get blacked out f----d up around people you aren’t comfortable with.” A few days later, he went on Pod Save America, the successful liberal podcast hosted by former Obama staffers, seemingly in an effort to get ahead of another unflattering story: that he had a tattoo ofa Totenkopf, widely recognized as a Nazi symbol, for nearly 20 years.Platner’s account of the tattoo goes like this: when he was in his early 20s and enlisted in the marines, he was drunk on shore leave in Croatia, and he and his friends went to get a tattoo. Platner selected a Totenkopf, an angled skull and crossbones image used by the SS; he claims he did not know what it meant, and that he merely thought it looked cool. Platner says that he did not know the significance of his tattoo until recently, and has said he is “not a secret Nazi”.But reporting from outlets such asJewish InsiderandCNNcontradicts this, with a source to Jewish Insider claiming that Platner had referred to his tattoo by its German name – as “my Totenkopf” – years before. OnPod Save America, Platner broadcast a video of himself, shirtless and evidently inebriated at his brother’s wedding, with the tattoo on display. As a crowd of partygoers looked on, the half-naked Platner sang an off-key version of Miley Cyrus’s Wrecking Ball. He got the tattoo covered up a few days later,appearing shirtless, again, on television to display an odd-looking Celtic knot with a hound motif where the Totenkopf had once been. One wonders how much familiarity with a Senate candidate’s nipples voters are expected to have.The men represent different paths for the Democratic party’s insurgent left wing, as left-populist candidates ride a wave of voter outrage and base anger at Democratic party leadershipCalls accumulated for Platner to drop out of the race. But some, most prominently the Pod Save America hosts themselves, defended Platner, and suggested that the calls for him to step aside were emblematic of what they see as the Democratic party’s core problems: an excessive priggishness and marriage to political correctness. “Only perfect candidates off the harvard law conveyor belt pls,”wrote Jon Lovettsardonically. “Highly disciplined, all boxes checked, well liked and humble, absolutely no spiritual connection to having a physical body except for severe IBS, volunteered at a soup kitchen in high school, signs email ‘cheers,’ etc.” (Lovett did not elaborate on what “spiritual connection to having a physical body” meant in this context.)Ryan Grim, formerly of the Intercept, cast Platner’s rehabilitation in existential terms for the party: “Not to overstate it, but this is a crucial moment for the Democratic Party,” he wrote. “If they decide that normal people with some skeletons in their closet (or inked on their chest) are not welcome, they are finished.” Normal seems to be a flexible term. Ben Burgiss, an adjunct at Rutgers and a columnist at the left-populist magazine Jacobin, put it more bluntly: “I still like Platner a whole lot more than the grim little hall monitors digging up dirt on him,”he wroteon the day that the Totenkopf tattoo story broke. “Sorry.”For his part, Platner was defensive about the need for actions like his to find tolerance and forgiveness in a party that seeks to court male voters. “How do you expect to win young people?” Platner said in an interviewwith Semafor. “How do you expect to win back men when you go back through somebody’s Reddit history and just pull it all out and say: ‘Oh my God, this person has no right to ever be in politics?’ Good luck with that. Good luck winning over those demographics.”Middle-aged men are among society’s loneliest people – what does that say about the patriarchy? | Van BadhamRead moreMamdani and Platner are clearly men of different temperaments. But the men also represent different paths for the Democratic party’s insurgent left wing, as left-populist candidates ride a wave of voter outrage and base anger at Democratic party leadership to pose serious challenges to the party’s mainstream. In Mamdani, what seems to be a genuine political talent has emerged: his uncommonly disciplined message focuses on affordability issues without shying away from pluralist values or seeming to mimic a more rugged, domineering form of masculinity. But in Platner, some pundits and members of the consultant class seem to have found a vehicle for their own project for the party’s reform, one that is less about policy outcomes than about transforming the Democratic party’s image to embrace men, masculinity and a vision of a rugged, rural whiteness.The notion that the Democratic party is losing because it is too feminized – too dominated by women among its voters, leaders and candidates, or not sufficiently comfortable with the style of masculinity represented by Platner – has been bubbling up among left and liberal commentators with increasing insistence over the past decade. The idea is that in catering too much to women, and in being insufficiently deferential to domineering, gruff, physically imposing and implicitly white, rural men, the party has come to seem hectoring, inauthentic and whiny, and lost the voters they need to most recruit: that is, the working class, imagined here, as they so frequently are, as brusque, bigoted, ignorant, vulgar and male.Put aside, for a moment, the misogyny of this assertion: is it true that by becoming too “feminine”, the party will lose the working class? The reality is that the American working class now consists less of the masculine-coded heavy industries like manufacturing and rust-belt steel mills, and more of jobs in the female-dominated service sector. Just under half of American workers are women, but they arethe majority ofthe low-wage workforce. The conflation of the “working class” with maleness is outdated and false, a rhetorical fig leaf that conceals sexism behind a facade of anticapitalist righteousness.One suspects that what is at stake in the pundit defenses of Platner and his masculinity is not so much about electoral outcomes as it is about an idea of what makes power legitimate. When the likes of Lovett, Grim and Burgiss suggest that tolerance for behavior like Platner’s is needed to win elections – an idea that seems to have very little esteem for men and workers, both – they might actually be signaling not so much what they need to do to win, but what kind of victory would be worth having.How can Democrats win back working-class voters? Change their tune | Joan C WilliamsRead moreThe infatuation with an idea of a working class that is not represented in the actual numbers is less about a materialist analysis of American politics than it is about a psychic investment in American manhood. The tolerance these pundits are calling for is not an electoral necessity, but a cultural valuation of a certain kind of American over others. It is unfortunate, in the light of Mamdani’s example of how capacious masculinity can be and how needless tolerance for racism and sexism are to an energizing campaign, that these men are choosing to line up behind a man who has displayed, at minimum, some highly questionable judgment.But to many, the Totenkopf-bearing man, shirtless and belting in the video that Platner showed on Pod Save America, is simply more American than others – more authentic, more admirable, more worthy of winning over. Women of color, Jews, rape survivors, Black people, or any of the others that Platner might alienate with this past behavior, meanwhile, seem relatively cheap to them in comparison. This chase for the white male vote as more worthy and important is conspicuous, now, among the liberal pundit class. How are all the other voters supposed to feel about it?Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsUS politicsOpinionDemocratsZohran MamdaniMaineNew YorkMencommentShareReuse this content"

Mind you, that was seven and a half years ago and an awful lot of inflation has happened since then. In the bid, Category 4 tickets for the group stage – the cheapest seats available – were priced at $21. (As we would soon learn, the actual price would start at $60, andcategory 4 tickets are almost non-existent.)Could Trump really move World Cup games? The facts behind his threatsRead moreI play over-40 pickup soccer with a group of a few dozen soccer-loving friends in New York’s Hudson Valley. In the group chat, anticipation built for the first round of general ticket sales in early October. Tidbits were traded. Links were shared. It was broadly accepted that the prices would be eye-watering – surely several hundred dollars per ticket, as this wasthe point of a North American World Cup, after all. Nineteen of us entered the Visa pre-sale lottery, as did 4.5 million others. Two of us, including me, won a time slot to buy tickets. It’s hardly a scientific sample at two people, but if our experiences are anything to go by, there are already serious questions around affordability at this World Cup (it makes sense anaffordability-focused political candidatewould make it an issue).The first of us to venture into the time slot stage spent two hours in a countdown queue loop that reset every 10 minutes. When he finally got in, category 4 tickets were sold out. He snagged some category 3 tickets to a round-of-32 knockout match in New Jersey, but his bank blocked the transaction. By the time he had resolved the issue, the system wouldn’t let him reorder those tickets, as it had logged the original, failed transaction as a sale, thus barring him from a second acquisition for the same match. He finally settled for some group-stage tickets instead.Two days later, I also spent several hours in ticketing purgatory before I was finally granted five whole minutes to log in.It was sort of ironic that I got through at all since I was on the fence about taking my family to the World Cup in the first place, afterour most recent outing to a Fifa tournamenthad its ups and downs. But it would be another year on, and World Cups in all their color and noise and sensation are extraordinary things to witness. I’ve been to three, and they are milestones in my life, that left vivid memories I doubt will ever fully fade. I figured I could always ditch the tickets on Fifa’s secondary market (less a 15% fee) if we decided not to go. But I wanted the experience to at least be something we could opt into.When I got a glimpse at the remaining inventory at last, everything in category 3 was gone as well for any game I was interested in – basically whatever was within a three-hour drive. The cheapest tickets left for any game at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey were $465 apiece and somehow also most likely in the upper deck. If we got the maximum of four tickets, that would easily make it a $2,000 day between the tickets, parking and other assorted expenses. And since the draw was still almost two months away, our tickets may yet turn out to be for a game like Qatar v Paraguay – potentially a barnburner on its day, of course, but at that price tag would need to deliver some serious pyrotechnics.I decided against it. Instead, I offered to get anybody else in my men’s league group chat the $465 tickets and transfer them. Out of 28 people in the chat with an interest in World Cup tickets – I went back and polled them, because we’re doing Journalism here – just one took me up on the offer. He had friends coming over from England for the World Cup, after all, and didn’t want to let them down.I ordered him four tickets to a group-stage match at the Meadowlands in category 2 at a total cost of $1,860. “I’m probably gonna regret this,” he said, as he signed off on the purchase.Then kicked off a new kind of kerfuffle: actually transferring the tickets to him.One fruitless attempt after another left the tickets stuck in myFifaaccount. “It felt like genuine progress when, after a week, the website went from aimlessly refreshing when trying to accept, to actually returning an error code,” said the friend.It took almost two weeks for the transfer function to finally work. And when it ultimately did, it left no paper trail at all. The tickets simply vanished from my account and appeared in his, giving me no notice, confirmation or receipt concerning the status of my near-$2,000 purchase.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

With those sorts of ticket prices, and these sorts of technical challenges, who is all of thisfor? And who, in the end, will be there when the games get underway?A World Cup preying on Fomo: Fifa’s 2026 ticket scheme is a late-capitalist hellscapeRead moreIf even those with the interest and the disposable income and the time and the logistical means of getting to a game hesitate at those prices, who are the real customers? More than a million tickets were sold in the first phase, per Fifa, but to whom? And how on earth might fans from other countries, where spending power tends to be lower than in the American middle class – and have to pay for flights and accommodation too – possibly afford to go? Will there be any kind of atmosphere at the games, if it’s just stockbrokers and lawyers and tech bros and sponsors and dignitaries filling the stadiums?Will it be the World Cup for the 1%?We can probably state with more certainty whowon’tbe there: a lot of people really keen on going to this generational event who can’t begin to afford it. A teacher I know is desperate to get tickets – any kind at all – for her soccer-besotted son. She’d been asking for updates about where and how to buy them for at least a year, maybe two. When I told her what the tickets I briefly had access to were selling for, she winced and shook her head sadly. “No…,” she said. “No.”Leander Schaerlaeckens’ book on the United States men’s national soccer team, The Long Game, is out in the spring of 2026.

Without international support, it risks crumbling altogetherThu 30 Oct 2025 07.35 EDTLast modified on Thu 30 Oct 2025 08.53 EDTShareIsrael’s recent airstrikes in Gaza, which have killedmore than 100 people, show just how fragile this arrangement truly is. This is not the first violation since it came into effect on 10 October, but rather one of many over past weeks – showcasing that without stronger enforcement mechanisms and determined planning this is a ceasefire in name only.According to Israel, thisround of violenceresulted from Hamas fire against IDF forces in Rafah, an area still under Israeli control, resulting in the death of an IDF reservist. Hamas has denied involvement. Israel responded with additional strikes on Gaza City and Khan Younis. With each side interpreting violations to suit its own interests, the ceasefire’s vague structure leaves a wide margin for miscalculation and opportunism.The ceasefire was introduced within the framework of Donald Trump’s20-point planfor ending the war. Indeed, ending the war has been celebrated as an important step forward that has seen Israeli forces partially pull back, and hostages and prisoners exchanged. However, the main problem is that the plan remains largely undeveloped. It offers no clear timeline, verification process or credible means of enforcement.Moreover, few details of the second phase of the ceasefire – which should include a complete Israeli withdrawal, the formation of a technocratic administration in Gaza and the deployment of an international stabilisation mission – have yet been agreed. With no clear sequencing or third-party oversight, the plan risks entrenching instability rather than resolving it.Israel has made clear that it will not move to this next stage until Hamas returns theremains of deceased hostages, a condition Hamas has struggled to fulfil. Hamas, for its part, accuses Israel of using the hostage issue as an excuse to maintain military control. Meanwhile, with Gaza’s infrastructure in ruins, the humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate and essential services are collapsing. The population, already traumatised from two years of war, faces acute shortages of food, water and medicine, while aid convoys remain subject to political bargaining and intermittent blockages.Beyond Gaza,violence continues to spreadacross the West Bank, where over the past few days clashes have intensified between Israeli forces and settlers, and Palestinians. This parallel escalation, enabled if not encouraged by Israel’s rightwing government, draws further attention to the limited scope of the current ceasefire and shows just how easily the conflict could expand again.The Trump administration has attempted to sustain the truce through high-level visits from Jared Kushner, Steve Witkoff, JD Vance and Marco Rubio. It has also deployed200 troopsto a monitoring centre and continues to exert pressure on both parties. While this engagement has been positive and demonstrates American intent, it is on its own insufficient to prevent renewed cycles of conflict. Ultimately, the administration’s statements continue to urge restraint but offer little in the way of accountability. The newly established monitoring centre lacks authority to verify or enforce compliance. Egypt and Qatar continue their mediation roles, but their influence is waning amid this uncertainty.What exists today is not a meaningful peace plan, but a temporary holding pattern through which both sides prepare for the next confrontation. Without mechanisms to prevent violations or impose consequences, the truce remains vulnerable to collapse from any single provocation. Each exchange of fire, each disputed body return and each unverified accusation deepens mistrust and further limits the possibility of compromise or needed discussions on the second phase of the plan.The fundamental flaws in Trump’s plan are clear, and it should be understood as one that treats symptoms rather than fixing the root problems.Gazais still very much politically divided, economically devastated and socially wounded. Israel, which is still in a strong military position, sees the ceasefire as a tactical halt rather than a meaningful change in its strategy.For the ceasefire to evolve into a sustainable framework, it must be reinforced internationally, not just through US pressure and the vague contours of Trump’s 20 points. Regional and international actors must put in place independent monitoring, clear timelines for reconstruction and withdrawal and binding guarantees for security and humanitarian access. Without these elements, the situation will lurch between cycles of calm and violence, eventually giving way to another round of war.Sanam Vakil is the director of the Middle East and North Africa programme at Chatham HouseDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Not only are several of Trump’s shutdown moves blatantly anti-worker, but legal experts say many of them violate federal law.Take the Trump administration’s abrupt decision to effectively cut off funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) beginning this Saturday. That’s the food stamp program used by millions of workers and their families – a total of42 million people, one-eighthof the US population.Last Friday, the administration said it wouldn’t let the Department of Agriculture’s $5bn-pluscontingency fund be usedto ensure continued food benefits after 1 November. Nutrition experts and Snap recipients warn that thiswill result in increased hungerin the world’s richest nation. The administration cut off funding by asserting that the contingency money could only be used for natural disasters, and it did so even though it had said just before the shutdown began that thecontingency fund could be usedto finance Snap benefits.Democrats finally have some leverage in the shutdown fight. They should use it | Robert ReichRead moreJB Pritzker, the governor of Illinois, slammed the move, saying that working families “are about togo without food assistancebecause Trump and congressional Republicans want to score political points and refuse to reach a deal.” Pritzker added: “They can find the money to pay masked federal agents wreaking havoc in our communities but not help people in need put food on the table.”Cutting off food stamps will hurt millions of low-wage workers as well as seniors, veterans and many other vulnerable Americans. “People receive Snap in every part of the countryand in every state,” said Sharon Parrott, president of the Center of Budget and Policy Priorities, a progressive thinktank. “It is quite something to be sitting on billions of dollars that could be used for food assistance for people who need help and to refuse to release it.”This past Tuesday,two dozen states sued the Trump administration, asserting that the Snap cutoff was unlawful. David A Super, a federal budget expert at Georgetown University, told the New York Times that “nothing in the law imposes that limit” of using contingency funding only for natural disasters. He added: “This [funding cutoff] is blatantly lawless.”The government shutdown began on 1 October, after Democrats blocked legislation to finance the government unless Trump and Republicans agreed, as part of any deal, to take an important step to help working Americans – extending subsidies that help 22 million Americans pay for Obamacare. Trump refused.The Snap cutoff is just one of the anti-worker moves Trump has taken during the shutdown. He alarmed 670,000 furloughed federal workers bythreatening not to provide them with backpay. After previous government shutdowns, the hundreds of thousands of furloughed federal employeesalmost always received retroactivepay for the time the shutdown lasted. Not only that, during Trump’s first term, hesigned the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act, which was understood to guarantee backpay to federal workers furloughed during shutdowns.But during the current shutdown, Trump suddenly backtracked on that legislation and threw an unwelcome curveball to the 670,000 furloughed workers. He warned them that there isno guaranteethey will receive backpay for the four-plus weeks they have been furloughed.This was widely seen as “a strong-arm tactic” to pressure congressional Democrats to agree to reopen the government and drop their demand to extend Obamacare subsidies. Senator Patty Murray of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the Senate appropriations committee, called this Trump tactic illegal and “another baseless attemptto try and scare & intimidate workers”. She wrote on X: “The letter of the law is as plain as can be – federal workers, including furloughed workers, are entitled to their backpay following a shutdown.”In a draft memo, the Trump White House indicated that only workers it deemed essential – like military personnel and air traffic controllers – may be automatically entitled to backpay. In a slap at the 670,000 furloughed workers, Trump told reporters that backpay was iffy for federal workers, saying it “depends on who you’re talking about” and there were “some people that really don’t deserve to be taken care of”.In another anti-worker move, Trump and Russell Vought, the director of the White House office of management and budget, seized on the shutdown to announcepermanent layoffs of 4,000 federal workers. They did this after Trump called the shutdown an “unprecedented opportunity” to revamp the government and cut “Democrat agencies”. In previous shutdowns, furloughed workers weren’t laid off; they returned to their jobs when the government reopened.On Tuesday, Susan Illston, a federal district court judge in San Francisco, extended an injunctiontemporarily blocking the layoffs. She calling them capricious and a form of “political retribution’ and said that such mid-shutdown layoffs were “unprecedented in our country’s history”.Everett Kelley, the president of the American Federation of Government Employees, a union representing 800,000 federal and Washington DC government workers,called the layoffs illegal. “Federal workers are tired of being used as pawns,” Kelley said. He added: “It is disgracefulthat the Trump administration has used the government shutdown as an excuse to illegally fire thousands of workers who provide critical services to communities across the country.”Trump’s biggest enemy isn’t the media. It’s poor people  | Ross BarkanRead moreWe shouldn’t be at all surprised that Trump has pursued new anti-worker policies during the shutdown, considering that he has embraceddozens of anti-worker policiesduring his nine months back in office. Notwithstanding his repeated promises to help miners, Trumphalted enforcement of a regulationthat protects coalminers from a devastating, often deadly lung disease. Enraging labor leaders, Trump has moved to strip collective bargaining rights frommore than 1 million federal workers. Hescrapped the minimum wage requirementthat federal contractors pay their employees at least $17.75 an hour; as a result, many full-time workers will see their wages fallby more than $9,200 a year. Trumpfired the chair of the National Labor Relations Board(NLRB), leaving the country’s top labor agency without a quorum to protect workers from companies’ unlawful anti-union tactics.Meanwhile, Trump has slashed regulations on oil companies and crypto-billionaires to help them increase profits. Trump “talks a good game of being for working people, buthe’s doing the absolute opposite,” said Liz Shuler, president of the AFL-CIO, the main US labor federation. “This is a government that is by, and for, the CEOs and billionaires.”For weeks now, Trump could have easily ended the shutdown by doing a straightforward favor for America’s working class. But he has refused to do so because he doesn’t want to be seen as bending in any way in his showdown with the Democrats. Trump could end the shutdown in an hour or two by telling congressional Republicans: “Let’s do the working class a solid by extending Obamacare subsidies.” That would be a boon to millions of workers because without the extension, Obamacare premiums willmore than double on averagefor 22 million Americans.All this shows that Trump has acted coldly, cruelly and calculatingly toward working-class Americans during the shutdown. Any president who truly cared about American workers, any president who wanted to reduce their worrying and their pain, would, during the shutdown, be doing the opposite of what Trump has done.Steven Greenhouse is a journalist and author, focusing on labor and the workplace, as well as economic and legal issuesExplore more on these topicsUS politicsOpinionUS federal government shutdown 2025Donald TrumpTrump administrationUS federal government shutdownsWorkers' rightscommentShareReuse this content"

Wouldn’t you?Paul DaleyAs someone who still has anxiety dreams about my final exams, my heart goes out to the Queensland students who studied the wrong Roman emperorThu 30 Oct 2025 18.56 EDTLast modified on Thu 30 Oct 2025 19.02 EDTShareFour decades later I still dream about my secondary school final exams as if it was yesterday. I can still sense the hellish, untameable anxiety that I carried throughout that unnecessarily demanding year when the smallest academic blip could launch me into a debilitating state of catastrophe.So it’s no surprise that my heart goes out to those year 12 Queensland students who learned on the eve of their final history exam that they’d studied the wrong Roman emperor –Augustus rather than his great uncle Julius Caesar, upon whom the test would focus.On reading about this I had a visceral reaction like I would on hearing breaking chalk or finger nails scraping down the blackboard. I went cold. My breath shortened. These poor students and their parents. Their pain was mine.Anxiety’s malevolent tendrils can grip us at the least convenient and logical of times. No matter how I might intellectualise a potentially challenging situation I’ve always found it easy to foresee the worst.A family member (could anxiety actually be genetic or is it just learned by our progeny?) recently advised me before a potentially challenging public appearance: “Just imagine the absolute worst-case scenario – and then when it doesn’t happen you’ll be really pleasantly surprised.”I always know when I’m irrationally anxious because I experience the same dream. In it I turn up to my year 12 English Lit exam having read all of the novels on the syllabus many times. Bathsheba Everdene of Thomas Hardy’s Far from the Madding Crowd lived rent-free in my teenage head for all of my 18th year, along with Pip and Miss Havisham and Magwitch from Charles Dickens’ Great Expectations.Et tu? More Queensland high schools taught wrong Caesar topic as student speaks out after examRead moreBut when I go into the study hall, sit at my desk and turn the exam paper over, there are no questions about these books. Instead the exam focuses on novels (and a comic!) I’ve never heard of. I wake up sweating, my heart palpitating.This dream is the same one that I had many nights in the year when I was actually studying for my Victorian high school certificate exams. I dream this scenario today with the same potent sense of dread.It’s a classic, not so subconscious, anxiety response of course – the impossible exam of my dreams a clunky metaphor for whatever potentially daunting grown-up situation I’m facing. It’s never actually happened – but it might’ve. And I know, from talking to school and university mates for over 40 years now, that this is a common dream among even the mildly anxious. So I have to wonder today just how it might feel if I had to face the reality on the eve of an exam, like those kids inQueensland, that Ireally hadsomehow studied the wrong novels or syllabus – which is to say emperor.In a word, I’d say, shattered. Perhaps paralysed. Terrified even.We put so much store in traditional schooling success, place so much pressure on our young from such an early age to succeed at school, that many of those Queensland students affected (notwithstanding the special consideration they’ll be given) would regard the situation as genuinely disastrous.Some people, in their anxiety dreams, find themselves partially naked when they walk on stage to give a speech or sing a song. Others are chased by lions in their local parks, or sharks in their swimming pool or jump out of the plane on their first solo sky-dive without a parachute. In the end it’s the same thing as dreaming about the exam you haven’t studied for.While anxiety has its focus on the unknowable, unpredictable, uncontrollable future, an actual realised threat can present as another more concrete, frightening, perplexing matter. So many people this week – callers to radio stations and on social media – sympathised and expressed compassion for those young people who, powerless to change things, had to confront their fear and sit the exam they couldn’t possible study for.It was all so relatable, for the essence of being human is survival – the avoidance of failure where possible.A much older person who stressed through year 12 and still vividly re-experiences its anxieties in dreams might advise those young people that school is but one gateway to a happy and productive life. Or that terrible, more challenging things happen in life that school can’t prepare us for – even if its emotional legacies can never quite be exorcised.Regardless, right now they all deserve As for resilience.Paul Daley is a Guardian Australia columnistExplore more on these topicsAustralian educationOpinionQueenslandPsychologyAnxietycommentShareReuse this content"

Certainly, May that year was when the headlines about butter peaked. Lurpak and Anchor, both owned by the same dairy co-op, Arla, had reduced the size of their standard butter pack from 250g to 200g. The price was brought down accordingly, in due course, but for a while, certain supermarkets were still charging half-pound prices for a “what would we even call 200g?” pack.The problem was, butter units are universal. A half-pound of butter always weighs the same amount in your hand, regardless of the brand. Seeing the small version in a supermarket felt almost sci-fi, like a tiny off-key detail that alerts you to the fact you’ve been kidnapped by aliens into a simulacrum world. They would have gotten away with it, but for that tiny flaw. Forced by the outcry to release a statement, the brand said it was trying to make prices “more accessible” for consumers. One almost feels embarrassed for it, flailing around for cosy equality language that didn’t explain its butter-miniatures at all.The butter meltdown was prompted by a steep climb in prices that began with the Russian invasion of Ukraine the previous year. By the start of 2023, the cost of a pack of Lurpak had gone up in some places by 37%, and people on social media were posting pictures of butter with its own security tag. What next: would they have to sell it like shoes, and keep the crackers on display and the spreadables out the back?At its height, which was 2023, grocery inflationhit 17.5%, which sounds less bad than it felt, because that was an aggregate across all foodstuffs, and there were one or two that went down in price. In fact, it was the highest shopping-basket hike since records began in 2008, costing the average household an extra£683 a yearon food had they bought the same goods as the year previous. Prices were galloping so fast nobody really understood what “average family” meant any more: previously, maybe you were average if you bought eggs, chips and beans without a glance but thought twice about steak. If you were standing in a Tesco metro, holding a Heinz four-pack, muttering: “What the living hell,seven quid?”, what did that make you? Someone with still-above-average means, but below-average speed-on-the-uptake? Or were we all,to invert Michael Govefrom way back when he was education secretary, below average now?Living costscontinued to risewell into this year, although political attention hasshifted to household bills, away from subsistence essentials, which are still very high (wait, council tax and certainly water also count as “subsisting” – maybe the better qualifier would be “commodities besides those you could immediately eat”). Food prices completely slipped off the political and media agenda, even though, just because inflation had eased, prices hadn’t gone down. Some corporations are at the mercy of global prices themselves; others are price gouging; all have seen their production costs increase, as energy prices have gone up; some have bespoke challenges related to Brexit. It’s a complicated picture, but it’s not so complicated that we need to collectively avert our eyes.Penguins and Clubs have been so hard hit by the cost of cocoa that theydropped their chocolate contentand as of a fortnight ago, can no longer be classed as chocolate biscuits. It’s a big moment for the “if you like a lot of chocolate on your biscuit, join our Club” generation, who are now biscuitally homeless. Overall, it’s been a quiet slide into things being smaller while costing the same – toothpaste, coffee, Gaviscon,Celebrations– whether you can’t live without it or should be able to, the trend is the same. It’s not discretionary, in other words, nor market-sensitive, obeying insteadthe principle of enshittification, which has yet to make it as a business studies module: everything that can get worse, will.For average families, for consumers, for – hell, throw them a bone – food producers (though major supermarkets are still doing just fine), the situation has remained dire, and yet the conversation has moved on. Which? magazine does valiant work insisting on the old values – that unit pricing should “be prominent, legible and consistent” – but there is no drumbeat demanding basic answers: how much is price-gouging, how much is necessity, how much is follow-my-leader, has anyone ever tried price-capping, will we ever get back to the old normal? These are questions a Labour government would be asking, if it weren’t so petrified of alienating businesses. That fear forces them to stay quiet, too, on the reality that the cost of living crisis isn’t over.Simultaneously, people are incessantly polled on the national issues of the day, and increasingly, they say immigration. Yet when they’re asked what’s most affecting them personally,immigration isn’t even in the top threeissues. It seems as though the media tired of the cost of toothpaste and moved on to small boats, as did all the main political parties. Who influenced who? PMQs and the media, whether print or broadcast, are like the brain and the gut, connected by the a nerve that goes both ways. In turn, this has informed what people feel they ought to say, if they want to sound as though they’ve been paying attention. Backs against the wall, though, people overwhelmingly still put the cost of living crisis first on their list of concerns. This is particularly marked among renters (91%), parents of a dependent child (91%), those aged 16 to 29 (89%), 30 to 49 (90%) and women (89%). If you’re thinking, “Wait, isn’t that everyone?”, no – those aged over 70 are more likely to worry most about the NHS (86%) and people educated to degree level angst about “the economy”, because that’s how you say “why does everything cost so much?”, when you’re fancy.What looks like a low-attention media environment is actually an omertà – a refusal to mention the thing that almost all adults spend almost all their time worrying about. “Gaslighting” is such an overused term, but we can’t stop using it until everyone stops doing it.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsUK cost of living crisisOpinionSupermarketsInflationRetail industryEconomicscommentShareReuse this content"

I asked my nan about it. She could have told me the truth, that the paint was graffiti.Instead, she told me the rocks were a species of monster called bloodsuckers, and that at night they came alive to eat children who were foolish enough to stray outside after dark. I believed her with all my heart. Why wouldn’t I? She was my nan!When my parents arrived to pick me up that day, I threw myself into the back of the family station wagon and demanded we leave before the sun went down. On the drive home, I asked my mum if bloodsuckers were real. Not only were they real, she told me, but she’d been attacked by one when she was a little girl and only narrowly escaped.My mum and nan knew what all parents eventually learn: traumatising kids can be fun.Halloween used to feel wrong in Australia, but now I gleefully await the spooky dayRead moreMum had her own share of tall tales as well. She liked the kind where the car breaks down on a lonely forest road late at night; there’s a mysterious sound outside and a maniac waiting just beyond the trees. The first chapter of my latest book is a variation of that scene, and I realise now that I probably owe it to her.I ate these stories up. They made the ordinary feel magical. They taught me it’s OK to explore the shadows, as long as you know the way back to the light. It’s no accident that children who love being scared also tend to have vivid imaginations – some even tell creepy stories for a living when they grow up.My wife’s childhood was filled with scares as well. Her father, Everett De Roche, was a screenwriter who made a career out of writing horror movies such as Razorback, Patrick and Long Weekend. Once, he secretly took a picture from the wall, scanned it, added red eyes and fangs, and hung it back up. He waited weeks for someone to notice and was delighted when the house erupted in screams.It shouldn’t come as a surprise, then, that we now have an eight-year-old daughter who loves to scare and be scared.Halloweenis her favourite time of year. She plans her costume months in advance and measures her success by how many people she manages to frighten. Sometimes she turns off all the lights in her room, hides in the corner and waits until I come to look for her. Then she lurches out at me, making zombie sounds.Of course, I give as good as I get: on the walk home from the pub, I run ahead, hide behind a pole or car, then jump-scare her when she’s close.I do this for two reasons. One, scaring kids reallyisfun. Two, now that I’m a dad, I’ve learned that scares and spooky stories aren’t just about freaking children out. Humans have long used horror stories to teach kids how to navigate a dangerous world.Fairytales warned children not to wander off, to stay away from dark and treacherous places, and to be wary of strangers. Behind the ghosts and monsters and maniacs, these tales teach us how to navigate fear and danger in the real world. They act as cultural handrails, guiding listeners from the innocence of childhood towards the complex moral landscape of adulthood.By confronting imagined terrors, we rehearse for the real ones, learning that courage, wisdom and empathy are the true charms that keep the darkness at bay.When my nan told me about the bloodsuckers, she was warning me to stay close and not to stray after dark. She was keeping me safe, in her own (slightly sadistic) way. Could she have found another way to teach me that lesson and save me from years of nightmares?Sure.

And presidential elections in Ireland are different. The office itself is largely ceremonial, but the figurehead is seen as the conscience of Irish society. The Irish electorate – at least since 1990, when Mary Robinson became Ireland’s first female president (she was followed by Mary McAleese and Michael D Higgins) – has a tendency to choose progressive presidents with intellectual heft. My own theory of who emerges victorious in Irish presidential elections is that they are thematic to the vanguard of prevailing social values: Robinson the feminist, McAleese the bridge builder between north and south, Higgins the socialist poet, and now Connolly, the anti-warpresident.As in many societies, there’s a sense in Ireland that governmental politics rarely cross over into people’s lives. So how did a leftwing politician cut through the apathy and capture a broad coalition of voters? And what lessons does her victory hold for progressives elsewhere?Connolly’s strength was her authenticity. Her personal story shaped her viewsabout social justice and equality. She grew up in a large working-class family, raised by a widowed father in a council house on the outskirts of Galway. But although she is 68, and a seasoned politician and lawyer, Connolly was able to tickle voters’ attention with organically viral videos displaying her deft soccer and basketball skills. She is a keen runner and swimmer, with a marathon personal-best time of three hours 36 minutes. Her team requested that she halt herrollerblading hobbylest she get injured during the campaign.She is not a crowd-rallying orator but a softly spoken woman given to nuance. She shirked soundbites, beyond repeating that she was representing a movement of a “new republic” and that she was an independent candidate with an independent mind. That movement is an ongoing cultural, social and political evolution in Ireland, where although far-right agitation is a feature of society, the electorate isshifting left, a Celtic revival underpins a good deal of popular culture, theIrish language is in ascendenceand people now speak of Irish unity in real, not just romantic, terms. Connolly’s vibe appealed to voters bored with centre-right politicians whose overly generic messages are honed to the point of blandness.Connolly’s politics are unapologetically on the left, and consistently so. She has repeatedly spoken outagainst war and militarisation, is highly critical of the EU’s response to what is accepted in Ireland as the genocide of Palestinians, and called out the US for funding and arming it. Hercampaign videoscentred the Palestinian solidarity movement in Ireland. She said she supported the marriage equality referendumin 2015and the abortion rights referendumin 2018. She has also repeatedly raised the climate emergency, disability rights, Ireland’s housing crisis and the importance of the Irish language being valued, and articulated a positive vision for society rooted in equality.When faced with apparent controversies, Connolly has stood by her judgment and, instead of flip-flopping, refused to backtrack, giving nuanced reasons for her thinking and behaviour. Unlike the centre-right Fine Gael party, which backed her opponent, she did not engage in negative campaigning and instead struck an optimistic tone, and remained calm in debates.Connolly has been culturally attuned. She broke out of carefully choreographed media set pieces and took instead to popular podcasts for long interviews in which she told the story of her background and spoke about her vision for a presidency built on progressive values.Her campaign leaned into the organising strategies of a grassroots movement rather than a centralised party machine. It learned from the decentralised volunteer networks used to huge effect during Ireland’s marriage equality and abortion referendums to mobilise canvassers around the country. This allowed people to organically take up the cause – folk-musician fundraisers in rural pubs, murals, memes, student organisers rallying the troops, andInstagram and TikTok influencersgravitating towards her campaign’s philosophy, giving it momentum as they communicated its message back to their audiences. Her campaign, as all successful movements are, was porous.Connolly’s team understood visual culture as the dominant form of online communication, but also the motifs within that visual culture that appeal to younger people. This meant shirking the early-2000s and 2010s styles of political branding. The campaign design had Celtic-motifflourishes and was inspired by traditional Irish shopfront signage, echoing New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani’s hand-paintedbodega signreferences. In an interview with online news outlet the Journal, Anna Cassidy, the 26-year-old graphic designer who created the brand identity for Connolly’s campaign, said: “It proves that design can tell a story,carry a message, and connect with people on both an emotional and cultural level.”Connolly will not have power to address the housing crisis, the dominant political and social issue in Ireland today. But she did talk about it. In reaching people where they are, using the language and imagery they communicate in, she has shaken the political establishment’s methods and demonstrated how an authentic connection with voters can be fostered with positive, sophisticated campaigning. In the end Connolly had something to say – but it’s her campaign tactics that got people listening.Una Mullally is a columnist for the Irish TimesExplore more on these topicsIrelandOpinionEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

Folklorists have interpreted Halloween as a relic of pre-Christian Celtic beliefs, when the turn of the seasons was thought to weaken the membrane separating the living and the dead. Some Christian evangelicals, especially in the US, view it as a sinister and sinful celebration of the occult. There’s also theperennial complaintthat it’s nothing more than a recent, brash American import.None of these claims is quite true. There may once have been an ancient festival at this time of year, but the evidence is from centuries later and doesn’t support the assertions that any celebrations had a supernatural dimension. Evangelicals’ fear reveals more about their own brand ofChristianitythan about why Halloween has its ghoulish associations.I am a curator at English Heritage, and from tales of a rotting revenant rising from its grave at Byland Abbey to aphantom drummer boyat Richmond Castle, almost every one of our sites has a story to make your hair stand on end.As for Americanisation, most of Halloween’s familiar rituals began on this side of the Atlantic: carving lanterns (traditionally from turnips); “guising” or dressing up; mischief or misrule; and going door to door asking for treats – a form of “licensed” begging that helped strengthen community ties. The small oaty “soul cakes” sometimes offered in return were first recorded in the 1400s, showing that Halloween had long been Christianised, manifesting as the 31 October feast of All Hallows’ Eve, or to use its formal name, the Vigil of the Feast of All Saints.View image in fullscreenThere are tales of a ‘rotting revenant’ at Byland Abbey in North Yorkshire.Photograph: David Pickett/English HeritageAll Saints’ Day itself, celebrated on 1 November since the eighth century, honours saints known and unknown, including souls believed to have reached heavenly bliss. But only the most virtuous went straight there. Purgatory awaited most Christians, where their souls would undergo punishment to cleanse their sins. Ultimately, souls consigned to purgatory would go upwards to heaven, but the pains endured in the meantime were believed to be every bit as hideous as those inflicted upon the wicked condemned to hell for all eternity.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They introduced the feast of All Souls on 2 November – a day for the living to pray and do good works for those enduring purgatory. Alms and soul cakes were given in exchange for prayers, and masses were sung to speed souls heavenward.Ghost stories soon spread, telling of restless spirits returning from purgatory to beg the living for help. It’s no coincidence that most of these supernatural tales were recorded by monks and nuns, the stories invariably underlining the effectiveness of monastic prayer for the salvation of suffering souls.The Reformation did away with the monasteries, and purgatory was repudiated as unscriptural. For many Protestants, Catholicism itself was becoming distinctly devilish. Over the centuries ghost stories have continually changed too, with each iteration of these “pleasing terrors” reflecting the spirits and morals of their own age.However distant we may now feel from the medieval ChristianHalloween, the festival still speaks to something deep and human. It reminds us that death comes to us all. It’s a preparation for whatever comes next, be that the netherworld or a place in the hearts of the ones we have left. Before we die well, let us first live well.

It’s deeply harmfulThu 30 Oct 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 30 Oct 2025 13.06 EDTShareThere is a video doing the roundson social mediain which Conservative MP Katie Lam pours beads into glass jars. Each bead represents 1,000 migrants and – we are led to assume – the containers they sit in, Britain. As Lam points to the number of people on indefinite leave to remain (ILR) and “all the welfare and services” they have access to, a jar ominously overflows. “State support should only be for citizens,” she says directly to the camera. “And if they are already here, they must not be able to go on benefits. Instead, they will need to leave.”This is not just a social media clip from a rogue shadow minister. It is – potentially – actual Conservative policy.In recent days, the party has confirmed it would retrospectively strip residency rights (otherwise known as ILR) from people who claim benefits or whose dependents do, even if they have lived here for decades. On Wednesday, after a large backlash, officials said a new policy would be produced “in the coming weeks” but refused to rule out removing ILR.I thought of this as I read research out on Thursday by the charityTurn2usthat outlines how decades of negative attitudes and distrust towards social security have been “baked into” the system’s design. Researchers found that 64% of current claimants believe the Department for Work and Pensions is “trying to catch them out”. It is a damning indictment of past governments’ assaults on the safety net and a vital guide to Labour as it eyes up another go atso-called welfare reform. But the report also acts as something else: a warning of how ripe this country is to buy the myth that “foreigners” are milking the benefits system.The Conservatives are not alone in rooting their immigration policy in the language of welfare dependency. When Reform launched itsplan to abolish ILRlast month, its leader, Nigel Farage, did so with the (unproved) claim that more than 50% of the people due to become eligible for the scheme in the next few years “are not working, have not worked and in all probability will never, ever work”.It is not a coincidence that rightwing media and politicians are morphing the two gripes together, or that this is happening at the same time as the far right mobilises. Attacks on immigration and benefits both rely on similar ugly prejudice: certain members of society “contribute” and others “cost”, and in the extreme, leech off the superior healthy and white population.It is often said nowadays that ideas that were once fringe in politics are becoming mainstream and that is certainly the case. But the truth is, many of these ideas – that certain groups are burdens, productivity equates to moral value, and social inequalities are a personal failure – have been mainstream for quite some time.The claim that migrants are workshy drains on the British taxpayer thrives in a society that has long framed the benefits system as too generous and easily exploited. From single mothersunder New Labourto disabled peopleduring the coalition years, over the past 30 years, receiving state support has been successfully stigmatised. The benefit reforms over the past decade – from subsistence-level benefit rates and increased use of sanctions, to degrading disability assessments – have all in effect been “punishments” for people who dare to be poor or sick. Tying the benefits bill to immigration status is in many ways the next logical step, with claiming social security now reason enough to be deported.Look out in the coming days for a debate about which types of state support count towards deportation – a sentence that, in itself, is quite remarkable to write. We have long known that not all social security is created equal. There are “good benefits” (think pensions and child benefit) and there are “bad benefits” (unemployment and disability), just as there are “good immigrants” (doctors and teachers) and “bad” ones (jobseekers or NHS patients). It will be easy enough for the right to sell the idea that, say, a young man on long-term sickness benefits is a drain on the public purse; much harder to do it with a GP on maternity leave. That one of the few details Tory officials have bothered to clarify about the policy is that older people will notlose their ILRfor claiming the state pension gives a clear enough hint at what arguments are coming our way.For an insight into how misinformation and stigma can be weaponised together, just look to the shadow work and pensions secretary, Helen Whately, who isincorrectly claiming on Xthat people on the Motability scheme get “free cars for acne”. There is a sense that the gloves are off, as politicians, legacy media and big tech platforms increasingly propagate far-fetched claims for profit and power.That the UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty has just warned that welfare cuts in recent years have fuelled therise of the far rightand populism globally shows how circular all of this is. The politicians who want to cut your benefits are the same ones who will prosper from it.Still, pull at the thread of the social safety net and it would not be a surprise to see the whole thing unravel. Does statutory sick pay for a bad back count? How about one-off support after a flood? What the hard right may find is that an uncomfortable truth will out: all of us at any given time could become sick or unemployed; most of us will experience old age. Far from what the dehumanisation of migrants would suggest, few things are a clearer sign of being human than to need some help. In the end, we are all just beads together in a jar.Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumOpinionBenefitsConservativesNigel FarageReform UKFar rightcommentShareReuse this content"

Instead, there is silence – and a huge opportunity for Labour’s opponentsThu 30 Oct 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 30 Oct 2025 06.47 EDTShareScroll back three years. The person sitting opposite me is yet to take their place at the top of Keir Starmer’s government. Instead, they are a star of theLabouropposition, for whom power advances or recedes with every poll and front page. They have just done a spot of electoral marketing, a photo op at a supermarket 100 or so miles from Westminster, and what they’ve brought home is the politics of the staff.“They’d all voted for Boris.”In this parliamentary office of dull green carpet and brown furniture my interviewee wears a mask of disbelief.Workers – backing an Etonian!“One said, ‘He’s a laugh, innee?’ They all laughed.”Fancy giving your vote away socheaply!Faster than you can say “Pavlov’s dog”, I demand the next act. Did you ask how these voters feel about their man Boris now – after the pandemic, the parties, the chaos of Brexit? Are they still laughing? But my frontbencher asked no such thing and, slowly, I see why: it smacks of challenge. For the politician in this shop, it is the staff who are the customers – soon to cast their votes – and the customer is always right. Even on something as basic to a democracy as who deserves your cross, to disagree is so disagreeable.All those clenched jaws and gritted teeth surely helped at last summer’s election, when Labour secured a majority a mile wide and an inch deep. Yet now the British government is defined by its inability to argue. Observers rarely point this out, perhaps because it is masked by Labour’s facility with blank slogans (“Change”) and production line of detailed policies. But fighting? This government is constitutionally incapable of such a thing, because that would involve picking sides and making enemies.Can you think of one group, one section or vested interest with whom ministers have traded blows? Not greedy bankers, extractive private-equity barons or even (that old Whitehall favourite) obstreperous trade unionists. After racking my brains, the Downing Street shitlist comes to: Jeremy Corbyn,Michelle Mone,bats and newts. Lest we forget, this is the government thatsaid it heeded“the concerns that have been raised by the non-dom community”. Thenon-dom community! Who gather not at a mosque or synagogue, but on a bobbing yacht to inculcate a sombre-faced Bridget Phillipson (the UK’s minister for equalities) in their more arcane tax practices.The lack of argument is why all those earnest academics cannot discern an actual Starmerism, why the prime minister’s speeches are such utter blancmange. But it is about to prove highly damaging, perhaps even fatal.In less than a month, the government will unveil a budget that will be huge in scope, and hugely painful. The public is likely to pick up a tab for £20-30bn in tax rises and spending cuts. This comes just a year after the last hugely painful budget, which was the second-largest tax raiser in postwar history and which Rachel Reevesswore never to repeat. The big headline out of prime minister’s questions this week is that the government is preparing to break its election promise not to hike any of the big three money-raisers of income tax, national insurance or VAT. That would make the second time they’ve broken that same promise, after increasing NI payments by employers.Right now is when a chancellor should be out making arguments. They should have spent months – years – arguing that the public realm needs investment, and laying out the stats that show the average British worker is taxed less than counterparts in most of western Europe. This weekend, they should be filling in Laura Kuenssberg about the expensive and arduous mission to fix a broken country. And preparing taxpayers for exactly how they’ll have to cough up (loyal backbenchers flying kites, papers from thinktanks, demands from government commissions). This time? Nothing. As things stand, the big reason for the tax rises and thus for misleading an already-suspicious electorate, will be not to pump money into schools and local services, but to observe fiscal rules imposed by Reeves herself last year. Good luck explaining that one on the doorstep. Nigel Farage couldn’t ask for more.That vacuum where ministers ought to be making their case will instead be filled by the right in both parliament and the press, who will bang on about a lying government (which is fair) and a fiscal crisis (which is nonsense).A few of uswarned long agothat strapping oneself into a budgetary straitjacket to score a point against the party of Liz Truss was as unnecessary as any stunt by Ed Davey, and far more dangerous. As anew pamphletfrom the Fabian Society points out, the fiscal rules have been ripped up by chancellors nine times before.But this lot lack the clarity and firmness even to execute a proper U-turn. The strategy so far is to bitch about “fury” at the Office forBudgetResponsibility for belatedly downgrading its forecasts for productivity – the same OBR that Reeves has made the centrepiece of her budget strategy, even promising a “fiscal lock” law. There’ll also be justified complaints about Brexit’s role in weakening the economy. But government is meant to be the business of identifying problems and proposing solutions. If ministers aren’t going to lay out how to significantly tighten trade relationships with Europe, their comments will amount to little more than well-paid kvetching.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Aides brief anonymously against Sue Gray or civil service chief Chris Wormald and they tauntMPs who resist welfare cutsas being guilty of “persistent knobheadery”. It is “an absolute vipers’ nest,” asone government official saidlast weekend. “This is no way to run a country.”You can blame the professionalisation of politics, which has given us a frontbench that, throughout their careers, have been insulated from public argument. Couple that with the chronic diffidence that afflicts many in Labour regarding the party’s enduring lack of popularity with the public. Take Reeves, first elected to parliament in 2010 when New Labour still ran the party. Across her tenure, Labour has been rejected by the public in its Brownite guise, its soft-left incarnation (under Ed Miliband) and its hard-left form. This is the kind of political training that teaches you to fear the public, and never show them who you are or what you believe.But in its essence, politics is a fight – for your side and your beliefs. Think of Tony Blair and the battle he fought with his own party over clause IV, and then against the public sector trade unions (who left him with “scars on my back”). Consider the example of Gordon Brown recruiting a senior banker to head a commission to write a report to soften up the public for a penny on taxes to pay for the NHS. Think of George Osborne arguing for years for spending cuts. And then look at this government, wasting a historic majority and leaving the door to No 10 flapping wide open for Farage and other chancers.Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsBudgetOpinionRachel ReevesLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

Never mind that it was probably carried out by a couple of chancers with a crowbar: for some of the pessimists, it’s civilisation itself that’s being prised open.Funny how the same people who decry France’s alleged dysfunctionalismprobably marvelled at the Paris Olympics of summer 2024 – thatbrief, dazzling interludewhen the city actually worked, the trains ran on time, and millions around the world fell a little bit in love with France again.The Louvre heistis hardly a harbinger of France’s decline – any more than the Notre-Dame fire in April 2019 was a symbol of the nation’s de-Christianisation. One a daring burglary, the other a simple construction accident – yet both reveal far less about the fate of France than about the relentless trimming of state funds for the upkeep of its cultural heritage.The very conservative politicians who now lament what they call young people’s “amnesia” about the past are the ones who made sure to cut back history lessons in secondary schools. The French elites are riven with contradictions, and we live in “an age of myth-making” as the French historian Marc Blochobserved: “The periods most devoted to tradition have also been those that took the greatest liberties with its true inheritance. It is as though, by a curious irony born of an irresistible creative urge, the very act of venerating the past inevitably led one to invent it.”How exactly are the French meant to feel a deep attachment to these stolen jewels when almost no one even knew they existed? And can we really blame them? Since the Revolution, France’s crown jewels have been little more than a revolving door oftheft, recovery, sale, reassembly, and auction: spirited away in 1792, partially recovered two years later, flogged off by the Directory in 1796, pieced back together under the Empire, and finally auctioned once more in 1887 under the Third Republic.Let’s not forget that the most dazzling royal diamonds and sapphires trace their origins to South Asia, at the height of Europe’s colonial expansion. With a few notable exceptions, modern France – a land of revolutions and restorations – remains largely indifferent to these trappings of monarchy, which conveniently serve, from time to time, as a handy top-up for the national coffers.The crown jewels – that glittering collection of precious stones – are not, in fact, jewellery. InFrance, since the reign of Francis I, thejoyaux de lacouronnehave been less about splendour than solvency: a state guarantee fund designed to back public loans rather than adorn royal necks and wrists. Which is why the jewels recently stolen from the Louvre are not, as some headlines breathlessly claimed, “France’s crown jewels”. They belong instead to what was known as theliste civile– the personal holdings of various members of the royal families.View image in fullscreenSupporters of Nicolas Sarkozy gather near the residence of the former French president in Paris on the day his prison sentence started, 21 October 2025.Photograph: JE E/SIPA/ShutterstockWhile the burglary itself deserves nothing but condemnation, we should be wary of anyone turning the symbolic weight of these regalia into a political prop – especially as national-populismedges dangerously forwardin France. Every petty crime becomes an occasion to resurrect the memory of a gloriously authoritarian and Catholic France – largely imagined, in this case the Second Empire – and to mourn the country’s so-called degeneration.The torrent of reactions to this jewellery heist lays bare the emergence of a political bloc in France straddling the right and the far right, bound together by a common disdain for the revolutionary legacy that shaped the nation.For days now, as if of one mind, they have launched anunprecedented assault, trampling on the very principles ofequality before the lawand judicial independence which date from the French Revolution of 1789 – all because the former president Nicolas Sarkozy happens to bebehind bars. This political tendency has always existed, but it has never been so close to power since 1940. Today, it is the president, Emmanuel Macron, who, ensnared in a quasi-monarchical exercise of authority, is inflaming the political crisis andpaving the way for this counter-revolution.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

One of his goals for the series, he says, is that “what I was wearing would get progressively more interesting”, which is ridiculous because in the very first episode he’s wearing a vivid, asymmetrical shawl that in some places reaches the floor, and he looks like a wizard who might seem chaotic but is actually very powerful.“Sheila [Greenwell, one of two judges, along with Di Gilpin] made that forLa Fetiche,” he says, referring to the avant garde house of knitwear. “Later on I wear some stuff byHope Macaulay, a Northern Irish textiles designer, thenBoy Kloves, right out of Central Saint Martins, then towards the end, two archival Stella McCartney looks.”The traitors got rid of people who probably would have figured it outIt’s not his first modelling rodeo, because who could forget theGillette campaignlast year, which is where many of us first learned the phrase “thirst trap”? But no question, it’s novel to see him wearing so many clothes. He loves being a “blank canvas”, but isn’t considering a second act as a model: “I think I’ve missed the boat – I’m 31.” Elite athletes have bizarre, truncated careers, even the ones who aren’t divers (yes, that is a “trunks” joke, thank you for noticing). But Daley is ready for his next act.Before we get to the wool, fresh in our minds, of course, isCelebrity Traitors, in which he was brutally “murdered” very early on in a tactical move by the traitors to put the heat on Kate Garraway. “They got rid of people who probably would have figured it out,” he says, not even mock grimly, with an athlete’s chagrin that he didn’t medal.View image in fullscreen‘I think I’ve missed the modelling boat’ … Daley’s first outfit for The Game of Wool.Photograph: Jamie Simpson/Channel 4It must be painful to watch the other faithfuls be so rubbish at it, I suggest. Frankly, it was vexing from the start. “Around that first round table, you’re either waiting to be touched or not wanting to be touched. It’s really intense. When I wasn’t a traitor, I was annoyed. You can think, ‘Just play the game and have fun and see where we get.’ But as an athlete, I like to be in control.”He’d also been looking forward to smashing the challenges. “As a viewer, you’re thinking, ‘I don’t really need to see all this.’ But as a participant I wanted to be jumping out of helicopters.” Instead he has had to watch from an armchair while his fellow faithfuls run really slowly and have conniptions when they get sprayed with water. It must be maddening, which would indeed explain this idea: “I think what they should have considered is a resurrection. Bringing someone back from the dead after, like, the first four murders.” Did he suggest that to the producers? “Yes. They said no.”I found The Game of Wool brutal to watch in a different way. Its contours are familiar: 10 contestants, at close quarters, knitting competitively under intolerable time pressure, getting picked off by the judges one by one. It sounds like Bake Off, but knitters are different; they’re sensitive. Holger, a German tailor, is painfully perfectionist and feels each necessary sloppy patch-up job like a blow. Meadow and Isaac point blank refuse to hug anything out. Dipti cries when she sees a dog. Ailsa is so into the story of wool, reaching back through centuries, that you worry she’ll reach the end of the thread one day, and have a terrible moment of “is that it?” Simon, a former soldier turned construction worker, is so people-pleasing you want King Charles to send him a telegram or something: “Relax, everyone already likes you.”Stephanie has a passion for Chelsea pensioners, but off screen, “the thing that she’s known for making is anatomically correct vulvas”. Why does she make those, I ask, the possibilities unfurling endlessly. (Sexual awakening workshops? Gynaecologist training? Corsage for lesbian wedding?) “That’s the amazing thing about knitting and crochet,” says Daley. “If you put your mind to making something, if you can see it, imagine it, you can make it.” Yes, sure, but why? “I can’t pretend to know why.”All the contestants are too pure for this world, which is maybe what drew them to knitting in the first place. It is, paradoxically, very stressful to watch. Yet Daley, who took up knitting just before lockdown because his coach said he had to find a hobby that didn’t involve rushing around all weekend, makes such a strong case for it that I ended up buying his first book, Made with Love, about the basics of knitting and crochet.View image in fullscreen‘Just play the game’ … Daley with Ruth Codd and Jonathan Ross in The Celebrity Traitors.Photograph: Euan Cherry/BBC/Studio Lambert/Euan CherryWhen I meet him in central London, Daley has flown in that morning from Los Angeles, where he lives with his husband, the screenwriter and producerDustin Lance Black, and their two sons, Robbie, who’s seven, and Phoenix, who’s two and a half. Daley doesn’t get jet lag because he doesn’t have time, he says, and the energy comes off him like steam – you can almost see it. He used to bite his nails, and he couldn’t sit still, but craft has solved all that.He started off making a scarf for his mum, and before too long he’d made a wool chandelier. I asked what Black thought about that. “He said, ‘Only you could take something that I suggested as a hobby and make it into something bigger than a hobby.’” It’s no joke, marrying an Olympian, but I was thinking specifically about the chandelier. You start off married to one kind of person, and suddenly they’re festooning your fittings with wool: it’s got to be an adjustment? “Oh, the chandelier was his idea.”Sorry to harp on – and this is my fixation, Tom Daley is too seasoned in the world of contest to ruminate on Traitors – but didn’t it also annoy him, after he’d been murdered, when they used his diving career as a quiz question and got the answer wrong themselves? The group were asked how many dives he’d done in his Olympic career, 96 or 102. “It’s actually 97, because I did a re-dive in London 2012. It’s a question that comes up in pub quizzes because it catches people off guard.” He won’t admit to actual annoyance, but he definitely noticed.After the 2020 Tokyo Olympics (which of course were held the following year, because of Covid), Daley retired in his head, but didn’t say so publicly. He took two years off, then un-retired himself to compete in the 2024 Paris Olympics, having realised he wasn’t ready to stop. Hetook silverin the synchronised 10 metre event, adding a fifth medal to the gold and three bronzes he already had – a record for a British diver – and then accidentally left it in the Olympic village. It had to be sent on after him when he went home. He’s so incredibly competitive, you can imagine him doing that in subconscious protest that it was the wrong colour.View image in fullscreen‘My child refused to get into the water’ … Daley at the Paris Olympics in 2024.Photograph: Sarah Stier/Getty ImagesHe already lived in the US by then – it was an obvious decision, since his husband is American and they had lived in London for the first 10 years of their relationship. But it’s also a vexed decision, in the Trump era, and “it’s just for now, anyway; we’ll see what happens with democracy”. They wanted to get their sons settled in time for elementary school. Robbie isn’t into sport, he’s into Lego and playing the drums, which is fine. Phoenix is the sporty one, “but we took him to his first swimming lesson, and, of course, it was my child that refused to get into the water”. Daley is relaxed about neither child becoming a diver, world-class or any other kind, but they do have to learn to swim. “It’s really important for children. Come on. It’sCalifornia.”It remains plain weird for him not to be a diver any more: “I’ve been an athlete since I was seven years old. There’s always been a goal to strive for. There’s nothing like a sporting goal.” He has no shortage of ideas: he wants to produce TV, and is working up projects with his husband’s counsel (Black has been making films for 25 years). But he’s pretty fixed on bringing knitting back to the masses, getting kids to sit still and be off their phones, and bringing the calm of repetitive action to a world of frazzled adults.A ripping yarn: Olympian Tom Daley opens knitting exhibition in JapanRead more“I think people will be surprised by the nostalgia, and how much it means to someone when you give them something handmade,” he says. He wants to start a YouTube channel showing people how to do the basics, working up to the trickier manoeuvres, the chandeliers.

From serene sushi-making to a shell with shoes on, we run down the finest films for those of a nervous dispositionByStuart HeritageThu 30 Oct 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 30 Oct 2025 10.56 EDTShare20.Cars(2006)Just so we’re all clear on the brief, tomorrow isHalloween. But some people do not like scary films. Some people do not like films where there are any intense emotional momentswhatsoever. This is mostly a list of those films. So, for example, Up cannot be included in the lineup because its first 10 minutes are genuinely traumatising. Similarly, Finding Nemo cannot be included because it is a film about a grief-stricken father searching for a son he believes might be dead. But Cars, a film about some cars, can. The scariest that Cars gets is when a car has a near-miss with a train. Other than that, barely any jeopardy at all.19.My Dinner With Andre(1981)View image in fullscreenChatty man … Wallace Shawn in My Dinner With Andre.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyHowever, this isn’t to say that all these films have to be for children. If you’re looking to keep your heartbeat at a consistently low thud, Louis Malle’s My Dinner with Andre fits the bill perfectly. Though rated 12, for infrequent moderate sex references, it’s fair to say that nothing at all happens here. Two men have dinner and talk a lot, and then it ends. A small army of viewers are quick to call My Dinner with Andre the most boring film ever made. It isn’t – a kinder read would be to call it deliberately cerebral – but nothing about it will keep you up at night.18.Curious George(2006)This adaptation of the classic children’s books (the first of which was published in 1941), about a pleasant chimpanzee getting into moderate scrapes, is nothing if not relentlessly charming. Will Ferrell plays a man who seeks to discover a hidden treasure in order to raise funds to save a museum, and a monkey follows him around. Unless you are extremely disturbed by scenes of paint being flung, this is one of the most happily inoffensive films ever made.17.In the Mood for Love(2000)On the surface, the films of Wong Kar-wai seem perfect for this list, since they all tend to move in a dreamily hypnotic state. However, he does seem to like to inject them with intermittent violence. There’s a car crash in My Blueberry Nights, for example, and a stabbing in Days of Being Wild. In the Mood for Love, on the other hand, is far more sedate. Two people are brought together after learning that their partners cheated on them with each other, and the result is this mournfully peaceful story. The trigger warning websiteDoes the Dog Die?states that food gets eaten rather loudly in one scene, though, so watch out for that.16.The Red Turtle(2016)View image in fullscreenExtremely touching … The Red Turtle.Photograph: Atlaspix/AlamyI desperately wanted to include the Latvian animation Flow in this list, until I remembered how badly it freaked out my eight-year-old. More sedate is Michaël Dudok de Wit’s similarly dialogue-free The Red Turtle. A man is stranded on a beach, his chances of escape thwarted by a turtle. Although – and here comes the only remotely frightening part – the turtle dies, it is reincarnated as a woman who falls in love with the man. Extremely touching and truly beautiful.15. On the Beach at Night Alone (2017)The work of South Korean director Hong Sang-soo could have filled this list from top to bottom, since he specialises in quietly meditative films where barely anything happens. However, his standout is still On the Beach at Night Alone, in which a Korean woman runs away to Germany after the end of an affair. The premise makes the film sound far more action-packed than it is, because in reality the most shocking thing that happens is that the main character raises her voice once. But the lack of tangible plot is the point. This is a film made to wash over you.14.Everybody Wants Some!! (2016)Compared with On the Beach at Night Alone, Everybody Wants Some!! is as action-packed as a Transformers movie. There are drugs, parties and repeated mentions of masturbation. But still, this is a Richard Linklater film, so it’s important to state that very little happens. For the most part, the film is just a loose collection of fun scenes comprising college baseball players hanging out and goofing off. With maybe one exception, this is as fast as your heart will beat in the entire list, but that isn’t really saying much.13.Le Quattro Volte(2010)View image in fullscreenThe GOAT? Le Quattro VoltePhilip French called Michelangelo Frammartino’s film “an essay, a cinematic poem, a spiritual exploration of time and space” – and it’s hard to find fault in that description. Le Quattro Volte is a film about an elderly goatherd in the Calabrian mountains, who quietly goes about his business in a calm and unhurried manner. It might be worth stating that this is ultimately a film about death – it’s sad but not scary – but for the most part this near-silent meditation feels like a long, slow exhalation.12.Jiro Dreams of Sushi(2011)The legacy of Jiro Dreams of Sushi is a million Netflix documentaries where chefs are treated with far more reverence than they deserve, but that doesn’t mean that this isn’t a masterpiece. Jiro Ono owns a 10-seat sushi restaurant in a Tokyo subway station, but his quiet focus and dedication to perfection mean that it has won three Michelin stars. The joy of the film comes from the loving, trance-like scenes of Jiro preparing his food with a monastic stillness. It cannot be called a truly soothing movie, because the guy is mean to his son, but other than that it fits the bill perfectly.11.The Peanuts Movie(2015)View image in fullscreenIn step with Schulz himself … The Peanuts Movie.Photograph: 20th Century Fox/AllstarThe danger, when it comes to adapting a beloved children’s character for modern audiences, is that there’s a tendency to go full Peter Rabbit and fill it with horrifying poop gags that sully the charm of the original. There is none of this in ThePeanutsMovie, which is as sincerely good-natured as any film could be. Charlie Brown harbours a crush on a redheaded girl in his class, and embarks on various methods of self-improvement so that she might notice him. It’s perfectly in step with Charles M Schulz’s comic strip and has such a lightness of touch that you’d have to be a monster not to adore it.10.Before Sunset(2004)Despite his ever-expanding sense of ambition (he is now adapting Merrily We Roll Along, filming over 20 years, with an eye to release in 2040) Richard Linklater’s masterpiece will always be the Before series, where we intermittently check in with Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy across the various stages of their relationship. Although 1995’s Before Sunrise landed with the most impact – Hawke and Delpy are young, sexy and flirtatious, and we get to watch them fall in love in real-time – Before Sunset is the heart of the trilogy. The pair are older and a little more bruised, and life has become more complicated. But it’s still a gorgeous, low-stakes, definitively unscary film.9.Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives(2010)Does the Dog Die?has an absolute field day with Apichatpong Weerasethakul’s languorous fantasy drama. Yes, this is explicitly a film about ghosts, but the site points out that they are “friendly spirits” and “not jumpscare ghosts”. And yes, there is also sexual content in the form of a scene where it is implied that a woman has intercourse with a fish, but “it somehow isn’t as disgusting as it sounds”. In truth, it is harder to justify the inclusion of this film than any other on the list, but the overwhelming tone is so soft and slow that it fits the bill.8. Playtime (1967)View image in fullscreenSterile modernity … Playtime.Photograph: Specta Films/AllstarJacques Tati’s masterpiece isn’t so much a film as an opportunity to marvel at his incredible production design; he built an entire city, Tativille, on the outskirts of Paris to make it. A procession of blink-and-you’ll miss it visual jokes, set in a stylish if sterile vision of modernity, Playtime has no real plot to speak of. Tati, dressed as his baffled Monsieur Hulot character, drifts through scenes more as an onlooker than an active participant, as the world goes about its business around him. Nevertheless, it’s a film that you will find yourself getting lost in time and time again.7.The Straight Story(1999)View image in fullscreenSlowly does it … The Straight Story.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyFewDavid Lynchfilms could comfortably fit into a list of unscary movies – stick a pin anywhere in his oeuvre and it’s likely to land on something that will psychologically terrorise you forever – but The Straight Story is his outlier. An old man (Richard Farnsworth) drives a lawnmower across middle America to visit his dying brother (Harry Dean Stanton), and that’s it. Rated U upon release, there is nothing to trouble even the most sensitive of viewers here, with the possible exception of an offscreen car crash. Nevertheless, the humour and emotion that Lynch crams into such a slight story is extraordinary. One of his finest.6.Paterson(2016)Jim Jarmusch’s best film, Adam Driver’s best film and almost certainly the best film ever made about the act of carefully redrafting a poem while simultaneously driving a bus. Paterson is an extraordinary movie with the slightest of premises. That is literally all that happens; Driver writes a poem, then changes it as he drives his bus around town, then the same thing happens the next day, and the day after. There are, admittedly, spikes in tension here and there – a guy pulls a fake gun at one point, and his wife is so relentlessly whimsical that it’ll put your teeth on edge – but for the most part this is simply a film about a man quietly going about his day.5.A Shaun the Sheep Movie: Farmageddon(2019)Especially compared with the other, far more languid, films on the list, Farmaggedon can feel a little bit like you’re being trapped in a shedful of exploding fireworks. But this is as joyful as film-making can be, and there is cross-generational appeal here. Shaun the Sheep finds an alien in his quiet small town, and decides to help it return home. The premise is just an excuse to deliver gags based on hoary old sci-fi tropes, but the scene that pushes Farmageddon into masterpiece territory is a near-scientific demonstration of what happens if you let a hyperactive alien ingest too much sugar. This may be heresy to some, but I’d bat for this as Aardman’s finest work.4.Marcel the Shell With Shoes On(2021)View image in fullscreenThe man himself … Marcel the Shell With Shoes On.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyIn these troubled times for cinema, where not even huge tentpoles can be guaranteed to make money any more, Marcel the Shell With Shoes On was a baffling thing to release theatrically. A quiet stop-motion animation about a shell who sort of ambiently potters about the place, the film is just about as niche as it gets. While it is very funny and sweet – Marcel is the sort of character you yearn to protect – there’s a melancholy undertow to the film that may catch you off-guard. But this is a list of films that aren’t scary, not films that aren’t sad, so it counts.3.Singin’ in the Rain(1952)“Very mild comic violence is unlikely to upset even the youngest children” ishow the BBFC describesthe classic music comedy, and anecdotally this is accurate. I had worried that Donald O’Connor’s aggressive slapstick in the Make ’Em Laugh sequence would be too much for my kids when they were very young – you are essentially watching a man injure himself for applause – but it turned out to be their favourite part. As films about the death of the silent movie experience go, this is vastly more palatable thanBabylon(which, let’s not forget, included a scene of an elephant crapping directly at the audience).2.Kiki’s Delivery Service(1989)Many parents will have experienced the horror of leaping into a family screening of aStudio Ghiblifilm without proper research – I cannot be the only person to have abandoned Pom Poko after all the dead racoons made the children leave the room – but Kiki’s Delivery Service is the safest bet in town. A film about a young witch who decides to work as a courier, the film is relentlessly delightful. I was going to say that there isn’t a person on the planet who wouldn’t fall in love with Kiki’s Delivery Service, but I just looked on Does the Dog Die? and there’s a trigger warning because it contains a body of water, so who knows?1.Perfect Days(2023)View image in fullscreenUtterly zen … Perfect Days.Photograph: Collection Christophel/AlamyA film about a man silently cleaning toilets for two hours has no right to be as beautiful as Wim Wenders’s 2023 film, and yet it manages to be staggering. Kōji Yakusho wakes up, gets dressed, cleans toilets, eats lunch, goes home and dreams, over and over again. The result is the best film about quiet contentment that has ever been made. It helps that the public toilets are genuinely works of art – you wonder how many holidays have been booked to Tokyo purely to visit them – but this is a film about a man experiencing everything as if for the first time. Nature, people, music, peace … it is so meditatively zen that you’ll want to watch it once a month to reset your nervous system.Explore more on these topicsRankedAnimation in filmWim WendersStudio GhibliPeanutsHalloweenPixarfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What kind of message and lyrics do you want to sing at this point in your life?steve_bayleyThe first song I got for the album was Human Mind, written by Hozier and Allison Russell, and that really set the tone for the entire record. It starts: “I deal in love baby, in good words from above … and I ain’t giving up.” I cried when I was trying to sing it for the first time. Then the next song was Beautiful Strangers by Kevin Morby. All the songs are part of me and what I’ve been singing about my whole life. There’s some about war, fighting, love … some about hard times, like the farmer whose losing his farm. Things that are going on in the world today, so Sad and Beautiful World is the perfect title.View image in fullscreen‘She was my idol’ … Staples sings with Mahalia Jackson at the 1969 Harlem Cultural festival.Photograph: Entertainment Pictures/AlamyI loved the documentarySummer of Soul. What was it like to play there [the1969 Harlem Cultural festival] and sing alongsideMahalia Jackson? Same question forWattstax [the 1973 Stax Records benefit concert in Watts, LA, to commemorate the seventh anniversary of the 1965 riots].snak3spanIt was an honour to sing with Sister Mahalia Jackson. She was my idol. When I was 10 or 11 I walked up to her and I said: “My name is Mavis and I sing, too.” She said: “Oh, you do, huh? Well, I wanna hear you.” I said: “You’ll hear me because I’m loud.” Then I started going out of the door to jump rope, because us children didn’t wanna hear the preacher. She pulled me over to her, and touched my neck and said I was damp. She said: “Don’t go out in the air when you’re damp like that. You wanna get to be an old lady like me and sing, don’t you?” She was letting me know how to take care of my voice. So my idol became my teacher and my friend. The Summer of Soul concert was a good time. Sister Mahalia told me: “Baby, Hayley don’t feel so well” – she always called herself Hayley – “I need you to help me sing this song.” So that’s why I came in on Precious Lord, Take My Hand. Wattstax was a different ballgame, because we were working in Las Vegas and had to rush over there. So in the documentary you see us in the back seat of a car having lunch. We didn’t have the chance to stay. It was fun watching the film because that was the first time I’d seen the show.You were influential in the civil rights movement in the 1960s. Do we need another civil rights movement now, 50 years later?AD2023When I did my album of freedom songs with Ry Cooder [We’ll Never Turn Back, 2007] we sang a song called 99 and 1/2. You know, 99 and a half won’t do … we gotta make a hundred. We gotta keep on pushing because the struggle is still alive.I discovered your music via Prince –The Sacrifice of Victor, a video release of one of his aftershows atBagley’s in London[1993]. Were those times and that show as fun as it looks?DrLongpigIPresumeOh lord. Any time I was with Prince was fun. I loved him so much but he was so painfully shy. He would talk to my sister more than me. He would just look at me, roll those big eyes and smile. I thought: well, if he’s going to write for me he’s gotta know something about me. So I wrote him some letters and the first album he produced for me [Time Waits for No One, 1989] had songs about or lyrics from what I talked about in my letters. Like, I told him I married an undertaker, so on The Undertaker [on The Voice, 1993] he wrote, “Don’t go with the crack, you might never come back … don’t be another number for the undertaker.” He was a genius. He kept everything all to himself, then it would come out like a blast.View image in fullscreen‘Another shy guy’ … Mavis Staples and David Byrne perform at the Apollo, New York City, 2019.Photograph: Taylor Hill/Getty ImagesHow did you find working withDavid Byrnewhen theStapleSingers covered Slippery People?Twig_the_WonderkidAnother shy guy. He would talk mostly to my father, but I loved David. He came to my birthday celebration in New York and we sang Slippery People together. Then I had the pleasure of going to his show on Broadway. He likes riding his bike. He was photographed with his bicycle on the No Kings marches? I’m not surprised. He rode that bicycle everywhere.Watching old videos of you, when you sing there are moments where you go so deep you seem to be in a trance state. Is that really the case?bluesgalI’m surprised but glad somebody noticed that. Sometimes, the spirit moves you. I definitely get lost in the music when I’m on stage. My father taught me: “Mavis, if you sing from your heart, you’ll reach the people, because what comes from the heart reaches the heart.” So when the spirit hits me, you’re gonna see Mavis looking like a zombie up there.View image in fullscreen‘Sometimes, the spirit moves you’ … Staples, circa 1970.Photograph: Michael Ochs ArchivesIs it true you had heardMartin Luther Kinggive the “I have a dream” part of his famous speech before and you shouted“Tell them about your dream, Martin”, to get him to use it that day? And you were also at theLorrainemotel in Memphiswhen he was shot. What do you remember about that day?SimonPavIt was Sister Mahalia Jackson who shouted “Tell them about your dream.” Also, I never called Dr King “Martin”, it was always “Dr King”. We weren’t at the Lorraine motel when Dr King was assassinated, we were around the corner, although we had stayed there many times because it was a Black-owned motel, so in the 60s it was the only place we could stay. We’d see Dr King every morning. He would come down to have breakfast and say, “How are you girls doing this morning?” He didn’t have to say anything: he was so powerful you would feel his presence. He called my father “Stay” and would go, “Stay. You gonna sing my song tonight?” His favourite song was Why Am I Treated So Bad, so we’d have to sing that every night at his meetings before he would get up to speak.I read in the liner notes about the moment your father [Roebuck “Pops” Staples] handed you some lost tapes and told you: “Don’t lose this.” You did a wonderful job with them – do you have your own “lost tapes”?tommytackerMy father was on his sickbed and he called me upstairs and asked me to bring him the last music he had recorded and he said, “Mavis, don’t lose this.” But it wasn’t finished, so I asked Jeff Tweedy if he would help me finish this record of Pops’ last music. When my sister Yvonne and I went to the studio and heard Pops singing Friendship we just broke down. But it came out so beautiful. That’s why the album is called Don’t Lose This. Most of the stuff that I did was released, and if it wasn’t it was probably because it didn’t come out right or I didn’t like it. There isn’t a whole bunch of stuff but if the record company want to come out with it later, it’ll be all right with me.View image in fullscreenSome of the Staple Singers … Pops, Cleotha, Mavis and Pervis in the late 1950s.Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty ImagesI first heardI’ll Take You Therein third grade when a classmate brought in this treasured 45rpm. Have other listeners shared with you how the Staple Singers influenced them positively as young people?DabMaineYes, definitely. I love kids and it’s amazing to see so many at our shows these days. They get on the front row and sing along with me, and sometimes I get them on stage. I call them teenyboppers. I love it because I used to think that the young people weren’t interested in what we were singing about. But I found out different.In my mind Stax Recordswas a true band of sisters and brothers pushing boundaries and creating magic, with a shared vision of art, liberty and righteousness. Is that the reality?Mr_202It was a pleasure working at Stax because they had all these great people such as David Porter and Isaac Hayes. We called Otis Redding “the footballer” because he was so huge, but he was one beautiful spirit. They had a mixed [race] band in Booker T and the MG’s. In the early 60s, two white guys and two black guys working together was not supposed to happen, but in Stax no one looked at colour. Anybody could walk into your session and sit and listen. It was like a family and, now they’ve got a museum, a lot of teenyboppers can see Stax today.View image in fullscreen‘I keep my head up’ … Staples and Hozier perform during Newport folk festival in 2019.Photograph: Mike Lawrie/Getty ImagesIs this the darkest time you’ve lived through or am I foolish to believe it is?babylonfallingIt is pretty dark.

I had more fun on the Llandudno pier’s ghost trainJonathan JonesThu 30 Oct 2025 13.16 EDTLast modified on Thu 30 Oct 2025 16.13 EDTShareWales is a divided nation, physically. The mountainous interior that makes it so beautiful creates more distance than you might expect between south and north. I spent the first 18 years of my life in north Wales but never saw the capital Cardiff until I lived in London. My dad used to rage at the Cardiff “crachach” down there monopolising culture.Artes Mundi, an international art prize whose shortlist this year boasts “six of the world’s most important international contemporary artists”, appears to have given in to this localism by devolving itself throughout the land. At the National Museum Cardiff, the artists have mini-displays stuffed into one long room, but to see the rest of their work you have to visit their larger shows in four other galleries dotted across Wales. Who is going to do that? And the National Museum show is not exactly appetising. I instantly fell out of love with all the artists, who did not seem to care whether they engaged visitors emotionally, intellectually or aesthetically. Their assumed audience is experts, collectors, cognoscenti – because these, after all, are the people giving the prizes.Sawangwongse Yawnghwe is a painter whose works I seem to have seen before, though not by him. His paintings of the history of Burma/Myanmar, based on black and white photographs, echo everyone from Warhol to Richter. But he has a surprise personal twist: his grandfather was independent Burma’s first president. Yes, that’s interesting – but the art is not.Nor is Anawana Haloba’s sound installation, another artwork that seems utterly familiar. A contemporary cliche, its sad ruminations lack anything to make you share the emoting. Sancintya Mohini Simpson shows a deliberately (I trust) childlike painting of plantations and European sailing ships that doesn’t tell you anything specific. It’s a gesture towards the history of empires rather than a detailed, meaningful analysis. Equally vacuous is her archaeology-style display of clay vessels that’s got something to do with the sugar trade. She may as well have just written “colonialism” on the wall.View image in fullscreenFor the few … Kameelah Janan Rasheed at Glynn Vivian Art Gallery, Swansea.Photograph: Polly ThomasThe best artist here really has printed words on the wall. Kameelah Janan Rasheed shows a huge stuttering display of broken sentences, repeated phrases and annoying punctuation marks. “i am not done yet – i am not done yet – i am not done yet” runs part of it in black type on the white wall. And it turns out she really isn’t: this troubling presentation continues on to black columns where enigmatic photographs add to the chaos. Communication is difficult, she may be saying. She deserves to win the prize if any of these artists do, I suppose, but her art is for the few not the many.Is Artes Mundi just telling the truth about art now – that it has lost touch with a mainstream audience? I headed to the other end of Wales to find out. Mostyn is a modern gallery in an unmodern place: Llandudno. For me as a child, the town meant doughnuts, a rickety ghost train on the pier and finding mermaids’ purses on the beach. Now it means watching a video of some guy slowly demolish Marcel Duchamp’s 1913 artwork Bicycle Wheel. Obviously not the long-lost original, or one of the valuable replicas owned by museums, but a mock-up the artist Antonio Paucar made himself. It isn’t hard: you just fix a bike wheel on to a stool. In what looks like a farmyard, Paucar first buries the wheel, then piles up logs around it and douses it with accelerant before setting it alight.This is a dry little joke that means less than it thinks. According to Artes Mundi, Paucar champions Andean indigenous culture, but how exactly? A performance attacking an icon of western art only makes sense to those in the know, can only communicate to someone familiar with Duchamp’s Bicycle Wheel and its place in modern art history – and smug enough to be tickled by the “reference”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Her work is an assemblage of half-baked, hackneyed tropes, from cod mysticism – she’s a water diviner! – to ironically awful paintings. One space is dedicated to her collection of small mysterious objects, essentially splodges of resin, on tables or stuck against black walls with fey inscriptions and banal assertions: “Regardless of what you hear trust the voice in your heart.” OK. The voice in my heart is telling me this is nonsense.Worse, it’s all stagey and false. But then the whole of Artes Mundi 11 is like this, at least as much as I could stomach seeing. “Six of the world’s most important international contemporary artists”? You could almost think the curators have tried to conceal the frailty of what’s on offer by dispersing it all over Wales, daring you to question them, when you haven’t even seen the show in Aberystwyth yet.If only the ghost train on Llandudno pier still existed.

Why should pupils suffer because of him?Stephen KelmanMy book, which draws on my upbringing on a diverse and deprived Luton council estate, has been used as a GCSE text. But one man objected to its profane language and depictions of violence and sexual behaviourThu 30 Oct 2025 11.36 EDTLast modified on Thu 30 Oct 2025 13.41 EDTShareBack in September, in a measure designed to “prevent immorality”,the Taliban closed down the internetin Afghanistan. This was the latest step – after a ban on all girls over the age of 12 receiving an education, and the removal of all books written by women from universities – to restrict citizens’ access to information that the regime might consider dangerous or difficult, or that challenges their ideological monopoly. The effect would have been to ensure that an entire generation of Afghans failed to reach their potential; the connection was partly restored 48 hours later, after widespread condemnation.It was against this backdrop that I read about the school in Weymouth, Dorset, thathad removedAmerican author Angie Thomas’s wildly popular young adult novelThe Hate U Givefrom its Year 10 reading list, apparently in response to the objection of one parent, former Conservative councillor James Farquharson. While copies of the book would continue to be available in the school library, its removal from classrooms sent a worrying message: that one man’s comfort could be considered more important than the rights of an entire student cohort to access literature that might speak directly to them, never mind that it may contain dangerous or difficult ideas.View image in fullscreenAuthor Angie Thomas at home in Mississippi.Photograph: Imani Khayyam/The ObserverI spoke to Vicky McNab, whose four mixed-heritage children have attended the school, and who launched a campaign to have the book reinstated (after an internal review, the school confirmed that the book will return to the Year 10 reading list). She shared with me Farquharson’s original letter to the school; he seemed to misunderstand or not appreciate the importance of teaching that racial injustice exists in America, as illustrated in the novel by the killing of a Black teenager by a white police officer.To avoid such difficult ideas gaining traction in the UK, he suggested it was the school’s duty to “select books that will teach pupils their cultural inheritance”. By implying all students share a single cultural inheritance, he seems to be residing under the belief that we are or should be a monoculture, and the overriding mission of our schools should be to reinforce some sort of nationalistic hegemony to which everyone, regardless of background, must pledge unwavering allegiance. The question then arises: who was he seeking to protect?The use of my novel,Pigeon English, is also under review at the school, thanks again to Farquharson’s intervention. His objections to my book – which he shared on Facebook having read the first 13 pages and Googled some reviews – centre on its use of profane language and depictions of violence and sexual behaviour. Pigeon English explores some of the same themes as The Hate U Give, social injustice chief among them. It draws on my experiences growing up on a diverse and deprived council estate in Luton in the 1980s and 90s, and on the killing ofDamilola Taylor, the Nigerian schoolboy stabbed to death in Peckham, London, in 2000.View image in fullscreenThe cover of Pigeon English by Stephen Kelman.Photograph: Susannah Ireland/Rex FeaturesThe novel was very much directed at an adult readership, which I felt could parse some of its more troubling content and recognise the urgent social questions it posed. I did not predict that it would end up in the hands of schoolchildren or being dissected in classrooms; nor was I consulted when the decision was made in 2015 – rubber-stamped by a Conservative education secretary – to include it on the GCSE curriculum. But its continued use as a set text suggests that teachers see in it an opportunity, rather than a threat. An opportunity to discuss, in the controlled and collaborative space of the classroom, themes and topics of particular relevance to the lives of their students.This has been borne out by the feedback I have received over a decade of visiting schools up and down the country where Pigeon English is used either as a GCSE text or as a class reader for younger age groups. Teachers report that the book engages their students at a deeper level than other texts at their disposal, while students routinely tell me it is the first book they have studied that represents a world they recognise and includes characters they can relate to. This makes them feel seen as individuals, as well as part of a community bound not just by their real-life familiarity with events similar to some of those described in the book, but by the collegiate experience of reading and studying it together. It might also initiate a connection to the broader world of literature and the arts that can be a lasting source of revelation in their lives.View image in fullscreen‘I have learned more about the human condition from looking at dirty feet’ … Kelman shortly after the publication of Pigeon English in 2011.Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose/The ObserverTo deny students that kind of opportunity just because they may have to traverse some difficult terrain along the way would be to inhibit their progress towards fulfilling their own potential. In my conversations with them, I do not see young people who have been traumatised by the experience of reading my book. I see in their smiles the pleasure of emotional engagement, and in their eyes the fire of intellectual challenge. Like it or not, kids relate to difficult content, in ways their parents and the adult world may not entirely understand or approve of. By providing them with opportunities to discuss that content – to find the social and political context, to analyse cause and effect, to unpack the psychology of why good people do bad things – we teach them empathy, resilience and critical thinking, and train them to enter a world where a command of those faculties is more vitally important than it has ever been.There are many things those who would ban books could be said to lack – reason, perspective, humility – but I would suggest it is their deficit of courage that defines them; or, to put it another way, their fear of discomfort. Perhaps it is the same fear that decrees the heroes of our novels should be sympathetic and relatable, that art should only depict humanity at its best and least offensive. But what can we really learn about ourselves by avoiding the messy and imperfect reality?WhenCaravaggio’s Madonna di Loretowas unveiled in 1606 it scandalised Rome; not because it dared to put a face to the newborn Christ but because it showed the dirty feet of the peasants who knelt to venerate him. Centuries later, do those same prudish sensitivities still prevail? I have learned more about the human condition from looking at those dirty feet than from the halo around the holy infant’s head.View image in fullscreenThe cover of The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas.Photograph: AmazonWhen I think about my own formative reading experiences, an instructive discomfort pertains to them all. The discomfort of learning that Jim was enslaved in Huckleberry Finn; of discovering thatPaddy Clarke’s parents were unhappy in their marriage, just like mine were; of observing, inSlaughterhouse-Five, that the human capacity for cruelty, if left unchecked, could reduce entire cities to ashes. The discomfort of simply trying to figure out, aged 17, what the fuckUlysseswas about was joyful and life-changing. From those discomforts my character was formed; they gave rise to my intellectual curiosity and emotional inquisitiveness, to my sensitivity to injustice, and to my deep compassion for humanity in all its flawed and magnificent diversity. They connected me to the world; and if you feel a part of something, rather than estranged from it, you’re more likely to want to work in its best interests.The modern trend towards avoiding discomfort – medicating against it with performative bigotry and Labubus, with flag worship andchatbot therapists– steals away our vigilance and opens the door to tyranny. To see this, we need only look at the success Nigel Farage and Reform UK are enjoying in fomenting distrust and division for their own political ends. People denied the practice of sitting with their discomfort become, inevitably, desensitised to the discomfort of others. This leads to a deficit of empathy.Discomfort and disorder are the world’s prevailing forces, and books remain one of the best tools we have at our disposal for preparing young people to navigate them. A good teacher – and schools up and down the country are full of them, national assets too often underappreciated and taken for granted – will guide a student through their discomfort, helping them to find clarity of thought within it. This way, a school becomes a breeding ground for empathy. If we are to survive the culture wars, these breeding grounds will be essential.Pigeon English by Stephen Kelman (Bloomsbury Publishing PLC, £9.99).

But who will be the new Time Lord – and is it goodbye to Russell T Davies?The BBC have confirmed that the long-running sci-fi show will return to our screens. But with ratings falling and its Disney partnership ending, questions hang over its futureMartin BelamThu 30 Oct 2025 10.01 EDTLast modified on Thu 30 Oct 2025 10.02 EDTShareSometimes the answer to one mystery only prompts more questions. That may well be the case with this week’s announcement from the BBC thatDoctor Whowill return to BBC One with a 2026 Christmas special and a new series to follow, but that the show’s international streaming partnership with Disney+ will end.There was no indication of who might play the Doctor in next year’s special, which will be written byRussell T Daviesand produced by Bad Wolf with BBC Studios.The final episode of the 2025 series,The Reality War, appeared to show a departing 15th Doctor, Ncuti Gatwa, brieflyregenerating into Billie Piper. Piper has previously played companion Rose Tyler, although it was notable that she was not credited as “The Doctor”, leaving the future casting of one of British television’s iconic roles very much up in the air.Lindsay Salt, director of drama at the BBC, said: “We’d like to thank Disney+ for being terrific global partners and collaborators over the past two seasons. The BBC remains fully committed to Doctor Who, which continues to be one of our most loved dramas, and we are delighted thatRussell T Davieshas agreed to write us another spectacular Christmas special.“We can assure fans, the Doctor is not going anywhere, and we will be announcing plans for the next series in due course, which will ensure the Tardis remains at the heart of theBBC.”Fans have already begun speculating, noting that the phrasing of the press release doesn’t confirm that Davies will continue as showrunner, the role he has held – for a second time – since taking the helm for the 60th anniversary specials in 2023. Nor does it commit the BBC to continue to work with Bad Wolf in Cardiff, where the show has been made since its 2005 revival.View image in fullscreenIs Rose the new Doctor? … Billie Piper in The Reality War.Photograph: BBC Studios/Bad WolfLike many high-profile dramas, Doctor Who had been perceived to be struggling, with diminishing linear transmission viewing figures. Episodes in the most recent series were regularlypulling in fewer than 2 million viewerslive on BBC One, a historic low for the long-running show. None of the ratings for this year’s episodes, even including iPlayer views after seven days, reached 4 million viewers, a significant slump compared with Jodie Whittaker’s tenure. The Disney deal did not power Doctor Who to be the global streaming hit that both sides of the arrangement must have been hoping for.While figures have been a closely guarded secret, Disney+ ending their association with the show will inevitably have an impact on the BBC’s budgeting for a programme that had a reputation in the 1970s and 1980s for wobbly sets andbubble wrap monsters, but which has been enjoying an expensive CGI-enhanced glow-up.Davies once told Doctor Who Magazine that a reported Disney-boosted figure of £10m an episode for the last two seasons was “exaggerated”, with Bad Wolf executive producer Jane Tranter only confirming that the deal with Disney provided “a really good budget for us”.She suggested, however, that the budget was not on a par with Game of Thrones or The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, highlighting one of the issues that Doctor Who has faced. In the streaming world it is competing with the likes of Andor and The Last of Us. It faces the scrutiny of an international adult fandom, while the BBC is also still trying to make it a programme that will appeal to families on a Saturday teatime and, crucially for the future of the franchise, give younger viewers an on-ramp to becoming the next generation of lifelong fans.Fun, flirty and far too brief: why did Ncuti Gatwa leave Doctor Who so soon?Read moreThe Gatwa era has been plagued by rumours of production difficulties behind the scenes, with his decision to leave the lead role after just 18 episodes apparently necessitating reshoots of the season finale. Carole Ann Ford, who played the Doctor’s granddaughter Susan in the very first episode in 1963 and who made a brief return this year,recently suggestedduring a convention interview that only part of what she had filmed was used. Gatwa’s departure, it seems, had resulted in her storyline being scrapped.Millie Gibson, who played companion Ruby Sunday, recently spoke out about tabloid coverage labelling her a “diva” on set, which, reports claimed, led to her being dropped in favour of Varada Sethu as the companion for Gatwa’s second series. The former Coronation Street star has claimed she found herself in a situation where she felt shecouldn’t speak up to defend herselfin case she spoiled future plot developments for viewers.A spin-off from the show,The War Between the Land and the Sea, starring Russell Tovey, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Jemma Redgrave and Ruth Madeley, is expected to be broadcast on BBC One later in 2025, marking the end of Doctor Who’s association with Disney.The BBC has also previously announced that it isexploring options for an animated versionof Doctor Who, aimed at a preschool audience, which would run on CBeebies, independently from the main show.Explore more on these topicsDoctor WhoFantasy TVTelevisionRussell T DaviesBillie PiperfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For the last decade, Von Hauswolff has dealt in music that is solemn, echo-laden, heavy on the drone of her beloved pipe organ and fully deserving of the adjective gothic.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Iconoclasts.Her work has elicited comparisons to Nico and Diamanda Galás; 40 years ago, it might have been packaged in a hauntingly abstract Vaughan Oliver sleeve and released on 4AD. She has collaborated with Swans, Sunn O))) and the black metal band Wolves in the Throne Room. Her last album, 2020’s All Thoughts Fly, was a collection of instrumentals, recorded on a replica of a 17th-century German baroque organ in a church in Gothenburg: you can perhaps get some idea of its emotional tone from the fact that it was released on a label best known for releasing doom metal.One blogger called her “the high priestess” of “satanic harmonies”, a description that caused her trouble. Taking the blogger at their word, fundamentalist Catholics succeeded in getting hershows at churches in Nantes and Paris cancelled: in the former location, protesters blocked the entrance. Clearly, Von Hausswolff doesn’t seem much like an artist out to challenge Sabrina Carpenter or Taylor Swift.Yet the description of Iconoclasts as “pop” fits, albeit with caveats. It’s far more straightforwardly melodic than her previous work, and it is no stretch to imagine the most straightforward track, the ballad Aging Young Women (a duet with Ethel Cain), on the radio or in the charts: it sounds a little like Lana Del Rey, had Del Rey somehow contrived to end up at the bottom of a well. Though it is perhaps worth noting that Cain is not the key collaborator here; nor is Iggy Pop, who turns up on another ballad, The Whole Woman, his baritone croon possessed of an affecting wobbliness at 78. It’s avant garde saxophonist Otis Sandsjö, whose music was winningly described by Jazzwise magazine as “intentionally puzzling”: suffice to say, his is not the first name you would think of were you planning a full-scale storming of Spotify’s Hot Hits playlist.Anna Von Hausswolff: The Whole Woman ft Iggy Pop –videoSandsjö is everywhere on Iconoclasts, his sax leading the instrumentals Struggle with the Beast and Consensual Neglect, his woodwind arrangements adding a note of warmth to the title track and The Mouth, his playing alternately raw – there are moments when you can hear his fingers hitting the keys of his instrument – becalmed and driving: the skronky funk of his performance on Struggle With the Beast powers the track for nearly nine minutes. And yet, you couldn’t describe his contributions as dominating: there’s too much else going on.Iconoclasts is a long album – it lasts the best part of an hour and a quarter – but it still feels crammed with sound. There are heaving synthesised drones that, in their intensity, occasionally evoke the sound of Fuck Buttons’ 2009 masterpiece Tarot Sport; explosions of fizzing noise; cinematic orchestrations; and drum patterns that marry a ritualistic-sounding thunder to rhythms that variously recall the pulse of dance music, the glitterbeat stomp of glam, and even reggae. Von Hausswolff is less inclined to erupt into shrieks and ululations than she once was, but her singing still has a blazing forcefulness that cuts through the echo she is frequently doused in.It’s music that feels as if it’s in constant motion, amplified by the fact that the melodies, rich and beautiful as they are, seldom adhere to any standard verse-chorus structure: the songs here usually end up somewhere very different from the place they started. Indeed, its maximalism might be too overwhelming to take in one long sitting.Anna von Hausswolff: ‘It’s still weird to see a woman screaming her nuts out’Read moreBut if it is too much, it’s too much of a good thing: with their sense of movement, their twists and turns, their radiant tunes, their emotive power, these songs are exhausting because they’re exhilarating. For an album with a worldview summed up by a striking line from Facing Atlas that declares life on Earth “full of shit and full of evil”, that ponders ageing and paralysing depression, and on which it is frequently unclear whether the songs are dealing with something personal or with current events (“the sky is crashing down upon the ships of freedom … the life we had has vaporised into the sky”), its overall mood is a kind of frazzled euphoria. The songs surge and build, the bursts of noise feel cathartic. It’s as if the music is fighting against the tone of the lyrics, urgently pressing forward despite everything. “I’m breaking up with language,” Von Hauswolff sings on Stardust, “in search of something bigger.” In the strange, unique, expansive, impassioned and experimental take on pop presented on Iconoclasts, she seems to have found it.What Alexis listened to this weekSampha – Cumulus/MemoryCo-written by Romy of the xx, but left off Sampha’s 2023 album Lahai, Cumulus/Memory is two songs in one, changing tempo midway through but united by a reflective, small-hours mood.Explore more on these topicsPop and rockAlexis Petridis's album of the weekExperimental musicalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s sensual, visceral and, she says, totally intuitiveThu 30 Oct 2025 04.00 EDTShareAcouple of summers ago I was in a club in Manchester, dancing alone in the dark, when bodies suddenly flooded the dancefloor. Androgynous men and women all dressed in skin-tight, skin-coloured lace. Their lithe limbs and torsos flinched and flickered; they slithered and strutted. They were alluring and unhuman, sexy and weird. I was in the middle of ROSE, an immersive dance collaboration between record label Young and Sharon Eyal, an Israeli choreographer now based in France, who has become one of the most in-demand on the contemporary dance scene over the last decade. In her works that have come to the UK – Killer Pig, OCD Love, Saaba and more – Eyal’s strangely intoxicating choreography taps into the sensibility of nightclubs and catwalks, as well as something much more primal in the gathering of bodies to move as one together.There is something intimidating about these dancers and their distorted bodies, gorgeously confident and coolly aloof; I wondered whether Eyal herself would be intimidating, too. She doesn’t do a lot of interviews. But on video call from her home outside Paris she smiles. She’s a little guarded, enigmatic, hard to get a handle on. Not the kind of artist who wants to explain her work (like Margot Fonteyn, who when once asked about something she’d performed, said: “I told you when I danced it”).“What does it mean to you?” Eyal counters, when I ask about the title of the piece she’s about to bring to London, Into the Hairy. I garble something about textures and murkiness and monsters and creatures (Chewbacca springs to mind, though I don’t mention that). “Amazing, beautiful. You have it all,” she says. Clearly, every answer would be the right answer.The root of it all, really, is music (especially dark, minimal, ravey beats), and all the choreography originates in Eyal’s own body. Born in Jerusalem in 1971, Eyal has been dancing for as long as she can remember, and started lessons at four. “I was a very hyperactive girl. I didn’t sleep, I didn’t eat. It was problematic. And the moment that my parents found dancing, I was much more calm and a better person, maybe,” she smiles. I ask her how dancing made her feel. “I don’t know how to answer this question,” she says. “It’s just, I’m more me. I can be more myself when I’m dancing and creating. I’m not thinking about what it means, just that I have to do it.”Eyal danced with Tel Aviv-based company Batsheva for 18 years, but she was always creating her own movement, always a choreographer. She set up her own company in 2013. Everything you see on the stage starts with Eyal herself improvising, which is then mapped on to the dancers. “I love to give my movement to the dancers and feel their interpretation,” she says. Each movement idea could be slowed down, reversed or repeated – there is a lot of repetition – just as a composer might do with a musical motif. From a small amount of source material, Eyal will play with composition and timing and layering up movement. “The most, most important, is timing,” she says. “For me, timing is everything. It’s almost like a movie for me,” she says, and I picture her in the studio like a director in an edit suite, getting the cuts just right.Caius Pawson, the founder of record label Young, who worked with Eyal on ROSE, told me over email about witnessing her process. “I’ve never experienced anything like it,” he wrote. “No thinking, no rationale, no explanation. It all seems to come from within. Pure heart. She’s open to everything, yet totally sure of what she loves. Precise in her choices but always tender.”View image in fullscreenBody talk … Into the Hairy.Photograph: Katerina JebbPawson wanted to put Eyal’s dancers into a club setting to bring dance’s visceral impact to audiences up close. The company has also performed at Bold Tendencies, the south London arts organisation based in a multistorey car park turned performance space. Eyal’s works are co-credited with her husband and creative partner Gai Behar, who is a former producer of parties and multimedia events on the Tel Aviv club scene. You can tell the couple have spent some time on dancefloors by the worlds they create on stage (Eyal is often pictured with dramatic eyeliner and blurred lipstick, which is a kind of 3am-on-the-dancefloor look), though the dance itself is as disciplined and highly technical as classical ballet.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I want to see the struggle, the fragilityOn the wall behind where Eyal is sitting there’s a large canvas of two figures entwined in an embrace. It’s Eyal and Behar, given to them as a wedding gift. “It’s beautiful, no?” she beams, like someone still very much in love. The couple have worked together for 22 years but it’s unusual for Behar, who isn’t a choreographer, to be co-credited as a dance creator. Yet it sounds as if he’s essential to the work. “His eyes are very different to mine but he has very good taste,” says Eyal. She calls him “the cleaner” because he helps finesse the choreography and focus her ideas, honing the finished dances.Behar is half French, which is partly why they moved here, nearly four years ago. Eyal has also renamed the company, formerly L-E-V, now Sharon EyalDance, or S-E-D. The new works, Into the Hairy and Delay the Sadness, which premiered in Germany in September, are different to the pieces I’ve seen before, she tells me. Something’s shifted. “It’s becoming more precise, more clean, more pure, more minimalistic,” she says, all in order to intensify the emotion. “For me, less is much, much more.” It’s a different chapter, Eyal says. Why, I ask, what has changed? “Life,” she says, and smiles, Mona Lisa-ish.Eyal has talked about the aim of her choreography being “total feeling”. “Total feeling is to be 100% in the moment,” she says, the physical, the emotional, all in. “I think I’m a person like that: when I’m doing something, it’s all my heart.” It’s not just being in your element, she says, it’s becoming the element, the danceristhe music,isthe movement.View image in fullscreenYou want it darker … Sharon Eyal.Photograph: Davit GiorgadzeBut that total feeling isn’t only a pleasurable one. “I don’t like it when a dancer feels very comfortable,” says Eyal. “It’s just not interesting for me. I want to see the struggle, I like to see the fragility, I love to see the challenge.” She wants them to delve into their own darkness. “In the end, I want them to enjoy, and suffer a bit also.” She gives a little laugh. “When you’re going through a deep feeling in yourself, I believe people can connect to it.” When Eyal raves about the music of electronic producer Koreless, AKA Welshman Lewis Roberts, who worked on Into the Hairy, she singles out “the disturbing feeling” of his music alongside its texture, nuance and melody. A comment under one of Koreless’s tracks on YouTube describes his music as being like having a brain massage, and Eyal is very happy with that idea.Eyal often harnesses the power of unison in her works, a couple of dozen bodies moving tightly in sync. “The power of unison is the power of loneliness,” she says, perhaps counterintuitively. “As much as you are in a big group, you become even more alone.” She coaches her dancers not just to dance together, “but really to feel together”. “A lot of times I’m saying to the dancers: you have to feel like you’re looking to the same star, or you’re from the same planet.”Is she thinking about the outside world when she’s in the studio, with these ideas of togetherness and loneliness? “I’m thinking about everything, all the time,” she says. “My creation is not outside my life. But I’m not talking about society and stuff like that. I’m talking about human feeling and physicality and sensitivity. I’m not such a philosophical person,” says Eyal. “I’m intuitive. That’s why it’s very hard for me to describe. It’s really something that’s coming from my urge.”That’s the thing about Eyal. It’s about the doing, not just directing others what to do. “For me it’s also about the dancing itself. I need to move to do it,” she says. And so does that mean as you get older and you change, the movement changes with you? “Yeah. And when I cannot do it any more, maybe I can’t create any more.”Or maybe you’ll be 90 and developing a whole new way of moving? “Let’s see,” she says, happily. “I hope so.”Into the Hairyis at Sadler’s Wells, London, 13 to 15 November;Delay the Sadnessis touring to Azerbaijan, Austria and France in November.Explore more on these topicsDancefeaturesShareReuse this content"

I will never forget the line that I had, but I couldn’t get it out. It was: ‘I’m sure you’ve all grasped the fundamental paradox of precrime methodology.’ That was the line that started the scene.“I remember one of the [crew] coming up and saying, ‘Do you want to go and take a breath of fresh air?’ And I remember thinking: ‘If I go out and take a breath of fresh air, then I’ll be under more pressure when I come back in.’”After 46 takes, Farrell finally managed it. “Tom wasn’t very happy with me,” he said.Three years after the incident, Farrell checked himself into a rehab centre to try to cure an addiction to drugs and alcohol, doing the same again in 2018 as a “preemptive measure”.In his latest film, Ballad of a Small Player, Farrell plays a high-stakes gambler hiding out in the casinos of Macau.Farrell’s character in Minority Report is meant to be entirely sober, but many actors have shot scenes in which they’re meant to be drunk whileactuallydrunk, in an attempt at authenticity.These include Fred Astaire, who shot his “drunken dance” scene in Holiday Inn seven bourbons down; Robert Shaw, who was so intoxicated before filming his key monologue in Jaws that he had to be carried to the set; and Nicolas Cage in Leaving Las Vegas, in which he plays a self-destructing alcoholic.View image in fullscreenRobert Shaw went method during Jaws.Photograph: THA/AlamyBilly Bob Thornton, too, adopted method acting techniques while shooting Bad Santa, about a permanently intoxicated Father Christmas, saying: “I drank about three glasses of red wine for breakfast … Then I switched over to vodka and cranberry juice, and then I had a few Bud Lights. By the time I got to that scene there, I barely knew I was in a movie.”However, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher forged a template for Farrell on the set of the Empire Strikes Back, arriving on set fresh from partying with Eric Idle and the Rolling Stones. “I remember that we never went to sleep,” said Fisher, “so we weren’t hungover – we were still drunk when we arrived in Cloud City the next day. We don’t really smile a lot in the movie, but there we’re smiling.”Cruise, meanwhile, is known for his strict work ethic and sober professionalism. In 2020, leaked audio of the actorberating crew memberson the seventh Mission: Impossible movie for potentially breaking social distancing guidelines went viral.View image in fullscreenHappier days … Cruise at the Cannes premiere of Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning.Photograph: Michael Buckner/Variety/Getty ImagesAdmonishing two technicians for standing too close to each other in front of a monitor in Leavesden, Cruise said: “We are the gold standard. They’re back there in Hollywood making movies right now because of us. Because they believe in us and what we’re doing. I’m on the phone with every fucking studio at night, insurance companies, producers and they’re looking at us and using us to make their movies.“We are creating thousands of jobs, you motherfuckers. I don’t ever want to see it again. Ever!”The actor later defended his outburst, saying that he wanted to ensure that production on the film did not shut down. “I said what I said,” he told Empire. “There was a lot at stake at that point.”In the UK,Taking Action on Addictionprovides links to different support services.

The couple are believed to have split at the end of 2024.The album has received widespread acclaim, including a five-star review from the Independent and four stars from the Guardian’s Alexis Petridis, who praised its “boldness and the quality of its songwriting”.The apparent disclosures – whether poetic licence or otherwise – have generated headlines since the album’s surprise release on 24 October. The woman known on the albumas Madeline– a Jolene-style figure – has apparently revealed herself to the Mail on Sunday. The New York City brownstone apartment where Allen and Harbour lived – which they once revealed on an Architectural Digest video – is on the market.In new interviews, Allen discussed how difficult dating had been after the dissolution of her second marriage and admitted that she had been banned from dating app Hinge on suspicion of being a Lily Allen impersonator.Three songs from West End Girl (the maximum possible from an album) are expected to chart in the UK Top 40 tomorrow: in the midweek charts, Pussy Palace was at no 17, the title track at 18 and Madeline at 29. The album was at No 4 in the midweeks, a position partly powered by – the now relatively arcane – mp3 downloads.Tickets go on sale at 10am GMT on 7 November.Tour dates2 March Glasgow Royal Concert Hall3 March Liverpool Philharmonic Hall5 March Birmingham Symphony Hall7 March Sheffield City Hall8 March Newcastle O2 City Hall10 and 11 March Manchester Aviva Studios14 March Nottingham Royal Concert Hall15 March Cambridge Corn Exchange17 March Bristol Beacon18 March Cardiff New Theatre20 and 21 March London PalladiumExplore more on these topicsLily AllenPop and rocknewsShareReuse this content"

But when it crashed in July, it left thousands of applications for vital funding in doubt – a situation that persisted for several months until applications reopened in late September.Individual artists and leaders of arts institutions have said that, after the crash, they received less money than initially offered by ACE, which is also accused of revoking funding application extensions for organisations affected by the collapse of the portal.ACE claimed the outage was caused by the inability of Grantium to operate with high traffic at a time when the system was being updated. The arms-length arts funder currently distributes about £500m of public money and more than £250m of national lottery money annually, while employing 650 people.Grantium launched in 2016 and was heralded as a system that would “help to bring [ACE] into the 21st century”. It was supposed to cut out the bureaucracy of the old paper-based system, be “fit for purpose” and create estimated annual savings of £1m for ACE.But many people the Guardian spoke to described chaos and confusion in the aftermath of the Grantium shutdown.Pui-Ka Cheng is the writer, director and fundraiser for Drift, an ACE-funded project that had performances at the Lowry’s Aldridge Studio in Salford earlier this month.View image in fullscreenPui-Ka Cheng had to cover her project’s expenses from her savings when its funding stalled.Photograph: Josh Cadogan PhotographyDrift received approval from Grantium on 17 July, according to Cheng. But she encountered difficulties in submitting her bank account details shortly afterwards.When Grantium started having problems, Cheng sent numerous emails, made phone calls and submitted inquiries through the ACE website “without receiving proper assistance. Unfortunately, we only received incorrect links in response.”She added: “We have not received any funding from the Arts Council. Consequently, none of our team members have received artist fees and I have had to cover all expenses from my personal savings.”Grantium has been criticised for years by those who have to use it. In May 2024, an open letter was sent to Dame Mary Archer, who was at that time heading a review into ACE, which is now led by Margaret Hodge.Figures including Shakespeare’s Globe chief executive, Stella Kanu, Actors Touring Company boss, Matthew Xia, and Live Theatre artistic director, Jack McNamara, called for a “transformation” of Grantium to make the grant process more “streamlined, equitable and transparent”.Pepa Duarte, an actor and theatre maker in London, said the outage caused problems for a £28,000 grant she received from ACE for her touring exhibition Sharing Ingredients. Duarte said ACE ended up underpaying her by £1,500 – money that would have covered her rent.View image in fullscreenPepa Duarte in A Fight Against by Pablo Manzi at the Royal Court Theatre Upstairs.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianGrantium collapsed when Duarte was due to file her final report, which includes income and expenditure, and is needed before the final payment is received from ACE.After weeks of being unable to submit her report, Duarte was asked to do it all manually in a Word document. “I had to put my expenditure in line by line,” she said. “You can imagine, with the amount of money these grants signify, trying to do it like that. I had nothing to support the maths of it all.”Duarte said that previously ACE would assist if an error was made or the final report missed, but after the Grantium crash, she struggled to get replies from ACE, which eventually claimed she had underspent and therefore her final payment was lowered.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The musician Brian Eno eventually stepped in and donated £10,000 but many organisations haven’t been as fortunate.Since the Grantium outage, arts unions have worked to highlight the impact the crash created for artists. In August,Equity saidthe “system meltdown is just the latest in a litany of governance failures. Every time it is struggling artists who pay the price.”Arts Council England chair says sector at ‘tipping point’ amid funding fearsRead moreReaction to ACE’s new system and whether it offers an improvement on Grantium,has been mixed. Daniel Bernstein, the chief executive of Emergency Exit Arts, said the system “feels clunkier”.Last month, the culture secretary, Lisa Nandy,said there would be no extra financial supportavailable to overhaul ACE’s grant application system. “It is a matter for them,” Nandy said. “We didn’t get additional money in the spending review to give them a new system.”An Arts CouncilEnglandspokesperson said: “Following the technical issues we experienced over the summer, we devised new application processes to ensure artists and organisations could access our funding as straightforwardly as possible. We’re sorry for the disruption caused by the original outage and grateful for the patience applicants showed as we worked to put alternatives in place. These are now up and running, and working well.“Since that point, we have made over 3,900 grant payments totalling over £203m to individuals and organisations around the country. When delivering any grant funding at this sort of scale, it’s invariably the case that a small number of applicants will encounter some issues. Whenever this happens, we work as quickly as we can to put this right, so applications are processed and payments are made as swiftly as possible.”Explore more on these topicsArts Council EnglandArts fundingEnglandLisa NandynewsShareReuse this content"

One wonders if they should have kept the temporary moniker, which befits the show better than its actual title; though I Love LA does go to Erewhon, it’s less a love letter to the city, nor a portrait of its precarious creative class, than a glossy, prestige brand bet on Sennott, an internet It Girl with a distinctly modern indistinction between actor and celebrity, and the popular, chaotic, very online sensibility that she embodies.Down Cemetery Road review – Emma Thompson is magnificent in this thriller from Slow Horses’ creatorRead moreThe logic of the project flowed downhill: Sennott, one of the few internet-bred comedians with real movie mettle (see:Shiva Baby,I Used To Be FunnyandBottoms), given eight whole episodes; HBO, continually losing younger viewers to YouTube, appealing to extremely online zillennials; the chattering class, starved for a truly good young-adult comedy – FX’sAdults, released earlier this year, didn’t cut it – eager for a successor to the messy, self-absorbed and totally absorbing women of Sex and the City, Girls and Insecure. All can agree: nothing gets people talking like a confident and maddening woman on TV.Sennott’s Maia certainly fits the bill, at once compelling and insufferable. We meet her on her 27th birthday in Girls-esque fashion – during unremarkable sex with her boyfriend – with a west-coast twist (She’s so laser-focused on her own pleasure that she blithely ignores an earthquake. Also, it’s 7am.). An aspiring talent manager living in Los Feliz, she’s a distinctly Sennottian blend of contradictions, for better and worse – at once hyper-self aware and delusional, histrionic yet dead-eyed, overtly sexual but girlish. She stretches her vowels like taffy, singes the end of every sentence with vocal fry, over-gesticulates as if perpetually before front-facing camera.At her best – usually, in short videos or scene-stealing line deliveries, Sennott’s teetering balance of clownish self-deprecation and cool-girl deadass-ness is sublime; I could watch one18-second biton LA, in which she twirls like a deranged Siren – “you don’t have an eating disorder? Get one, bitch!” – on an endless loop. Maia is a more jarring creation, whose deadpan petulance blurs the line between provocatively annoying and off-putting; like Meg Stalter, another internet-bred comedian recently given star billing in Lena Dunham’smiddling TV return, Too Much, Sennott attempts to ride a shtick designed for the quick hits and attention deficits of the internet through episode-length television. There’s turbulence – it takes several episodes for Maia to downshift from sketch trope to character, an initial barrier to entry for a promising series that rewards patience.Like Sennott, Maia and her friends graduated from New York University and settled in LA as part of the city’s upwardly mobile creator class. Charlie (Jordan Firstman) is a celebrity stylist in WeHo’s ruthlessly judgmental gay scene, with a preternatural and cynical gift for social climbing that belies an inner yearning for connection. Alani (True Whitaker, daughter of Forest), is a well-meaning but clueless nepo baby with a made-up job at her father’s production company and an unlimited credit line, the Dionne to Maia’s Cher.Girls gone bad: Lena Dunham’s Too Much is just not good enoughRead moreAnd then there’s Maia’s ex-best friend Tallulah (a stellar Odessa A’Zion), a New York Instagram baddie – her Kardashian-esque cleavage situations become more perilous by the episode – who blazes back into Maia’s life, and the series, like a comet. Husky-voiced, dangerously beautiful and brimming with energy, Tallulah has theje ne sais quoiquality of a star. (So does A’Zion, already gathering buzz for her starring turn opposite Timotheé Chalamet in the upcoming Marty Supreme). Maia, naturally, becomes her manager.The business of internet celebrity, and the navel-gazing world of Hollywood, is a tricky combination for a show – social media dynamics, niche, turbocharged and generally uninteresting to those outside it, are notoriously difficult to capture on screen. It takes a bit for I Love LA to find its footing. Earlier episodes have a mechanical quality, a Madlibs of stark lines (“reputations died in 2017”), LA references (Courage Bagels) and zillennial touchstones: Paris Hilton’s Stars Are Blind, the Hannah Montana movie, the casting of Gossip Girl’s Leighton Meester as Maia’s (girl)boss and Josh Hutcherson, of Bridge to Terabithia and The Hunger Games fame, as her sweet normie boyfriend Dylan. (Hutcherson, as expected, makes him endearing.) Loving LA, it seems, means enduring a lot of bluster.But the hooks are there, as are the visuals – it’s refreshing to see a comedy pilot given the artful, emotionally intuitive treatment of director Lorene Scafaria. (Subsequent directors, including Sennott, Bill Benz and Kevin Bray, maintain the lived-in aesthetic.) Midway through the season, I found my usually rigid guard against influencers down – charmed by Charlie’s unexpected connections, pained by Tallulah’s flops, frustrated by Maia’s staggering absorption but nonetheless rooting for her. Tickled by the show’s sharp ironies and increasingly textured portrait of this particular rung on the fame ladder, craving another chapter. The endless embarrassments and boundless opportunities of celebrity can seem, by season’s end, not too different from that of being alive, particularly in one’s 20s. It’s a bumpy ride, but they’re just getting started.I Love LA starts on HBO in the US on 2 November, on HBO Max in Australia on 3 November and on SkyComedyin the UK on 5 NovemberExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewTV comedyHBOComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

But the Witcher is preoccupied. The winds of change howl around his thigh boots and perturb the weave of his wig. “Your silence is especially loud today, Witcher,” observes sidekick Milva (Meng’er Zhang), as the Witcher – who, for the purposes of drama/HMRC, is also known as Geralt of Rivia – frowns at another horse. But the Witcher/Geralt doesn’t want to talk about why he doesn’t want to talk. Not because the most recent instalment of the beloved Netflix series with which he shares a name saw his family rent asunder by the forces of darkness (although, to be fair, this probably hasn’t helped). But because the wandering monster-hunter has awoken in season four of The Witcher to find he is no longer being played by Henry Cavill, upon whose mountainous shoulders rested the first three seasons of this unapologetically preposterous fantasy-drama. Instead, Geralt is now Liam “Younger Brother of Chris” Hemsworth, who used to be in Neighbours. In a very real sense: strewth.The metamorphosis clearly weighs heavily on Geralt, who spends the first episode of the new series flaring his nostrils and peering anxiously into the middle distance, as if concerned Harold Bishop might suddenly appear from behind a shrub and club him with a mace. The maverick’s malaise is understandable: Cavill’s are big thigh boots to fill, the actor’s granite-jawed charisma providing an often deeply confusing show with its near-monosyllabic anchor. But now, with Cavill off to brood in pastures new, the final two series of The Witcher (the oversized rubber axe is poised to fall at the end of season five) must look to Hemsworth’s flaring nostrils for their protagonism. How fares the extraordinarily violent fantasy-drama in the wake of such a seismic regeneration, my liege? Let us clamber aboard a faux-medieval horse and head into the rugged wilds of season four to search for clues.The last time we saw Geralt, he was trudging off to search for his adopted daughter and witcher-in-training, Ciri (Freya Allan), who had been rescued from her nomadic kidnappers by hey-nonnying brigands the Rats. Meanwhile, Yennefer (Anya Chalotra), Geralt’s sorceress squeeze, had launched her own search for Ciri, largely via a portal system called, with devastating perspicacity, The Portal System.View image in fullscreen‘They scowl and punch their way through storylines’ … Ciri (Freya Allan), Geralt (Liam Hemsworth) and Yennefer (Anya Chalotra) in season four of Netflix’s The Witcher.Photograph: PRAnd now? The plot continues in much the same vein, with screen time divided more or less equally between Geralt, Ciri and Yennefer as they scowl and punch their way through storylines thick with impenetrable geopolitics, dialogue of the “the north quails before us” variety and mud-spattered extras keen to divest themselves of their intestines.While Ciri finds companionship with sympathetic “Rat”, Mistle (Christelle Elwin),Geralt, Milva and insufferable bard Jaskier (Joey Batey) are joined in their journey east by Zoltan (Danny Woodburn), an amiable dwarf with an explosive beard and wisecracking parrot (sample quip: “asshole”). Elsewhere, there are rumblings of more and worse wars, as dastardly Nilfgaardians point at maps and ferrety mages scheme in candlelit vestibules.The tone remains wildly uneven, lurching as it does between steeple-fingered Game of Thrones-y glumness and those early-90s Saturday afternoon series in which an uncommunicative hunk wanders between small communities, rescuing imperilled innocents from baddies while learning about the true meaning of friendship. Similarly uneven is Geralt II’s accent. Poor Geralt II’s accent. “He hasn’t been the same since his injuries,” warns Jaskier with no little understatement as his companion’s vowels once again escape their restraints and make for Erinsborough. Our hero does his best to compensate by mumbling incomprehensibly while making his nostrils flap like enraged windsocks. “Grrrnnngh”, he says. “Grrrnnngh destiny rrmmph.” Alas, no amount of wounded grunting can detract from the fact that Hemsworth, bless his pleather britches, is no Henry Cavill.While his predecessor invested Geralt I with a gruff likability, Geralt II is less “valorous man-mountain grappling with responsibilities beyond our ken” and more “bollard in a wig”. Will fans embrace this lunkish scowler? It’s still early days, of course, but whether The Witcher will survive the replacement of its brooding load-bearer remains to be [unintelligible grunting].The Witcher season four is on NetflixExplore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewFantasy TVreviewsShareReuse this content"

Generally, the feelings are intense, but the stakes are low; it’s all very formative for the individual character, but it can feel a bit trivial to anyone else. In fact, reading an account of someone’s university days is surely only one or two stages removed from having to hear about the dream they had last night.So my heart initially sank at Heart the Lover’s cover promise that our main character would soon be “swept into an intoxicating world of academic fervour, rapid-fire banter and raucous card games” – good grief, save me from the raucous card games! But obviously the caveat here is what it always is: a good writer will make it matter. I had faith, therefore, that everything would be all right, since Lily King is an exceptionally good writer. Indeed, she could probably write a book-length account of her most recent dream and I would still rush to read it.King is a well-established name in the US, and it’s about time she reached a wider audience over here. In her hands, this story of first love between college kids is vivid, moving and witty. It unspools into a searching exploration of loss, mortality and the inexorability of time. “It’s just this long tender farewell to youth,” the narrator says early on, referring to a short story she has read. King’s novel got me straight in the heart. It hurt.The narrator is not named until the end, although if you’ve read King’s brilliant previous novelWriters & Loversyou’ll know her name already. Heart the Lover is a companion of sorts to that book, both a prequel and a sequel, while also capable of standing on its own. There is just one slightly perplexing reveal – which I won’t spoil – that may feel like a rewriting of history to fans of Writers & Lovers, though I think most readers will be in a forgiving mood.The novel is awash with literary references – and actually it’s a delightWe begin as the narrator meets Sam, and then his best friend Yash, in her senior year of college (let the academic fervour, quick-fire banter and raucous card games commence: the book’s title is a reference to one of these card games). It looks set to be a classic love triangle, but this is not the angle King is most interested in, and what we get instead is a two-hander, a more focused love story. Despite this, the book has a rich cast of background characters, each of whom King presents with precision and care. At the midway point comes a time jump, and the second half of the story presents middle age butting up against the echoes of youthful intensity, with the shifting of relationships and character over time. Characteristically, King pays attention not just to what we lose, but to what we gain.The novel is awash with literary references, and yes, I may have balked at the aforementioned “academic fervour”, but actually it’s a delight: this is a book in love with the experience of reading, precise about the way certain stories and ideas powerfully affect us at particular stages in our lives. “You know how you can remember exactly when and where you read certain books?” the narrator says. “A great novel, a truly great one, not only captures a particular fictional experience, it alters and intensifies the way you experience your own life while you’re reading it.” King maintains a lovely balancing act: she is an unapologetic English major (a type as much as a biographical feature), but her books, tightly plotted and compulsively readable, are for everyone.The first half might be seen as a “young” book, excellent on the intensity and desire and energy of youth. It then becomes a grown-up novel: wearier, more poignant, and yet still – and this is not a decision every writer would have made – hopeful. The arc of the story suggests bleakness, but the delivery resists it. To say farewell to youth, according to King, is not to say farewell to love, or to hope. “Isn’t love a form of hope?” the narrator asks at one point. We may be left feeling melancholy at the end of Heart the Lover, but, crucially, we are not disheartened.Havoc by Rebecca Wait is published by Riverrun.Heart the Lover by Lily King is published by Canongate (£18.99).

Opening in Zanzibar in the aftermath of independence, his 11th novel, Theft, spans half a century as it documents the lives of Karim, Fauzia and Badar. We learn how young Karim is treated as “an afterthought” by his mother, Raya, who divorces her much older husband and leaves her son behind to start a new life.Mother and son are reunited several years later in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, where Raya has married a pharmacist named Haji. Karim, who grows up to be handsome, intelligent and more than a little conceited, gets a scholarship to study in the city and meets Fauzia, who is training to be a teacher and is keen to avoid the fate of other “mute daughter[s] laid out for deflowering”. She and Karim marry, and the pair open their home to Badar, a former servant of Raya and Haji’s who was abandoned by his parents as a child.Theft by Abdulrazak Gurnah review – love and betrayal from the Nobel laureateRead moreActor Ashley Zhangazha is the narrator of this intimate drama about interconnected lives, his reading deftly navigating the contrasting voices and interior lives of the main characters.

It’s a book that captures not just the hypocrisies of one elite, Thatcher-loving family but the hypocrisies of a whole era, with power and politics bristling beside the hedonistic explosion of 1980s gay culture.Maybe it needs an entire series (as in the case ofAndrew Davies’s TV adaptation), but Jack Holden, whose 2021 playCruisetraversed similar ground, makes a robust go of it here. He arrives at the dark heart of the book while filleting and mixing the order of things so that the timeline of the central three sections is shorter and slicker, but also less intensely lived.The focal point is the ruling-class Fedden family, whose bumptious patriarch Gerald (Charles Edwards) is a newly elected Tory MP, and in whose Kensington Gardens household the middle-class, timidly gay Oxford graduate Nick Guest (Jasper Talbot) becomes, well, a guest.Nick is the observing insider/outsider of this entitled milieu. Talbot – a fast rising star – plays him with a good balance of young-fogey bookishness and sweetly innocent daring. His break-out reflections on beauty, which are key to the story, do not feel jarring on the whole, and his final monologue, in which he asserts the value of beauty as a primary force in his life, is one of the play’s most moving.Michael Grandage brings fantastic directorial polish and pace and the cast are excellent, from Alistair Nwachukwu as Nick’s wryly funny, working-class boyfriend Leo, to Arty Froushan as the uber-rich Wani, who is engaged to a woman but in a secret relationship with Nick. “Are you a poof? asks Cat (Ellie Bamber), the fragile daughter of the Feddens, with unacknowledged offence, before adding: “I love poofs.” As do her family, on the face of it, though this is an age in which the gay community are slyly othered even by those who seem nonchalantly accepting.View image in fullscreenInnocent daring … Talbot with Leo Suter as Toby Fedden.Photograph: Johan PerssonChristopher Oram’s set is light on its feet, seamlessly taking us from the Feddens’ lavish party to Leo’s kitchen table, while the soundtrack – the Communards, New Order, Frankie Goes to Hollywood – captures the synth-edged club culture of the time. It is all engaging, with elegantly executed social satire.But what a lot of story, and feelings, to fit in. Nick’s dance with Gerald’s friend, the “great lady” Margaret Thatcher, comes early so that his devil’s pact with Conservatism seems to come too soon in the wake of his announcing his liberal(-ish) credentials to Leo. And in its portrayals of sex, the play does not quite capture the raw, explicit nature of Hollinghurst’s book. It is somewhat truncated in its love stories too. There is gorgeous chemistry between Leo and Nick, and a more arch electricity when Wani and Nick get together over a toilet cistern and lines of cocaine.But we do not really enter into these relationships fully. So the devastation of the Aids crisis is felt – but not in the gut. Still, something incendiary is built up by the end, when the upper-class snobberies and casual homophobia become clear to see, if not the racism. The strength of this production lies in its deft parallels with The Great Gatsby (a comparison also made when Hollinghurst’s book was published). Nick is not just a Guest but a Carraway figure; not a part of this spoiled, privileged crew but not apart from them either,while the Feddens really are like Tom and Daisy, crashing into other people and moving on without casualties of their own.We hear early on how an MP has caused a scandal by being caught with a young male sex worker. It provides a neat bookend with Gerald’s double scandal at the end, which typifies the venality of the Tory party of that era. But he refuses to see this scandal on a par with Nick’s sexual exposures. “You grasping little ponce,” he spits, and we finally see his bigotry bared.So: a reminder of then, a warning for our age of rising intolerance, and an adaptation well worth seeing.At theAlmeida theatre, London, until 29 NovemberExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreAlan HollinghurstAlmeida theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Yet, ironically, it seems as if thisRoyal Shakespeare Company production from 2013has not aged well itself.Wendy (Hannah Saxby) is the protagonist here, grieving for a young dead brother who she seeks to find and bring back from Neverland. Despite the reframing, she remains strangely tame, duly playing at being “mother” to the Lost Boys, full of uncertainty, self-deprecation and guilt for most of the play. So, when she suddenly decides to form a sisterhood with Tink (Charlotte Mills) and Tiger Lily (Ami Tredrea) – “let’s go kick some pirate bum” – it comes from nowhere, and feels thoroughly latched on. Mrs Darling (Lolita Chakrabarti) is also given more agency, wresting freedom in her marriage and talking of the Suffragettes, but it is rather removed from the main drama.Peter Pan (Daniel Krikler) is given his own inner crisis that looks strangely like hormonal desire. He seems much more a teenager than a boy and has the urges of one too, clearly hot-crushing on Wendy, offering her shy kisses and calling her “babe”. It sits oddly within the story of a boy who refuses to grow up: this one seems as if he is losing that battle and it is icky to witness.According to the programme, the production has been “developed and expanded over the years”. Directed by Jonathan Munby, it is quite the theatrical monster now, with dazzling lights and a sea of video projections (designed by Taiki Ueda) that saturate the stage in waves. There is impressive aerial work and the Jolly Roger sails monumentally on to the stage more than once.View image in fullscreenBuccaneering … the Jolly Roger in Wendy & Peter Pan at the Barbican theatre.Photograph: Manuel HarlanIt should all arrest the senses but seems like a cheap sugar-rush of spectacle that does not hit the spot. Actors rush around, often shouting or screeching their lines so that they really do seem like adults playing at being children too energetically. The accompanying music, by Shuhei Kamimura, sounds like a generic “buccaneer action film” score and is uncouthly cranked up for every sword fight.There is good movement (choreographed by Lucy Hind) that slows down the frenetic pace; and some minor characters such as Hook’s right-hand man, Smee (Scott Karim), along with Tredrea’s subtly played Tiger Lily, bring some charm along with a dangerously roving crocodile (Harrison Claxton, with excellent physicality).It is not enough to redeem proceedings. Despite the pace, it drags. What might, in its original state, have been radical now appears like a soulless stage juggernaut – a mix of big optics Christmas and pantomime. Captain Hook (Toby Stephens) channels pure panto baddie (while philosophising on ageing) and Tink seems like its cockney fairy. When one character emphatically asks, “They’re behind me, aren’t they?” the pantomime is complete.At Barbican theatre, London, until 22 NovemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreElla HicksonJM BarriereviewsShareReuse this content"

In Elisabeth Gunawan’s Prayers for a Hungry Ghost, for her theatre companyKiss Witness, it is folded in with another staple figure of storytelling: the double. The play centres on non-identical twin sisters and explores, through a supernatural family drama and a mix of theatre, dance, video and puppetry, the dynamics and dysfunctions of the immigrant experience.The girls’ father (Daniel York Loh) has left Hong Kong to forge an apparently successful life in the US, a place where he has never seen so much food. Their mother is absent and unidentified, but seems to haunt the stage in the form of a silent background figure (Tang Sook Kuan) who sometimes shadows the action or helps with props.View image in fullscreenHeads will roll … Elisabeth Gunawan in Prayers for a Hungry Ghost.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianLittle Sister (Jasmine Chiu) is the golden child, integrating into society and ascending its ranks to become a celebrated classical pianist. Big Sister (Gunawan) is the big problem, a discordant foil to her sister’s harmonious trills and turns, unsatisfactorily partnered with a second-rate doctor – a hollow puppet with a grotesque detachable head who sees her as second-best to her unattainable sister – and eventually mutating into a hungry ghost herself, with blackened mouth and distended belly, screeching her agonised poetry.The staging echoes the work’s own themes, using mirrors, shadows and projections, and doubling live and recorded voices until the words feel only tenuously tethered to the characters who speak them. The audience becomes implicated too, occasionally lit or addressed directly, as if to reveal our own ghostly presence in these scenes.The work is part of the Barbican’s theatre development programme, and it feels very much in development: the pacing can be ponderous, scenes are somewhat bolted together and there’s a sense that Gunawan has bitten off more than she can chew. Still, I applaud its guts and vision, one that shows Big Sister not as the problem child but as the child of a situation that enmeshes them all, though she is the one made monstrous by its malfunctions.At the Pit, Barbican, Londonuntil 1 November.

He wants us to feel our bodies in space, to use them to understand the world, each other and the digital realm. It’s a lofty vision that the 55-year-old choreographer has long been investigating through the creation of dance works, but also by collaborating on academic research, working with new technology, and in fashion, film and music such as hit showABBA Voyage.McGregor is an artist, but also an entrepreneur, a man who makes things happen, and it’s fantastic to see a major exhibition dedicated to a choreographer as part of Somerset House’s 25th anniversary as an arts venue. This is no retrospective though. You won’t be guided through McGregor’s three decades of work and you’re unlikely to see a live dancer (members of the company will occasionally be in residence). Instead, there are a series of installations made by McGregor’s collaborators from the technology and design spheres, some of which need the visitor’s own body to trigger them.View image in fullscreenMaking things happen … Wayne McGregor’s Infinite Bodies at Somerset House.Photograph: Andrea RossettiOne of these is the artificially intelligent movement archiveAISoma, developed with Google, where you can record an eight-second dance visualised by a slightly clunky stick figure, from which AI will extrapolate new movement. It’s fleetingly fun, even if the result looks fairly random. The idea is to jog the creative process of a dancer stuck for inspiration. Is it any better than Merce Cunningham’srolling of the dice? Well it’s certainly a lot more expensive. But is this what Cunningham would be doing if he were alive today? Maybe. As a visitor, I preferredRandom International’s Future Self: 10,000 LED lights hanging in a column which light up in response to your movement to make a glittering shadow, as if your spectre’s trapped inside. It’s a poetic effect: we are starlight.Is there enough here, enough “wow” moments, to rock our world (or truly get inside McGregor’s art)? Sometimes idea and process are richer than output – and you can see McGregor’s own neatly written notebooks for a glimpse behind the scenes. There’s also a room of movement-sensitive mirrors, like a clan of miniature paparazzi turning their gaze on you, a 2003 film by director Olivier Megaton featuring a young McGregor that looks like David Cronenberg meets Daft Punk, plus McGregor’s own forays into visual art-making in 3D-printed sculpture – a crouched figure (from his piece Far) glimpsed through the frame of another installation, is a highlight.To see what all McGregor’s conceptualising leads to, in terms of choreographic creation, you’ll need to visit On the Other Earth, the UK premiere of a cutting-edge immersive 360-degree film, watched with 3D glasses inside a black cylindrical screen (15 minutes walk away from the exhibition, on a separate ticket). An hour spent standing in the dark will certainly make you more aware of your own body’s (creaky) sensations, but the effects are undoubtedly impressive, whether digital manipulations or just lifesize bodies up so close you can really see the detail. In the theatre, McGregor’s dancers, barely clad humans in their absolute prime, can seem like perfectly honed machines, “bodies” rather than people, and this closeup view is a corrective to that.Without seeing On the Other Earth, the exhibition alone might feel rather abstract. It’s cool, in both senses: “Oh, that’s cool”, and also emotional distance, despite our physical presence – that’s the paradox in the work. But Infinite Bodies is full of questions and genuinely innovative; the work of a creator brimming with bold ideas.At Somerset HouseandStone Nest, London, until 22 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsWayne McGregorDanceInstallationVideo artArtreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s evident from the outset in a rumbustious reading of the Scapino overture that positively snaps, crackles and pops.Principal cellist Jonathan Aasgaard is the soloist in Walton’s final concerto where the music’s angst-ridden romantic sweep is tinged with introspective melancholy. Translucent orchestral textures allow his generous tone to shine, while a prodigious technique is showcased in an immaculately articulated account of the central Allegro appassionato.View image in fullscreenAlbum cover for Walton Cello Concerto.Photograph: ChandosThe First Symphony has received some fine recordings over the years, not least André Previn’s blistering 1972 account with the London Symphony Orchestra and Edward Gardner’s in 2014 with the BBC Symphony Orchestra. Wilson’s performance yields pride of place to no one. His sure-footed pacing brings out the opening movement’s brooding tension while building its snarling climaxes with an effortless assurance. Orchestral precision, aided by Chandos’s surgically detailed recording, pays dividends throughout. The “con malizia” scherzo bristles with excoriating detail, the slow movement is quietly affecting, and, for once, the hard-won finale with its Technicolor fanfares feels fully earned.Released by Chandos on 7 NovemberExplore more on these topicsClassical musicalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

Its title, Africa Direct, is a statement and a method: a call to approach the continent not through inherited filters (Soviet, colonial, or western) but through direct engagement with its histories, philosophies and living cultures.The museum, which holds one of the most distinguished private collections of the 19th century in easternEurope, was badly damaged when a Russian missile struck nearby in October 2022. Windows and show cases were shattered and the glass ceiling collapsed. Yet the museum’s collections were unharmed: Byzantine icons, Islamic artwork, and old master paintings had already been secured, some of them safely evacuated to partner institutions in Paris, Vilnius, Warsaw and The Hague.The museum did not close. Its staff kept the institution open, empty but active, organising lectures, readings, and mental health workshops with the neighbouring hospital. Some of the glass fragments were later turned into brooches by a local goldsmith, offered as a sign of endurance to guests and friends.View image in fullscreenThe curator has chosen to resist the usual distance imposed by glass, placing the works on simple wooden boxes.Photograph: Ada KhrolNow, on the third anniversary of the attack, Africa Direct has opened in the same building, this time filled with objects and voices from another continent. Curated by Yulia Fil and Daria Sukhostavets, and initiated by the deputy director Hanna Rudyk, the exhibition brings together 40 works from 18 African countries, collected over two decades by the Ukrainian couple Tetyana Deshko and Andriy Klepikov, who have worked extensively in African public health. Historical artefacts sit alongside works by contemporary artists such as the Ghanaian-British artist Adelaide Damoah, Christian Nyampeta (Rwanda/the Netherlands/US), Seyni Awa Camara (Senegal) and Esther Mahlangu (South Africa).No attempt is made to emulate the encyclopaedic ethnographic displays of other European museums. Instead, the selection privileges a sensuous engagement with African art and material culture: things made to be touched, carried, embraced. At the heart of the exhibition is a group of magnificent ceramic vessels, some serving, in their living worlds, as temporary homes for ancestors. As in all museums, one cannot help but wonder what these pieces are doing here, far from the ecologies and relationships that once gave them meaning. Yet the curator has chosen to resist the usual distance imposed by glass, placing the works on simple wooden boxes, an act of humility that suggests fragility and protection.View image in fullscreenA terracotta piece, made by women of the Dakakari people for funerary purposes, carries in its clay the memory of care, mourning and continuity.Photograph: Yurii StefanyakOne large terracotta piece from north-western Nigeria is particularly striking in this Ukrainian context. Caught between alertness and fear, half vessel, half vegetal lobe, it bears on its body the outlines of a face in relief. Its wide, deeply carved eyes stare into an invisible distance with almost hallucinatory intensity. The slightly open mouth hovers between a cry and a breath, as if eternally about to speak or exhale. Notched forms radiating from this face, like arms, horns, or antennae, give it a cosmic presence. It was made by women of the Dakakari people for funerary purposes, and carries in its clay the memory of care, mourning and continuity.Nearby, an angel painted on the parchment of an early 20th-century Christian Ethiopian healing scroll also stares with wide eyes, meant, as the catalogue explains, to protect from evil the body and soul of whoever met its gaze. InUkrainetoday,la patience des objetsfeels less historical than human.The exhibition also reflects a decisive turn in Ukraine’s cultural thinking: an acknowledgment that decolonisation is not only a geopolitical struggle but also an epistemic one.At the opening, Anika Johnson, a longtime resident of Ukraine and representative of the African community there, drew a parallel between African and Ukrainian experiences of oppression and resistance. “We are both freedom fighters,” he said. “Africa fought colonialism, Ukraine fights now for its freedom.” The words resonated beyond diplomacy or solidarity. They articulated a shared vocabulary of independence that connects two histories often seen as separate.View image in fullscreenThe selection privileges a sensuous engagement with African art and material culture.Photograph: Ada KhrolThe exhibition is conceived as an experiment in intellectual realignment, a reflection on how museums can redefine their role in times of resistance. As Rudyk put it in the catalogue, Ukraine has long looked westward and inward; turning southward now is a way to refuse isolation and to enter a global conversation on its own terms. Decolonising the museum, she argues, means not only revising narratives of art and empire but addressing questions of racism and rethinking how knowledge itself is produced and shared.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In August 2024, Mali’s military government abruptly cut diplomatic ties with Ukraine after accusing it of covert involvement in fighting in the north of the country, a claim denied by Kyiv but widely circulated in the media. The episode revealed how fragile and politically charged relations between Ukraine and several African states have become, especially where Russian influence is strong. Against that reality, Africa Direct stands out as an autonomous gesture by art historians, scholars, and curators seeking a different, more reciprocal language of exchange.That this process is unfolding under bombardment gives it a particular gravity. Most of the museum’s staff are in their 20s and 30s. Many returned from abroad out of commitment to their institution, their city, and their sense of purpose. In their hands and eyes, culture is not a luxury of peace but a form of civic resilience and critical reflection.On the night after the opening, the alarms sounded again. Messages flashed across phones: “Ballistic”, “Take shelter”. “Now it’s drones.” Then, hours later: “All clear.” By morning, half of Kyiv was without electricity and water. Yet the city’s rhythm resumed: coffee, children, emails, plans, reconstruction. Life continues in overlapping layers, as does culture. Between darkness and daylight, between war and work, the Khanenko Museum insists on a principle that is neither tragic nor heroic but necessary: continuity, intelligence, and a critical engagement with inherited narratives.Africa Direct is at the Khanenko Museum, Kyiv, until 11 January 2026Explore more on these topicsUkraineAfricaMuseumsEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

He’s been coming here three nights a week for the past 12 years, but even he looks a little uneasy as he arcs his torch like a searchlight against the knotted walls of elm and beech trees which embrace us on all sides, looking so thick that they might be the boundary of the known world.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Marius motions with his torch towards several pairs of slender beech trees, eerie in their symmetry, branches intertwined to form arches – portals or stargates, you might speculate, were you possessed of a particularly febrile imagination. “Many came in here and never came out. But don’t worry,” he adds, turning to me with a grin. “Our tours have a 100% return rate.”Reports of strange happenings here date back centuries – the forest is named after a local shepherd who is said to have vanished in the distant past, along with 200 of his sheep. But Hoia-Baciu came to international attention in 1968, when a military technician named Emil Barnea photographed what he described as a UFO hovering above a circular clearing in the centre of the forest. In the decades since, Hoia-Baciu has drawn yogis, shamans, ufologists and paranormal investigators from across the world, curious to experience the strange energies said to echo through the forest.View image in fullscreen‘Home of Dracula’ … Bran Castle, in Transylvania’s Carpathian mountains.Photograph: Jeremy Woodhouse/Getty ImagesIt may be one of the world’s premier pilgrimage sites for lovers of the paranormal, but the forest is under threat. The western suburbs of Cluj-Napoca – a modern tech hub of more than 400,000 people, described as the Silicon Valley of eastern Europe – are encroaching, and developers are pushing for permission to clear the trees to build apartment blocks. Barring a few hectares home to locally rare Mediterranean oak trees, the forest is not officially protected, but Marius hopes that the company he co-founded – theHoia-Baciu Project– will help to change that, encouraging the authorities to recognise the forest’s value as a tourist attraction. The company offers day and night walks in the forest, yoga sessions, paranormal lectures, treasure hunts and escape games – and even, for the particularly intrepid, overnight camping.As twigs and autumn leaves snap and crunch beneath our boots, Marius recounts some of the folk tales and alleged paranormal happenings here. One famous story describes a five-year-old girl disappearing during a family picnic, only to rematerialise five years later with no memory of what had happened to her, having not aged a day, her clothes shy of the slightest speck of dirt.Some people claim to hear disembodied whispers through the trees, or feel hands grabbing or pushing themMore common reports describe mobile phones and camera equipment inexplicably shutting down on entering the woods, while emotional responses range from full-blown dread to states of ecstasy. Some people report seeing strange rashes on their skin, hearing disembodied whispers through the trees, or feel hands grabbing or pushing them, even when sure they are alone.Marius pulls an iPad from his rucksack and shows me the UFO images which catapulted Hoia-Baciu to international attention in the 1960s. Grainy and monochrome, they appear to show a button-like flying saucer hovering above the trees. He flicks through dozens of other photographs taken in the years before and since, with similar saucer-like objects, glowing orbs or wraith-like apparitions. Enigmatic photographs of this nature have been a fixture of paranormal research for more than a century, not much use as evidence, but it’s worth noting that Barnea did not stand to profit from publishing his photographs – on the contrary, he lost his job in the military, with the communist government not looking kindly on anything with a supernatural tang. “Many of the old researchers who investigated the forest ended up in psychiatric wards,” Marius says. “Did the communist regime put them there? Or did something really happen to them, here in the forest?”View image in fullscreenAn evening walking tour of Hoia-Baciu.Photograph: Hoia Baciu ProjectWhile many of the stories may be unverifiable, there is much before my eyes that is undeniably strange. All around are trees whose trunks are bent and twisted into fantastical shapes. Some bulge outwards at the base, their crowns disappearing into the black night, so they resemble giant meat hooks hanging from the heavens. Others droop like melted candles, or are bent in strange, spiralling patterns. Various suggestions have been given to explain the deformed trees: that hurricane winds could have bent the saplings, or naturally high radiation levels in the soil account for their crooked growth. But scientific investigations have turned up no satisfactory evidence.Marius’s tours allow visitors to take part in a little scientific inquiry of their own. As we approach the clearing in the trees where Barnea took his famous UFO photographs, he hands me an EMF meter, a stalwart of ghost-hunting kits which measures electromagnetic fields. “We’re entering the most active part of the forest,” he says. “See what you can find.”The trees suddenly stop dead as we emerge into a perfect circle. The only greenery is the short grass beneath our feet; it’s clear that it hasn’t been mown, and appears that this strange clearing is natural, not the work of human hands.Wielding my EMF meter, I sweep the clearing like a detectorist, excited when the needle ticks madly back and forthWielding my EMF meter, I sweep the clearing like a detectorist, briefly excited when the needle begins to tick madly back and forth, only for my vibrating phone to indicate that the electromagnetic disturbance was just an incoming text message. Despite spending several hours in the forest, and being genuinely baffled by the twisted trees and the strange clearing, I haven’t seen anything I’d describe as supernatural. Perhaps the forest is a blank canvas, on to which people project their own fears and desires.Transylvania generally is a place which stirs the imagination, where the border is blurred between fact and folklore. In rural Romanian communities belief persists instrigoi(“screamers”) – undead, shapeshifting bloodsuckers, who rise from their graves to terrorise local communities.View image in fullscreenMisty and spooky: Hoia Baciu wood.Photograph: Pal Szilagyi Palko/AlamyBram Stoker’s famous vampire Count Dracula is forever associated with Transylvania, and Bran Castle – a Saxon monolith perched on a rocky outcrop in the Carpathian Mountains around four hours’ drive south of Hoia-Baciu – is keenly marketed as “Dracula’s Castle”. While it bears little resemblance to the shadowy ruin described as Dracula’s dwelling, and there is no evidence that it inspired Stoker, it’s still a major attraction for fans of all things gothic and ghoulish – particularly around Halloween, when the castle hosts costumed parties.But even myth-shrouded Transylvania – literally, “the place beyond the forest” – feels solid and predictable compared to these eerie woods, which seem to be, for reasons radioactive, atmospheric or simply folkloric, a nexus for human imaginative power. “In Hoia-Baciu,” Marius says, “the line between reality and imagination is very thin.”Daniel Stables is the author ofFiesta: A Journey Through Festivity(Icon Books, £20).

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.We’ve all heard of chilled reds by now, right? Even so, it was only relatively recently that they became part of our drinking lexicon, and modern British drinkers realised that bringing down the temperature of certain reds by a few degrees made them sing and deliver charmingly pronounced, bright, fresh fruit notes. So much so that I now can’t think of drinking a light French red any other way.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.But what if I told you the same can be true for – wait for it – bold, warmer whites? Common knowledge dictates that we serve all white wine from an ice bucket, chilled to within an inch of its life – it’s just what we do – but in reality that can kill a wine, particularly if it’s a powerful and/or aromatic example. Over- or needlessly chilled wine often prevents us from picking up on much of its aromas and, considering that much of what we taste is what we smell, you’re mostly going to end up tasting an unpleasant mouthful of alcohol and acid.I propose we start enjoying our whites a little warmer than is customary, at room temperature even when we’re sat around a roaring fire. And I can’t think of a better time of year to explore such an approach. Think about what you want from a wine in the autumn and winter months. Do you want it to be higher in alcohol, generous and ripe? In which case I would ask why anyone thinks you necessarily need to drink a red wine to achieve that.So if you fancy turning to a warming, ripe white to keep your insides warm over the colder months, where should you start? Well, it’s a good idea to be aware of the grapes and regions that are likely to yield bigger, bulkier white wines. As we know, the same grape can yield many different wine styles. Chardonnay, for example, can create anything from an enormous, oaky, American-style wine to a linear, mineral chablis. In fact, those wines are often so unrecognisable from each other that beginners often won’t know they’re made from the exact same grape.In terms of chardonnay, you’ll be looking for examples from places with warmer climes. Take the aforementioned US, which has a reputation for powerful chardonnay, or seek out wines from the south of France, Australia and South Africa. That said, all these regions are capable of producing lighter, fresher styles, too, so consult the label before you buy.I’d also keep an eye out for sauvignon blanc from any of those same areas (again, check the label first), chenin blanc from South Africa, and Rhône whites made from marsanne and roussanne for bold, peachy flavours; gewürztraminer is another grape that can offer aromatic, oily cuvées, as are sémillon, viognier and pinot gris (unlike its zesty Italian twin, pinot grigio).Four whites for winterWildstone Roussanne£9.50 Waitrose, 13.5%.

The cook has the job of getting through that tough skin before finding the tender flesh, and they give off their best only after slow cooking. But it’s worth it. They are great culinary chameleons, able to soak up and marry well with ingredients as diverse as gruyere, chipotle, rosemary, sage and nutmeg. Their smoky, sweet flavours are just right for the season of turning leaves.Confusion reigns, however, about the difference between a pumpkin and a squash. It is a difficult area, and often local usage dictates what is a squash and what is a pumpkin. Both are members of the same family and, although the terms are often used interchangeably, pumpkins are usually the jack-o’-lantern shape we associate with Halloween, with thick, orange skins, while squashes can be smooth, warty, striped, stippled, their skins as green and shiny as old leather books, pale yellow, flame orange or delicate amber. They come in myriad shapes – acorns, turbans, melons and curled, snake-like creatures – and sizes.Each year, I display them before I cook them: a row is lined up on the kitchen table; a great big rougevif d’etampes, a French variety that looks like Cinderella’s carriage and acts as a doorstop between kitchen and living room; little miniature ones with cute names such as munchkin, jack-be-little and baby boo sit among the candles on the mantelpiece. Their flesh, once cooked, can be as smooth as that of avocados or baked quince, the flavour as sweet as corn, or, admittedly, simply bland, if you end up with a bad specimen.The important matter for the cook is to find a variety you like, be it a pumpkin or a squash. The best all-rounder, to my mind, is crown prince. It’s an elegant grey-blue, the sort of colour you might find on a chart of historic paints, with not a hint of the vivid golden flesh inside. The ubiquitous butternut squash always has a sweet flavour and melting flesh, while the chubby, yellow-and-green-striped sweet dumpling and delicata are both excellent for stuffing and baking. Cut off the tops of these little ones and, once you’ve scooped out and discarded the seeds and fibres, fill them with mushrooms, cream and cheese, a part-cooked stuffing of wild and brown rice, dried cranberries and smoked bacon, or chopped cooked spinach and ricotta. Replace the lids and roast them wrapped in foil to stop the sweet juices from running out into the roasting tin and burning.Even if I’m going to puree the flesh, I either roast wedges or saute chunks in butter first, rather than boiling them. You need to drive off about one-third of their moisture to intensify their taste and, anyway, pumpkin flesh loves butter, olive oil and cream; you will seldom eat a low-calorie pumpkin dish.The Italians cook pumpkin and squash in risotto, or mash the flesh, sweeten it with crushed amaretti and use it to stuff pasta. The Belgians cook acarbonnadeof beef and beer in a hollowed-out pumpkin; in south-west France, they roast wedges with goose fat and thyme. In America, there’s an endless list of pumpkin and squash pies and tarts, both sweet and savoury. I love savoury pumpkin tarts filled with salty cheeses – gorgonzola, gruyere or feta. The oldest pumpkin seeds were found in Mexico, and they make one of the most ancient pumpkin recipes,calabaza en tacha, or candied pumpkin, which is part of the Día de los Muertos (Day of the Dead) celebrations. Cooked in brown sugar, orange juice and cinnamon (it’s delicious with star anise, too), it’s sometimes eaten for breakfast.Then there is pumpkin soup. Using a base recipe of chopped pumpkin or squash sweated in butter with chopped leeks and simmered in stock, I turn out endless variations every autumn. Add a good splash of bourbon, scatter the top with smoked bacon and serve it under a melting cheese crust or season with pickle juice, paprika and dill (a gorgeous Austrian idea).I didn’t see a pumpkin until I was about 23, so they are still a novelty to me. I still see the image of the girls in Laura Ingalls Wilder’s Little House on the Prairie books using them as stools to sit on in the attic. American friends, who find pumpkin and squash so mundane, exclaim, “Oh, you and your pumpkins”, but I will always love them. With pumpkins, the only limit is the cook’s imagination.This is an edited extracted from Around the Table: 52 Essays on Food & Life, by Diana Henry, published by Mitchell Beazley at £20.
