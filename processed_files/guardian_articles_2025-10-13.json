It gives an artist a unique opportunity to work on an epic scale and animate this colossal post-industrial space all the way from piazza floor to girdered roof. Artists haveput the sun in here,built slides, openeda crackfrom one end of the floor to another. YetMáret Ánne Saraseems either scared, repelled or just uninspired by it. She has built a little fort of sticks to hide away from the vastness. That’s the best I can say about her installation – that a small child might enjoy it as a pretend stockade. This easy-to-escape maze of trees actually reminds me of an upmarket adventure playground.It’s hard to understand why Tate Modern didn’t ask Sara for a bit more, well, art. She must have submitted drawings. Did these not suggest it was all going to be rather slight? You do know, they might have gently said, this is the spaceAi Weiwei carpeted with sunflower seeds, andRachel Whiteread filled with a simulacrum of Arctic ice?When you stand on theTurbine Hallbridge looking down, the main part of Sara’s installation is swallowed up in the scale of its setting, the weakly spiralling wooden fences failing to impose themselves at all on the eyes or imagination. You hope it will be better inside. But when you enter, you don’t feel immersed. The neatly cut shafts of raw wood and bark are not that high, nor are they lashed very close together. It’s skimpy. Any atmosphere is dissipated by the views you keep getting of the Turbine Hall.There is no confrontation with the realities of living close to nature. Why not serve reindeer meat, perhaps?This is a thin, unengaged excuse for land art that entirely fails to carry you off into the world of the Sámi that Sara wants you to respect and understand. The Sámi have a long history of oppression by the nation states in which their ancestral lands are enclosed, their shamans even persecuted as witches. So it’s exciting that Sámi artists are now making their culture visible, showing how a tradition of intimacy with nature might inspire a world in climate crisis. I’ve seen powerful, magical contemporary Sámi art. But not here.View image in fullscreen‘Neat arrangements of reindeer skulls’ … the artist with a detail of her work.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianReindeer herding, which plays a crucial economic and ritual role for the Sámi, is represented at the other end of the Turbine Hall by a column of hides flowing up from ground to ceiling. They are suspended between chains and white neon tubes in an imposing yet vacuous minimalist stack. It’s coolly decorative. The animal skins are washed and clean. They look like rugs.The main part of this commission, the weedy tree maze, has well-cleaned and neat arrangements of reindeer skulls and bones. There is no shock or confrontation with the realities of living close to nature in an installation that would suit a hotel lobby. Instead Sara has farmed out the content of the work to the audio recordings about Arctic life on headphones installed by reindeer hide-covered seats. They come with a warning that you will hear descriptions of animal slaughter. But the stories and viewpoints, intercut with bits of plangent Nordic sound, are miserable rather than eye-opening. Of course the point is that climate change makes this fragile ecosystem tougher. But why not confront us with this visually, physically? Butcher and serve reindeer meat perhaps. Just make it real. Somehow.View image in fullscreenAn installation that would suit a hotel lobby … the artist and Queen Sonja of Norway with the reindeer skulls.Photograph: Jack Taylor/ReutersThe biggest problem with the recordings is that you don’t need to be here to hear them. This is essentially a podcast that could be listened to anywhere – though I don’t think it would be Spotify’s biggest hit. And you don’t need to have been to the edge of the Arctic to know that when you leave behind cities and towns, when you are in a natural landscape, there is an immensity, solitude and strangeness that can be overpowering. Land artists as well as landscape painters find ways to make us feel that in a museum, to isolate us among stones or wood or fur and put us in another place,as Andy Goldsworthy’s recent Edinburgh retrospective did. But Sara, with such an extreme and spectacular natural world to share, makes the most desultory gestures towards making us feel what it’s like. She tells instead of shows, lectures instead of lures.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Perhaps Sara doesn’t believe you can bring the Arctic into London except as some shallow consumerist spectacle. She sulks in her fort instead and invites those who truly care to sit in there and listen to sombre truths about Sámi existence.But art is a form of communication and this space is a tremendous chance to do that.

Our love of her films is pretty much the only cultural taste I inherited from her. I was about 10 when she first let me watch a VHS off the grown-up shelf. She picked Baby Boom. I might wonder what the appeal of a film about a high-flying 80s businesswoman inheriting a baby was to a kid – were it not so plainly funny, spanning Keaton’s talents from screwball to synonymous with comfort, and a curious lens on adult life. My next Keaton wasFather of the BrideI and II, which made Keaton – and Steve Martin – feel even more like my movie parents.As a teenager I got into her Woody Allen roles, but I confess I’ve never seen most of her serious work. Instead, it’s her dalliances with the indignities of ageing – in Book Club, Hampstead – that I watch with my mum and nana. Keaton felt so ingrained in my life, not to mention showing that you can be lovable as a deeply idiosyncratic woman existing outside conventional beauty standards; I can’t imagine crying about the death of any other actor. Last night, mum texted me to say she had just finished Baby Boom and was about to start Something’s Gotta Give. At that exact moment, I was watching the credits roll on the latter.‘Diane Keaton taught me the power of real world revenge’Benjamin LeeView image in fullscreenRelatably wimpy … Keaton (left), Goldie Hawn and Bette Midler in The First Wives Club.Photograph: Paramount/AllstarI wasn’t having the best time in 1997. I’d started a new school in a new area and the kids just didn’t take to me (I was gawky, living in what they deemed the wrong side of the tracks and, worst of all, clearly, if not openly, gay). I was an easy target for bullies so I needed to find a way to cope with the barrage and while Carrie was on my rewatch rotation, frustratingly telekinesis wasn’t coming easy (I had stared at so many things for so long but alas). Then we rented out The First Wives Club andDiane Keatontaught me the power of real world revenge. She was a relatably wimpy doormat finding strength in getting her own back and I too found hope in wishing, and quietly planning, for the very worst to happen to those who wronged me. There was something empowering about her embracing and justifying bitter, targeted pettiness, a sap who became a survivor and turned into my unlikely high school mascot. When they went low, I went back to The First Wives Club.‘I found her irresistible’Emma BrockesDiane Keaton: ‘I love Woody. And I believe my friend’Read moreWhen I met Diane Keaton 11 years ago in LA, she turned up to the interview fully in role as “Diane Keaton”: that is, as a person of impossible charm and assiduous vagueness – la-di-da – in a bowler hat and fingerless mesh gloves. Keaton was then 68 and still very much in her prime. I found her irresistible, as everyone who met her did, a woman of radical, thrilling, eccentric style in an industry of dull conformists. It took steel to be that way, and around the edges of her persona I thought I could see it. Do you know she made a second income flipping houses? Or that her relationship with Warren Beatty ended because, she wrote in her memoir, “I wanted to be Warren Beatty, not love him”? Celebrity culture didn’t suit her, she told me, because – raise a glass, tip the bowler – “I don’t fit.”‘She was the dream Boomer’Catherine BrayView image in fullscreenSo Diane … Keaton and Jack Nicholson in Something’s Gotta Give (2003).Photograph: Cinematic/AlamyFor a certain cohort of elder millennials and the younger half of Gen X, Diane Keaton was about the same age as your own mother, and for me, she always represented an idealised version of that much-maligned generation, the Boomers. Keaton was the way you want this generation to be: stylish in the 1970s, feminist in the 1980s, hilarious in the 1990s and ageing aspirationally into the new millennium, with Keanu Reeves’ sexy doctor character in Something’s Gotta Give chasing her with lines like: “How great is it for you that I’m not intimidated by your brilliance?” Quite apart from her onscreen roles, she campaigned to protect wildlife, preserve architectural history and was a vocal ally to the LGBTQ+ community. Boomers who wonder why they can’t seem to get it right with their adult kids: be more Diane.‘She walks on the broken glass of contradictions of what it meant to be a modern woman in the late 70s’Priya ElanView image in fullscreenDitzy … Keaton in Looking for Mr Goodbar (1977).Photograph: Paramount/AllstarAs a child I fell for Diane Keaton, the comedic ditz. But it wasn’t until recently I discovered her greatest dramatic performance, Looking for Mr Goodbar. Conventionally read as a parable against the single life, the film is really a fascinatingly nuanced look at one person’s attempt to find themselves through their sexuality, navigating the choppy sea to independence and swimming against a tide of societal expectation. Keaton dispenses with her usual comedy tics to play Theresa Dunn, a scoliosis survivor with a deeply enmeshed Catholic family who enters the pre-Aids singles-bar scene in an attempt to find, well, not love per se, but herself. The film de-centres Theresa from the male characters (who are all monstrous) to portray a character walking on the broken glass of contradictions of what it meant to be a modern woman in the late 70s. As the film builds ominously to its chilling climax, you realise you have been watching one of the greatest horror films ever made.‘I conflated her with my mom’Richard LawsonView image in fullscreenComplex … Keaton in Baby Boom (1987).Photograph: United Artists/AllstarOf the few VHS tapes my childhood household owned, 1987’s Baby Boom was among the most precious. Charles Shyer’s witty and wistful comedy of interruption – about a greed-is-good 1980s Manhattan businesswoman who is suddenly saddled with a distant relative’s infant daughter – was such a favourite of my professionally accomplished mother that I, as a kid, began to conflate fiction with reality. In financier JC Wyatt’s smart haircut, I saw my mom’s. Ditto JC’s sardonic humour, her occasional fluster, the compassionate humanity lying underneath a tough exterior. In some senses, JCwasmy mom and thus Diane Keaton was, too. It was only when I got a bit older and saw more of Keaton’s work that I realised what a departure this was for the actor, a chance to play a bit flintier than she normally did. It’s a performance I’ve revisited again and again over the years, first with my family and then on my own.Baby Boom is a nostalgia vector, to be sure. But it is also a valuable window into the complex talent of a legendary actor often thought of as one thing: a flouncer, a sweet mess, a whimsical dream girl. Those qualities are certainly present in Shyer’s film, gradually teased out as JC’s circumstances realign her priorities. But there is something unique in there, too, a harder facet of Keaton’s ability that I only wish she’d gotten to, or chosen to, explore more of later in her career. At least we’ll always have Baby Boom, with its achingly lovely music underscoring scenes of a woman buckling under dual allegiances, struggling to and then succeeding in finding her own way to have it all – just as Keaton did, just as mom did.‘She seemed hotter than all the bronzed Barbies’Amy FlemingView image in fullscreenDeftly original … Keaton at the Oscars in 2004.Photograph: Francis Specker/AlamyI was spellbound by Diane Keaton when I was a tween in the 80s. I would always watch the Woody Allen films she was in when they came on TV – Sleeper, Annie Hall, Manhattan. As a girl yet to experience a romantic relationship, I found them, and especially her, hilarious and fascinating.What a contrast she was to the women in the TV shows I’d grown up with – The A Team, Wonder Woman, Dukes of Hazzard, Bewitched, Dynasty. She seemed hotter than all of them while dressing androgynously and not showing off bronzed Barbie-doll legs or pouting.Deftly original, her screen presence felt like permission to be weird, contrary, complicated, funny and so deeply into your own interests as to not be remotely intimidated by or in thrall to verbose, idiotic, self-absorbed men.‘Her coltish energy was relatable and deeply desirable’Leslie FelperinAs the child of east coast Jews, I was raised on Woody Allen movies. But that only emphasised how out of sync I felt growing up in California in the 1970s at a time when all the girls aspired to look like Cybill Shepherd, Farrah Fawcett or Suzanne Somers, all assorted shades of ultra-femme blonde. With her menswear borrowings and goofy hats in Annie Hall, Diane Keaton offered a style that was uniquely her own but also eminently copyable for an adolescent girl.View image in fullscreenOddly powerful … Woody Allen and Keaton in Annie Hall (1977).Photograph: United Artists/AllstarThere was something oddly powerful about it too, as if Keaton and all of us young women cloning her style were asserting that we didn’t want to look like the Übermensch power-shiksas the men said they wanted; we wanted to look like the men themselves, the guys who desired Annie in spite of, perhaps because of, all her brittleness, her anhedonia, her performative la-di-da poise. Her coltish energy was relatable and deeply desirable, and you can’t but admire how she evolved that style over the years into something that worked exceedingly well in middle-age, all chunky knitwear and tweed coat – quiet luxury before that was even a phrase.‘I’m still singing and whooping along to her solo’Hollie RichardsonI was a daughter of divorce in the 90s; watching The First Wives Club with my mum was a rite of passage. While Goldie and Bette spit out the big laugh lines, Diane’s doormat Annie – “the one who can’t manage a single declarative sentence” – is most relatable in learning to stand up for herself. And it is so satisfying. The “I’m sorry!” she screams at her husband, his new girlfriend and her therapist is just incredible. But, of course, it’s the final scene, where Annie at last gets the guts to do her solo in You Don’t Own Me, that leaves its joyous mark. “Just let me be myself,” she warbles, shaking out her head. The trio, all fabulously dressed in white, join in and spill out on to the street. My mum sent it to me on Saturday, after the news of Diane’s death, and I’m still singing and whooping along to it with a tear in my eye.‘The scene in Manhattan when she yells at her dog Waffles is an absolute masterclass’Andrew PulverView image in fullscreenRecognisably human … Woody Allen and Diane Keaton in Manhattan (1979).Photograph: Ronald GrantWithout the sardonic delivery of, say, Tina Fey or Sarah Silverman, Diane Keaton was, in retrospect, a tiny bit overmatched in Woody Allen’s “early, funny” comedies; Allen, after all, had some claim to be the funniest human being ever during his early 70s pomp. But if her gag delivery was a little shaky, she more than made up for it with her brilliant acting chops, able to inhabit roles with great skill: you totally believed she was a ditsy future-world poetess addicted to the Orb, or a Russian maiden unhappily married to a herring merchant. She really came into her own as Allen’s films evolved into fully conceived comedy-dramas, with their fully rounded and recognisably human characters, rather than blizzards of skits. Annie Hall suited her well – it seems you could hardly get a cigarette paper between Annie and Keaton’s real-life persona – but Manhattan, her last Allen film until a brief cameo in Radio Days, may be her most accomplished performance. Her character, emotionally needy journalist Mary Wilkie, is introduced superbly, intimidating Allen’s Isaac with a rapid-fire critique of the art show they are visiting (“It was perfectly integrated and it had a marvellous kind of negative capability. The rest of the stuff downstairs was bullshit!”); and the scene in which she simultaneously argues with Michael Murphy’s Yale, fields a call from even more emotionally needy therapist Donny, and yells at her dog Waffles is just an absolute masterclass. Her later comedies were fun, for sure, but never match up to this.‘Keaton fought for, and won, the right to be smart and creative, screwed-up and restless’Charlotte O’SullivanView image in fullscreenAngsty … Allen and Keaton in Annie Hall.Photograph: United Artists/AllstarKeaton doesn’t make a single duff move in Annie Hall, Woody Allen’s zippy, raw ode to doomed love. But she’s especially awesome in the bit where fidgety heroine, Annie, has an out-of-body experience. It’s been established that wannabe singer Annie routinely gets stoned before having intercourse with comedian boyfriend, Alvy (Allen) and that these days, even when high, Annie is finding Alvy less likely to float her boat than sink it. Here, the couple are on holiday in the Hamptons, and a typically hot-to-trot Alvy demands she ditch the drugs. Once sprawled on top of her, he remarks “You seem sorta distant”. When Annie mutters, “I’m fine!” you can all but picture her gritted teeth.Soon her ghost-like inner self is padding out of the bed, sitting on a chair and drawling, “Alvy, do you remember where I put my drawing pad? Because while you two are doing that, I think I’m gonna do some drawing.” Allen is king of zingers, but Keaton more than holds her own by being nakedly real. Keaton lets her shoulders get slumpy. Her voice sounds almost whiny. Meanwhile, watch the expression on the face of her “ghost”. Annie slips from looking stern, to indulgent, and finally (once she remembers her beloved drawing pad) ecstatic. Annie is clearly in a funk and Keaton, with great skill, puts us inside this character’s teeming brain. It’s been said that in Annie Hall the actor isn’t doing a whole lot, because she’s just being herself. What hooey!Annie laid the groundwork for a bunch of other frazzled females on a herky-jerky quest for meaning. Elaine from Seinfeld. Clementine from Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Frances Ha. Fleabag. Insecure’s Issa Dee. It’s not about where these women live (though many of themdocrash around NYC), it’s about a state of mind. Keaton fought for, and won, the right to be smart and creative, screwed-up and restless. Angsty Hall. That Keaton was allowed to bring this magnificently awkward character to life – and that her performance continues to have a cultural impact – makes me happy beyond words.‘A movie star who was entirely the same in real life’Catherine ShoardMy half an hour on the phone with Diane Keaton two years ago could have been quite stressful. There was a delay on the line, she’d asked for topics in advance but hadn’t read them, she only wanted to talk about doors anyway and then her dog vomited up a rock.View image in fullscreenIn-the-moment … Keaton attends a Lakers game in Los Angeles with Jack Nicholson in 2003.Photograph: Vince Bucci/Getty ImagesYet I was left totally beaming. Keaton waswildlynice. I’ve never been complimented so much in 30 minutes. But she was also responsive, curious, quick, surprising (read: all over the shop), warm but not soft (called herself a bitch for having a black Mercedes, was rigorously puritanical about victim culture). Unless it was about dogs – then she was hypnotically soppy.‘God, life is so strange’: Diane Keaton interviewed in 2023 on dogs, doors, wine and why she’s ‘really fancy’Read moreThese qualities have substantial overlap with her movie persona (at least the comedy one – she was also a skilled actor who played loads of prickly people) – and are why everyone loved her. But it was a unique experience to meet a movie star who was just entirely like that in real life. She also seemed, I should say, really cheerful – which tracks. Note how different to her peers she looks onthat iconic Vanity Fair cover, not only in terms of surgery and swaddle, but smile.Outside small children, Keaton was the most in-the-moment and bracingly unreflective person I’ve ever met. Maybe this spontaneity had something to do with why she was quite so magnetic on screen, as well as great company on the blower. I thinkthat interviewwas the last one she did. I’m beyond honoured – and very sad.Explore more on these topicsDiane KeatonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

How does she make sense of what happened?Mon 13 Oct 2025 06.48 EDTShare‘It is so rare, in fact it never happens, that crimes are so well documented.” Manon Garcia is the French feminist philosopher whose thinking featured so prominently in the final stages of theDominique Pelicot trial. There are, she points out, 20,000 videos and photos of Gisèle Pelicot “being raped, unconscious, by complete strangers”. One might struggle to understand why, in the face of such compelling factual evidence against her husband Dominique and a further 50 men, prosecutors would need to bring in a philosophical argument to explain why this was wrong. But since they did, they couldn’t have found a clearer or more persuasive voice than Garcia’s, the author of We Are Not Born Submissive and The Joy of Consent.Last November, six weeks into the trial, Garcia arrived in Avignon to watch mass rape in the dock. She had intended to come for a day or two, just to see it, and then go back to her normal life. “But I was seeing things that the journalists were not seeing, because we’re not doing the same job. Also, something deeper happened. It felt like I couldn’t do anything else. My kids were three and five, and I could not be a mother, be in my daily life, while the trial was happening.”Living with Men: Reflections on the Pelicot Trial is her new book about “the Mazan affair”, named after the Pelicots’ home village. Its subject is “unbelievably dark, but this is not a dark book”, she tells me over video call from Berlin, where she is now a junior professor at the Freie Universität, following stints at Harvard and the University of Chicago. She has a penetrating gaze and a remorseless dry wit, and her book, from the subtlest scene-setting to the starkest conclusion, is gripping, eloquent, angry, funny and profound. It’s also surprisingly moving, not least because of Gisèle Pelicot’s courage.View image in fullscreenGisèle Pelicot in December 2024, after the trial of the men who raped her.Photograph: Miguel Medina/AFP/Getty ImagesHaving survived rape on an unimaginable scale, and 10 years of thinking she was dying, because of the cocktail of sedatives and anti-anxiety medication her husband was spiking her with, Gisèle Pelicot somehow found the strength to waive her right to anonymity so that the trial could be held in open court. This meant she was faced, every day, with “50 defendants plus one or two lawyers each. They were an enormous group, and she’s alone next to them, next to all these men that have raped her, and yet she doesn’t know them, has never seen them,” Garcia describes.It was a bear pit; a lot of these guys had been sharing a cell while on remand. “They got along really well – they were bros hanging out. Over time, there was this atmosphere of: ‘These crazy feminists, these extremists who want to have us punished for something that we didn’t do.’”Gisèle Pelicot, who was 71 when proceedings began, was often left feeling as though she was on trial herself. “I have felt humiliated while I’ve been in this courtroom,” she said at the time. “I have been called an alcoholic, a conspirator of Mr Pelicot.” There was barely any room for her own supporters, most of whom had to watch in an overspill room. But the women who were there applauded her, every day, at the going down of the sun, and in the morning. “They were saying: ‘You have the women behind you,’” Garcia, 41, recalls. “That was very powerful. Even up until the end – I don’t know if I want to say this publicly, because it makes me look like such a typical ‘woman’ – but I cried every time she was applauded.”That ordeal resumed for Gisèle last Monday, when 44-year-oldHusamettin Dogan, sentenced to nine years in prison, appealed against his rape conviction. She was taking part, her lawyer, Antoine Camus, said, “to make clear that rape is rape, that there is no such thing as a small rape.” Doganlost his appeal, and his sentence was increased to 10 years.Nothing has changed, insofar as the same defence arguments were lodged, rejected again by the jury. Yet this time, Garcia says, “Gisèle Pelicot’s lawyers successfully opposed the use of old sexual pictures of her in the trial, arguing that it risks exposing her to secondary victimation. This was a victory that can have strong jurisprudential consequences.”One of the shocking things about these 50 rapists is that their only common denominator was that they were from the same 50km radius. (Dominique Pelicot didn’t want to take chances on the drugs wearing off.) They came from every class, from every age group (the youngest was 27, the oldest 74) – a lorry driver, a soldier, a journalist, a DJ. They were single, they were married, they were fathers, they were not. They were such a perfect randomised cross-section of society that the world tied itself in knots to come to a sensible conclusion that wasn’t: “This is what men are.”Garcia describes wryly in the book how people from Paris would say: “This is men from the south”; intellectuals would say: “These don’t look like guys who read many books”; her German and American colleagues would say: “It’s really a problem with French culture.” (I had a trace of that myself – I couldn’t imagine it happening in the UK, butI just wasn’t imagining hard enough.)When I admit as much to Garcia, she openly laughs: “At the end of the trial, German journalists found a Telegram group where 70,000 men were sharing recipes for chemical submission and pictures of how they were raping their wives. This summer, 32,000 Italian men were found on a Facebook group where they shared pictures of their [she mimes some air quotes]sleepingwives in sexual positions. I wish we could decide that this was a problem with French culture.”Drugging women to rape them is often either passed off as the woman’s alcoholism or drug abuse, or camouflaged as a kink, by the defendant and then his defence team. Garcia considers this really deeply, the difference between what we might call forced unconsciousness (chemical submission, non-consensual asphyxiation) and a fetish like somnophilia – getting aroused by a person who’s pretending to be asleep. In Living With Men, she writes that chemical submission delivers “maximal transformation of the victim into a thing”. I would prefer “person” – once the person is a victim, the transformation is already under way. But I’m only tinkering with her sentences because I admire them. As for asphyxiation, she tells me: “BDSM and kink can be a response to how to create a better sexuality in a patriarchal world, but its mainstreaming has been used as a cover for men who commit sexual violence. It’s thought of as a new defence in rape or even murder trials, that the strangulation was just because: ‘We were into this – it’s rough sex gone wrong.’ That’s funny for me, because it isnotnew.”She delves into some stunning detail on the judges’ questions during the trial: a handful of men used as their defence that they couldn’t have raped Gisèle Pelicot because they couldn’t get an erection, and video evidence backed this up. “There was one judge that was silent most of the time,” she says, “but really interrogated them: ‘How come you couldn’t have an erection?’ He didn’t once ask any of the 45 other men: ‘How come you could have an erection?’ Once you see the videos, there’s nothing about it that is arousing. It’s not a rock movie of a hot woman on a beautiful bed. It’s a naked woman that could be your grandmother. You don’t know her, she’s in a coma; how does this turn you on? Let’s do this as a thought experiment. Imagine a guy on a bed in this little bedroom, snoring, saliva coming out of his mouth, 30 years older than you, a stranger, and you’re going for it 100%?”View image in fullscreenGisèle Pelicot’s supporters outside the courthouse in Avignon, France, last November.Photograph: Alexandre Dimou/ReutersGarcia doesn’t like the phrase “rape culture”, finding it too loose, but refers in the book to the “cultural scaffolding of rape”, an idea coined by the New Zealand psychologist Nicola Gavey in the mid-00s. Three assumptions underpin it – men only want sex, not love; women only want love, and will have sex in order to obtain it; sex is vaginal penetration by a penis, ending in ejaculation. These myths frame the sexes at odds – men as hunters, women as prey, male desire as a “standby position, waiting for the opportunity to rape”, she writes.One of the most bracing elements of Living With Men is the comparison Garcia draws between sitting through the Pelicot trial and Hannah Arendt’s 1963 book Eichmann in Jerusalem: a Report on the Banality of Evil. Adolf Eichmann, of course, was on trial for being an organiser of the Holocaust, which cannot be paralleled. “There are two reasons why I had to make the analogy with Eichmann. The first is that I’m a philosopher who goes to a trial. So anyone is going to ask me: ‘What do you take from Arendt in Jerusalem?’ And the second is that ‘evil’ and ‘male’ are the same sound in French. The banality of evil and the banality of males is the same sound. So the joke was constantly made.”In fact, there is a much more profound comparison, which is what Arendt ultimately concluded. “If a criminal trial works the way it should, it will not do the work that you’re expecting it to do,” Garcia says. “If you want this to be a social trial about sexual violence, or if you want the Eichmann trial to be a trial of nazism, this is not what the criminal trial can give you. If it were to give you this, it would be a bad criminal trial.” Just as Gisèle Pelicot’s experience in court replayed and even amplified her violation, so Eichmann’s defence that he was passive and merely obedient reframed the Holocaust as pointillism, an atrocity in which no single person’s actions had meaning, no individual was at fault. “The big difference is, there are historians who think Arendt believed Eichmann’s defence unduly – that he was playing dumb. These guys in Mazan, they’re not playing dumb, they have literally nothing to say about what they did. This, for me, was terrifying.View image in fullscreenThe trial of Adolf Eichmann, in the glass booth, in Jerusalem, December 1961.Photograph: Bettmann/Getty Images“In the French justice system, if perpetrators recognise what they did, if they think about it constructively, they will go to prison for less long. So these men have had a very strong incentive to do this work, they have been in prison for two years or sometimes four, and yet they cannot. It’s not because they’re dumb. It’s because there’s something about what it is for them to be a man, and to be entitled to women’s bodies, that makes them, I think, at least some of them, deeply convinced that they haven’t done anything wrong.”The trial took a toll on Garcia. “I had very strong sleep problems, because I really felt like any moment I could fall asleep, and something horrible could happen. The only place I felt safe was next to my husband, and my brain was saying: ‘Are you being stupid? This is the one place you should not feel safe.’ But you can’t feel that way.” She’s not some anti-man feminist, she says. “I just want men to understand that this is the world we share, and you being a man has something to do with this being the world we share.” It feels like needless contrarianism, almost trolling, to call this book uplifting; but it’s a map of terrain that is inescapable without one. It’s incredibly uplifting.Living With Men: Reflections on the Pelicot Trial is published by Polity, price £20. To support the Guardian, order a copy fromguardianbookshop.com.

Netflix tackles the horrific ‘Monster of Florence’ murdersIt was a brutal killing spree that gripped Italy – yet so little is still known. Why were lovers murdered in their cars? Why were their sexual organs often targeted? AuthorTobias Jonessifts the evidenceTobias JonesMon 13 Oct 2025 13.02 EDTLast modified on Mon 13 Oct 2025 21.30 EDTShareSome criminal cases are so vast that even the number of victims is uncertain: in the case of the unsolved “Monster of Florence” crimes that have grippedItalyfor half a century, it is known that seven couples were murdered. But some say it’s eight, and at least another 16 murders have been connected to the case. The number of suspects almost matches that of the victims. First there was thepista sarda, the Sardinian line of enquiry into the swinging, pimping Vinci brothers who probably had a hand in the “first” murder in 1968. In the 1990s, a rapist, Pietro Pacciani, was convicted and then cleared. In 2000, Pacciani’s co-accused, Mario Vanni and Giancarlo Lotti, were sentenced to life and 28 years respectively for the murders committed between 1981 and 1985.Gianluca Monastra, author of Il Mostro di Firenze, writes that it’s a case in which “there’s a seductive and ever more abstract ballet of hypotheses … it’s a story in which everything can seem true, as can its contrary.” Filled with intrigue and sex (most of the victims were young couples making out in the countryside), it has spawned its fair share of obsessives, who have come to be known as monsterologists. The frequency with which evidence suddenly appeared or disappeared has persuaded some monsterologists to suspect that elements within law enforcement were involved.Milva Malatesta was burned in a car along with her three-year-old sonDebate about the Monster’s identity will reignite this month with the release of Stefano Sollima’s four-partNetflixdrama, The Monster of Florence, on 22 October. Son of the film director Sergio, Sollima has decided to concentrate only on the beginning of the story, on thepista sarda, a choice that means the series never moves beyond act one of the Monster tragedy – a sequel is presumably in the works.The actual facts are grim. In 1974, a couple kissing in a car in Sagginale, north-east of Florence, were murdered. The woman’s breasts and pubic area were stabbed 97 times. Nothing further happened until a burst in the 1980s. The Monster struck twice in 1981, then again in 1982, 83, 84 and 85. The same H-series gun cartridges were used in every murder – the stabbings and surgical cuttings only occurred after the monster had shot and killed his victims.There was a creepy ritualism to the murders. Each time the victims were in states of arousal in a car. The man was killed first. Usually the women were sexually mutilated. A part of one victim’s breast was posted to the only woman on the investigative team. All the murders happened in the countryside north-east and south-west of Florence, often in or very near a small town called San Casciano.But 1974 may be the wrong place to start the story. In 1982, an anonymous tip persuaded investigators to link the gun used by the Monster, a Beretta .22 series 70, to an earlier crime: in 1968, Barbara Locci and her lover, Antonio Lo Bianco, had been murdered in the latter’s car as they made love with Locci’s son asleep on the back seat. They were the “first” or “eighth” couple.Locci’s husband, Stefano Mele, was imprisoned for that 1968 murder and thus excluded as a Monster suspect. But Mele was thought to have had Sardinian accomplices. Three brothers, called Vinci, had all been Barbara Locci’s lovers. One of them, Salvatore Vinci, had often been Locci’s husband’s lover as well.There was a fluidity and abusiveness to many of these relationships. It seems that Salvatore Vinci probably pimped out Locci. In 1985, after a trial in which he was cleared of killing his first wife Barbarina back in 1960, Salvatore Vinci disappeared.Sollima is exactly the man you would want to tackle this start of the tortuous story. The kingpin of Italian crime series for the last two decades, he directed Romanzo Criminale (the series, not the film) and Suburra (the film, not the series). He directed the cops-and-ultras film ACAB, and produced the series. He has also been a co-director on famous Roberto Saviano adaptations, from ZeroZeroZero to Gomorrah.View image in fullscreenLovers … 1981 victims Stefano Baldi and Susanna Cambi.Photograph: ShutterstockHis new series captures the weird giddiness of the Monster case because each of the four episodes is told from a separate point of view: those ofMele and his brother Giovanni who was imprisoned for eight months, but later released without charge, and the two Vinci brothers. The same scenes appear in subsequent episodes but now the viewer sees things differently and scoffs at their previous gullibility.But in never leaving thepista sarda, the series feels slightly gullible as well. The Sardinian line of enquiry was abandoned, at least by investigators, in 1989. Michele Giuttari, the lead investigator on the case for almost seven years, believes it was a deliberate red herring and that the ballistics connections between the 1968 and 1974 murders remain unproven.In the 2000s, in the aftermath of the convictions of Vanni and Lotti, Giuttari (who had become chief inspector for the Investigative Group for Serial Crimes) concentrated on who commissioned the murders. “There was a superior level, it’s useless to deny that,” Giuttari said recently. Pacciani was mysteriously wealthy and Giuttari hypothesised that the murderers were commissioned in order to cull body parts for satanic masses. He revealed connections between prostitution and participants in orgiastic parties organised by a Sicilian guru called Salvatore Indovino in San Casciano.It’s almost impossible to conclude from the evidence that all the murders were committed by a single culpritGiuliano Mignini, the public prosecutor in Perugia, also took the case in new directions. Many suspects had spoken about a doctor’s role in the killings, without naming him. Mignini investigated the unexplained death in 1985 of a 35-year-old gynaecologist and freemason, Francesco Narducci, who had been fished out of Lake Trasimeno, Umbria, one month after the last double murder. No autopsy was conducted. Mignini disinterred Narducci and claimed that he had been murdered.The conspiracy theories, and tangential murders, mounted up. In 1982, Elisabetta Ciabani, a friend of one of the Monster’s 1981 victims, Susanna Cambi, was found disembowelled in her room in Scicli, Sicily. Francesco Vinci was killed – hog-tied and set on fire in his car – in 1993. A few days later, Milva Malatesta, a woman who had been in a relationship with Vinci, was murdered – also burned in a car – along with her three-year-old son.There are so many connections, but it’s hard to know if they mean anything. Members of the Malatesta family worked in a factory owned by the doctor’s family. Malatesta’s brother maintains that one of those most closely involved in the official investigation had been present at parties where his sister was part of the carnal offering.View image in fullscreenIn the dock … Marco Bullitta as Stefano Mele in the Netflix series.Photograph: Emanuela Scarpa/ NetflixBy now, it’s widely accepted that the “Monster” label covers an actual conspiracy – in the sense of “plotting together”. It’s almost impossible to conclude from the evidence that all the murders were committed by a single culprit. The crimes appear collective: the killings were probably watched, the body parts passed on. Most now believe not in a single monster but in monsters. In 2019, Paul Russell, an Italy-based producer, titled his documentary Monsters of Florence (Paramount+/Netflix). “The whole case is a source of fantasies,” he tells me.The fantasies aren’t only sexual, but investigative. Public prosecutors became “monsterologists”, speculating about masonic lodges and satanism and often appearing borderline paranoid themselves. Mignini maintained that if Narducci’s body was present in his actual grave it must have been swapped twice. Giuttari thought a stone cairn implied satanism. The Perugia and Florence prosecutors started a turf war over who held ultimate responsibility for the case: Mignini opened an investigation into the chief prosecutor in Florence and arrested, and imprisoned, the journalist, Mario Spezi, on charges including libel which were later dropped (Spezi was the co-author of Douglas Preston’s book, The Monster of Florence, which made veiled accusations against the son of one of the original Sardinian suspects). Mignini was later accused, and cleared, of abuse of office.That’s what the Monster story can do to people. Public prosecutors, journalists, film-makers and barflies become fixated. But as we pile up names, facts and distant connections, the story slips from the true crime genre into a fable about the evasiveness of truth.The Monster of Florence is on Netflix from 22 October.

She recounts falling in love with the city and its thriving literary culture, before an air raid siren soundsFiona BensonMon 13 Oct 2025 11.15 EDTShareIhad been working on Exeter University’s Ukrainian WartimePoetryproject for two years when the invitation came to travel to the country’s largest literary festival. I didn’t exactly relish the prospect of a journey to a war zone, but I was assured that visiting BookForum in Lviv, a city so far west it’s practically in Poland, would be safe. I had been leading poetry workshops with exiles and editing translations of Ukrainian poetry, including soldier Artur Dron‘’s collection We Were Here, published last November. So, when Artur and his translator – the incredible poet Yuliya Musakovska – asked me and language professor Hugh Roberts to attend, I couldn’t say no.What I didn’t expect was to fall in love with the city: its gorgeous architecture, its cafes, its parks full of trees, and its writers. Lviv’s inspired, robust literary culture puts the UK’s own underfunded, last-gasp scene to shame. On the first night of the Forum, Hugh and I attended a nonstop music and poetry event in a nightclub at which both Artur and Yuliya read their poems, and revealed what utter rock stars they truly are. I don’t know why I was surprised; We Were Here,written on the frontline before Artur was even 22, is a masterpiece. It is full of lucid, clear-eyed accounts of his experiences in the trenches and on the battlefield, elegies for his comrades, humane portraits of the suffering of bereaved civilians and furious adaptations of liturgies and prayers. One of his poems is published below.Lviv’s inspired, robust literary culture puts the UK’s underfunded, last-gasp scene to shameThe next day, Yuliya and I read our own poems together, and then Hugh and I were hustled off to meet the mayor of Lviv, Andriy Sadovyi. We watched a presentation about the Unbroken Institute, an enormous hospital development in the Lviv region dedicated to the rehabilitation of casualties. It includes world-leading prosthetics design facilities, physiological and psychological care units, and maternity wards. It is always augmenting, preparing for casualties yet to come and the long-term legacy of this war, its manifold trauma.When, on day two of the book festival, a siren sounds, it is so soft, so unlike the ear-splitting sirens of my RAF childhood, that at first I think it’s a drill. Then comes a recording of a man who tells us, in the gentlest voice I’ve ever heard, that there is an air raid and we must seek shelter.I pull a jumper on over my pyjamas and make my way down to the shelter – a staff kitchen area in the basement. Slowly other people filter in, including a family with two children who are shown into a room which I hope has beds. Children all over the city are listening to the sounds of this murderous sky. It turns out to be the worst bombardment Lviv has yet suffered.In the bomb shelter, a tremor comes up through the soles of my feet. I am afraid of what is happening above groundUnder the migraine-inducing strip lights, everyone huddles over their phones, watching the trajectories of the Russian missiles on Telegram channels such as War Monitor – red, green and yellow lines pointing straight at Lviv. My new shelter buddy Bartosz has an app that delivers blow-by-blow updates, including a meme of a furiously smoking monkey to indicate there is time between missiles for a quick cigarette. This is war in a digital age. Hugh receives a text to say that two Russian Kinzhal missiles are coming and, sure enough, I hear and feel them. Down here they sound like plosives (“puh … puh”) rather than explosives, and a muted tremor comes up through the soles of my feet. I am afraid of what is happening above ground, and fervently grateful to the defence units trying to shoot down the drones.It would be easy to say that when I tentatively step out the next day, there is only a faint whiff of burnt rubber, that repairs have already begun, that Lviv is unbroken. Yet energy infrastructure has been targeted, boding a cold winter; a six-year-old boy has suffered a traumatic brain injury; a whole family have been killed including Anastasiia Hrytsiv – the same age as my daughter, the same long hair and bright smile. Just that night she had been texting her father on the frontline, checking he was OK.The BookForum is in full fuck-you-Putin mode, defiantly thriving, and I wander through stalls piled high with exquisitely produced books and wonder at the richness of book culture here. Our last event is a bilingual reading with three soldier poets, Dron’, Ihor Mitrov and Fedir Rudyi. I read the English versions of Fedir’s poems; they are tender, grounded and as acutely observant and sensitive as Fedir is in person.After the reading, the three poets hold each other. They are all in pain. These war poems are hard to read, and all three of them have injuries, psychological and – in Artur’s case – physical: nerve damage in his left arm inflicted by a Russian drone. A red scar wipes out a section of his beautiful sleeve tattoo of trees. He is still receiving rehabilitation treatment at the Unbroken Institute. Many of his friends – also terrific poets – have been killed, including the incredible Maksym Kryvtsov.Beloved poets, beloved city, I am praying for an end to Russian aggression, I am wishing you safe from harm.Prayer by Artur Dron’Translated from the Ukrainian by Yuliya MusakovskaWith the swimmers, swim,with the travellers, travel,as they say in church.With the one who was rapedand is expecting a child,breathe, breathe, breathe.With the child whose hair has gone grey,prepare a backpack for school.With the frostbitten, freeze,with the shellshocked, vomit in the trench.With the tank commander,who’s been missing since October,be found, be pieced togetherfrom scattered body parts.Consecrated particlesas they say in church.And also bewith the one who eats pot noodles with cold water;with the one who was captured but will never talk;with the one who was conceivedbut didn’t get born.And be with the onewho didn’t get to give birth.And also bewith the two girlssomewhere in the Rivne region, do you remember?We were driving to the east, in a convoy,and they stood watching at the roadside,and put their hands on their hearts.And then I understood everything.Prayer is taken from We Were Here by Artur Dron’, published byJantar.

Operator route maps are approximateThe majority of Great Britain’s major rail operators are now in public ownership, as the Labour government continues its efforts to make the railways “more reliable, affordable and accessible”.The nationalisation of Greater Anglia on 12 October represents the ninth major passenger service to be brought back into public ownership, leaving seven to go before the government’s deadline of completing every operator by 2027.The rollout, which is resulting in an operator being nationalised roughly every three months, is gradually bringing an end to a privatised system that critics argue has been overly fragmented and focused on profit, to the detriment of passenger experience.Several operators were already under public ownership by the time Labour were elected in 2024, having been nationalised by the Conservatives over financial woes and poor performance.Meanwhile,Transportfor Wales and ScotRail were each nationalised by the Welsh and Scottish devolved governments, in 2021 and 2022 respectively.However, under the current transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, the Department for Transport (DfT) has accelerated the pace of nationalisation, bringing three operators on to the public books since May: South Western Railway, C2C and Greater Anglia.State of play, October 2025So farnineof the 16 major rail operators in Britain are now in public ownership:Tap an operator to highlight routes, tap again to deselectThe government has said the remaining seven will be nationalised byOctober 2027:The operator that was nationalised most recently wasGreater Anglia, which took place on12 October 2025.The next operator set to be nationalised isWest Midlands Trains, which the government says will take place inFebruary 2026.The nationalisations come ahead of the establishment of a new state-controlled company called Great British Railways, expected next year, which will manage rail infrastructure and services.It has been describedby the DfTas a “single directing mind” for “bringing track and train together, putting passengers and customers first, [and] rebuilding trust in the railway”.It will soon manage most of the publicly owned operators in Great Britain, combining them with Network Rail, which owns the tracks, signals and big stations.However, Great Britain’s trains will remain privately owned.Industry insiders have expressed cautious optimism about Labour’s plans, highlighting the potential for Great British Railways to achieve more coordination and, in turn, greater efficiency.However, experts have also warned that nationalisation alone may not be enough to fix all of Britain’s problems with rail, given ballooning costs.“Irrespective of the ownership changes, the government’s got a major headache with the fact that rail is gobbling up so much public subsidy, and that’s before you get to HS2,” said Stephen Glaister, the emeritus professor of transport and infrastructure at Imperial College London and a former chair of the Office of Rail and Road.“The government are making promises to make fares even cheaper and services even better, but both will cost more public money.”The data available on nationalised operators so far offers a mixed picture on performance.Several have experienced improving train punctuality and a reduction in cancellations but the performance of others has worsened over the past year.LNER has been one of the most improved – and in June the rail minister, Peter Hendy,described the operator as a “blueprint”for wider renationalisation efforts.Have rail operators improved in the past year?Change in delays and cancellations by rail operator, year to June 2025Show more franchisesGuardian graphic. Source: delay and cancellation data taken from the Office of Rail and Road. *Note: South Western Railway, C2C and Greater Anglia were nationalised by the Labour government in the latter half of the time period analysed hereWhen will the next operators be nationalised?Labour committed to bringing rail into public ownership in theparty’s 2024 election manifesto– claiming it had come up with a way to nationalise trains “without costing taxpayers a penny in compensation”.Instead of an “all-at-once” approach, nationalising every operator simultaneously and paying off shareholders, the government is running down the clock on existing rail contracts.The DfT is waiting for each operator’s core contract expiry date, which allows the government to take over without compensating the private companies.The final operator to expire in this way will be CrossCountry in October 2027 – and this is when the government says it will have completed rail nationalisation in Great Britain.Until then, the government has set a pace of nationalising one operator in each annual quarter. West Midlands Railway is due next, in February 2026.Labour’s current one-at-a-time approach builds off of the work of its predecessors in government. Several operators – including LNER, Northern and Southeastern – were brought into public ownership by the Conservatives from 2018 onwards.In those cases, nationalisation was taken as an emergency measure rather than a deliberate policy – in response to financial difficulties, in the case of LNER, or because of dismal performance, in the case of Northern.Additionally, ScotRail and Transport for Wales were brought into public ownership by their respective devolved governments, and their train operations are not expected to be merged into Great British Railways.Labour’s strategy for the remaining operators is driven by legal reality – which experts say could be helpful given how fragmented rail in Great Britain has become.“You can’t do it in one go,” said Marcus Mayers, the managing director of the Rail and Station Innovation Company. “If you try to merge 22 companies in one go – you don’t have the ability to build the system, to join it together that quickly.“So you build an operation which is capable of ingesting organisations, and is capable of ingesting organisations at the rate of one every three months. That makes sense.”Will nationalisation improve the railways?The prime minister, Keir Starmer, has previously said his government would not be nationalising rail out of ideology but because of what it could deliver for passengers.“We’ve tried privatisation for two or three decades and it’s a complete mess,” the Labour leadersaid in April 2024. “Everybody who travels on the trains has been affected by the cancellations and delay.”Privatisation was undertaken by the Conservatives in the 1990s, after decades of falling ridership under the nationalised British Rail.From 1948 onwards the annual number of journeys on Britain’s rail network fell consistently, from a peak of more than 1 billion a year in 1950 to a low of 0.6 billion in 1982.After privatisation, rail journeys recovered significantly, reaching a new peak of 1.7 billion by 2017.Chart showing passenger journeys on Britain’s rail network between 1945 to 2025“Privatisation sparked a railway renaissance,”saidPatrick McLoughlin, the transport secretary under David Cameron, in a speech in 2013.However, the impact on other aspects of train travel has been more mixed.One of the original selling points of privatisation was that competitionfor franchises would bring better value for the taxpayer.While the industry remained subsidised overall, some major commuter franchises went on to pay a return.Yet in the past few years, after huge falls in passenger numbers during the coronavirus pandemic, the amount the government pays to operators in public subsidy has ballooned to record levels.“The government is still forking out £12bn on operational subsidy, plus HS2 is another £7bn, plus extracurricular investment projects on the existing railways,” Glaister said.“That’s a very great deal of money in the context of the public expenditure crisis.”Costs have risen for passengers, too.Rail fareshave become less affordable since privatisation, rising faster than average earnings in the same period.Today it costs about £8.90 to take a 50km (31-mile) journey by rail, based on how much revenue rail operators collect for each kilometre travelled on their network.When adjusting for inflation, that same journey would have cost £7.54 in 1994.Chart showing how rail fares have increased relative to wages since privatisation in 1995The rising cost of rail comes amid widespread dissatisfaction with the reliability of Great Britain’s trains.Last year was the worst year for cancellations nationally since 2015,according to statistics produced by the Office of Rail and Road.Labour has pledged to improve reliability and affordability with nationalisation, banking on a unified Great British Railways to end what critics see as an overly fragmented system.“It’s possible, because there’s efficiencies of integration of track and train, which might mean that problems get solved more quickly,” Mayers said.“You may be taking out the commercial imperative to drive reliability, but you’ve also got more collaboration about how to achieve it. So it’s a fine balance, and whether it will work or not is still open for debate.”Others are sceptical of how much more efficiency can be wrung out of the system.“Governments frequently say: ‘Oh, we’ll make the railways more efficient, we’ll buy lots of new equipment, we’ll employ less people to do the work,’” Glaister said.“But the industry has been trying to do that for years and years, and the regulators screw that down to the absolute bottom in their settlements. And I don’t think there’s a lot of, as it were, undiscovered efficiencies to go for.”A DfT spokesperson said: “Through public ownership and the creation of Great British Railways, the government is fundamentally reforming how our railways are run, putting passengers first.“Public ownership will deliver a railway that is more accountable, efficient, and reliable – resulting in greater opportunities for communities and significant growth.“It is not a silver bullet, and issues inherited from private sector ownership will take time to root out, but we expect public sector operators – and Great British Railways once it is established – to focus relentlessly on improving reliability, punctuality and other aspects of the service that matter most to passengers, and we will hold them to account for doing so.”Response from operatorsAll 16 rail operators were contacted for comment for this pieceMark Ilderton,ScotRailService Delivery Director, said: “ScotRail operates more than 2,100 services across the country every day, with around nine out of ten of those services meeting the punctuality target, getting customers to where they need to be.“We are absolutely committed to delivering the best possible service for customers throughout the country, and everyone at ScotRail is working hard to deliver the safe and reliable railway that our customers expect and deserve, and to encourage more people to travel by train instead of using the car.”Show more"

Live footage of their release and their family reunions was broadcast on large screens around the square. The plaza has been the centre of the national campaign for their release since 250 Israelis were abducted on 7 October 2023 in the surprise Hamas attack on southern Israeli communities that killed 1,200 people and ignited the conflict.The bodies of four hostages held in Gaza and handed over to the Red Cross byHamason Monday were brought back to Israel, the army said.View image in fullscreenThe Israeli hostages arrive at Tel HaShomer hospital in Ramat Gan.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesA large crowd also massed in the southern Gazan city of Khan Younis on Monday tocelebrate the returnof nearly 1,700 Palestinians detained over the course of the war, while in the West Bank capital of Ramallah people welcomed the arrival of 88 Palestinian detainees who had been serving life sentences imposed by Israeli courts. At least one had been imprisoned for 24 years. About 160 more were deported through Egypt after their release.The Public Committee Against Torture in Israel said almost all Palestinian detainees had been held without trial as “unlawful combatants”. It noted that there were 22 minors among those released, some of the 360 Palestinian minors held in Israeli custody.The ceasefire appeared to be holding inGazaon Monday after a two-year Israeli military onslaught that has killed nearly 68,000 people. But 2.1 million surviving Palestinians there still face a deep and complex humanitarian crisis in a sealed coastal strip where the overwhelming majority of homes have been destroyed or severely damaged, and which has been starved of humanitarian supplies for many months.Tom Fletcher, the head of the UN’s humanitarian relief branch, OCHA, said aid deliveries had begun arriving in Gaza, with far more poised to enter in the coming days. “Millions of Palestinians counting on life-saving aid getting through at scale. We must make it happen,” Fletcher said while attending the peace summit at Sharm el-Sheikh.Trump, who brokered the ceasefire last week, arrived in the Red Sea resort after a short visit to Israel. He declared “a new day is rising” and signed a joint declaration with the leaders ofEgypt, Qatar and Turkey, intended to turn the ceasefire into a coherent peace plan.2:16Trump hails end of 'age of terror' and 'historic dawn' of a new Middle East – videoThe last Gaza ceasefire broke down after two months in March when Israel resumed its offensive. There are fears in the region that this truce may also prove precarious, especially given the resistance from the far-right wing of the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition.Trump insisted his 20-point proposal for maintaining peace and rebuilding Gaza would take root. “The document sets out a whole series of rules and regulations and is very comprehensive,” the US president said.The contents of the declaration signed in Sharm el-Sheikh were not immediately made public and the aspirations expressed in Trump’s 20 points, involving the disarming of Hamas and the deployment of a stabilisation force under a technocratic Palestinian committee overseen by a “peace board” chaired by the US president, present an extremely challenging task.The “summit for peace” was a virtual who’s who of Middle Eastern and European politics, while attracting other unlikely power brokers in the Trump era of international diplomacy such as the president of Fifa, Gianni Infantino. Leaders from at least 27 countries, many in Europe and the Middle East, joined the summit in Sharm el-Sheikh on Monday.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump speaks alongside Egypt’s president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, at the summit in Sharm el-Sheikh.Photograph: Evan Vucci/APThe leaders of the major Arab and regional states, including Sisi, Turkey’sRecep Tayyip Erdoğan, and the leaders of the Gulf states Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, were present. Keir Starmer and European leaders from France, Germany, Italy and Hungary also attended.However, representatives from Israel or Hamas were absent from the signing ceremony. A last-minute plan by Trump to invite Netanyahu was scuppered after Erdoğan said he would not land his plane if the Israeli prime minister attended.In Sharm el-Sheikh, Trump said he had been watching videos of the Israeli hostages being reunited with their families. “The level of love and sorrow, I’ve never seen anything like it. It’s amazing. They haven’t seen their loved ones in such a long time,” he said. “In one sense, it’s so horrible that this could take place. In another, it’s so beautiful to see a new and beautiful day is rising.”Beyond the welcoming crowd in Khan Younis, the response across Gaza to the mass detainee release was muted by the desperate circumstances and the nervousness over whether the ceasefire would stick. It was unclear how many of those freed on Monday were militants from Hamas or other armed groups, and how many had simply been swept up by Israeli forces.Some returned to meet new children born during their captivity. Others came back to find their relatives had been killed in a conflict that has seen a historically high rate of civilian casualties among Palestinians. AUN human rights commissionhas assessed Israel’s actions constitute genocide.View image in fullscreenPalestinians released by Israel arrive at Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, Gaza.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesHaitham Salem, one of the detainees freed on Monday, discovered on his release that his wife and children had been killed and he was the sole survivor of his immediate family.

It has been reported that, under the ceasefire agreement, Israel will open five crossings into Gaza, including one leading from Egypt. Only one crossing, at Kerem Shalom between Gaza and Israel, has been open for aid deliveries throughout much of the conflict.“With easing of movement and access restrictions in multiple areas, we were able to pre-position medical and emergency supplies to where they are needed most, assess key roads for explosive hazards, and support displaced families in flood-prone areas,” Fletcher said, adding that Israel had given security clearance for 190,000 metric tons of humanitarian supplies to enter Gaza, including food, tent components, medicine and other essentials.Additional reporting byAndrew Rothin WashingtonExplore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestineMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelDonald TrumpAbdel Fatah al-SisinewsShareReuse this content"

Now it’s time to translate those victories against terrorists on the battlefield into the ultimate prize of peace and prosperity for the entire Middle East.”Repeatedly insisting that Israel’s military victory was complete, Trump’s remarks were intended as a reassurance to Arab states that he would neither allow Israel to reopen the conflict withHamasnor permit Hamas to re-establish itself inside Gaza.Trump then flew to Egypt to take the message of optimism to a summit of more than 20 world leaders dedicated to endorsing his peace plan, the rebuilding ofGazaand a limited form of Palestinian self-rule. The guarantors of the peace agreement – the US, Turkey, Qatar and Egypt – also signed a comprehensive document setting out their responsibilities in ensuring peace, and an eventual path to Palestinian self-rule.The summit was jointly hosted by Trump and the Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh. At the opening of the summit, Trump told reporters that phase two of his Gaza plan, concerning the reconstruction of the strip, was already under way. He told reporters: “Phase two has already started. The phases are all a little bit mixed in with each other. You can start cleaning up. You look at Gaza, it’s a lot of clean-up.”The US is already asking wealthy Arab states to commit large sums to Gaza, a place he described as “debris times 10”. Estimates for the reconstruction costs have reached more than $30bn.A confident Trump predicted: “Gaza will be demobilised, Hamas will be disarmed, and Israel’s security will no longer be threatened.”The US president also sent out a thinly coded message that Israel had been losing public support due to its reliance on force. He said: “There was getting to be a period of time over the last few months when the world wanted peace and Israel wanted peace. If you had gone on for another three or four more years, keeping fighting, fighting, fighting, it was getting bad, it was getting heated. So the timing of this is brilliant. I said: ‘Bibi [referring to the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu], you will be remembered for this far more than if you kept the thing going, going – kill, kill, kill.’”Trump also indicated he was going to put pressure on Arab states to sign the Abraham accords “quickly and without games”. The accords require Arab states to recognise Israel. Iran, he insisted, was also ready for peace.European diplomats are privately warning that the speed of the ceasefire means plans for an international stabilisation force and a Palestinian civil police force need to be accelerated if proposals for Hamas to be disarmed are to bear fruit. Hamas, which has governed Gaza alone since 2007, has said it is willing not to be part of the new technocratic government of Gaza, but has insisted it will only disarm on certain conditions to a Palestinian-led force.Israel has said it will not withdraw the Israel Defense Forces further from its current positions inside Gaza so long as Gaza’s network of tunnels and guns remain under the control of Hamas.France, the US and the UK have said they are willing to act as backstops to the international force, but it is recognised that the force’s credibility stems from troops coming from Muslim countries such as Indonesia and Turkey, two countries that attended the summit. France is also pressing for the force to be given a UN mandate, similar to that of the UN force in Lebanon.A separate Palestinian National Authority civilian police force has also been trained, mainly in Egypt and Jordan, to enter Gaza, but French diplomatic sources said that, unless it is deployed rapidly, it risks finding itself in conflict with a resurgent Hamas. Neither Hamas nor Netanyahu attended the summit.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He added that he wanted Sisi to sit on the board, but said he was testing opinion in the region to see if there was support for Sir Tony Blair to be on it as well.Trump, for the first time in eight years, met with the Palestinian National Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, shaking his hand and giving a thumbs up sign. Only a fortnight ago, Trump had banned Abbas from New York and the UN general assembly.The French president, EmmanuelMacron, one of the politicians most involved in keeping the two-state solution alive, said on arriving in Egypt that Abbas’s attendance “was a very good signal … It’s a recognition of the role the Palestinian Authority has to play as a legitimate entity”.“On the questions of governance, we will have a particular role to be by the side of the Palestinian Authority and to ensure it plays its part, and also that it conducts reforms for the day after.” The authority has promised to hold presidential and parliamentary elections within a year.Macron also called for the position of the West Bank, which is the subject of accelerated settlements by Israel, not to be forgotten and for continuing efforts to create a formal Palestinian state alongside Israel.We must “make the connection between Gaza and the West Bank” and “ensure that there is a path to two states, the only political perspective that truly allows for lasting peace,” he said. On the security front, Macron indicated that the Europeans would “step up” the training of Palestinian police officers in Gaza, but that France would not participate directly in the stabilisation force that is to be put in place.There is a “consensus” to have “especially regional forces and perhaps contributions from certain countries like Indonesia,” he said. These countries, however, are asking that this be done within an “international framework” – that is, at the UN. France will also co-organise a conference on humanitarian aid to Gaza with Egypt, which it will host “in the coming weeks,” Macron also specified.Explore more on these topicsIsraelHamasDonald TrumpGazaPalestineMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Like so many sunflowers, their faces turned up to search the clear blue morning sky for the source of the sound. Then it swept into view from the west, from the direction ofGaza.A helicopter, military brown, was on the way to Ichilov hospital a few hundred metres away. But it diverted. It circled around the crowd giving each person below a view, and then tilted to its right, in an apparent salute to the cheering, waving, smiling faces below.At the door of the helicopter, the keen-eyed will have seen the outline of a figure almost hanging out, seemingly straining to get closer to the jubilant crowd below.It appeared to be one of thefinal 20 live hostages released that morningafter two years in Hamas captivity. He used his hands to make a shape: a heart.Who are the final 20 living hostages to have been freed from Gaza?Read moreAbout eight helicopters in all swept by, not all of them diverting to put on a show. Some medical cases may have been more urgent than others.But each received a raucous cheer on what was certainly a highly emotional day forIsrael, and one that so many dearly hope will prove to be historic.The square, nothing much to look at, on top of a car park close to the Israel Defense Forces headquarters, has been where the campaign to bring the hostages home has been led. The question now facing Israel is whether the release can lead to a lasting peace withPalestine.“I always say that I hope so, you know, but this neighbourhood is not so much friendly,” said Ayelet Lantzer, 63. “I grew up in kibbutz Nir Oz, and was born there before the ’67 war. There were days that we used to go to Gaza to eat hummus, and we went to the beach and we went to restaurants, and we had a very good relationship with the people there.”Nir Oz, less than 4 miles(7km) from Gaza, was where Hamas took seven of the hostages on 7 October. Six of them came home alive on Monday as part of Donald Trump’s 20-point Gaza plan. The seventh, Aryeh Zalmanowitz, 85, died in captivity.View image in fullscreenReleased Israeli hostages were brought to Beilinson hospital in Israel by helicopter.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesSince the first week of the war, Lantzer had organised for a permanent encampment on the square, a white tent with a few chairs and lots of posters, as part of an attempt to keep pressure on the Israeli government to prioritise the release of those taken.She had seen no such effort on the part of Israeli prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, she said – a common refrain. But this last hostage release did seemingly close a horrifying chapter, she suggested.About 1,200 people were killed on 7 October when Hamas launched their attacks and took 251 hostages. An estimated 67,000 Palestinians have been killed in the Gaza Strip since Israel launched its military response, the majority of whom were civilians, leading aUN commission to find Israel had committed genocide in Gaza.But what next? Few on the square on Monday had any answers, but the US president was insistingthe war was over– and certainly the overwhelming sentiment was relief.Released Israeli hostages reunite with families – in picturesRead moreThat was certainly the feeling at 7.15am when Hamas issued its first statement of the day. It was the names of the 20 people it intended to release into the hands of the Red Cross. The first real proof for some that their beloved would return alive.Images on two big screens on two sides of the square allowed the thousands assembling to see the reaction of the families at Re’im military base near Gaza where they were waiting to be reunited with the lost and now found. The hugs and tears on the screen were echoed in the square.This release was being chronicled in real time by Israeli broadcasters – and more extraordinary scenes were to follow.There was word shortly after 8am that seven hostages had been released into the hands of the Red Cross. Then footage appeared on the large screens of jubilant parents receiving video calls from hostages not even among that first tranche. Hamas had apparently allowed them to make calls.Julie Kupershtein, the mother of hostage Bar Kupershtein, who was working atthe Nova music festivalas a paramedic on 7 October when he was taken, said: “We were in the compound, and suddenly I had a conversation, suddenly I saw Bar. I screamed to the sky. Crazy. To see them, these pure, righteous children, alive. I’m shaking all over.”View image in fullscreenReleased hostage makes a heart with his hands as he arrives over ‘hostages square’.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesFurther images emerged of pale smiling men. The first seven were with the army, it was announced from the stage on the square.There were energetic renditions of “Habayta” (“Home”) – a song that has become the anthem of the hostage crisis.Then it was Trump’s perfectly scripted moment.The large screen was split between images of the US president stepping on to Israeli soil from Air Force One and images of further released men, dark around the eyes, but looking reasonably physically fit.“Trump did everything,” said Jude Frajdenrajch, 55, who had visited the square every Saturday since the war began as word of the release of the final 13 emerged.There were chants of the US president’s name and one woman held aloft a placard carrying the words: “Trump’s list”, a seeming nod to the famous Schindler’s list that saved Jews during the Holocaust.1:27‘You are coming home’: surviving Israeli hostages freed after two years in Gaza – video reportAnother piece of the deal was Israeli ministers’ approval of the release of 1,718Palestinian prisonersand detainees, including 250 terrorism convicts serving one or more life sentences.At lunchtime Palestinian media outlets published footage showing the arrival of some of them in Ramallah in the West Bank. All seemed to be going to plan – and then a problem.Hamas had been due to release the bodies of 28 killed Israeli hostages. But they only appeared able to provide four of them.It was suggested that the carnage in Gaza had left them unable to locate the buried. It was fodder for the hardline within Netanyahu’s Likud party.“Hamas’s announcement of the expected return of four bodies today constitutes a failure to meet its commitments,” said defence minister Israel Katz, adding that “any delay or deliberate avoidance will be considered a blatant violation of the agreement and will be met accordingly”.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump speaking at the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, on Monday.Photograph: Saul Loeb/APThe families of the deceased were also understandably distraught. “From the people of Israel I ask – please, do not forget us,” said Yael Adar, the mother of Tamir Adar, 38, whose body was taken from the Nir Oz kibbutz on 7 October. “Take action, demand [their return]. We need you more than ever. The struggle is not over until the last captive returns. It is absolutely forbidden to accept the violation of the agreement.”This was not something that the Americans were going to let upset Trump’s perfect day. On his arrival at the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, where he was due to give a speech, Trump wrote a message in the guest book: “This is my great honour – a great and beautiful day. A new beginning.”After a lengthy speech from Netanyahu in which he criticised the rest of the world for failing to stand by Israel and inevitably heaped praise on Trump, it was time for the US president to speak. And did he speak.He was cheered roundly as he stood in the parliament and outside on the square, and many laughed with him as he began his typically eccentric address. “Nice place,” Trump told the members of parliament. Was he considering a new real estate deal? “The long and painful nightmare is finally over,” he added.The attention of the crowd in the square nevertheless appeared to drift off as Trump meandered into various rabbit holes including criticising Joe Biden, praising a top donor, Miriam Adelson, and making the familiar claim that the Ukraine war “would never have happened if I had been president”. He also urged the Knesset to give Netanyahu a pardon over the corruption charges he is facing.View image in fullscreenCrowds cheer Donald Trump’s speech.Photograph: Chris McGrath/Getty ImagesTrump invited Netanyahu to join him at a peace conference in Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt. The Israeli prime minister declined the offer due to it being a holiday period. There is also an international criminal court warrant for his arrest, and it was reported that the Turkish president,Recep Tayyip Erdoğan,threatened to boycott the summitif Netanyahu attended.A powerfully emotional day then but perhaps one that also offers some signs of the deal’s vulnerability to the character flaws of leading figures.Shirley Bar Natahan, 44, had tears in her eyes on the square as she watched images of hostages being reunited with their children, wives and mothers. She had been here every Saturday for two years. This was a very good day for all the pitfalls, she said.“There’s nothing more important than this,” she said. “I think that if we, if this, didn’t happen, I feel like Israel would not have the right to exist. This is why we exist so the Jews can have a safe place to bring everybody home.”Explore more on these topicsIsraelGazaIsrael-Gaza warPalestineMiddle East and north AfricaDonald TrumpBenjamin NetanyahufeaturesShareReuse this content"

As soon as they saw the Palestinian prisoners and detainees through the windows of the bus, hundreds of people gathering in front of a theatre in Ramallah in the occupiedWest Bankrushed forward, chanting the names of loved ones they had not seen for years or, in some cases, decades.Their faces were gaunt, the sharp angles decorated by freshly scabbed-over wounds. Loved ones hoisted them up on their shoulders with ease. One, swaddled in a Palestinian keffiyeh and splaying his fingers into a V for victory, was dropped before his mother, whose feet he began to kiss.View image in fullscreenThe freed prisoners disembark upon arrival at Ramallah Cultural Centre in the occupied West Bank.Photograph: Zain Jaafar/AFP/Getty ImagesIn total, 88 Palestinians were released from Israeli prisons and sent to the occupied West Bank on Monday – the other nearly 2,000, a number that includes about 1,700 Palestinians seized fromGazaduring the war and held without charge, were sent back to Gaza, where a minority would travel on to neighbouring countries.The prisoners and detainees were released by Israel a few hours after all living Israeli hostages were returned from Gaza. The exchange marked thefirst step in a ceasefirethat could permanently end the two-year conflict in the territory.Before Monday’s release, 11,056 Palestinians were held in Israeli prisons, according to statistics from the Israeli NGO HaMoked in October 2025. At least 3,500 of those were held in administrative detention without trial. An Israeli military database has indicated that only a quarter of those detained in Gazawere classified as fighters.View image in fullscreenJubilation mixed with relief as family members arrived to greet their loved ones.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesThe political implication of the release was far from families’ minds in Ramallah on Monday; most were celebrating a day they never thought would come.Most of the men returning to the West Bank were serving life sentences and many were charged with violent crimes including murder and deadly attacks against Israelis.“He’s been locked up for 24 years,” said a relative of Saber Masalma, a member of Fatah, the main faction of thePalestineLiberation Organization. Masalma was arrested in 2002 and sentenced to life in prison on charges of conspiracy to cause death and placing explosive charges.He shoved a phone in Masalma’s face, eager to introduce him to his adult niece over a video call, while he juggled requests for selfies with his relatives.He had not seen Masalma for two years, as Israel had restricted family visits after the 7 October attack by Hamas-led militants who killed about 1,200 people and took 251 hostages. Masalma had warned him over the phone that he might not recognise him owing to the amount of weight he had lost in prison.“He looks like a dead body. But we will bring him back to life,” he said, laughing. They were off to a restaurant, where they would have to be careful that Masalma did not eat too much, as his stomach was not used to much food after not eating well in prison.View image in fullscreenThe emotional reunions were heightened by the fact prison visits were suspended by Israel after the 7 October 2023 attack.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesThe others also looked to be in bad shape. Their cheekbones jutted out, with some bearing the marks of recent beatings and a few unable to walk without being propped up by their relatives.When asked about their treatment in the prisons, a prisoner apologised and said he could not answer, for fear that he would face repercussions from Israeli authorities, only saying that it was “horrible”.Another said that the conditions were “very, very, very difficult,” and that the last two years in prison were the “worst two years of his life”, asking that he not be named.Palestinians have faced abuse and inhumane treatment in Israeli prisons “as a matter of policy” according to the Israeli human rights organisation B’Tselem. The group alleges that Palestinian detainees are denied medical treatment, adequate food and face physical abuse in Israeli prisons.View image in fullscreenRecently released prisoners described poor treatment within Israel’s jails.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesActivists have long said that wide-scale imprisonment of Palestinians is used as a tool to enforce Israel’s occupation of the Palestinian territories, with statistics estimating up to 40% of Palestinians have been arrested at some point.Israel says its prison system complies with international law.Israel also forbade people from celebrating the release on Monday, firing teargas at family members and journalists waiting near Ofer prison in the occupied West Bank, where detainees were kept. A flyer distributed by the Israeli military warned people that “we are surveilling you everywhere” and threatening that if they supported “terrorist organisations” they could be arrested.Six different relatives of prisoners all said they had been visited by Israeli security services in recent days.“They came to warn us not to hold celebrations, not to raise flags or banners, not to gather in the diwan [hall]. These days, the hardest thing is to speak the truth,” said a relative of the prisoner Hani al-Zeer, who asked not to be identified by name out of fear of security repercussions. Zeer had been imprisoned for 23 years, and the relative, as well as Zeer’s son, had also been imprisoned several times.View image in fullscreenMany of the prisoners had been behind bars for years, and in some cases decades.Photograph: Haitham Imad/EPAAmid the scenes of joy, there was also sorrow. Several families who had been told by the Israeli security services that their family members would be returning home were surprised to see that they were not on the buses on Monday.Two different prisoner lists were circulating in the hours before the releases. On one list, some were slated to be released back home, on the other, detainees and prisoners were to be deported to Gaza.To Umm Abed, whose brother had been scheduled for release, the sudden possibility that her brother, Kamal Imran, could be deported to Gaza, came as a shock. If he was deported to Gaza, there was virtually no way for her to see him unless he was able to leave the territory.Hamas deploys armed fighters and police across parts of GazaRead more“We’ve been waiting here for his release for two days. We’re shocked to hear this. The Israelis stormed our house and told us we were forbidden from doing any kind of celebration – so he should be released,” said Umm Abed, tears in her eyes.She waited anxiously as the buses arrived to the drop-off point in Ramallah, waiting for her brother to emerge. When the last man got off the buses with no sign of her brother, she clutched her cheeks and wailed.Others evidently had been told their loved ones were to be returned home, only to find out at the last minute that they were being deported. “Why are they deporting him?” a woman screamed in tears, as police officers rushed her away from the crowd.“It would have been easier if they just told us from the beginning. We don’t know where he is. Egypt? Gaza? We are devastated,” said Raed Imran, as he led Umm Abed to the car where she had been preparing to receive her brother.Explore more on these topicsWest BankGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestineIsrael-Gaza warfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He said that without it the case “could not succeed”.There have been accusations that the government deliberately declined to provide this evidence for fear of damaging trade relations with China, and claims that Powell was behind the decision.Downing Street insisted on Monday it was “entirely false” to suggest that the government was responsible for the collapse of the trial. The prime minister’s spokesperson said the “decision to drop the case was entirely a matter for the CPS” and that there had been “no role for any member of this government, no minister or special adviser” in making it.The aide, the associate, the ‘Chinese agent’ – and the collapse of a long-awaited UK spy trialRead moreMinisters appeared to harden their line towards China on Monday, with Jarvis, the Foreign Office minister Hamish Falconer and the Cabinet Office spokesperson in the Lords Ruth Anderson all saying the country posed a series of national security threats to the UK including through cyber-attacks and the transnational repression of Hongkongers.The Conservatives wrote to Parkinson on Monday night to ask whether the prosecution could be restarted if ministers now provided the evidence requested.Lindsay Hoyle, the Commons speaker, told MPs he was “angry and disappointed” that parliament was not receiving robust enough protection against foreign espionage.NewMI5guidance has been published warning politicians in the UK that they are “a target of long-term strategic foreign interference and espionage from elements of the Russian, Chinese and Iranian states”.The intelligence service warned that foreign agents operated by posing as diplomats, journalists, academics and lobbyists and employed techniques including blackmail and financial donations.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsEspionageChinaKeir StarmerJonathan PowellMI5Crown Prosecution ServicenewsShareReuse this content"

Robinson told police he was white English but was travelling on an Irish passport he had recently obtained and that he lived in Spain.Police were suspicious of his “vague replies” to questions and requested access to his iPhone under schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act, which allows for the stopping of anyone passing through a UK port to “determine whether they may be involved or concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism”.Robinson, who denies failing to comply with the counter-terrorism powers, said in video recorded before he entered court: “Thankfully, I haven’t had to beg for donations today because Elon Musk has picked up the legal bill for this absolute state persecution.”Musk has been contacted to confirm whether he is covering the bill.The X and Tesla boss has emerged as an ally of Robinson and recently appeared on a live video link at a far-right rally organised in London by Robinson, where Musk told the crowd: “Whether you choose violence or not, violence is coming to you.”Opening the case, the prosecutor Jo Morris said officers “became concerned” about the activist’s demeanour after he drove alone into the police inspection area. He had been recognised by police at an early stage and was restrained when he tried to start filming them and recorded a message that he was being detained, she said.When he was asked to hand over the phone’s pin, Robinson was said to have replied: “Not a chance, bruv … You look like cunts so you ain’t having it.”He told police at the tunnel and said in a later interview at Folkestone police station that his phone contained information about “vulnerable girls” whom he had spoken to during what he described as his journalistic reporting on grooming gangs.PC Mitchell Thorogood, a counter-terrorism officer who was in the booth when Robinson arrived at Folkestone, told the court that the Bentley Bentayga SUV – prices for which start at £170,000 – had attracted their attention. It was also a last-minute booking and “unusual” for someone to take a long trip in someone else’s carAsked by Robinson’s barrister, Alisdair Williamson KC: “Do terrorists drive in high-value, high-visibility vehicles?” he replied that terrorists could drive “any type of vehicle”.The lawyer, who said that the activist “frequently” travels to Benidorm later suggested that stop may have been “discriminatory” against Robinson’s political beliefs.Sgt Farmer, who carried out an initial consideration of the decision to stop Robinson under counter-terrorism powers, told the court that the activist’s involvement in the English Defence League (EDL) and the “emerging threat level” from the far right had also been cited as a factor.Under questioning, Farmer said he had experience as a public order officer policing demonstrations by the EDL. He said he was aware it had disbanded in 2014 but said there was still a concern over far-right ideology “in terms of perceived Islamophobia”.Earlier, District Judge Sam Goozee gave an instruction that Robinson’s address should not be published, after Williamson said there were “credible threats” against the activist’s life. The trial, which is expected to take two days, was adjourned until Tuesday.Explore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

He said the attack didn’t cause any lasting injury.Farage said he was “deeply upset” about the incident and “the words used against him echo the prime minister’s disgraceful attack on Reform during Labour conference week and wholly irresponsible comments from the leader of the Green party”.In a post on X, Reform’s head of policy, Zia Yusuf, also wrote: “Reform’s council leader George Finch has been assaulted in the street. The assailant shouted “fascist, racist” – exactly the language used by the prime minister and the leader of the Green party. They know exactly what they’re doing.”This comes after Farage accused the prime minister of inciting violence against him during his speech at the Labour party conference. During the speech,Starmer told delegatesthat the Reform leader “doesn’t like Britain” and “doesn’t believe in Britain”.In response, Farage said the prime minister had incited the “radical left” against him and accused Starmer of threatening the safety of Reform officials.In response to the incident, and the claims by Farage, a Labour spokesperson said: “Violence, harassment or intimidation is completely unacceptable and has no place in our politics or society.“Any such incidents must be thoroughly investigated and the perpetrators must be brought to justice.”Reform UK abandoning manifesto pledge of £90bn in tax cuts, deputy leader admitsRead moreA Green party spokesperson said: “There is no place for violence or intimidation in politics and using the disgraceful attack of a councillor to score cheap points is distasteful.“The Green party is committed to offering a message of hope to counter those looking to fuel division and hatred.

The bank said almost half of consumers in a survey of 2,000 individuals were making changes to their personal finances in anticipation of Reeves’s26 November budget, with one in three building a savings buffer.What price loyalty? UK supermarket cards ratedRead moreHelen Dickinson, the chief executive of the BRC, said the looming budget had affected spending alongside milder weather, while growth in the value of food sales was mostly down to rising grocery prices.“Rising inflation and a potentially taxing budget are weighing on the minds of many households planning their Christmas spending,” she said.The BRC said UK total retail sales increased by 2.3% year on year in September, compared with a growth rate of 3.1% the previous month. That was below the latest Office for National Statistics reading for inflation across the board,August’s 3.8% annual rate.Food sales increased by a stronger 4.3% year on year, albeit asgrocery inflation acceleratesamid a fresh squeeze on living standards.Non-food spending rose by 0.7% year on year, below a 12-month average of 0.9%, as milder temperatures across the UK deterred shoppers from refreshing their autumn and winter wardrobes. Sales were propped up by spending on electrical goods, after the launch ofApple’s latest iPhoneandsmartwatch.Linda Ellett, the UK head of consumer, retail and leisure at the accountancy firm KPMG said non-food sales were growing by a meagre 1.2% on average. “Spending continues to be very targeted as consumers remain cautious,” she said.Reeves is widely expected to raise taxes in her autumn budget. However, business leaders have warned higher costs for companies would be passed on to consumers in the form of price rises, hurting household finances and the economy at large.In an intervention published late on Tuesday, the British Chambers of Commerce called on the chancellor to rule out business tax increases because companies had been left drained by higher levies she introduced in last year’s autumn budget.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They cannot plan ahead as they expect further tax demands to be laid at their feet.”The 0.7% annual decline in consumer card spending recorded by Barclays in September, came after 0.5% year-on-year growth in August. Essential spending fell 2.6%, while growth in discretionary spending slowed to 0.2%.Despite growing concerns over the chancellor’s budget, the bank said consumer confidence in households’ ability to live within their means had reached a four-year high of 78%, while confidence in personal finances remained resilient.However, it warned households remained cautious amid the prospect of higher inflation, tax increases and broader economic uncertainty.Karen Johnson, the head of retail at Barclays, said: “We’re continuing to see cautious spending, and shoppers are consistently seeking out areas they can cut back on. However, multiple retail categories have proved to be resilient in recent months, with furniture, clothing and beauty all remaining in growth since February of this year.”Explore more on these topicsRetail industryEconomicsRachel ReevesnewsShareReuse this content"

It seems that for our cognitive health too it is never too late to quit, she added.Bloomberg and her colleagues from UCL reached their conclusions by comparing the cognitive functioning of adults aged at least 40 in the 12 countries who quit with those who kept smoking. While their performance was the same at the start, the quitters had gained substantial advantages over the smokers when their cognitive capacities were assessed over the next six years.“Individuals who quit smoking had more favourable [cognitive] trajectories following smoking cessation than continuing smokers”, they write in The Lancet Healthy Longevity. “The rate of cognitive decline was slower for smokers who quit than for continuing smokers in the period after smoking cessation.“The results suggest the importance of smoking cessation, even in later life, for long-term cognitive health.”Although the findings do not prove cause and effect, they could provide “compelling motivation” for older smokers – who are less likely than younger age groups to try to give up – to do so, the authors added.Smoking is one of the 14 risk factors for dementia which a commission of experts assembled byThe Lancetmedical journal identified last year. There is growing evidence that tackling them, which include depression, drinking too much, hearing loss and high cholesterol, reduce the risk of developing dementia in the first place, they added.“The findings strengthen existing evidence that changing to a healthier lifestyle can have a measurable impact on your brain health,” said Dr Richard Oakley, the associate director of research and innovation at Alzheimer’s Society. “We know that quitting smoking, keeping physically active, eating a healthy balanced diet and drinking less alcohol can all help reduce the risk of dementia.”The paper explains that smoking is thought to contribute to neurodegeneration by both harming cardiovascular health, by affecting blood vessels that supply oxygen to the brain, and also by causing chronic inflammation and directly damaging brain cells through oxidative stress.However, Dr Julia Dudley, the head of research at Alzheimer’s Research UK, cautioned that “the greater cognitive decline seen in smokers doesn’t mean that these people will go on to develop dementia”. Differences between the two groups in their socioeconomic background or alcohol intake may have influenced the results, she said.Caroline Cerny, the deputy chief executive at Action onSmokingand Health (ASH), said: “We’ve known for some time that smoking increases the risk of dementia and cognitive decline, but this important evidence shows that the harms can be slowed by quitting.“It illustrates just why it is so important to stop smoking at any age, but particularly in middle age before many of the symptoms of cognitive decline will have emerged and highlights the need for sustained investment in stop smoking services.”Last month, 35% of smokers in England tried to quit and 29% of them succeeded, almost double the rate seen when records began in 2007.Explore more on these topicsDementiaSmokingAlzheimer'sHealthMental healthEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The rise is being driven by ransomware attacks, often by criminal actors seeking money, and society’s increasing dependence on technology which increases the number of hackable targets.The chancellor,Rachel Reeves, the security minister, Dan Jarvis, and the technology and business secretaries, Liz Kendall and Peter Kyle have written to the leaders of hundreds of the largest British companies urging them to make cyber-resilience a board-level responsibility and warning that hostile cyber-activity in the UK has grown “more intense, frequent and sophisticated”.“Don’t be an easy target,” said Anne Keast-Butler, the director of GCHQ. “Prioritise cyber risk management, embed it into your governance and lead from the top.”NCSC dealt with 429 cyber incidents in the year to September and nearly half were classed as of national significance – more than doubling in the past year. Eighteen were “highly significant”, which means they had a serious impact on the government, essential services, the mass population or the economy. Most of those were ransomware incidents, including the attacks that significantly affected Marks & Spencer and the Co-op Group.“Cybercrime is a serious threat to the security of our economy, businesses and people’s livelihoods,” said Jarvis. “While we work round the clock to counter threats and provide support to businesses of all sizes – we cannot do it alone.”The NCSC declined to comment on reports that one line of investigation into thecrippling attack on Jaguar Land Rover, which has halted manufacturing, is examining Russian involvement. It said Russia is inspiring informal “hacktivists” who are targeting the UK and the US, as well as European and Nato countries.View image in fullscreenLast month, passengers at a number of European airports, including London Heathrow, were disrupted by a cyber-attack.Photograph: Isabel Infantes/ReutersOverall, the number of attacks in the year to September represented the highest level of cyber threat activity recorded by the NCSC in nine years. Over the 12 month period, the UK and its allies uncovered a Russian military unit carrying out cyber-attacks for the first time, issued advice to counter a China-linked campaign targeting thousands of devices and raised the alarm over cyber-actors working for Iran, according to the NCSC. But the threat is also homegrown, and last week two 17-year-olds were arrested in Hertfordshire over the allegedransomware hack of children’s data from the Kido nursery chain.Hack of age verification firm may have exposed 70,000 Discord users’ ID photosRead moreHackers are also increasingly using artificial intelligence (AI) to sharpen their operations, and while the NCSC has yet to face an attack initiated by AI, it said: “AI will almost certainly pose cyber-resilience challenges to 2027 and beyond.”“We do see our attackers improving their ability to cause real impact, to inflict pain on the organisations they have breached and those who rely on them,” said Richard Horne, the NCSC’s chief executive. “They don’t care who they hit or how they hurt them. That is why we need all organisations to act.”He stressed the emotional impact of becoming a victim of cyber-attacks and said: “I’ve sat now in too many rooms with individuals who have been deeply affected by cyber-attacks against their organisations … I know the impact the disruption has on their staff, suppliers and customers, the worry, the sleepless nights.”Explore more on these topicsCybercrimeInternetGCHQRachel ReevesLiz KendallPeter KylenewsShareReuse this content"

In more than half of the cases reviewed, unsupervised overnight contact was ordered.“No child should be forced to spend time with an abusive parent or caregiver if the circumstances aren’t safe for them to do so,” Jacobs said. “But time and time again we see how the pro-contact culture and antiquated views on domestic abuse are contributing to decisions that put children in harm’s way.“It’s clear that domestic abuse can no longer be considered a side issue within the family justice system, but instead its everyday business that demands a rigorous response.”Academics from Loughborough University examined 298 files from three courts and observed nearly 100 court hearings. As well as discovering evidence of abuse in case files, the team also heard claims of abuse in 73% of observed hearings, the report said.Survivors repeatedly described how they were dissuaded from raising allegations of domestic abuse due to the suggestion that it would have “no impact” on whether the abusive parent would be granted contact. Others said they felt that pressure had been put on them to accept potentially unsafe child arrangement orders out of fear that, if they contested, an even worse outcome would be granted.Jacobs said survivors were being forced to navigate the complex system without representation. She urged the Ministry of Justice to commit to a rollout of the multi-service Pathfinder courts to resolve problems between parents sooner, and place more emphasis on hearing children’s voices.“The government must also provide the necessary investment to extend the pilot study, conducted by my office, to allow for rigorous oversight on the changes being made and ensure accountability from within the family court,” she added. “Tinkering around the edges will no longer suffice.”The report highlights how outdated views on domestic abuse among some legal professionals saw physical violence taken more seriously, while coercive and controlling behaviour – which often underpins physical abuse and is an offence in itself – was frequently dismissed.Areport by Women’s Aidthis summer detailed how 19 children had been killed over nine years by adults who had been allowed contact with them despite a history of violence.In March, MPs discussed the presumption of parental involvement, and heard from Claire Throssell, whose two sons, Jack and Paul, weremurdered by their abusive fatherin during court-ordered unsupervised contact.On Tuesday Catherine Roper, the chief constable of Wiltshire police, apologised after a staff member’s failure to properly undertake applications under Clare’s law – which allows people to find out whether a partner has a history of violence or domestic abuse – left women at risk of violence, including one who was the victim of attempted murder.Explore more on these topicsDomestic violencenewsShareReuse this content"

More than 91% of parcels valued at less than €150 came from China, where Temu and its fellow low-cost sellerSheinmake and dispatch most of their goods.However, controls began to be tightened in July this year, and customs duty is expected to be applied from 2028.The US this summerabolished its “de minimis” exemption, which allowed goods worth less than $800 to skip import duty, to limit the rise of Temu and Shein, while the UK chancellor has said she is reviewing a similar loophole.Paul Monaghan, the chief executive of the Fair Tax Foundation, estimates that Temu’s Irish entity facilitated consumer sales of $10bn in the EU – as its revenue figure only accounts for the company’s commission and fees from independent sellers on its marketplace.If Temu’s estimated $2bn in sales via its sellers are included in the UK, that would make the marketplace bigger than the UK retailer Next and about the same size as Primark.“Serious questions need to be asked as to why Temu has such a negligible economic and tax footprint in the UK and acrossEuropedespite its enormous sales,” Monaghan said.“What we have here is a chain of companies in a series of tax havens, that have been structured so as to leave little or no tax benefit in Europe.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Despite being a young and fast-growing company still in the investment phase, we have already paid billions of euros in taxes across European jurisdictions, and that figure will continue to rise as our operations mature.“The tax figure cited refers only to the tax paid by a single legal entity and does not include customs duties, VAT, and other taxes.“Temu entered the European market just two years ago and has invested heavily in building its platform to connect sellers and consumers more efficiently, passing those efficiencies back to consumers in the form of lower prices on quality goods. At the same time, we have been creating new growth opportunities for local sellers across Europe.“Our focus is on the long term: building a sustainable, compliant, and trusted platform that helps consumers access quality products at affordable prices while enabling local sellers across Europe to grow their businesses and reach new markets.”Explore more on these topicsRetail industryEuropean UnionEuropeChinanewsShareReuse this content"

He could still winLong Beach voters have a choice: re-elect the Republican incumbent or the Democrat who seemingly vanished at seaAssociated PressMon 13 Oct 2025 19.48 EDTShareA political candidate in theNew YorkCity suburbs went for a night swim in the Atlantic Ocean this past spring and never returned.Petros Krommidas’s phone, keys and clothes were found on the sands at Long Beach on Long Island. The 29-year-old former Ivy League rower, who was training for a triathlon, had parked his car just off the picturesque wooden boardwalk.As the months passed, localDemocratsattempted to field a replacement to run for the seat in the Nassau County legislature.But two Republican voters took them to court and won: a state judge recently ordered Krommidas’s name to remain on the November ballot, ruling that he’s still considered missing and not officially deceased.Now, as election day approaches, voters in Long Beach and other communities on the south shore of Long Island have a curious choice: re-elect the Republican incumbent or the Democrat who seemingly vanished at sea.James Hodge is among those calling on residents to cast their ballots for Krommidas regardless – hoping to trigger a special election in which Democrats can put forward another candidate to run against Republican lawmaker Patrick Mullaney.The Long Beach resident worked with Krommidas at the Nassau county board of elections and had been tapped by Democrats to run in his place.“We need to stand by and honor his name and memory,” Hodge told the Associated Press. “Let’s give him that victory. It’s the right thing to do.”The Republican voters argued in their lawsuit that Democrats couldn’t claim Krommidas was dead because authorities still considered him a missing person. They pointed to a New York state law that someone is presumed dead after being “absent for a continuous period of three years”.A county judge, Gary Knobel, agreed, writing in his ruling last month that “‘missing person’ status does not qualify as a vacancy that can be filled”.The judge noted a similar situation decades earlier in Alaska.Nicholas Begich Sr, a congressman, disappeared in a plane crash weeks before the 1972 election but still won. The Alaska Democrat was eventually declared dead, and his Republican opponent claimed the seat in a special election.In 2000, the Democratic governor of Missouri, Mel Carnahan, died in a plane crash while campaigning for a seat in the US Senate. Although Carnahan was trailing in the polls when he died, he made a political comeback after his death and narrowly defeated his Republican opponent, John Ashcroft. Carnahan’s widow, Jean, was appointed to serve in the Senate until a special election in 2022, which she lost.More recently, Dennis Hof, owner of the Nevada brothel featured on HBO’s Cathouse documentary series, died weeks before a 2018 election but still captured a seat in the state legislature.In 2020, North Dakota legislative candidate David Andahl died from Covid-19 the month before the election and still won. And in 2022, Pennsylvania state lawmaker Anthony DeLuca won reelection despite dying from lymphoma the month prior.Hodge and other Long Island Democrats argue that Republicans only sued to assure themselves victory as they seek to bolster their majority in the county legislature. They say the lawsuit has only prolonged the anguish for Krommidas’s family.“I understand politics, but there’s a time to stop and be a human being,” said Ellen Lederer-DeFrancesco, who met Krommidas through the local Democratic Pparty. “Petros is someone’s son, brother, friend.”The Nassau county Republican committee chairperson, Joseph Cairo Jr, in a statement, vowed the party and its candidates will “show the highest level of sensitivity during these challenging times for the Krommidas family”.Krommidas’s family declined to comment when reached by phone, but his mother and sister both called for residents to “honor and vote” for him in recent Facebook posts.“My Peter cared deeply about people and his community and continues to inspire kindness and unity in our community,” his mother, Maria, wrote.Eleni-Lemonia Krommidas, his sister, described him in her own post as a first-generation American who loved his country and “believed in equality, education, and the power of unity”.In the days after his disappearance, family and friends joined first responders in scouring Long Beach’s broad swath of sand, which is located just east of the New York City borough of Queens.View image in fullscreenA missing person flyer for Petros Krommidas on a telephone pole in Long Beach, New York, on Thursday.Photograph: Phillip Marcelo/APSome of the missing person fliers they put up with images of Krommidas’s youthful, smiling face are tattered and faded but still visible on telephone poles around Long Beach.Meanwhile campaign signs for Mullaney, his opponent, are prominently displayed on fences along the main thoroughfares and on tidy residential lawns. The Republican didn’t respond to emails seeking comment.Along the Long Beach boardwalk last week, longtime resident Maude Carione was dumbstruck at the choice facing voters in November.“It’s insane to leave his name on the ballot. You’ll confuse people,” said the 72-year-old Trump supporter, who didn’t have plans to vote in the upcoming local election. “In fairness, you have to give another candidate a chance for the Democrats. You have to.”For resident Regina Pecorella, the decision, while grim, was clear. “If it’s between those two, I’m voting for the person that’s alive,” said the 54-year old independent, who voted for a straight Republican ticket in the previous election. “I don’t know how else to answer that.”Guardian staff contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsNew YorkDemocratsUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Collapsed spying case remains bafflingDan SabbaghDefence and security editorLabour says Tory government at time failed to classify China as a threat, but plenty of evidence suggests the contraryMon 13 Oct 2025 14.51 EDTLast modified on Mon 13 Oct 2025 15.42 EDTShareThere is a baffling contradiction at the heart of the efforts of Dan Jarvis, the security minister, to explain why the prosecution of two Britons accused of spying forChinacollapsed last month. The problem, he insisted in front of MPs on Monday, was that “it was not the policy of a Conservative government to classify China as a threat to national security”.Except there is plenty of evidence to suggest that China was recognised as a threat by the previous governments in documents and public statements by ministers and officials. All this makes the failure of the government witness – Matthew Collins, the deputy national security adviser – to set this out in three separate witness statements given to the prosecution even more surprising.The context here is the ongoing fallout from the collapse of the prosecution of Christopher Cash, a parliamentary researcher, who was working for the Conservative MP Alicia Kearns at the time of his arrest, and his friend Christopher Berry, a researcher based in China. Bothwere accused of spying for Chinaunder the 1911 Official Secrets Act because the alleged offences took place between late 2021 and early 2023, when that law was still in force.The archaic legislation, now replaced by the National Security Act, required Collins – as the government witness – to label China as an enemy,redefined after a court casein July 2024 as a “current threat to national security”. But it seems he did not do so to the satisfaction of the Crown Prosecution Service, not just in his original witness statement of December 2023 but again in February and July 2025.The formal explanation continues to be it was this failure that led to the CPS abandoning its case, a month before a trial was due to start. Jarvis, so keen to distance ministers and the prime minister’s national security adviser, Jonathan Powell, from the embarrassing episode, insisted that the content of the all important evidence was a “matter for the deputy national security adviser”.Although Britain’s relationship with China will always be complex and cannot be reduced to a single word, as Jarvis tried to argue, the idea that Chinese actors were not threatening the UK between 2021 and 2023 is absurd. Kemi Badenoch, responding for the Conservatives, had plenty to aim at, starting with the same policy documents that the Labour minister had sought to offer in his defence.Jarvis cited Boris Johnson’s integrated review of defence and foreign policy published in March 2021, perhaps the best guide to the prevailing policy at the time of the alleged spying. The policy review described China as a “systemic challenge” but, as the Tory party leader was able to point out, also that it was the “biggest state-based threat to the UK’s economic security”.During this period, between August 2021 and October 2022, the Electoral Commission was hacked by Chinese actors, allowing the cyberattackers access to the electoral register of 40 million people. When the Conservatives formally attributed the hack to Chinese actors, Rishi Sunak, then the prime minister, said China was “thegreatest state-based challengeto our national security”.Against this backdrop it is unclear why Downing Street and Jarvis continue to focus on Conservative policy at the time of the alleged offences, when doing so continues to invite scepticism and further questions about whether pressure was discreetly applied on the civil servant to restrict his witness statements. There is no shortage of evidence that Labour, influenced by Powell, wants acloser relationshipwith China.An obvious solution would be to provide more information by releasing Collins’s three witness statements, redacting, if necessary, any unproven allegations against Cash and Berry. Jarvis did not rule this out on Monday, but said he could not release anything “which may still be used in any further ongoing legal processes”, with Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, still pressing for a private prosecution.This will need to be resolved. For now Labour has struggled to provide an explanation that will kill off suspicion that the government failed to supply prosecutors the information they needed to improve the climate with Beijing. If the collapse of the case really amounts to a muddle over semantics, seeing Collins’s evidence ought to help.Explore more on these topicsForeign policyChinanewsShareReuse this content"

Ron works for a company that builds shopping malls, and their latest one is the first for which Ron has been made project lead, despite some of his superiors’ misgivings. Today is his big day. He’s giving a speech at the launch!Ron is the creation of Tim Robinson, the former Saturday Night Live writer/performer who reinvented the American sketch show in 2019 withI Think You Should Leave. In a new half-hour, eight-episode series that starts as a workplace comedy before sprawling into mystery/thriller territory, his alter ego is a stock Robinson character, a variation on the textbook comic protagonist who has to bear the burden of being the only sane man in every room. Ron is genuinely beset by absurdity, misfortune and other people’s idiocy and selfishness, but always manages to react in a way that makes everyone around him conclude that he is the problem. Whereas Larry David in Curb Your Enthusiasm met the world’s small annoyances in a rational but insensitive manner, Ron combats them irrationally and too sensitively.The opening scene sets the tone: Ron is quite rightly vexed by a waitress crassly hovering over the family’s table while his wife, Barb (Lake Bell), is trying to raise a toast to him. But by the time Ron has finished speaking to the young woman, he has got into a ridiculous argument caused by his refusal to accept that she never shops in malls, and has too aggressively insisted on boxing up half a devilled egg to take home. Later on, in the silent middle of the night, a restless Ron raises his head, irritated by something else now: “I swear I have the worst pillow in town!”View image in fullscreenLike Larry David but way more irrational … Tim Robinson as Ron Trosper in The Chair Company.Photograph: HBO/WarnerRobinson’s followers will be able to hear him say that line in their heads, or the one where he overemotes at how nice the restaurant food looks: “This is ssssstunning!!” Countless amateur comedians on YouTube and TikTok have borrowed that manic, suddenly shouting intonation, but without nailing character details as carefully as Robinson does. Everything his fans would expect in a leading man is present as Ron, hunched and forever hyperventilating, prowls from one embarrassment to another in his crap suit, squinting through unflattering glasses, fingermarked and askew.Of course, Ron’s big presentation goes haywire, via a moment of roaringly well-executed slapstick that causes our friend to embark on a truly wild crusade against a negligent office-chair manufacturer. The overarching story, in which Ron’s obsessive persistence leads him to become entangled in a strange conspiracy – there are hints ofOnly Murders in the Buildingin the way the narrative is unafraid to unfurl haphazardly, while director Andrew DeYoung sometimes films Robinson as if he is in a paranoid 1970s movie thriller – might be more ambitious than the traditional office comedy, but both are ideal vehicles for Robinson’s comic gifts.Aside from embodying pure cringeworthy rage in his performance, as a writer Robinson is – along with regular collaborator Zach Kanin – brilliant at making supporting or one-off characters and situations just that little bit more extreme than an average comedy would think appropriate. If the script has the need for a shop assistant who acts oddly, or a cafe owner too busy to answer Ron’s questions, or an unhelpful customer service operator who knows nothing about the business they represent, Robinson and Kanin make sure the interaction has the unforgettable unpredictability and intensity of an I Think You Should Leave skit. All comedy is essentially about surprises and in The Chair Company, you can’t tell exactly when the next massive, stupid laugh is coming. Ron’s colleagues are just the right amount of wacky, too, from the janitor jealously guarding his wheelbarrow to Ron’s nemesis, a kindly older co-worker who has stopped taking his career seriously and starting blowing bubbles across the room during important meetings.The test of whether The Chair Company turns out to be great or just very good will be Robinson’s ability to sustain himself across a longer, more narrative-driven format. Episodes of his hilarious but exhausting sketch show ran to just 15 minutes. There are positive early signs: beneath all the goofing are tender hints that Ron is acting out because his two kids are growing up and he is worried that he is now too old to achieve anything, but we can see that his wife and kids don’t agree that he’s a loser and that they are his big achievement. So can Ron take Robinson to the next level? To borrow a phrase from one of his unanswered emails to the chair people: “I look very forward” to finding out.The Chair Company aired on Sky Comedy and is on NowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewreviewsShareReuse this content"

A study in contrast. At one point Luke Humphries’s eyes widen as another 22g Red Dragon dart flies past double 16. He shakes his head. Looks down. Bites his lip. Meanwhile, the automaton beside him powers on. Until the moment Luke Littler is pumping his fists,revelling in his 6-1 victoryand a first World Grand Prix title.Littler’s extraordinary immunity to pressure is fast reaching the stage where even peak-era Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal would be taking notes. In his quarter-final against Gerwyn Price, Littler looked down and out at times until he hit a 156 checkout to clinch the match. Against Humphries, it didn’t matter that his three-dart average was more than a point lower as he won five of his six sets in final-leg deciders.Luke Littler thrashes Luke Humphries to claim World Grand Prix finalRead moreLuke the Nuke? More like Luke the nerveless. While the 18-year-old often reacted after a 180 or winning double against Humphries, there was barely a flicker of emotion between darts. That, according to Philip Furley, a senior lecturer at the German Sport University in Cologne, is significant. Furley has just published a new study in the Psychology of Sport and Exercise journal, which suggests that even the tiniest of facial tics and movements before a player throws a dartcan indicate whether they will hit a high or low score.Furley has a history in this area. Previously, he hasshown players are more likely to miss penalties if they turn their back to the keeper beforehandor take less time than usual before their kick. “We called this hastening and hiding behaviour,” he says. “If you see something like that in the pressurised performance context that’s often a sign the play is not going to do so well.”Darts is another laboratory. Many of its pleasures come from its purity. Dart and board, eye and nerve. A player is only ever seconds away from needing a big score or a double; to silence the self-talk in their head or the hecklers in the crowd. Every throw and thrower is captured by TV cameras, allowing it to be assessed.View image in fullscreenGerwyn Price missed match darts in a psychological battle with Luke Littler at last week’s World Grand Prix.Photograph: Carl Recine/Getty ImagesEssentially, that is what Furley did, as he looked at scoring and facial attributes at the 2017 PDC World Darts Championships. High-performance scores, ranging from 103 to 180 points, were contrasted with low-performance scores between 0 and 75. A program called Facial Action Coding System, which breaks down facial expressions into 20 individual small segments, was used to track whether players did things like wrinkle their nose, raise their upper lip or close their eyes each time they threw.Furley says there were extremely limited facial muscle movements immediately before throwing a dart, but a “clear pattern of results emerged” showing that the players whose face did not change scored better.“What we reliably find is that more tension around the eyes and around the mouth is an indicator of suboptimal performance,” Furley says. “While less tension seems to be an indicator that, OK, he is going to perform better.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But as a keen darts watcher he is in awe of how psychologically mature he is at the board. “Having a poker face, and not really showing much of these muscle movements that are a sign of tension, is something these absolute top performers like Littler seem to have more often.”Furley’s research is part of a wider drive to examine unintentional non-verbal cues in sport. Some of it is obvious. You did not need a PhD in psychology to sense Frank Bruno was anxious when he crossed himself more than a dozen times on the way to the ring before his second fight with Mike Tyson.But there are some things that may surprise you. A study on 152 Ultimate Fighting athletes found that increased smile intensity in the pre-fight photograph was associated with poorer performance by the fighter showing the smile. Why? Well, according to the researchers, smiles are a nonverbal sign of reduced hostility and aggression and therebyunintentionally communicate reduced physical dominance.There are exceptions in all this. Zinedine Zidane once vomited before taking a penalty against England in a Euro 2004 group match, due to tiredness and nerves. He still scored. Littler too showed he isn’t infallible when he surprisingly lost to Beau Greaves at the World Youth Championship on Monday.View image in fullscreenCameron Menzies in deep concentration as he throws a dart. A study showed that players whose face did not change scored better.Photograph: Carl Recine/Getty ImagesSo what is next? Furley says facial recognition software now exists to track whether a player is showing more evidence of nervousness and tension in real-time. He has also just submitted a study for review that is based on Fifa kinematic datasets that track the skeletons of all 22 players in real time.“When we put boxes around the players and measure how upright the head is, how upright the body is and how open the shoulders are we see some really interesting things,” he says.Such as? “The more upright a player is, it seems to be a clear sign they are on top of their game and things are going better for the team,. And being head down and a bit slumped, with shoulders inwards, seem clear indicators the team’s not doing very well.”Much of that, as Furley says, is intuitive. Even so, it is interesting when the evidence backs up our instincts. Whether it is on the football pitch or at the oche.Explore more on these topicsDartsLuke LittlercommentShareReuse this content"

It’s obviously aimed at a specific market that expects a certain blend of melodrama, softcore sex and lush lifestyle porn, and (more importantly) is invested already in the trilogy’s story. Given those parameters, it probably delivers – although the dialogue, at least judging by the subtitles, is super clunky and cliched.Complete outsiders coming to this cold may be a little baffled by what’s going on, since this concluding instalment makes no effort to fill in any blanks. But even total newbies will get the gist that heroine Noah (Nicole Wallace) still has feelings for her ex Nick (Gabriel Guevara) – who also, somewhat disturbingly, was once her stepbrother, although their respective parents didn’t marry until Noah and Nick were well into adulthood. At the Ibiza-set wedding of comic relief best friends Jenna (Eva Ruiz) and Lion (Victor Varona), Noah and Nick bump uglies before having the inevitable row that will separate them for most of the narrative until the final-act rapprochement. In the middle part, Noah hooks up with nice (and therefore doomed to romantic failure) Simon (Fran Morcillo), and Nick goes around offices wearing suits and issuing orders in boardrooms. There’s a bad guy, Michael (Javier Morgade), who looks almost identical to Nick but with more perma-stubble, and he tries to wreak havoc on our central lovers.Unfolding across various scenic, seaside parts ofSpainas well as London, this has all the glossy sheen of a holiday brochure, with much attention paid to clothes and wedding planning details. A syrupy stream of EDM-style pop in assorted languages fills in the spaces where people aren’t talking, but ultimately it’s all too bland and banal to even be offensive or annoying.Our Fault is on Prime from 16 October.Explore more on these topicsFilmRomance filmsRomance booksFilm adaptationsSpainEuropeFictionreviewsShareReuse this content"

She wouldn’t advise the athletes she works with to completely cut out carbohydrates – foods such as bread, grains, potatoes and sweets. “However,” she says, “reducing carbohydrate intake can be beneficial for weight loss, if we can moderate total energy intake.”Weight loss comes down to energy balance: consuming fewer calories than we burn. There are many ways to achieve this: exercising more, eating less, or choosing foods that are lower in calories. Cutting back on some carbohydrates can be one way to create this deficit, she says. Not because carbs are uniquely “fattening”, but because other macronutrients such as fibre, protein and fat tend to be more filling. “If we spend more of our calorie budget on these foods, we feel fuller for longer,” Crouse says.You’ll feel much better for eating a balanced, high-protein meal with vegetables and some healthy fats. It’s a better investment of your ‘calorie cash’Is it true that … women snore less than men?Read moreThis is especially the case when it comes to refined carbohydrates, such as white bread and sweets, which are digested quickly. They can be useful as a pre-workout snack, but they’re less helpful as a staple carb source. Instead, Crouse recommends higher-fibre varieties at mealtimes, such as brown rice and wholemeal bread, which release energy more slowly.“You’ll feel much better for eating a balanced, high-protein meal with vegetables and some healthy fats,” she says. “It’s a much better investment of your ‘calorie cash’.”Crouse recommends consuming more carbohydrates on days when you’re working out: “It reduces the risk of illness and injury, and supports exercise adaptation.” On rest days or less active days, cutting back on carbs can help to reduce your overall energy intake, as long as you still include protein for muscle repair, plus plenty of fruit and vegetables for vitamins, fibre and antioxidants.Explore more on these topicsDiets and dietingIs it true that …Health & wellbeingFoodHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In the racially diverse Springburn area of Glasgow, people fear a storm is gathering and refuse to let it pass unchallengedByChris LeslieMon 13 Oct 2025 02.00 EDTShareIn recent weeks, the streets of north and east Glasgow have been lined with saltires. Scotland’s national flag – rooted in the story of Saint Andrew’s martyrdom and long a symbol of resilience and pride –has become a flashpoint in a growing cultural battle. Flags have been raised as part of a UK-wide action, known as “raise the colours”, amid protests against housing asylum seekers in hotels and rising far-right activity.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenSaltire flags in SpringburnIn Springburn, a community with no asylum seeker hotels but scarred by deep poverty and known for its diversity of black and other minority ethnic groups, refugee and asylum seekers, hundreds of flags appeared almost overnight. Their sudden presence unsettled many residents. In response, a grassroots coalition – Springburn Anti-Racism Group – was formed to reclaim the saltire and defend the neighbourhood with a message of solidarity and inclusion.View image in fullscreenSaltires and union jacks displayed alongside anti-immigrant slogansat the ‘unity rally’ in central GlasgowThe tension burst into public view last month at a far-right-backed “unity rally” in central Glasgow. Saltires and union flags flew alongside anti-immigrant slogans, while counter-protesters from Stand Up to Racism and other groups assembled on the opposite side of police lines. For hours, chants and banners collided in the streets. The standoff ended after five hours with one arrest for the assault of a police officer, and an atmosphere that was heavy with unease, a sense that deeper, wider conflicts were brewing beneath the surface.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenPolice at the ‘unity rally’ form a dividing line to control rival protestersWhile the city-centre rally drew headlines, a quieter struggle is playing out daily in Springburn. The newly formed anti-racist group, which has fewer than 20 members but is growing, says that even small acts of resistance matter. It plans to host community arts and music events to celebrate Springburn’s diversity and is launching an anonymous system for reporting racism, enabling the group to share findings with those who can act. The group fears a storm is gathering and refuses to let it pass unchallenged.For Moloy Sarker, from the Bangla Centre SCIO charity, the flags first seemed harmless. “I thought it was for a football match. It’s Scotland’s flag, after all,” he recalls. “At first I wasn’t worried. But then I saw online who was putting up the flags and the anti-immigrant slogans tied to them, and I began to feel very anxious.”View image in fullscreenMoloy Sarker, the president and trustee of the Bangla Centre, at the Winter Gardens in Springburn ParkSchoolteacher Debbie Jack joined the group after watching far-right narratives gain traction. “People were in shock, almost sleepwalking, while the news kept targeting immigrants. We decided it was time to act, to protect our pupils and our community.”Though she hasn’t noticed an increase in racism among her students, she is deeply concerned by how aggressively young white boys are being radicalised online. “Springburn is multicultural. Children from all ethnic backgrounds grow up learning and playing together. That’s the norm. But if we don’t resist, these outside forces will poison that.”View image in fullscreenCounter-protesters against the ‘unite rally’ in Glasgow on the 20 SeptemberGraham Campbell, a local councillor, a links the tension to Glasgow’s worsening housing crisis. “The north has lost far more homes than it has gained. Tower blocks have been demolished and not replaced with enough new housing. Poverty and poor housing are real issues – but blaming refugees is a dangerous distraction.”View image in fullscreenLocal councillor Graham Campbell at the former site of the Red Road flatsThough flag-hangers often claim their actions are about housing shortages, the NHS, or crime, Campbell disagrees. “If you have grievances, there are legitimate ways to raise them – with councillors, MSPs. This isn’t about housing or protecting communities. It’s about hijacking Scotland’s flag. The National Front tried it years ago, and they failed. These new far-right groups will fail too.”View image in fullscreenRostyslav Prokhyra, a Ukrainian refugee who settled in the area in 2022, pictured inside the community garden and mural he created with his tenants’ group between two local flatsFor refugees, the saltire’s new associations carry a painful weight. Rostyslav Prokhyra, who fled Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, helped establish a tenants’ group, community gardens, and clean-up projects in Springburn. He worries that the welcome he once received would be less likely today. “We try to make this a better place for everyone – but suddenly all you hear is that refugees are the problem. That’s not the truth. You can’t judge us all by the actions of a few.”View image in fullscreenMala Jayhindaran, a member of the newly formed Springburn Anti-Racism GroupMala Jayhindaran and her son Shawn, founders of Springburn Unity Network, share that frustration. After seven years of waiting, they finally gained refugee status in 2023, but for years they had already been serving the community, running food banks, language classes, and family support. “We’ve given years of work here,” says Jayhindaran. “Then people turn around and call us lazy, say we’re a burden. But what have people like Nigel Farage ever done for Springburn? Nothing. For them it’s political theatre. For us, it’s survival.”For Shawn, joining the anti-racism group is about both prevention and hope. “Our greatest identity is not where we are from, but how we connect with the world and we want to prove that most of Springburn isn’t racist.”View image in fullscreenShawn inside the room where he and his mother have been helping to run local language lessons in the Glasgow dialect for asylum seekers and refugeesThe flags remain, fluttering over Springburn as uneasy reminders of division. Residents brace for the possibility that hostility will intensify during the next election cycle. “It’ll feel like dodging racist bullets all over again,”Jack warns.View image in fullscreenDebbie Jack, a local schoolteacher and member of the Springburn Anti-Racism Group: ‘We decided it was time to act, to protect our pupils and our community.’What is happening in Springburn reflects a broader struggle across Scotland and beyond: a battle over national symbols, identity, and belonging. The far right’s resurgence may be global, but so too is the resistance against it.As Sarker puts it, small acts carry weight: “We may be tiny compared with the scale of global politics, but change always begins at the community level. Even here in Springburn, we can spark something bigger – showing that compassion is stronger than division.”Explore more on these topicsThe Guardian picture essayScotlandRaceImmigration and asylumGlasgowfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Those rights are in dire perilMon 13 Oct 2025 10.23 EDTLast modified on Mon 13 Oct 2025 12.01 EDTShareImagine a movement arising in this country that seeks to overthrow established power. Imagine that it begins with a series of rebellions, in Scotland and south Wales perhaps, that shut down workplaces, confront police and soldiers (sometimes peaceably, sometimes with crude weapons), set up roadblocks and lay siege to the places where fellow protesters are imprisoned and government officials are meeting.Imagine that this movement goes on to smash or disable machinery across the country. Imagine that it organises a general strike, nixing much of the UK’s economic activity for three months. Imagine that it keeps protesting in the same places by the same means, gradually eroding the resistance of the state.Keir Starmer’s Labour government would doubtless do everything in its power not just to stop these individual actions but to prohibit the movement. What am I describing? The origins and development of the Labour party.The Labour party arose from a long wave of protests by workers against capital, calling for workers’ rights and for sweeping democratic reforms. These protests and their organisers came to be known as the labour movement. Its early actions includedthe radical war in Scotland,the Merthyrand Newportrisings in south Wales,the Swing riotsin England andthe General Strike of 1842. No such protests would have meant no such movement. No such movement would have meant no such party.Yet somehow, the party that arose from protest has formed, in terms of our rights to free expression and democratic challenge, the most illiberal government the UK has suffered since the second word war. ThisLabourgovernment would have banned the labour movement.Over 40 years, starting with the Public Order Act 1986, our rights to assemble and challenge power have been severely curtailed. That act was followed by theTrade Union Act 1992, the Criminal Justice Act 1994, the Terrorism Act 2000, theSerious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, thePolice, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022and thePublic Order Act 2023. Between them, they have largelybound and gagged effective protest.Any government that fails to contest and reverse this trend, even if it did nothing to add to this bleak legacy, sides with illiberalism. Far from doing so, Starmer’s has already gone further than the Conservatives dared, byclassifying a civil disobedience group– Palestine Action – as a terrorist organisation and banning it. It has also (so far with remarkably little resistance)inserted a clauseinto its crime and policing bill enabling the police to stop demonstrations “in the vicinity of a place of worship”. As our towns and cities are so richly endowed with religious buildings, that means almost any urban area.But its latest proposal is even worse. The home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, has announced that the policeshould be able to stop proteststhat have a “cumulative impact”, by recurring in the same place. She will also consider “powers to ban protests outright”.Mahmood has sought to justify these measures with the claim that repeated protests can leave religious groups, especially the Jewish community, feeling unsafe. It is worth noting that a Conservative home secretary, Suella Braverman, forced avery similar measurethrough parliament in 2023 (which was later struck down by the courts) using anentirely different argument: that repeated environmental protests were causing disruption to businesses and travellers. Illiberal people seek to stop protest. They will seize on any argument that justifies this urge.It is essential that Jews in Britain are fiercely protected against antisemitic hate and antisemitic attacks. We must be perpetually vigilant against anyone who uses the Israeli government’s genocide in Gaza as an excuse for antisemitism. This hate crime must be prosecuted, wherever it arises. But linking this disgusting crime to the act of protesting against the genocide, however peacefully and respectfully, as the governmenthas explicitly done, triggers two grim thoughts.The first is that it is using the horrific terrorism in Manchester last week as a good moment for shutting down dissent. The second is that it treats protests against Israeli government actions as protests against the Jewish community in Britain. Otherwise, it’s hard to understand why Mahmood and the prime minister should have called for onlyone thing to be cancelledthe following day to respect the grief of British Jews: not football matches, concerts, car boot salesandprotests, but solely the silent and peaceful Palestine protest in London. Jewish people in this country haverepeatedly warned against such conflations, which can themselves constitute antisemitism.Mahmood’s proposals, as well as being profoundly illiberal in their own right, add a new storey to the tower of authoritarian measures in whose shadow we live. We suffer the “cumulative impact” of a long succession of anti-protest laws. Labour is waging a concerted attack on the thing that made it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Thanks to the protests of the past, we’ve overthrown the corrupt old elites and achieved democracy. Well, I hope one day our descendants will look back on our system and wonder how it could ever have passed for democracy, and why we tolerated it for so long.First-past-the-post elections delivering a massive majority on 34% of the vote? One second’s participation in decision-making every five years?Presumed consentin between? Governments claiming to represent us, but responding instead to press barons and corporations? Politics on sale to the highest bidder, through political donations and paid lobbying?Thisis democracy?Thisis a system that requires no challenge?Those who opposed the labour movement two centuries ago also believed their political system was unimprovable. In 1830, when a tiny minority was allowed to vote and entire cities were unrepresented, the prime minister, the Duke of Wellington,told parliamentthat neither he nor the leader of the opposition could see any means by which “the state of the representation could be improved”. The existing system deservedly “possessed the full and entire confidence of the country”.Our political ancestors knew that to be effective you have to keep coming back. You have to turn up where it counts. You have to make a nuisance of yourself. You must be noisy, obstructive, annoying. One by one, all these rights have been struck down. Now the last remaining attribute of effective dissent – persistence – is also to be banned.Protestis allowed, as long as it’s invisible, transient and useless. But the moment protest ceases to be effective is the moment democracy dies.George Monbiot is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

They are in no position to build a Palestinian futureMon 13 Oct 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 13 Oct 2025 10.06 EDTShareToday, Sharm el-Sheikh will host the most high-profile gathering of global leaders in the Middle East of recent years. Donald Trump, Keir Starmer, Emmanuel Macron, Pedro Sánchez and othersare meeting“to end the war in the Gaza Strip, enhance efforts to achieve peace and stability in the Middle East, and usher in a new era of regional security and stability”.If the ceasefire holds, this language is an augur of the future. One where there is no reckoning, no addressing of root causes. Only a hurtling into the imperatives of cleanings-up and workings-out. All the while illegal occupation continues, and another chapter of Israel’s violations is furtively closed without accountability not only forIsrael, but for its sponsors.There is an Arabic expression,hameeha harameeha– meaning “its protector is its thief”, that comes to mindas those who have plied Israel with weaponry gather to figure out how to achieve peace in Gaza. Over the coming weeks and months, a Gaza even more devastated than what has been shown to the world so far will come into view. Already the colossal scale of what needs to be rebuilt is becoming clear. People arereturning to their homesin Gaza Cityto find a wastelandflattened to the horizon by bombs andthen bulldozers. In the images of the area, even the sunlight looks different and otherworldly. I couldn’t figure out why, until I realised it was because there were no structures to filter it. No shade, no shadows. A home returned to is just a plot on which to pitch another tent and wait for aid. But this time, with less risk of being bombed in your sleep.People in Gaza have been released from the fear of death, but what of the life they now face? What of thethousands of orphans, and the wounded or maimed children with no surviving families? It is not just the infrastructure of large parts of Gaza that has been destroyed, it is also the social fabric. Family lineages across two, three,four generationshave been wiped out. What of the thousands of parents who haveburied their children? And of all those who have collected the body parts of their loved ones? How to even begin to think about addressing such mass trauma when there isn’t even a roof to gather under? I asked a man from Gaza about his brother, who had lost all his children and his wife in one strike. Where is he now? “Just constantly walking around, circling the rubble” of the site where they died. “Lost.”View image in fullscreenPalestinians women in Gaza City, 12 October 2025.Photograph: Majdi Fathi/NurPhoto/ ShutterstockThe death toll will certainly rise, as bodies that could not previously be retrieved are pulled out of the rubble. At least 10% of Gaza’s population has beeneither killed or injured, and that is a conservative estimate.It is important that these facts are not simply totted up and brushed aside as the costs of war. The assault must end, but the terms on which it is ended, and on which the path to peacemaking and reconstruction is based, are crucial. The crimes that have been committed cannot be redressed, or even prevented from recurring, if the conditions that enabled their perpetrators continue.This is a difficult thing to insist on when you are dealing with a genocide. The scale of the death and violence, the erasure of the conditions for life, make the cessation of that erasure the most urgent, the only focus. But with that comes exculpation, and worse. Already Donald Trump is taking a victory lap for his peacemaking, after enabling what has taken place for months. Jared Kushnerpraised Israel’s conduct:“Instead of replicating the barbarism of the enemy, you chose to be exceptional.” StarmerlaudedTrump for securing the deal, and focused on the importance of letting in humanitarian aid. He will,No 10 has said, pay “particular tribute” to the US president in Sharm el-Sheikh. And so now we have a crime without criminals, a genocide withoutgénocidaires, a wretched population who, we are to believe, have been brought low by Hamas, and must be fed and watered while the world works out what to do with them. An entire history across Palestine of Israeli impunity and dominion, one of repetitiveethnic cleansing, military rule, expansion of settlements – and nowexplicit rejectionof Palestinian self-determination – is erased, again.This time, that exoneration, that framing of what has happened as tragic and finally over, is even more urgent, because the responsibility of countries that have supported Israel and silenced its critics is clearer than ever. Of course you would rush to Sharm el-Sheikh if you were representing a government that provided arms,restricted protestand refused either to endorsedeclarations of genocide, or toobserve the rulingsof the ICC when it issued an arrest warrant for Benjamin Netanyahu. Peace in Gaza represents an opportunity to forget; to erase from the collective consciousness an era in which some western countries took a bludgeon to international norms and institutions, and indeed their own domestic politics, in order to force through the destruction of Gaza.But many all over the world who have witnessed the massacre, and all that went into sustaining it for two whole years, will not so easily forget. The secure future of those inGaza, andPalestinein general, is not something that can be delivered by the thieves-turned-protectors. Without the empowerment of the Palestinian people and their self-determination, there can be no faith or trust in Israel or its allies to deliver that constantly invoked “lasting peace”. The killings have mercifully stopped for now in Gaza, but there must now be a refusal to normalise what will follow – a return to a status quo in which we all keep on pretending that Palestinian life is viable under the authority of Israel.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What has been learned in the past two years cannot be unlearned, despite all the energy that will be expended to make that happen. The Palestinian cause cannot be returned to the fringes of “complex”, marginal politics, a framing that has enabled two years of devastation. That devastation’s perpetrators disqualified themselves long ago from any mandate over the people they have aided in killing and shattering. What will now be revealed in the body count and wreckage in Gaza should make that impossible to deny.As the world leaders descend, a line from TS Eliot’s Gerontion hangs over Sharm el-Sheikh: “After such knowledge, what forgiveness?”Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Members and trade union affiliatesvoted to back, first the findings of a UN commission of inquirythat Israel is committing genocide, and second that the government must do all it can to prevent it.It is now two weeks since this motion was passed, but still the Labour government refuses to recognisethe genocide in Gazaand allowsthe supply of weaponsto Israel.Over the past 40 years in parliament, I have witnessed at first-hand the democratic deficit in our political system. For too long, top-down political parties have disempowered their membership and crushed internal debate. Now,Your Partywill try to do something unprecedented in British politics: forge a mass, democratic party from scratch.When we launched,we announcedthat members would decide the policies, the strategy and even the name. In the meantime, we called it Your Party.It was an apt choice because it expressed the essence of what we are trying to build: a new kind of political party that belongs to its members.In November, we are hosting our inaugural founding conference. This will be the moment that members come together to decide the direction of the party, the models of leadership, and the strategies we need to win. We want our conference to be participatory, open and democratic. Members will be chosen at random to come to the conference in person and debate our founding documents. Then, every member will get the final say online through one member, one vote.This conference will not come out of the blue. It will be the product of a series of mass,regional assembliesup and down the country. More than just rallies, these assemblies will be an opportunity for communities to come together to discuss and debate the key questions facing the future of our party and our country.A democratic party isn’t an end in itself. It will provide the space for people to organise, together, for a radically different society. When highly centralised political parties answer to nobody but themselves, you get policies that nobody asked for. You get privatisation of our public services. You get austerity. You get 4.5 million childrenliving in povertyin one of the richest countries in the world. When political parties are democratically accountable to their members, you get policies that the British people want and need.I’ll go further: undemocratic parties produce undemocratic societies, where a small section of society owns the resources we all need to survive. Democratic parties produce democratic societies; where wealth and resources are owned by us all. Take public ownership, for example. Currently, a small number of companies control the production of basic resources, to the detriment of us all. Everyone relies on these services, yet it isunaccountable shareholderswho decide how they are run. Public ownership means giving communities the power to decide how to run the services they provide and consume. This is the heart of socialism: the extension of democracy into every sphere of life. And that is at the heart of Your Party.For too long, people have been shut out of our political system. We are doing things differently: we are putting power in your hands. Those who want to stand in the way of transformative change want to suppress the rights, voices and power of ordinary people. Their greatest fear is democracy – because democracy is our greatest strength.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Apart from people rushing to work or walking their dogs, the place seemed relatively deserted. Even some of the most popular coffee spots had more vacant seats than occupied ones. This day feels like a holy day – not because it actually is one (it’s Simchat Torah Eve) – but because of the return ofthe last 20 living hostagesfrom Hamas captivity. There was no need to ask where everyone was. Thousands had gathered in “hostages square” in Tel Aviv (formerly known as Museum Square – and who knows if that name will ever return). Others were glued to their television screens at home, as if it were the World Cup final. Thinking about it, the war’s final act trumps even that. Apparently, the sound of silence can be full of joy.Ever since the deal was struck and the war finally came to an end, it seemsIsraelhas been under the influence of the best drug imaginable. Strolling through the streets now, you see people smiling for no reason – or perhaps for the best reason of all. Even the serious faces worn by TV anchors have been replaced by cheerful ones. “Today is the day I smile,” said one correspondent gladly this morning, stating the obvious. But as the TV presenters and panellists persisted with the good news theme, you could not help but notice the other footage. As the buses and Red Cross vehicles drove through the Gaza Strip on their mission to bring the hostages back, the scene was one of destruction – ruins of cities where people once lived.The fight for the hostages and the calamity inGazaare two sides of the war’s coin. That will remain the case in the days to come. But as time goes on, more and more focus will probably shift to Gaza, its rehabilitation, and the truth that lies beneath all the rubble.Israeli hostages released: all living captives freed as Trump tells Knesset ‘age of terror’ is over – latest updatesRead moreThe curtain-raiser will come later today in the resort city of Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt, where theleaders’ summit on Gazawill convene. Perhaps this meeting, and those that will inevitably follow (given that the plan for “the day after” could hardly be resolved in a single day) will set a timeline for a new international governing body and security force to actually take control of the Gaza Strip. As if there were any doubt about the urgency of this, even by the weekend some news reports suggested that Hamas hadalready reasserted controlof Gaza as part of its own version of “law and order”.Only at noon today, almost in the final minute of stoppage time, did Egypt announce that Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, had also been invited to the summit. Given that Netanyahu had been reluctant to end the war ever since it began – no matter the cost – this decision seemed to be an attempt to tie him to the “day after” scenario for both Israel and Gaza. Unlike the first phase, which brought the hostages home, the second offers Israel no tangible gains. It’s all about Gaza’s rehabilitation. Considering that many Israelis viewed the end of the war as a price worth paying to bring the hostages back, one must wonder: will they seek a return to the battlefield once all Israelis are safely home? Netanyahu’s attendance in Sharm el-Sheikh, alongside Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian National Authority, should have provided an answer to that question. However, just an hour later – after the Israeli media celebrated his imminent attendance –his office statedthat he had to politely decline due to the proximity to the start of the holy day in Israel.View image in fullscreenUS president Donald Trump with Israel prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the Knesset, 13 October 2025.Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/APWhatever Netanyahu’s true reason may be, perhaps the bottom line remains: this summit, coordinated byDonald Trumpwith world leaders, is a way of signalling to Israel that Gaza is no longer under its sole authority. The war is over – as Trump keeps saying – and now others will take charge. Of course, any initiative in Gaza will still need to work closely with the Israeli government. But the question remains whether it will be a cooperative effort or a matter of direct orders – much like the way Trump compelled Israel to accept the deal to end the war.Speaking in the Israeli parliament today, Trump said: “Israel, with our help, has won all that they can by force of arms – you’ve won. Now it is time to translate these victories against terrorists on the battlefield into the ultimate prize of peace and prosperity for the entire Middle East.” This statement may come as no surprise, given his previous remarks declaring that “the war is over”. It also aligns withthe scheduled visitto Israel by the president of Indonesia tomorrow: Israel doesn’t have diplomatic relations with Indonesia, and the visit might suggest another “peace deal” is coming. But (not to spoil the celebrations), one must ask: where do the Palestinians fit into this vision? Is an independent state really just around the corner? Does that include the West Bank, and does it mean the end of all settlements? That seems a premature conclusion, to say the least. And if that is not forthcoming, is lasting peace really likely?But that is just one unresolved issue among many. Others were evident during the early celebrations on Saturday evening in Hostage Square, where, behind the displays of happiness and relief, deeper truths emerged. The most notable moment of the evening came when Trump’s envoy, Steve Witkoff, attempted to praise Netanyahu for his role in achieving the deal. The crowd – far more familiar with his failures – booed loudly. Not once, not twice. Every time his name was mentioned, the crowd jeered. The rhythmic chant, “Thank you, Trump” only emphasised whom Israelis view as their true saviour.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But even if that’s true for now, Trump – as he’s proven countless times before – is like a child who quickly tires of old toys. At some point, he will probably abandon the Middle East and redirect his attention elsewhere: the Russia-Ukraine conflict (after all, there’s still time to chase next year’s Nobel prize), his battle against immigration, or the war he’s declared on US democracy itself.

That she’d be ashamed. But mostly, I was terrified they’d send me home. Again. That I wasn’t sick enough. That I was just another hormonal woman with a flair for drama.This was week five of what I now know is hyperemesis gravidarum (HG), a condition where pregnancy nausea and vomiting go full Tarantino. I’d already been to the emergency department five times in two weeks. No diagnosis. Just a rinse-and-repeat routine: some staring down the tiles while holding a tie-and-twist vomit bag, some pokes and wriggles to find my dehydrated veins, some fluids and the awkward assurance that “baby is like a parasite, it will take everything it needs”. As if maternal suffering were a footnote. As if I were the side salad to the main course of foetal development.Among family members, the chorus was louder. Vomiting seven or eight times a day is, apparently, normal. “You should be grateful” and “There’s a reason God placed heaven under the feet of the mother.” Apparently, martyrdom is the price of admission.Don’t call it morning sickness: ‘At times in my pregnancy I wondered if this was death coming for me’Read moreI started to believe them. Maybe I was weak. Maybe I was exaggerating. Maybe I was failing at the one thing my body was biologically designed to do.But that night, on a stretcher, my body gave out. I couldn’t stand. My head was splitting. I hadn’t kept down food or water in four days. I’d already vomited four times that day – but not enough, I thought, to justify calling an ambulance and clogging up ED yet again. The debate in my head was about whether I was an impostor or someone genuinely suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum (HG).But then I came across anarticlethat validated what I’d suspected all along: diagnosis can be tricky. Featuring astudyof 300 Australians with severe nausea, it said HG leads to poor quality of life and negatively affects social, occupational and domestic functioning. So much so that more than half considered terminating their pregnancy. Ninety per cent considered not having more children. Only half found commonly used anti-nausea treatments effective.The article reflected my bed-ridden days, where I was fully reliant on my mother to do basic chores, unresponsive to oral antiemetics and living in a fog of dehydration and dread. HG doesn’t just affect your stomach, it hijacks your entire life.The first real validation came from a pathologist who said, “Oh, sounds like that thing PrincessKatehad.” Not because it was a royal condition, but because I felt like someone understood.View image in fullscreenPrince William, Duke of Cambridge, and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, in December 2012, leaving the hospital in London where she had been treated for HG.Photograph: Danny Martindale/WireImageHGis a debilitating condition routinely dismissed as “just morning sickness” because as many as80%of pregnant women experience some form of nausea and vomiting. But HG is not a spectrum, it’s a cliff. And once you fall off it, there’s no soft landing.I learned HG isn’t just bad luck – it can run in families. Specific gene variantslinkedto appetite regulation, inflammation and placental development may help explain why some bodies react this way to pregnancy. I ticked every box: motion sickness, migraines and a family tree full of women who “just got on with it”. But instead of this being seen as biological vulnerability, I framed it as personal failure. I wasn’t sick – I was soft.Historically,treatmentsfor HG ranged from mercury and morphine to electric shock and radiotherapy. One physician even injected his patient with her husband’s blood. By the 1960s, the medical enthusiasm fizzled out – just as women’s rights were gaining traction. Funny, isn’t it? Motherhood was too sacred to be touched, even by science.Why are women who suffer extreme sickness in pregnancy told it’s all in their heads?Read moreAs someone navigating HG while living in Australia, with family ties across multiple cultures, I’ve been struck by the universality of the minimisation. There’s a cross-cultural rush to romanticise motherhood while silencing its pain. It’s not that people mean to be cruel. The dismissal of HG isn’t usually malicious – it’s ambient. It seeps in through the cracks of culture, religion, medicine and memory. It’s the grandmother who says “We all went through it”, the friend who chirps “You’ll forget once you have the kid”, the nurse who shrugs “Baby gets everything it needs” and sends you home with a pamphlet and a pat on the back. It’s the glorification of motherhood as divine suffering, where pain is proof of love and silence is strength. And when that narrative becomes gospel, HG becomes invisible.And the freakiest betrayal? It’s from women themselves. Again, it’s not conscious. Like all good bias, it’s baked in. We grow up believing our bodies are meant to suffer. And this is what stands behind thelag inmedical understanding and public consciousness. HG lacks concrete diagnostic protocols, consistent care pathways and financial investment in effective treatments.I now have a hospital management plan and I’ve successfully shooed away any termination ideations. I’m waiting eagerly for the baby to be out and the much-promised “this will pass, and your memories will fade” to arrive. There will almost certainly not be a second pregnancy, given the recurrence risk of about24%.I’m writing this hoping that a few more people will learn about the condition, fostering compassion and community consciousness about the silent pains of motherhood. Fourteen weeks into pregnancy, I fear what else there is about motherhood that I don’t know and will learn the hard way.Generations of women have quietly suffered and survived. Some died. But it doesn’t have to be this way.In Australia, support is available atBeyond Blueon 1300 22 4636,Lifelineon 13 11 14, and atMensLineon 1300 789 978.

Thelatest statisticsreleased by the Home Office, showing religiously motivated offences at a record level, are deeply disturbing. But for those who have witnessed some of the appalling scenes on our city’s streets in recent months, they will not be surprising.Over the past two years, Jewish people have faced a rising tide of antisemitism, and the heinous terrorist attack in Manchester on Yom Kippur was a terrible reminder of just how pervasive this poisonous form of hatred continues to be. Between January and June, the Community Security Trust reported more than 1,500 antisemitic incidents. A survey by the Institute for Jewish Policy Research found that 35% of Jewish people feel unsafe in the UK.A terrifying increase in anti-Muslim hatred has left many British Muslims feeling the same way. Two days after the horrific events at Heaton Park synagogue, a mosque was set alight in Peacehaven. A suspected arson with the intent to endanger life, it was the latest in a long line of violent assaults on Muslim places of worship. In July, one man was sentenced after videoing himself releasing wild rats next to a mosque in Sheffield. In the same week, another pleaded guilty to terrorism offences after planning to burn down a mosque in Greenock.The idea that attacks against our Jewish and Muslim communities are isolated incidents is ignorant at best. At worst, this thinking is deeply dangerous. The violence we have witnessed is the result of rapidly deepening divides in our society which, if left to fester and grow, could tear our way of life apart.For Londoners, this is profoundly distressing. Our diverse city must always be a place where people of all faiths and none can live side by side in the knowledge that they aren’t just safe to be who they are – they are celebrated for it. Today, though, extremists are attempting to exploit our fears to divide us for their own gain, and their ideas are being allowed to infect mainstream political debate.As a city and as a society, we must put a stop to this. The London I know isn’t a city where people feel scared go to their synagogue or mosque, or fear wearing a hijab or a kippah in public. My London – the London I’ll keep standing up for – is a city where Muslim, Jewish and Christian leaders come together to celebrate Iftar, and people walking home from Friday prayers wish their neighbours shalom Shabbat. A place where we come together to condemn violence against places of worship, knowing that any attack on our neighbour’s freedom of religion is also an attack on our own.The London I love is the one I saw on a cloudy morning last November. Across the capital, thousands of people came together to visit care homes, clean up parks and cook for those in need. Jewish, Muslim, and Christian, Hindu, Buddhist, and Sikh, they were all taking part in Mitzvah Day: the UK’s largest faith-led day of social action.Founded by a Jewish Londoner, Laura Marks, Mitzvah Day has become a staple of life for many communities in the capital. City Hall is no different. Preparing for the day by packing boxes full of fresh vegetables for vulnerable Londoners with my colleagues, I found myself reflecting on our reasons for being there.Grounded in Jewish tradition, Mitzvah Day asks us to do good deeds – or mitzvot – for our community. For Muslims like me, that feels very familiar; zakat, or giving to the needy, is one of the five pillars of our religion. In the call to love your neighbour, my Christian friends hear a similar chance to put their beliefs into practice through acts of charity. My Hindu and Sikh friends embody this in seva, or selfless service.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Let Manchester be a turning point | Jonathan FreedlandRead moreThat morning, each of us found inspiration in our own faith. But, drawing on our different traditions, we also found a common cause: building a better future for the community we are proud to share. In homeless shelters and food banks across the country, many others did the same. Together, we showed that our diversity is a strength to be celebrated, not a weakness to be hidden. That, when faced with darkness and despair, hope and unity will always prevail.I don’t see my faith as something that sets me apart from my fellow Londoners, because I believe our different beliefs can bring us closer. As some seek to score cheap political points by weaponising a series of appalling events to turn us against one another, we can find an antidote to hatred in the sense of purpose we share in our churches, mosques and synagogues, our mandirs, temples and gurdwaras.Sadly, some politicians and commentators seem unwilling to defend this common humanity, choosing instead to exacerbate tensions by appealing to our worst instincts. This is reckless and wrong, revealing callous disregard for the safety of the people they are supposed to serve. Now, more than ever, we must resist the forces of division and unite to build stronger, kinder communities where we can live together in peace.Sadiq Khan is the mayor of LondonDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Is this really what the Iron Lady would have wanted?Mon 13 Oct 2025 10.31 EDTLast modified on Mon 13 Oct 2025 21.31 EDTShareOn this fateful day, whenMargaret Thatcherwould have been 100 years old, many are taking a moment to replay their favourite memories: that time when she said there was no such thing as society; that time when she snatched milk from primary-schoolchildren; that amazing pro-EU jumper she had; all those times when she wasn’t for turning. It’s one of those days when you’re supposed to stick to the stuff we can all agree on, such as: whatever you think of her policies, she was a one-off. You didn’t get many Margaret Thatchers to the yard.No amount of positivity, however, can paper over the alarming gulf in Thatcher-appreciation between regular people and members of the Conservative party. Last week, I went to the opening of The Iron Lady: The Legacy Paintings, an exhibition by the artist Lorna May Wadsworth, who, although I don’t know her, I’m medium sure is not a Thatcher superfan. She was the last artist to paint Thatcher before she died, but she has also painted Tony Blair, David Blunkett and Rowan Williams. She’s a portraitist. They rise above petty stuff like “what people said” and “what people did”, the better to immortalise them.The Tory faithful, however, love these Iron Lady paintings to a hair-raising degree. Another of Wadsworth’s fetched £400,000 in 2014. It’s 6ft square, and hangs in Conservative Campaign Headquarters, bearing down on the party with memories of past glories, like a gigantic rebuke. These smaller (let’s call them normal-sized) ones are essentially the same image with Warholian variations – a gold background, a blue one, an iron one; it’s surprising how many colours are quintessentially Thatcherite for those who really, really love her – and the iconography comes to feel much bigger than politics, more like a faith.At the Conservative conference this year, meanwhile, Thatcher references had gone from memorabilia to shrine. There were cardboard cutouts, because there always are, and cheeky, kitsch gift mugs. Delegates were invited to have their photos taken to make a Thatcher mosaic, to be projected on to a wall – you have to admit, it’s a fascinating solution to the question, “How can we make everyone here feel as though they’re a living, breathing part of a project that died 35 years ago?” But you also have to admit what an astronomically weird question that is. There were genuine Thatcher outfits in glass cases – dry-cleaned, of course, but that couldn’t wash away the crispy, faded, slightly eerie look, more Miss Havisham than V&A museum.View image in fullscreenThe lady’s not for tippling … limited edition Scotch whisky and a Margaret Thatcher-themed Toby jug on sale at the party conference.Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty ImagesThatcher passion among Tories was well in evidence three years ago, during the leadership contest, but its nature was different. Kemi Badenoch was trying to channel Thatcher-the-chemist by going on about her engineering credentials. Penny Mordaunt was deploying that soft, low voice – Thatcher famously took months of coaching, to rid herself of any modulation that people might find shrill – as well as making assertively witless anti-trans jokes: “I think it wasMargaret Thatcherthat said every prime minister needs a Willie; a woman like me doesn’t have one.” Liz Truss stole the show by simply dressing up as Thatcher, recreating her signature looks, pussy-bow collars and fur hats, in a fancy-dress pitch to people who weren’t concentrating at all (Truss was nothing like Thatcher, politically), but wanted to feel the same feels as they felt in 1979.It was powerfully reminiscent ofFerdinand “Bongbong” Marcos, sweeping to presidential victory in the Philippines that same year by blaring out the same campaign songs as his father, Ferdinand Sr, had used 40 years earlier. Somehow, voters didn’t think, “Wait a second, isn’t this the son of that utterly corrupt guy whose wife had all those shoes?”; they thought, “Ah, I remember this tune, makes me feel young again.” In 2022, talking constantly about Margaret Thatcher made Tory members feel young again.Three years on, the Conservatives’ Thatcher obsession feels more devotional than nostalgic, more cultish than escapist. And while none of us, least of all me, can speak for the Iron Lady’s heart, we all know she was quite a pragmatic person; I cannot believe this is what she would have wanted.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsConservativesOpinionMargaret ThatchercommentShareReuse this content"

Well, if it gets people reading …Carys AfokoThe special edition of Jennifer L Armentrout’s new ‘romantasy’ will stand out on any bookshelf, even if you’ve got your eyes closed. I refuse to be sniffy about itMon 13 Oct 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 13 Oct 2025 06.02 EDTShareWould you like a book that smells like garlic? Didn’t think so. But that didn’t stop author Jennifer L Armentrout from using garlic-infused ink to print 1,000 copies of her new novel The Primal of Blood and Bone.Seem strange? Maybe less so if I explain that the book is the latest instalment in a“romantasy”series that features Vampry (vampires) and Craven (sort of zombie vampires). Even then, this garlic business doesn’t quite add up. InArmentrout’s six-book saga(not including its four-book prequel), there is literally no mention of garlic repelling vampires. It’s only when you open TikTok that the special edition makes sense – it’s a “partnership” with the mayonnaise brand Hellmann’s. A quick search and my screen is full of excited readers opening coffin-shaped packages that contain the special smelly book and a free bottle of Hellmann’s garlic aioli. This is a stunt targeted at the army of romantasy readers onBookTok, the corner of TikTokdevoted to books and reading.Like garlic itself, this stunt has left some people queasy. On this very website, author David Barnett has denouncedthe use of “gimmicks” to sell books, with publishers dedicating huge marketing budgets to authors who are successful and don’t need the hype. That may be true in general but I don’t think that’s what’s happening here.View image in fullscreenThe limited edition comes with a bottle of Hellmann’s aioli.Photograph: Hand-out/UnileverI’m an unashamed fan of romantasy. I picked up a copy ofA Court of Thorns and Rosesaround the time we learned Trump was returning to the White House, and devoured all five books and another Sarah J Maas series (Throne of Glass) within weeks. Part of the joy of these slightly silly books is finding other people that enjoy them. And because romantasy is a genre people can be sniffy about, word of mouth ends up being one of the best ways to find new authors.A friend recommended Armentrout via social media to help with my Sarah J Maas “book hangover” – the period when you’ve finished a book/series and feel bereft without the characters. Her Blood and Ash books are incredibly long and not always well written but they had the heady, pacy plot and “enemies to lovers” trope that I was craving. So, while I will not be ordering a garlic-scented book, maybe a weird and slightly incoherent gimmick is OK if it gets people excited about reading.Carys Afoko is a communications strategist, writer and host of the Over the Top, Under the Radar podcastExplore more on these topicsBooksOpinionMarketing & PRYoung peoplecommentShareReuse this content"

But there is no guarantee that the ceasefire will end Palestinian sufferingMon 13 Oct 2025 13.46 EDTLast modified on Mon 13 Oct 2025 14.37 EDTShareThe reprieve brought by the end of fighting in Gaza is immense. In Israel, therelease of the living hostageshas led to widespread elation. In Gaza and the West Bank there are also celebrations, as up to 2,000 Palestinian detainees start to be released – though there is distress, too, due touncertainty about who is being freedand where they will be sent. In northern Gaza, people can finally return todig through rubblefor the remains of an estimated 10,000 missing people.As recently as three weeks ago, the likelihood of a ceasefireappeared remote. But it has taken effect, and on Monday Donald Trump travelled from Jerusalem, where he was cheered in the Knesset, to Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt. There, he joined ahigh-powered peace summitof more than 20 world leaders, including Sir Keir Starmer. The plan for peace begun there is due to be continued at a conference in the UK. The US president, acting with international partners, did make this deal happen – despite, not because of, Israel’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu.Hopes that the deal marks the first step toward Palestinian statehood are understandable – but, given historical precedent, somewhat optimistic. It offers no clear path to sovereignty for Palestinians and risks splitting, for the foreseeable future, Gaza from the West Bank. Then there is the utter devastation this war leaves behind. The lack of any timeline for Palestinian self-determination inMr Trump’s plangives the lie to vainglorious references, in his Knesset speech, to the “historic dawn” of a “golden age”.The US president could not help himself polarising and personalising the deal in his speech. In a moment of relief – with the hostage release, ceasefire and resumption of aid – he chose to recast it as a morality play in which he alone restored Israel’s honour after supposed betrayal by former US presidentsObama and Biden. This despite the Biden administrationa year agohaving attempted a similar deal: a ceasefire tied to humanitarian access and eventual political talks.A plan that denies one side meaningful agency cannot yield legitimate peace. The ceasefire and aid trucks are to be welcomed. But this is not yet political progress. Without mechanisms guaranteeing Palestinian participation and control over their own institutions, any deal risks freezing subjugation under the language of peace.Gaza’s people desperately need humanitarian aid– and food and medicinesmust be the first priority. But reconstruction cannot wait. Amid 60m tonnes of rubble, Palestinians need help restoring homes, schools, hospitals, mosques and other institutions shattered by Israel’s invasion. For Gaza’s transitional administration to succeed, funding must flow quickly and security gaps be filled. Like much of Mr Trump’s peace plan, references to an international stabilisation force and a proposed “board of peace”, withSir Tony Blair, are alarmingly vague.Strong international support for thePalestinian Authority, enabling it to take over from Hamas, is probably the most promising possibility. The enormous suffering of the past two years means the moral case for a resolution to the conflict is arguably more urgent than ever. But while the ceasefire, the return of the hostages and commitment by Hamas to “demilitarise” Gaza should be acknowledged as positive steps, Mr Trump’s record gives little reason to believe he will deliver – or feel bound to try. Short-term relief does not mean that the prospect of a Palestinian state has been brought closer.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But it won’t end a noxious multibillion-dollar industry that devastates the lives of two sets of victims. The first are those cheated out of money, often by people posing as potential romantic or business partners in what are known as“pig‑butchering” schemes. The second are those who are forced to cheat them, working in conditions amounting to modern slavery.The recent study,Scam: Inside Southeast Asia’s Cybercrime Compounds, by Ivan Franceschini, Ling Li and Mark Bo, paints a terrifying picture of the sector. Workers are trafficked into heavily guarded, prison-like compounds, where they are routinely abused and tortured for failing to meet targets, or extorted for ransoms. Others take the jobs willingly, but find that they cannot repay ruinous charges for food and accommodation. Their work requires them to be connected to the outside world round the clock, yet they are too terrified to seek help because of the surveillance and violence they endure.Reports of people being forced into criminality in online scam centres in south-east Asia first emerged in 2018. Five years later, the UN Human Rights Office reported that120,000 peoplehad been forced to carry out online scams in Myanmar alone, with another 100,000 in Cambodia. The Cambodian police boast that theyrounded up 3,000 suspectsfrom 19 countries this summer, in their biggest crackdown yet.But scam centres have now been identified in Serbia, Peru,Pakistan, central Africa and most recentlyTimor-Leste. One NGO worker told the authors of Scam that a common scenario might be “a Chinese perpetrator residing in Cambodia [using] a trafficked Filipino individual to deceive a US citizen, using credit cards from Dubai for money laundering”.The trafficking ofWang Xing, a Chinese actor, to Myanmar in January highlighted the brazenness of these criminals. But as China and others turn up the heat, the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crimewarnsthat syndicates are targeting individuals from countries with limited diplomatic or consular resources, citing more than 700 Ethiopian nationals rescued in Myanmar this year. Satellite internet services and solar power have allowed operators to move to remoter areas. Deepfake technology is opening up new avenues for scamming.Corrupt officials, from local police to senior politicians, allow these enterprises to thrive. When victims are rescued, authorities frequently prosecute them as scammers or fine them for immigration offences. Assistance may come instead from white-hat hackers, local NGOs or business people from the victim’s homeland. Remarkably, even some scam targets have put aside their anger and helped those tasked with exploiting them after learning the full story.Criminal syndicates prosper by extracting and exploiting data, and working across transnational boundaries to evade control. To fight them, governments must share intelligence and target networks, not isolated compounds. Cooperation needs civil society – yet China and others distrust it. Technology companies must stop their platforms being used for organised crime; WhatsApp recentlydeleted 6.8m accountslinked to online scam centres. Above all, however, authorities must ensure that traumatised victims are not punished as perpetrators.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But it would be a mistake to imagine that those who hold to the church’s traditional teaching on the ordering of ministry are simply “misogynistic”.Anglican orthodoxy does not rest on hostility to women; it rests on a particular reading of scripture and Catholic order that long predates today’s culture wars.The traditionalists are not motivated by prejudice but by theological conviction, namely that ministry is representative before God, not a question of aptitude or value. One may disagree with that conviction, but to dismiss it as bigotry is to substitute moral outrage for argument.What has damaged the Church of England most in recent years is not honest theological difference but the intolerance of it. A broad church only remains broad if conscience is protected and disagreement allowed.It would be a genuine sign of renewal if the new archbishop could model a gracious, theologically literate unity. This does not entail erasing those who dissent, but proving that conviction and courtesy can still coexist in public religion. That, more than denunciation, might even persuade the rising generation that Christian faith is still capable of intellectual depth and moral seriousness.Rev Simon JonesBarrow in Furness, CumbriaHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

This is why I did it, 8 October).This may be so, though such a power will be minuscule, filtered not only by official censorship but by the knowledge that any truly challenging topic will not be broached. The understanding is that performers will not rock the boat, so it seems uncompelling to justify participation on the basis that the boat might be slightly rocked in vague and inoffensive ways.There is also a dismissal of the idea that very highly paid comics like Dave Chappelle would perform for the money. Yet plenty of very wealthy people pursue opportunities for more wealth. Another participant explicitly said he was offered enough money to “look the other way”.Finally, Djalili says that perhaps people should visit the region first before criticising it. That’s a nice sentiment, but my existence as a queer person is criminalised inSaudi Arabia, subject to corporal and even capital punishment. Visitation is neither safe nor advisable.When a public figure enters a contract with a host, it is an association of mutual benefit. The host here is guilty of heinous abuses of human rights and the murder of people like me. And the benefit that it sees from these bookings, I’m afraid, is a laundering of international reputation.Joel SportEaling, LondonOmid Djalili’s defence that performing in Riyadh helps “broaden what’s thinkable” is deeply naive. His attempt to shift the moral burden on to critics, implying that they simply don’t understand nuance, or that they’re just bitter they weren’t invited, is smug and dismissive.By appearing at a state-sponsored festival, he helps sanitise a government that still jails critics and represses basic freedoms. A few laughs in a controlled environment don’t challenge that reality, they just help an oppressive regime whitewash itself as progressive while silencing dissent elsewhere.Comedy can be brave, but not when it’s curated by those in power, who invite only uncritical voices to perform. After refusing Saudi gigs for 15 years, what changed – the regime​ or Djalili’s willingness to look away?Peter BurgessLiverpoolI agree wholeheartedly with Omid Djalili’s position. I went toLibyain 2006 during the Gaddafi era for work, and I was treated with nothing but respect from ordinary people. They wanted to talk to me, they wanted to practise their English, they wanted to know what my perceptions of Libya were, they wanted to learn about the UK from someone who lived there. They wanted to talk to me about Pink Floyd, for example. It was a powerful reminder, as Djalili says, that the people of a country are not their government.By building stronger cultural links between people of different countries, we stand the best chance in the long run of improving governments around the world. He is also right to point out that change happens by degrees and, by pointing out commonalities in humanity and laughing together about them, we become more willing to listen to each other’s point of view. His audiences in Riyadh may have been mostly young people, but some of them will grow up and have positions in government in future.Mike HerseeLondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

But while Wales gaveBelgiuman early fright, two Kevin De Bruyne penalties and a Thomas Meunier strike paved the way to a comeback victory that all but quashes their hopes of automatically qualifying for the World Cup.Nathan Broadhead, on as a substitute, pulled a goal back but almost immediately Leandro Trossard struck to cap a victory this time featuring just the six goals. Joe Rodon headed in to giveWalesa welcome leg up but Belgium stirred to maintain their pristine qualifying record; their last defeat in a qualifier here in June 2015, when Gareth Bale scored to propel Wales towards Euro 2016. Wales will likely have to do it the hard way if they are to reach North America next summer.Nick Woltemade seals Germany’s win over spirited Northern IrelandRead moreFor Wales, it was a galling rollercoaster of an evening and, as Bellamy acknowledged, they have now breached the Belgium defence five times across two matches with nothing to show for it. “That’s hard to take,” said the Wales manager. “I honestly love playing these top teams because your heart is in your mouth at times, you’re really living on the edge.”For many supporters, the topic of conversation upon departure centred on not another historic night in Cardiff but the sight of Brennan Johnson coaxing a rat off the pitch after Thibaut Courtois failed to get to grips with the invader.Bellamy demanded an intensity from his side to match the electricity in the stands. This stadium played the hits pre-match: Yma o Hyd, Zombie Nation, a light show to boot. The players emerged to a giant banner strewn across the Canton Stand: “Tan Yn Eu Gwaed (Fire in their Blood), Welshmen will not yield.”View image in fullscreenA rat evades Thibaut Courtois during the World Cup qualifier in Cardiff.Photograph: Charlotte Wilson/Offside/Getty ImagesThere was a typically rousing anthem, too, for which the captain Ben Davies – on his 100th cap – stood with his eldest son by his side and his youngest resting over his left shoulder. Davies applied his game face, though his eyes appeared watery. Who could blame him?Wales arrived to the pitch turbocharged, Bellamy applauding as Mark Harris, the Oxford striker preferred to Johnson, who entered approaching the hour, forced Zeno Debast into a panicked clearance inside two and a half minutes. Wales were everything they were notin the opening stages at Wembley last Thursdayand they led inside eight minutes, an unmarked Rodon heading in a delicious Sorba Thomas corner, their third in relatively quick succession. Rodon rushed off in celebration, his rusty knee slide leaving him on his backside, every outfield player joining the party.For seven minutes, Wales were in dreamland – until the German referee, Daniel Siebert, headed to the VAR monitor, to take a look at a potential handball by Ethan Ampadu. A communal groan followed the initial hush and then Siebert pointed to the penalty spot. Ampadu was penalised for his right hand halting Charles De Ketelaere’s dink and a couple of minutes later De Bruyne sent Karl Darlow the wrong way from 12 yards.Bellamy was booked for his explicit protestations and will subsequently serve a touchline ban in Liechtenstein next month. Suddenly the place was deflated and Belgium breezed through the gears, chiefly Jérémy Doku. Trossard punched a diagonal pass out towards the right flank and while Wales considered it a lost cause, Doku did not and retrieved the ball from close to the corner flag. The Manchester City winger gobbled up about 40 yards of turf but that was nothing compared to Meunier, who flew forward from inside his own half to send a first-time finish zooming past Darlow. From there things threatened to unravel, Rodon preventing Trossard from a near-certain third goal and then De Bruyne blasted over after Doku left Ben Cabango in a heap.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He proved virtually unstoppable in Brussels in June and was a constant menace again here. His next magic trick? Slipping the ball through the legs of Davies, who had James with him in support, and racing to the byline to fashion another chance. Doku wasted a chance to establish some breathing space in the 69th minute, sending a shot too close to a grateful Darlow when looking for the far corner.Davies was forced off through injury a minute later and just as it seemed Wales had settled, De Bruyne was standing over another spot-kick with 15 minutes of regular time to play. Trossard found himself cornered by red shirts, but James made a brainless decision to intercept the ball with his right arm. De Bruyne dispatched another penalty low, this time into the opposite corner.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersWalesBelgiummatch reportsShareReuse this content"

That alone ensures the 32-year-old’s Lionesses career will leave an indelible mark on English football. Her entry on to the list of England greats had been guaranteed a year earlier, though, as one of the key heroines of the summer of 2022.When Leah Williamson prepared to raise the Euro 2022 trophy at Wembley after England’s victory against Germany had secured the Lionesses’ first major trophy, she chose to angle it slightly into the direction of the woman next to her, Bright, her vice-captain, so they could lift it together, acknowledging Bright’s major contribution. As the pair held aloft the 60cm-high trophy, weighing 6.7kg, Bright’s tattooed forearm was centre stage in front of the white fireworks erupting behind them in a colourful scene of euphoria.WSL talking points: Arsenal face dilemma and Blindkilde Brown gives Wiegman nudgeRead moreWhen Bright wore the armband a year later in Sydney, in the absence of the injured Williamson, her team were not quite able to add another trophy, but their run to the final was historic nonetheless, in a tournament Bright had done well simply to get to, weeks after knee surgery.Bright is a player who prefers to do her talking on the pitch. Members of the media covering the Lionesses have not had much insight into her personality, perhaps best shown in July 2023 at a press conference in Brisbane, when Bright was preparing to captain England in their tournament opener against Haiti.ESPN’s Tom Hamilton asked Bright how it felt to be captaining England at a World Cup; those listening perhaps expected a patriotic or emotional answer, and Bright, focused on the task, said plainly: “Things just stay the same. With or without the armband, my behaviour is the same, my mentality is the same.”View image in fullscreenMillie Bright captained England on their run to the 2023 World Cup final.Photograph: Rick Rycroft/APThat summer it was also usually others such as Lucy Bronze who spoke publicly about issues such as the team’s dispute with the Football Association over commercial deals. Bright’s captaincy was more about crunching tackles and bruising physical duels, which she usually won.Before all that, she was a key figure in the generation of England players that transformed how the Lionesses viewed success, being part of squads that reached the semi-finals at Euro 2017 and at the 2019 World Cup as they built towards glory. It is the lifting of a much smaller trophy, though, that perhaps Lionesses fans will most fondly remember when they think back on Bright’s career, after she became something of a cult hero when thrust up front by Sarina Wiegman for an Arnold Clark Cup game against Germany at Molineux in February 2022.Wiegman’s surprise tactic workedas the defender struck late, with all the composure of a classic centre-forward. The Lionesses recorded a first home-soil victory over Germany and Bright – much to the amusement of fans – collected the golden boot, graciously passed to her by Alexia Putellas after they had tied with two goals each.Bright scored six times across 88 caps. For long spells it had felt certain she would reach a century. Could she have? Bright opted towithdraw from selectionfor last summer’s Euros, where England successfully defended their trophy, saying it was “the right thing for my health and my future” because she felt she could not give 100% mentally or physically. She underwent a knee operation and analysed much of the European Championship on a podcast with her best mate, the former England player Rachel Daly.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Bright later said she was “at peace” with the decision. The main beneficiaries of this retirement could be Chelsea, for whom she continues to play a key role. She will now be able to rest somewhat during international breaks and perhaps extend her career. A Chelsea player since 2014, she has been involved in every major trophy their women’s team have won.As for England, Bright’s experience is something any international setup would miss, but the time may well be right for younger blood to get a chance and, as attention starts to turn towards 2027, perhaps this is an ideal moment for Bright to pass the torch. It feels pretty unlikely – albeit not impossible – that Bright would have been in England’s starting side for the 2027 World Cup in Brazil; the final of that competition will be less than a month before her 35th birthday.The future looks – ahem – bright, when it comes to centre-backs in contention for England, whether it be the Manchester United captain, Maya Le Tissier, 23, the emerging Arsenal centre-back Katie Reid, 19, who has impressed so much in the early stages of this season, or Bright’s Chelsea teammate Brooke Aspin, 20, who is recovering from a knee injury. Esme Morgan, 24, has 16 caps, and the 26-year-old Lotte Wubben-Moy still has plenty to offer, and that’s without mentioning the centre-backs who won this year’s European Championship, Leah Williamson and Jess Carter, along with the Manchester City captain, Alex Greenwood. It is not certainly not a problem position for Wiegman who, fitness permitting, appears spoilt for choice.Explore more on these topicsMillie BrightEngland women's football teamWomen’s Euro 2025Women's World Cup 2023Women's World CupWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The sentiment is not an exclusively American thing. “Attack wins you games, defence win you titles,” Sir Alex Ferguson once said. And he should know, having won quite a lot of them with Manchester United.As England look forward to next summer’sWorld Cup, which will be co-hosted by the US, Canada and Mexico, the idea has come to resonate, mainly because of how miserly they have been at the back under Thomas Tuchel.Why there is no such thing as a perfect football tactic | Jonathan WilsonRead moreThey will secure automatic qualification with two games to spare if they beat Latvia on Tuesday night. It ought not be beyond them given Latvia could only draw 2-2 here with the Group K whipping boys, Andorra, on Saturday. And givenEnglandhave been virtually impregnable in the campaign under Tuchel.The table shows five wins out of five with five clean sheets, Jordan Pickford keeping them all. The goalkeeper returned another last Thursday inthe 3-0 friendly win against Walesat Wembley, his eighth in a row for England, breaking a record he shared with Gordon Banks. You have to go back a year to find the last England game when Pickford conceded;the 2-1 Nations League defeat against Greeceat Wembley. Tuchel’s England have been breached in one match – the3-1 friendly defeat against Senegalin June when Dean Henderson was in goal.That was no slight on Henderson, rather a reflection of Senegal’s superior quality compared with everything else Tuchel has faced. This really cannot be overlooked. Wales are the next-highest country at No 30 while a Serbia team in disarray are 34th. Albania are 66th; Latvia and Andorra well into the triple digits.Drill a little deeper into the numbers and it is hard to ignore the one about how Pickford has been required to make two saves during qualification;one against Latvia, the otheragainst Serbia. But this is not only about Pickford, rather the unit he anchors. As he was quick to point out, it is about the XI as a defensive collective, starting with the captain, Harry Kane, up front.It is about good habits and relationships; the setting of standards. If it is not the glamorous side of the game, the one that excites the fans, it remains fundamental. England were criticised for their lack of spark under Gareth Southgate at Euro 2024. Their resilience almost overcame everything as they conceded four goals en route to the final,which they lost 2-1 against Spain.View image in fullscreenJordan Pickford made his name for England at Russia 2018 with his penalty shootout heroics against Colombia.Photograph: Simon Stacpoole/Offside/Getty Images“What we’ve got is that solid base,” Pickford said. “Once we know we’re defending like that as a unit, it gives us the freedom to go and create chances at the other end. Keeping clean sheets is good, but if you keep having that momentum defensively, you get better positions on the ball and you create more opportunities to score and win the game.”Pickford, who is primed to sign a new long-term contract at Everton, has been the constant in Tuchel’s defensive unit during qualification and it feels as though it is John Stones, who is back to fitness, and Marc Guéhi as the preferred centre-half pairing, with Ezri Konsa also pushing. The worries are in the full-back positions.It seems like a long time ago that Southgate was ribbed for having a right-back fetish. Kyle Walker and Kieran Trippier are out of the picture and Trent Alexander-Arnold does not appear to have Tuchel’s trust. He is also injured at present. Reece James is the first choice, but his fitness problems are well documented; he, too, is out with an injury. Konsa is in line to fill in against Latvia, as he did against Wales.At left-back, Tino Livramento started in the 5-0 away win against Serbia in September, which was surely Tuchel’s biggest game. As such, Livramento is probably the player in possession of the shirt, although he is another injury casualty. Which leaves Djed Spence, who, like Livramento, has been repurposed from right-back, and Myles Lewis-Skelly, who has lost his place in Arsenal’s starting lineup. Tuchel has made clear that he needs Lewis-Skelly to “perform at club level on a regular basis … to just be a good citizen in camp will not be enough to stay the whole year”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But there is a reason why he has remained the undisputed No 1 – his shot-stopping reflexes are excellent and his concentration levels have improved as he has grown in experience. The most recent example came against Wales when he was a virtual bystander for the first 55 minutes and then made two good saves.“I’m always moving with the game,” Pickford said. “I always stay in the moment when I am not doing anything. My coaches used to say: ‘Don’t be bored, don’t go trying to invent work, let the work come to you. If there is a cross 16 yards out, don’t come and think you have to go and do it because you have not done anything for 15 minutes.’ That is something I have definitely learned and there is a big improvement on that side of it.”Of Pickford’s remarkable England statistics, one stands out. He has made a single error that has led to a goal – inthe 2-2 friendly draw against Belgiumin March 2024. He has never let England down. He intends to be the foundation stone for glory.Explore more on these topicsEnglandJordan PickfordWorld Cup 2026World CupWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I pursued and it fell through when word came out that there were investigations going on, so that was difficult. I had to just accept the fate and that this whole process is bigger than me.”Burrell, who played as a centre, leftNewcastleat the end of the 2021‑22 season, after which he made his ­experiences public.An investigation by theRugby Football Unionfound that “on the balance of probability” ­Burrell’s claims were likely true, but it could not definitively prove that most of the abuse happened at Newcastle.The club later said that the only proven incidents during his time there, which involved racist messages in a players’ WhatsApp group and incidents on an away day and a night out, were “gravely concerning” and “incredibly disappointing”, but that they were unable to take disciplinary action against ­individuals due to “no further actionable ­evidence” such as names or dates being provided.Burrell said much of the racism he experienced was “something that’s dressed up as banter” and that he had also experienced “several traumatic experiences” while playing for England, for whom he made 15 appearances between 2014 and 2016. Burrell also said there were “undertones of discrimination” throughout English rugby.Explore more on these topicsRugby unionRaceNewcastleEngland rugby union teamRugby Football UnionnewsShareReuse this content"

The final will be held on 23 November at Butlin’s Minehead Resort, which will also be hosting the 2025 Players Championship Finals.Rather than taking some downtime after winning what he admitted had been a “brutal” double-start event in Leicester, Littler was back on the oche at the Robin Park Leisure Centre on Monday afternoon as part of the 128-strong field.The 18-year-old, who has also won the UK Open and World Matchplay this season to close on Humphries’ world No 1 ranking, had no trouble in progressing from the initial round-robin stage, with the players split into 32 groups of four and the top two advancing to the knockout rounds.View image in fullscreenThe defending world youth champion, Gian van Veen (right), lost to Luke Littler at last week’s World Grand Prix event.Photograph: Carl Recine/Getty ImagesLittler saw off Tom Garfield 6-2, averaging 102, before dispatching Ireland’s Ronan McDonagh 6-1 to move into the last 16. Charlie Manby – who is fourth on the PDC Development Tour rankings – led Littler 5-3 only for the world No 2 to reel off the final three legs.The quarter-final against Jamai van den Herik proved less dramatic, as Littler built on a fast start to close out a 6-1 win – but an expected repeat of the 2023 final with Van Veen was denied by Greaves’ exceptional display, as she became the first woman to reach the world youth championship final.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSport in FocusFree weekly newsletterSign up to Sport in FocusEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

To date, York’s International Stakes, in 2020 and 2024, is the only British race to finish at the top of the pile.Gewan denies Aidan O’Brien record with shock 25-1 Dewhurst Stakes triumphRead moreAscot’s executives will quietly fancy their chances this year, however, after three of the top 12 horses worldwide at any distance all stood their ground for Saturday’s £1.3m Champion Stakes at Monday’s five-day stage.Ombudsman,currently top of the global rankings on 128thanks tohis emphatic success in the International Stakesin August, faces a decider in his head-to-head with Delacroix, who beat him in the Eclipse and went on to win the Irish Champion Stakes. But it is far from a two-horse race with Calandagan,the King George winner, and Almaqam, the only horse apart from Delacroix to beat Ombudsman this year, also in the mix alongside William Haggas’s Economics, the Irish Champion Stakes winner last year.The best news of all for racegoers and armchair fans alike, meanwhile, is that the weather forecast remains dry and settled before a Champions Day card that will feature five Group One races for the first time, following the upgrade of the Long Distance Cup from Group Two status.It is also a seven-race card for the first time this year, following the addition of a £250,000 two-year-old contest as the opening race, and all five Group Ones received supplementary entries on Monday as owners and trainers were encouraged by the prospect of decent racing ground and, in the case of the three events on the round course, the certainty that there will be no switch to the hurdles track, a last resort that has been forced on the track three times since 2019.View image in fullscreenDelacroix, ridden by Christophe Soumillon (left), on the way to winning the Irish Champion Stakes at Leopardstown in September 2025.Photograph: Damien Eagers/PAThe Champions Day card this year will be the 15th since the Champion Stakes itself was moved from Newmarket – amid much grumbling from the traditional wing of racing’s fanbase – to be the climax of Britain’s richest day at the races, and an equivalent of Champions Weekend in Ireland and Arc weekend in Paris in the nation that gave racing to the world.It was mightily blessed by the presence of Frankel in both its inaugural year in 2011 and then a year later, when the greatest horse of modern times bowed out in the feature event. There were just two Group Ones on the schedule until the Fillies & Mares event got an upgrade in 2013, and the Sprint became the card’s fourth Group One two years later, but Saturday’s seven-race card is arguably the first with the full range and depth of quality to stand serious comparison with the showpiece meetings in France and Ireland.And in a good year, like this one, it certainly holds its own. In addition to the star-studded Champion Stakes, the likely attractions on Saturday include Field Of Gold, joint-second in the global rankings, in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes, and Lazzat, second in the sprint ratings, in the Champions Sprint. Trawlerman, meanwhile, is officially the world’s best stayer this year, and should prove the point in what is, admittedly, a slightly underwhelming six-horse field for the Long Distance Cup.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Tuesday racing tipsShowLingfield Park1.30 Manila Mist 2.00 Hashtagnotions 2.30 Eternal Solace 3.00 Kilkenny Warrior 3.30 Baikal 4.00 Saxonia 4.31 Spitzbergen 5.05 Forever My Prince 5.40 Hedge Fund (nb)Leicester1.44 Supreme Dancer 2.14 Storm Esme 2.44 Figjam 3.14 Amused 3.44 Song N Dance 4.14 Platinum Prince 4.44 Sixtygeesbaby (nap) 5.15 Guinness LadMarket Rasen1.51 Un Sens A La Vie 2.21 Country Park 2.51 Indemnity 3.21Tankardstown Diva 3.51 Lunar Discovery 4.21 Independent Jimmy 4.55 Luna GraceNewcastle4.50 Alobayyah 5.25 Up The Jazz 6.00 Starmade 6.30 Fizzy Cristal 7.00 Rain Cap 7.30 Medway Queen 8.00 Raatea 8.30 Second FiddleWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The problem that still faces Champions Day, however, even in what could now be seen as its fully fledged form, is that key factors which determine its year-to-year success are beyond the organisers’ control. It is still sandwiched uncomfortably between the Arc and the Breeders’ Cup, both of which offer significantly high prize money, while the latter event at least comes with an effective guarantee of fast ground.At Ascot in mid-October, by contrast, 12 of the 14 renewals of the Champion Stakes since the switch from Newmarket have been run on ground with “soft” in the going description.The Irish Champions Festival in Ireland attracted 20,000 spectators over two days this year, around 10,000 fewer than Ascot will get on Saturday. Yet it remains firmly entrenched on the September weekend that, in an ideal world, Champions Day would probably occupy, giving owners the chance to run at Ascot, Longchamp and then the Breeders’ Cup.Fair play to Ireland – they got there first. But it is also another reason why we should appreciate Saturday’s exceptional Champions Day programme all the more – because it could be a long wait before the stars align in quite the same way again.Explore more on these topicsHorse racingTalking HorsesHorse racing tipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Stokes missed the fifth Test against India with a shoulder injury, however, while Wood sat out the entire English summer following knee surgery back in March.Winter is coming: England’s cricketers fly out for long tour that will decide Ashes and World CupRead moreThings appear to be coming together, at least, with the pair recently training in the heated outdoor nets at Loughborough alongside their Durham teammate, Brydon Carse. While Cummins says he is “unlikely” to be ready for the first Test in Perth that starts on 21 November due to his lower back stress issue, England could have a full complement of seamers at their disposal.Carse said: “Ben is looking near enough 100% fit and so is Mark. I’ve been bowling with them. It’s exciting to see where they have got to after their setbacks during the summer. They will be raring to go come Australia time.”As for his own knowledge of Australia, Carse was part of a successful Lions tour back in 2019-20 and conditions should not be alien. The chief difference this time – beyond the quality of opposition – will be the presence of bumper crowds and thus some possible verbals on the boundary’s edge.“100%” replied Carse, when asked if he was ready for this. “The way I play my cricket, I wear my heart on my sleeve. I wouldn’t be expecting anything less and I’m looking forward to the challenge.”The 30-year-old has also shown himself to be pretty adept with the Kookaburra ball, claiming 27 wickets in five Tests with it last winter. After a summer that then returned nine at 60 runs apiece against India, it may be that his style of muscular heft is better suited to away tours.“We played on some pretty batter-friendly wickets against India,” Carse added. “At times I felt I deserved more than I got. I might not have got the rewards, but I’m not looking too far into it going into the winter.View image in fullscreenBrydon Carse (right) will play in all formats this winter and is looking forward to the challenge of an away Ashes series.Photograph: Adam Davy/PA“I like bowling with the Kookaburra ball. It feels more comfortable in the hand than the Dukes. I think it’s just personal preference. Sometimes the Dukes can have quite a pronounced seam and feels quite big in your hand. The Kookaburra can be slightly smaller but slightly wider.”While Stokes and Wood remain in the UK, Carse is part of the England white-ball squad that touched down in Queenstown, New Zealand over the weekend before the three-match T20 series gets under way in Christchurch on Saturday.A tour that also features three ODIs against the Black Caps, it should primarily inform plans for the T20 World Cup in India next February. But as England’s final slab of international cricket before the Ashes, it is also a chance for a player such as Jacob Bethell to make a point.“I think my game’s pretty suited to Australian conditions in terms of a bit more bounce,” said Bethell, speaking at the Toyota-sponsored PCA Awards last week. “I’ve had a little think about the challenge. But the first port of call is New Zealand, so that’s where my eyes are at.“Form is a big thing in sport. So, yeah, I’ll just try and put in performances to win games for England. And if that does end up in an Ashes call-up into the XI, then I’ll be taking that with both hands, hopefully.”The No 3 position appears the one spot in England’s Test top seven that is still up for debate, with Ollie Pope the mainstay these past three years but coming off an India series that rather summed up his career at large. A ninth Test century in the opening Test at Headingley felt like a statement at the time, only for the returns to again tail off.At the same time – and despite impressing at No 3 against New Zealand last December – Bethell was experiencing a stop-start season that, after a one-off outing against India, only truly kicked into gear during the ODIs in September witha maiden professional century against South Africa.Though made easier by the recent change of Test vice-captaincy, England have a decision to make here: stick with Pope’s experience at first drop or lean into a 21-year-old with a backfoot game that appears suited to Australia – but whose back catalogue has more gaps.“I’m actually not very happy with the summer I had,” said Bethell. “But it’s something that has kind of lit a fire in me, I’m looking to build on that.“Me and Popey get on great. I wouldn’t really call it a rivalry – there’s a lot of talk of outside noise but it doesn’t really filter into the camp. We practise really well together. He’s obviously the batter in contention for that No 3 spot. He’s got that spot and he’s done unbelievably well.”Explore more on these topicsAshes 2025 - 26CricketThe AshesEngland cricket teamAustralia cricket teamBen StokesnewsShareReuse this content"

Wane, however, was unmoved by suggestions Connor should have been in his squad. When asked how tough that decision was, he said: “Not really difficult.“He’s a very good player is Jake and I spoke to him in the week and he’ll be available for the World Cup next year. When picking a squad, the thing you will never hear from me is ‘he’s won the Man of Steel’.“I don’t pay attention to stuff like that. I don’t know who’s in the [Super League] Dream Team for example.

While his report was seen as central to Tory efforts to win over economically insecure Labour voters, it was largely mothballed as the party cycled through prime ministers.He also held the role as the government’s head of labour market enforcement between 2019 and 2021, but sharply attacked the Tories for backsliding on its pledges to protect workers from unscrupulous employment practices.Taylor told the Guardian Starmer’s government had the potential to make progress after the Tories had reneged on their promises.“I think it was quite clear that the previous government had not got that balance right, [and] I think this government is going to get that balance right,” he said.“Flexible work will always have an important role in our economy, but it mustn’t be at the price of the insecurity and unfairness towards workers.”Hiring Taylor – one of the country’s leading employment experts – is expected to underscore Labour’s commitment to bolstering workplace rights despite mounting pressure from businesses for the party to water down planned changes.Bosses have warned the government’s landmark employment rights bill, which includes banning zero-hours contracts and day-one rights protecting against unfair dismissal, will drive up unemployment and hurt the economy.Business groups have ramped up their lobbying before Rachel Reeves’s 26 November budget, amid criticism that the chancellor added to a slowdown in the jobs market by raising taxes on employment in last year’s budget.Ministers have, though, insisted the bill will be enacted “in full” amid intense pressure from trade unions and leftwing MPs fearful that Keir Starmer’s government will backslide on the legislation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The justice secretary, David Lammy, then ruled out the measure last week.Kate Dearden, who replaced Madders last month, said Labour was “absolutely committed” to boosting workers’ rights.“We’ll always listen carefully to feedback from businesses and from trade unions, because we want to ensure this legislation works for workers and employers alike. That’s why it’s pro-business, it’s pro-worker, and pro-growth,” she said.The creation of the Fair Work Agency, however, comes amid questions over the resourcing and the capacity of the government to oversee its tougher approach to the enforcement of its package of workers’ rights.While drawing together thefunctions and powers of the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority, along with other existing enforcement responsibilities, to create the Fair Work Agency, experts believe extra resources are also likely to be required.Explore more on these topicsEconomicsLabournewsShareReuse this content"

The three-month hearing that opened at London’s high court on Monday will focus on vehicles sold by five manufacturers – Mercedes, Ford, Renault, Nissan and Peugeot/Citroën – from 2009. In “real world” conditions, when driven on the road, lawyers argue, the cars produced much higher levels of emissions.The judgment on the five lead defendants will also bind other manufacturers including Jaguar Land Rover, Vauxhall/Opel, Volkswagen/Porsche, BMW, FCA/Suzuki, Volvo, Hyundai-Kia, Toyota and Mazda, whose cases are not being heard to reduce the case time and costs.Opening the case for the claimants, Thomas de la Mare KC said: “Each player in the industry basically took a conscious decision that customer convenience, which helped the industry sell more cars, was more important than reducing pollutants causing death.”In written submissions, the claimants quoted a Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air report that found excess NOx emissions had caused 124,000 premature deaths in the UK and Europe between 2009 and 2024.De la Mare told the high court levels of emissions could have easily been reduced had vehicles had larger tanks for AdBlue – an additive that cuts NOx in diesel vehicles – and asked customers to refill them. Instead, he said: “They have basically said the concern about making these cars sellable by removing these inconveniences is so strong … that we would rather cheat than comply with the law.”The lead barrister also told the judge, Mrs Justice Cockerill, that manufacturers were trying to argue that numerous prior dieselgate rulings abroad, including in the US and European court of justice, did not apply to the UK. He said: “Our position is broadly that we will rely on foreign regulatory decisions as a matter of fact, rather than an opinion on law.”He said the defendants’ argument meant that “mainland GB becomes a sort of defeat device Brexit Island … But Northern Ireland is applying case law that you’re being asked to put in the bin.”Internal training and briefing documents from Ford in 2010 on defeat devices showed that “the manufacturers could and did understand the law exactly as we do now”, De la Mare said.Lawyers for the defendants will make opening statements later this week. The car manufacturers deny having used prohibited defeat devices.In written submissions, lawyers for Renault said the case was “riddled with errors and misunderstandings, especially about the design and operation of the vehicles’ emission control systems” while Ford’s said it was “scientifically illiterate”.Mercedes said the claimants case was “obsessively focused” on NOx pollution rather than other emissions, and did not “acknowledge the complexity” of diesel engineering. Lawyers for Nissan said the case’s central legal premise was “an untenably broad reading of defeat device”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A judgment is expected next summer, with a further trial for possible compensation following.Adam Kamenetzky, from south London, a lead claimant among the 1.6 million owners, told the Guardian outside court: “For the first time, certainly in the UK if not in any jurisdiction, the evidence is actually being made public.“If these allegations are borne out, consumers were deceived at the point of sale, and there needs to be action taken to prevent this kind of deception being built into cars.”Clean air campaigners including Mums for Lungs and Rosamund Adoo-Kissi-Debrah, whose daughter Ella’s death was the first to be officially linked to air pollution, demonstrated outside court.Adoo-Kissi-Debrah said that “illegal pollution from diesel vehicles has caused thousands of premature deaths in the UK,” adding that she hoped for a “day of reckoning” over the use of the fuel.The landmark claims have been brought by more than 20 law firms, led by Leigh Day and Pogust Goodhead. Leigh Day’s senior partner Martyn Day said the claims, “if proven, would demonstrate one of the most egregious breaches of corporate trust in modern times”.Alicia Alinia, the chief executive of Pogust Goodhead, said the case would go “the heart of corporate accountability and environmental justice”.Explore more on these topicsAutomotive industryAutomotive emissionsPollutionAir pollutionnewsShareReuse this content"

They told him he must present himself at the entrance of LaSanté prison in the south of Parison 21 October to begin his sentence.The 70-year-old will be the first French postwar leader and the first former head of a European Union country to go to jail. He had already become the first former French head of state forced to wear an electronic tag after being convicted in aseparate case of corruption and influence peddlingover illegal attempts to secure favours from a judge. In that case, he was given a one-year jail term but was able to serve it with an electronic tag worn around the ankle. He wore the tag for three months before being granted conditional release.Sarkozy, who denied wrongdoing and having being part of acriminal conspiracyto seek election funding from Libya for his victorious 2007 presidential campaign, has appealed against his conviction. A new trial is expected in about six months. But the nature of Sarkozy’s prison sentence means he must go to jail as his appeal process plays out.Sarkozy was reported to have hosted 100 friends and former collaborators in Paris last week at a sort of goodbye party before going to prison.Le Figarosaid he had told guests he was innocent and should never have been found guilty. Talking about prison, he reportedly said: “I will ask for no advantages. When there is a cross to bear, you must bear it to the end.”Sarkozy is expected to have his own individual prison cell, with one hour’s exercise a day and three visits a week.La Santé prison has held some of Frances’s most famous prisoners in its 158-year history, including the terroristCarlos the Jackaland the war criminalMaurice Papon. Sarkozy is likely to be held in a special wing for vulnerable prisoners, which some call the VIP wing.It affords more privacy to prisoners, who are placed in individual cells of 9 sq metres and kept separate from other prisoners when exercising. Patrick Balkany, the former rightwing mayor of Levallois-Perret and one-time friend of Sarkozy, was held in that wing in 2019 after a conviction for tax fraud. He described to Paris Match how the isolation was psychologically demanding, but it spared him from being photographed by other prisoners.Sarkozy was found guilty of criminal conspiracy but acquitted of three separate charges of corruption, misuse of Libyan public funds and illegal election campaign funding. The public prosecutor had told the court that Sarkozy entered into a “Faustian pact of corruption with one of the most unspeakable dictators of the last 30 years” to gain election funding from Gaddafi.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A similar plan was presented at the White House where some briefing room spots were given to podcasters and other representatives of non-traditional media.Pentagon demands journalists sign pledge not to gather certain informationRead moreOn Monday, theWashington Postjoined the New York Times, CNN, the Atlantic, the Guardian, Reuters, the Associated Press, NPR, HuffPost and trade publication Breaking Defense in saying it would not sign on to the agreement.Matt Murray, the Post’s executive editor, said the policy runs counter to constitutional guarantees of freedom of the press.“The proposed restrictions undercut First Amendment protections by placing unnecessary constraints on gathering and publishing information,”Murray wrotein a statement published on X. “We will continue to vigorously and fairly report on the policies and positions of the Pentagon and officials across the government.”The Atlantic, which became embroiled in a dispute with Pentagon and White House officials earlier this year after editor Jeffrey Goldberg was accidentally added to a group chat on Signal,saidit “fundamentally” opposes the new restrictions.The new policy “constrains how journalists can report on the U.S. military, which is funded by nearly $1 trillion in taxpayer dollars annually,”a New York Times statementsaid. “The public has a right to know how the government and military are operating,” wrote the Times Washington bureau chief, Richard Stevenson.Hegseth responded on social media to statements from the Atlantic, the Post and the Times by posting a single emoji of a hand waving goodbye. Later, the defense secretary, a former Fox weekend anchor,posted a liston X of what he called “press credentialing FOR DUMMIES: Press no longer roams free Press must wear visible badge Credentialed press no longer permitted to solicit criminal acts”. He also reposted a cartoon that depicted the Atlantic as a crying baby.Reuters alsoannouncedon Monday that “our journalists will not sign the revised press pass policy”, calling the Pentagon’s new restrictions an affront to “the press protections afforded by the US constitution, the unrestricted flow of information and journalism that serves the public interest without fear or favour”.National Public Radio’s editor-in-chief, Thomas Evans,said: “We will not sign the administration’s restrictive policy that asks reporters to undermine their commitment of providing trustworthy, independent journalism to the American public.”“The restrictions secretary Hegseth is attempting to place on the press are flatly unconstitutional,” Whitney Snyder, HuffPost’s editor-in-chief, said ina statement. “HuffPost will not agree to a document clearly aimed at snuffing out actual news-gathering at the nation’s largest and best-funded federal department.”Some righ-leaning outlets have also declined to sign the document. “Newsmax has no plans to sign the letter,” the network toldthe New York Times reporter Erik Wemple. “We are working in conjunction with other media outlets to resolve the situation. We believe the requirements are unnecessary and onerous and hope that the Pentagon will review the matter further.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s some of the states that have claimed to be the strongest supporters of human rights defenders including the UK, Germany, France and the US, that are most often repressing climate activists and where the right to protest is being denigrated and delegitimized.“These big countries spew out the rhetoric about 1.5C, but they don’t mean it. They are playing the game to suit themselves. It’s business as usual,” Lawlor said in an interview with the Guardian.I was an independent observer in the Greenpeace trial. What I saw was shocking | Steven DonzigerRead moreLawlor will presentthe penultimate report of her six-year mandate,“Tipping points: Human rights defenders, climate change and a just transition”, to the UN general assembly on 16 October.It documents state repression including police violence and surveillance, civil litigation deployed to deliberately wear down and silence climate defenders known as Slapp (strategic lawsuits against public participation), as well as bogus criminal charges ranging from sedition, criminal defamation, terrorism and conspiracy to trespass, to public disorder and to disobedience.In December 2023, the Just Stop Oil member Stephen Gingell became the first person to be jailed underthe UK’s new public order legislation aftertaking part for 30 minutes in a peaceful slow-march protest on a London road.“The UK is leading by bad example, abusing the international standards to which it itself agreed by bringing in these draconian laws that are designed to stop protest against any of the issues that are uncomfortable for the UK government.”In the US, about 1,000 criminal cases were brought in Minnesota against people involved in non-violent actions against the Line 3 oil pipeline, including charges of attempted assisted suicide and trespass on critical infrastructure. While most cases were eventually dismissed oroverturned,legitimate concerns about Indigenous lands, environmental harm and climate impacts were ignored and the pipeline began operations in 2021.The criminalization of Line 3 protesters mirrored the repression seen during the 2016 Indigenous-led movement against the Dakota Access pipeline in the US. “Both instances entailed close collaboration between the companies involved and the police, indicating the adoption of a blueprint for the repression of climate activism in the United States,” the report states.The Guardian has previously reported on a criminalization playbook used against climate and environmental activists, that is being adopted and sharedin the USandinternationally.One trend documented by Lawlor is the conflation of non-violent climate action with terrorism. In 2022, the French minister of interior at the time, and current minister of justice, accused the national environmental movement Les Soulèvements de la Terre of “ecoterrorism”. The government sought to close down the group, but the country’s highest administrative court eventually overturned the effort.Lawlor is adamant that climate activists are human rights defenders. They use non-violent protest, disruptive civil disobedience and litigation to stop fossil fuel projects and pressure elected officials to take meaningful action precisely because they are trying to protect the right to food, clean water, health, life and a healthy environment.“These people are exercising the right to defend human rights. Of course some climate groups are disruptive, but that’s because they tried so hard for so long to use normal run of the mill techniques to achieve change, and the government did nothing. Look at change throughout the century by people like Martin Luther King and Gandhi, civil disobedience is sometimes necessary,” said Lawlor, who is the founder and former executive director ofFront Line Defendersand former director of the Irish branch of Amnesty International.But it’s not just fossil fuels.Human rightsare now being targeted in the rush for critical minerals and new sources of non-fossil energy. The same repressive playbook is being used by governments and private companies involved in land grabs, pollution and Indigenous rights violations in pursuit of a green transition.In Vietnam, which has committed itself to a just transition and net-zero emissions by 2050, the environmental lawyer Dang Dinh Bach was sentenced to five years in prison in January 2022 on bogus charges of tax evasion. Bach, who is among several climate activists imprisoned in Vietnam after advocating for the transition away from coal, is a victim of arbitrary detention,according to UN experts.In Kenya, police fired rubber bullets and teargas at villagers in Uyombo in 2024, who were peacefully protesting against construction of a nuclear power plant facility on their land without consent.“Governments are repressing human rights defenders and the current trajectory is incompatible with the realization of human rights for all. It’s just a road to destruction … I think states are behaving in a criminal fashion,” Lawlor said.On Thursday Lawlor will repeat calls on governments to stop treating climate defenders like enemies, and instead work with them on a just transition to prevent climate catastrophe.“No system, no power, no government, no big company seeking profit should trump the rights of billions of people in the world. And that’s what’s happening. It’s the rich, the powerful that are creating such a disaster for humanity.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisUnited NationsHuman rightsProtestinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Continued failure to protect them puts our collective prosperity at risk.“We already know what works to stop forest loss, but countries, companies, and investors are only scratching the surface. And even those initial efforts are facing strong pushback from the standard bearers of an economic system built on forest destruction.”Behind the grim trend is a grotesque imbalance between the finances devoted to extraction and conservation. Agricultural industries, which have been responsible for 85% of forest loss over the past decade, have received average annual subsidies worth $409bn (£307bn). This is almost 70 times more than the $5.9bn of international public finance provided each year for forest protection and restoration.“Efforts to protect forests don’t stand a chance as long as our economic system keeps rewarding quick profits from forest destruction,” said Franziska Haupt, a partner at Climate Focus. “To truly tackle deforestation, leaders must work collectively to implement bold, binding reforms that will transform the system that still generously rewards forest loss.”How the world’s taste for soya is eating Brazil’s AmazonRead moreA growing cause of alarm is the spread of fire, which hit staggeringly high levels in the Amazon last year after record droughts turned swathes of the normally moist tropical rainforest into a tinderbox. Many blazes are started deliberately to clear land and spread out of control.The carbon dioxide released by the burning Amazon last year was seven times higher than the average over the previous two years and more than the total greenhouse gas emissions of Germany. The authors of the report said the fires were pushing the forest closer to a point of no return.Private financial institutions are further tipping the balance. A separate report released by Global Witness found that banks have made $26bn from financing deforesting companies since the Paris agreement was signed in 2015 – averaging around $7m every day.US banks, led by Vanguard, JPMorgan Chase and BlackRock, earned the most globally, making $5.4bn, according to the watchdog group, based on data from the Dutch research consultancy Profundo.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Chinese financial institutions also secured $1.2bn, despite the country’s green finance policy supposedly restricting lending for companies with environmental or social governance concerns.“We are witnessing major banks bankroll a fire sale of the world’s rainforests,” said Global Witness forests lead Alexandria Reid. “And they’re reaping obscene profits from the ashes.“As long as tearing down forests remains more profitable than protecting them, the world will not meet its 2030 goal to halt deforestation, with catastrophic consequences for the climate. If world leaders want to change this, they must act now to shut down the profits fuelling this crisis.”Hopes for change are focused onnext month’s Cop30 in Belém, the first climate summit to be held in the Amazon. The host, Brazil, has shown in the past that it can dramatically slow the speed of deforestation by stricter enforcement of the law. At Cop30, it will also be proposing a new conservation funding mechanism, the Tropical Forests Forever Facility, which aims to raise $125bn for countries that preserve their standing forests.“The overall numbers are dismal, but the future of forests doesn’t have to be,” said Matson. “New finance initiatives such as the TFFF offer a path to transformative change. IfCop30delivers on its promise, we could be reporting a very different story next year – one of real progress.”For this to work, financial institutions also need to step up. They are expected to buy bonds worth fourth-fifths of the $125bn that the TFFF hopes to raise. This might help them allay growing criticism that they areprofiting from destruction.Elisabeth Hoch, the international portfolio lead at Climate & Company, which is part of the coalition that produced the forest assessment, said only 40% of financial institutions have a deforestation policy, even though forests are worth $150tn a year in economic value.“I want companies and financial institutions to leave the Cop feeling, ‘I must do something or I will be losing out,’” Hoch said. “Cop can generate momentum. It depends on whether financial institutions finally have the guts to do something about this.”Explore more on these topicsDeforestationCop30BrazilConservationTrees and forestsClimate crisisAmazon rainforestnewsShareReuse this content"

It has benefited from the huge growth in the industry, commanding hefty option fees from renewable energy developers to secure areas of the seabed to build their windfarms.It made a£1.1bn profit in its financial year ended in March, double its level just two years ago.King Charles to receive £132m next year after crown estate makes £1.1bn profitRead moreWill McCallum, co-executive director at Greenpeace UK, said the estate should be “managing the seabed in the interest of the nation and the common good, not as an asset to be milked for profit and outrageous bonuses”.“We should leave no stone unturned in looking for solutions to lower energy bills that are causing misery to millions of households,” he said.“Given how crucial affordable bills and clean energy are to the government’s agenda, the chancellor should use her powers of direction to ask for an independent review of how these auctions are run. If the problem isn’t fixed before the next round, we may need to let a court decide whether or not what’s happening is lawful.”Greenpeace argues the crown estate has a legal duty not to exploit its monopoly position as owner of the seabed around England, Wales and Northern Ireland, but that it is now in breach of this.The lobby group said it was concerned the crown estate was rationing supply of the seabed to protect high prices, and argued this could harm the development of offshore wind power in the UK.The crown estate has reportedly rejected Greenpeace’s claims, arguing the lobby group has misinterpreted the estate’s legal duties.About 12% of crown estate profits flow to the monarchy through the sovereign grant to fund its work. This was lowered from 25% in 2023 to offset the rise in profits from offshore wind projects.The UK’s wind industry is at a critical juncture as the government plans todouble onshore windand quadruple offshore wind power capacity by the end of the decade.The crown estate, which also includes a portfolio ofLondonproperties and rural real estate, is worth £15bn. The property assets in London, which is concentrated around Regent Street and St James’s, are valued at £7.1bn.A spokesperson for the crown estate said: “Greenpeace has misunderstood the crown estate’s legal duties and leasing processes. Option fees are not fixed by the crown estate. They are set by the developers through open, competitive auctions and reflect market appetite at the time. As our net revenue is returned to the Treasury, option fees help to ensure that taxpayers benefit from the requisite value from the development of our scarce and precious seabed resource.“The crown estate is accelerating offshore wind in line with government policy to move forward the energy transition at pace and improve energy security.”A Treasury spokesperson said the crown estate “operates independently and makes its own commercial decisions”, adding that “every penny of profit [that] goes to the Treasury … [helps] pay for vital public services like schools and hospitals”.Explore more on these topicsEnergy industryCrown estateGreenpeaceKing Charles IIIMonarchyRenewable energyWind powernewsShareReuse this content"

The particles may contain any number of 16,000 plastic chemicals, of which many, such as BPA, phthalates and Pfas,present serious health risks.The substance has been found throughout the human body, and can cross theplacentalandbrainbarriers. Among other issues, microplastics are linked to chronic pulmonary inflammation, which can lead to lung cancer.Previousresearch foundthat as much as 70% of microplastics in ocean samples were from apparel. Meanwhile, the substance has been found in clouds and in precipitation samples.Keyes in 2023 sampled for microplastics in Lake Tear of the Clouds, which sits at about 4,300ft (1,300 meters). It sees heavy hiker traffic because it is adjacent to a trail segment that is part of several larger trails.Keyes sent the sample to an independent lab that found 9.45 particles per milliliter (mL). Because the area only had hiker traffic, “it was surmised that microplastic pollution was being brought to the area largely by airborne deposition”, the authors wrote, meaning primarily via precipitation.Now they suspect they were wrong. The authors returned two years later in early 2025 to sample Lake Tear, as well as Moss Pond, which the paper describes as “a remote, trailless body of water” at a similar elevation.California governor under pressure over bill to ban cookware made with PfasRead moreThe independent lab detected about 0.73 particles per mL in Moss Pond, and about 16.54 particles per mL in Lake Tear – a roughly 23-fold difference that suggests the hiker traffic is playing a major role. Lightweight trail shoes can shed microplastics similar to tires, which are another source of pollution, Keyes said.“It’s a pretty clear indication given the stark difference in microplastic levels between the sister body of water that’s a bushwack away compared to Lake Tear, which is on this thoroughfare for hikers that sees tens of thousands of people annually,” Keyes said.Sami Romanick, a microplastics researcher with the Environmental Working Group non-profit who was not involved with the study, said the research’s methodology and design were sound. She agreed with the conclusion that the contamination was likely caused by hiking gear.“It’s a reasonable explanation that’s supported by the data,” Romanick said.The authors say the findings are meant to generate awareness and underscore why industry should produce clothing and shoes that will shed fewer microplastics. Hikers should consider wearing hard-rubber-sole shoes that release less plastic compared with soft soles, and wear synthetic fiber clothing underneath those made with natural fibers.Explore more on these topicsPlasticsPfasPollutionnewsShareReuse this content"

He highlighted free university tuition and prescriptions, free bus travel for under-22s and the scrapping of peak rail fares.This was delivered by “a government wholly owned by – and wholly serving – the people of Scotland”.Swinney claimed the SNP was within reach of an overall majority at Holyrood by winning 65 seats, a figure he argued would form a mandate for the Scottish government todemand a new independence referendum.That approach has been repeatedly rejected by Keir Starmer, the prime minister, who has said the UK Labour government will not grant Scotland the legal powers to stage one. The first vote, in 2014, was won decisively by anti-independence campaigners, by 55% to 45%.Douglas Alexander, the Scottish secretary, said on Sunday he and other Labour MPs, who won a majority of Scotland’s seats at Westminster last year, had been elected on a manifesto pledge not to approve a second independence vote.Nicola Sturgeon, who quit as first minister in 2023 after failing several times to deliver a new referendum, told reporters on Sunday she knew from experience it would be an “exceptionally hard task” for the SNP to win that majority.Holyrood’s proportional voting system makes it very hard to win an overall majority for one party but Swinney’s goal has resonance for the SNP for several reasons.It has only happened once since the devolved parliament was set up in 1999, when Alex Salmond, the former SNP leader, won the 2011 Holyrood election with 69 of Holyrood’s 129 seats.That triggered talks between his government and the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government in London on Scotland being given the temporary legal power to hold an independence referendum.But that was a voluntary, political decision by the UK government; there is no legal or constitutional requirement to do so. Swinney hinted on Sunday he believed that could form the basis for a legal challenge if the SNP were to win a majority and Starmer continued to block him.Despite Sturgeon’s warnings, SNP strategists argue privately the independence strategy is necessary to win over hundreds of thousands of pro-independence voters who no longer back the SNP. Many of them voted Labour in last year’s general election.Explore more on these topicsScottish National party (SNP)ScotlandJohn SwinneyCare workersScottish politicsSocial carenewsShareReuse this content"

She is considering whether to identify the politician when she gives evidence to the inquiry next month.Lady Lawrence said the evidence so far disclosed to the inquiry showed “plainly and unequivocally that, for at least a decade, whilst fighting for justice for her son, she was spied upon without any justification whatsoever and that this was not only sanctioned but rewarded by those at the top”.Ina statement to the inquirythat was published on Monday, she said that the then commissioner of the Metropolitan police, Paul Condon, who is now a peer, and Scotland Yard’s senior ranks were behind the surveillance.She added that “during the course of her grief she was, quite undeservedly and unlawfully spied upon by those meant to serve and protect her”.Her blistering criticism comes as the inquiry, led by the retired judge John Mitting, will over the coming months examine why undercover officers working for a covert Scotland Yard unit gathered information about the campaign to force police to properly investigate the racist murder of her son.Policeofficers, including Condon, and campaigners are due to be questioned.Stephen Lawrence case: Theresa May orders inquiry into police spiesRead moreOne of the undercover officers, who used the fake name David Hagan, reported back to his superiors that Lawrence was splitting up from her husband, Neville. Lawrence said that Stephen’s murder in 1993 had “led to her becoming divorced from her husband who she had been married to for over 20 years. It led to her suffering extraordinarily painful mental ill-health”.The spycops inquiry was set up in 2014 after the Guardian revealed testimony from whistleblower Peter Francis, an undercover officer who spied on anti-racist groups between 1993 and 1997. The activists supported the Lawrence family’s campaign for justice.In her statement, Lawrence cited evidence by Francis in which he said that during his deployment, his manager “gave me specific instructions to gather any intelligence that I possibly could get to help stop the anti-racist campaign following the death of Stephen Lawrence and made reference to ‘stopping’, ‘undermining’, combating’ and ‘smearing’ the campaign”.Francis added that his unit, the special demonstration squad (SDS), “wanted information to be able to tarnish the campaign with accusations of it being nothing more than an extremist front”. Other police officers deny this took place.The whistleblower added that throughout his deployment, “the gathering of intelligence on the Stephen Lawrence campaign was the SDS’s number one priority”.At the time, Scotland Yard was facing heavy pressure from the Lawrence family and their supporters to catch Stephen’s racist killers.Hagan infiltrated an anti-racist group which supported the Lawrence family’s campaign. For six months in 1998, he gathered information about the campaign and its supporters while a crucial publicinquiry, headed by Sir William Macpherson, a retired judge, scrutinised why police had failed to investigate Stephen’s murder.Hagan was told that his reports were “going straight to Commissioner Condon’s desk each morning” and that he received a message back: “Congratulations from the Commissioner for your excellent reporting.”In August 1998, Hagan met secretly with Richard Walton, a senior Scotland Yard officer who was part of a high-level team defending the police’s failure to investigate Stephen’s murder.An official note of this meetingrecorded that “it was a fascinating and valuable exchange of information concerning an issue which, according to [Walton], continues to dominate the commissioner’s agenda on a daily basis”.The note also recorded that Walton “explained a lot of the behind the scenes politics involving the Home Office. It emerged that there is great sensitivity around the Lawrence issue with both the home secretary and the prime minister extremely concerned that theMetropolitan policecould end up with its credibility – in the eyes of London’s black community – completely undermined”.In her opening statement, Doreen Lawrence said: “Given the involvement of the Home Office, the commissioner and the seniority of officers involved and the hierarchical nature of the Metropolitan police, the assertion by officers like [Hagan] that he, in effect, followed orders, confirms that the surveillance was not collateral, but directed from the very top.”On Monday, Neil Sheldon, a barrister for the Home Office, told the inquiry: “Whilst the Home Office appears to have remained a recipient of indirect SDS intelligence, the Home Office is unaware of any cogent evidence of direct tasking of the SDS by the Home Office.”Explore more on these topicsStephen LawrenceSpycops scandalUndercover police and policingHome OfficeDoreen LawrenceMetropolitan policePoliceLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

This means the approach could also pave the way for the production of blood that is fully compatible with a patient’s own body.Although other methods exist for generating human blood stem cells in the laboratory, these require a cocktail of extra proteins, whereas the new method mimics the natural developmental process in which self-organising structures drive the formation of different cell types.“Although it is still in the early stages, the ability to produce human blood cells in the lab marks a significant step towards future regenerative therapies – which use a patient’s own cells to repair and regenerate damaged tissues,” said Prof Azim Surani at the Gurdon Institute, senior author of the paper.In this latest study, scientists used human stem cells to replicate some of the cells and structures that would typically appear in the third and fourth week of pregnancy. The model was specifically designed to lack the tissues that go on to form the placenta and yolk sac in a natural embryo, meaning that it did not have the theoretical potential of developing into a foetus and did not develop the tissues that would go on to form the brain.“This is a minimalistic system,” said Neupane.The team observed the emergence of the three-dimensional embryo-like structures under a microscope. By the second day, they had self-organised into three germ layers – called the ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm – the foundations of the human body plan. By day eight, beating heart cells had formed, the cells that eventually give rise to the heart in a developing human embryo.By day 13, the team saw red patches of blood appearing. Blood stem cells taken from the model were also shown to be able to differentiate into various blood cell types, including oxygen-carrying red blood cells and white blood cells that are crucial to the immune system.The findings are published in the journalCell Reports.Explore more on these topicsScienceStem cellsUniversity of CambridgeHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

He said rival “political forces” were “solely responsible for this chaos” after they “instigated the destabilisation” of the prime minister,Sébastien Lecornu.Lecornu, a Macron ally, held his first meeting with France’s new government after he appointed a mix of stalwarts from Macron’s centrist grouping, as well as a few faces from the upper ranks of the civil service and civil society. New arrivals included Jean-Pierre Farandou, who headed the state-run railway, SNCF, and is now labour minister.View image in fullscreenSébastien Lecornu and the agriculture minister, Annie Genevard, arrive for a meeting with the new cabinet at the prime minister’s residence in Paris.Photograph: Abaca/ShutterstockLaurent Nuñez, who served as a junior minister in the interior ministry during thegilets jaunes(yellow vests) protests of 2018 and 2019, was appointed to the key post of interior minister. He had recently served as Paris police chief, responsible for the policing of last year’s Olympic Games.It is France’s second government in a week:Lecornu’s first government collapsed after 14 hoursamid backlash over a lack of fresh faces, and he dramatically resigned last Monday. Lecornu was thenreappointed by Macron on Friday nightand quickly assembled a new administration on Sunday. “How long will it last?” several regional newspapers asked, including La Provence in the south and La République du Centre.France has lurched from crisis to crisis since Macron’s gamble on a snap election last year that led to an inconclusive result. Parliament remains divided between the three blocs: the left, the far right and the centre, with no clear majority.Some parties have called on Macron to resign. “Never forget that the mandate given by the French people is to serve, to serve and serve, and to provide answers to the questions of everyday French people, and to do everything possible for the independence of France,” Macron said. “That is the only thing that matters. The rest is the government’s business … I will continue to ensure stability.”Macron’s term ends in spring 2027. He declined to speculate on a possible dissolution of parliament and snap election if the latest government fails. “I’m not making any bets,” he said. “I want the country to move forward.”View image in fullscreenThe newly appointed members of the cabinet.Photograph: Alain Jocard/AFP/Getty ImagesLecornu faces the urgent and complex task of getting a 2026 budget through parliament by the end of the year. He told ministers: “Our only task is to surpass the political crisis.” He said that political crisis was exasperating French people and observers worldwide. He called on the government to “put egos aside” and work collegiately to find compromise.The prime minister will deliver his first key policy speech to the French parliament on Tuesday afternoon.The leftwing La France Insoumise party and the far-right National Rally are due to put down motions for a no-confidence vote. For the government to be toppled, several opposition parties would have to group together to back the vote, including the Socialists.The Socialist party has said it will wait to hear Lecornu’s policy speech before deciding. It has warned it could vote against the government unless Lecornu suspends Macron’s controversial 2023 law that installed a gradualrise in the retirement age from 62 to 64.The new cabinet is expected to present a draft budget on Tuesday morning that will include cuts on public spending. The government must give parliament the constitutionally required 70 days to scrutinise the plan before the end of the year.“We have to give this country a budget, otherwise we’re heading for catastrophe,” the new minister for external commerce, Nicolas Forissier, told Ici Berry television.Explore more on these topicsFranceEmmanuel MacronEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It added that he may have headed for Dubai.He had been due to speak to the nation at 7pm (1600 GMT), according to a statement from the presidency on Facebook.Rajoelina, 51, was first president from 2009 to 2014 beforereturning to power in 2023. He was increasingly isolated after losing the support of a key army unit thatjoined thousands of youths activists known as “Gen Z Madagascar”to protest against corruption and poverty. The movement had earlier turned down an invitation to meet him for dialogue and demanded his resignation.People flooded a square in front of the Antananarivo city hall on Monday, waving flags and chanting slogans, some hanging off military vehicles as they arrived, according to Agence France-Presse reporters.Among the demonstrators were soldiers from the elite Capsat unit, which played a major role in the 2009 coup during Rajoelina’s rise to the presidency after mass protests forced his predecessor Marc Ravalomanana out of power.Also present were gendarmerie officers, accused of using heavy-handed tactics during the near-daily protests over more than two weeks. They admitted in a video statement to “faults and excesses” in their response.At least 22 people were killed in the first days by security forces and others in violence sparked by criminal gangs and looters, according to the UN. But Rajoelina had disputed the toll, saying last week there were “12 confirmed deaths and all of these individuals were looters and vandals”.‘We are the last hope’: Gen Z Madagascar vows to fight on until president resignsRead moreOn Saturday, some Capsat soldiers had posted a video to social media saying: “Let us join forces, military, gendarmes and police, and refuse to be paid to shoot our friends, our brothers and our sisters.”“Close the gates, and await our instructions,” they added. “Do not obey orders from your superiors. Point your weapons at those who order you to fire on your comrades in arms because they will not take care of our families if we die.”The showdown began following the arrest of two politicians on 19 September after planning a protest against the country’s chronic power and water outages.Explore more on these topicsMadagascarFranceAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

So the industry needs to be more careful because it’s not going to stop there.“AI companies need to know that we will be putting in these subject access requests en masse. They have a statutory obligation to respond. If an individual member reasonably believes that their data is being used without their consent, we want to find out.”Fleming said he hoped the tactic would push tech companies and producers resistant to being transparent about the sources of their AI content to strike an agreement on performers’ rights.“What we’re trying to do is use people’s individual rights to make it so hard for tech companies and producers to not enter into collective rights,” said Fleming.As the union has 50,000 members, significant numbers of them making subject access requests would create a “hassle” for firms unwilling to negotiate, he added.Under data protection law, individuals have the right to ask for all the information an organisation holds about them. Organisations normally have one month to reply to a subject access request.“It’s not a silver bullet,” Fleming added. “It’s not easy to do because they may well have got data from somewhere else. A lot of people are behaving very recklessly and immorally.”Monroe said she believed that Norwood had copied both her image and her mannerisms.Monroe said: “I move my head quite a lot when I’m acting. I noticed in the last few seconds of Tilly’s show reel, that is exactly what she did. Other people have also said, ‘Those are your mannerisms. That’s how you act.’”Liam Budd, industrial official for recorded media at Equity UK, said the union was taking Monroe’s concerns seriously. The AI production company Particle6, which launched Xicoia earlier this month, confirmed it was working with the union “to address any concerns”.A spokesperson for Particle6 added: “Briony Monroe’s likeness, image, voice or personal data have not been used in any way to create Tilly Norwood.“Tilly was developed entirely from scratch using original creative design. We do not and will not use any performer’s likeness without explicit consent and fair compensation.”Although he would not comment on Monroe’s complaint, Budd said: “We’ve had increasing numbers of members getting in touch about specific infringements where they believe that their image or voice has been used without their consent to then create an output which can identify them or resembles them in some way.“It’s been a lot more common in the audio space because the technology is much easier. You don’t need many recordings to create a digital replica of a voice.”But Norwood represented a new challenge for the industry, said Budd, because “we haven’t really seen the launch of a wholly synthetic actor” before.Equity UK has been in negotiations with the UK production trade body Pact (Producers Alliance for Cinema and Television) about AI, copyright and data protection for more than a year.Fleming said: “The bosses are not asking questions about where this data has come from. Privately, they will admit that it is impossible to ethically use AI because it has been scraped and trained on data where the provenance is at best unclear.“But nine times out of 10, we know it’s been used completely outside of the existing copyright and data protection framework.”Max Rumney, the deputy chief executive of Pact, said its members needed to use AI technology in production or they would be at a commercial disadvantage to those firms with no collective agreements with unions, who did not remunerate actors, writers and other creatives.But he added that there was no transparency from tech companies on what content or data had been used to train foundation models, the technology that underpins AI tools such as image generators.“The foundational models have been trained without permission on the films and programmes of our members,” said Rumney.“Our members want human creative expression in their films and programmes. They value this and consider that this is what makes UK productions so compelling and innovative.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Tilly Norwood (AI character)Trade unionsnewsShareReuse this content"

AI is also being developed to help manage hospitals, from optimising bed capacity to tackling supply chains.But while experts say the technology could bring myriad benefits for healthcare, they say there is also cause for concern, from a lack of testing of the effectiveness of AI tools to questions over who is responsible should a patient have a negative outcome.Prof Derek Angus, of the University of Pittsburgh, said: “There’s definitely going to be instances where there’s the perception that something went wrong and people will look around to blame someone.”The Jama summit on Artificial Intelligence, hosted last year by the Journal of the American Medical Association, brought together a panoply of experts including clinicians, technology companies, regulatory bodies, insurers, ethicists, lawyers and economists.Theresulting report, of which Angus is first author, not only looks at the nature of AI tools and the areas of healthcare where they are being used, but also examines the challenges they present, including legal concerns.Prof Glenn Cohen from Harvard law school, a co-author of the report, said patients could face difficulties showing fault in the use or design of an artificial intelligence product. There could be barriers to gaining information about its inner workings, while it could also be challenging to propose a reasonable alternative design for the product or prove a poor outcome was caused by the AI system.He said: “The interplay between the parties may also present challenges for bringing a lawsuit – they may point to one another as the party at fault, and they may have existing agreement contractually reallocating liability or have indemnification lawsuits.”Prof Michelle Mello, another author of the report, from Stanford law school, said courts were well equipped to resolve legal issues. “The problem is that it takes time and will involve inconsistencies in the early days, and this uncertainty elevates costs for everyone in the AI innovation and adoption ecosystem,” she said.The report also raises concerns about how AI tools are evaluated, noting many are outside the oversight of regulators such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).Angus said: “For clinicians, effectiveness usually means improved health outcomes, but there’s no guarantee that the regulatory authority will require proof [of that]. Then once it’s out, AI tools can be deployed in so many unpredictable ways in different clinical settings, with different kinds of patients, by users who are of different levels of skills. There is very little guarantee that what seems to be a good idea in the pre-approval package is actually what you get in practice.”The report outlines that at present there are many barriers to evaluating AI tools including that they often need to be in clinical use to be fully assessed, while current approaches to assessment are expensive and cumbersome.Angus said it was important that funding was made available for the performance of AI tools in healthcare to be properly assessed, with investment in digital infrastructure a key area. “One of the things that came up during the summit was [that] the tools that are best evaluated have been least adopted. The tools that are most adopted have been least evaluated.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)HealthMedical researchnewsShareReuse this content"

But two decades on, not every UK graphene company has made the most of that potential. Some show promise but others are struggling.Extracted from graphite, commonly used in pencils, graphene is a latticed sheet of carbon one atom thick, and is highly effective at conducting heat and electricity. China is the world’s biggest producer, using it to try to get ahead in theglobal race to produce microchipsand in sectors such as construction.In the UK, a graphene-enhanced, low-carbon concrete was laid at a Northumbrian Water site in July, developed by the Graphene Engineering Innovation Centre (GEIC) at the University of Manchester and Cemex UK.“The material when it came out of academia was hyped to death … but the challenge is going from lab to fab,” says Ben Jensen, the chief executive of 2D Photonics, a startup spun out from the University of Cambridge that makes graphene-based photonic technology for datacentres.Jensen alsoinvented Vantablackcoatings, made of carbon nanotubes – rolled-up sheets of graphene – and known as the world’s “blackest black” because it absorbs 99.96% of light, at the UK company Surrey NanoSystems that he founded in 2007. The material’s artistic rights weresold exclusively to the sculptor Anish Kapoor, and BMW used it on its X6 coupe to create the “blackest black car” six years ago.View image in fullscreenAn untitled Vantablack work by Anish Kapoor on display in Venice in 2022.Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian“This is the challenge when you have new materials trying to displace an incumbent technology,” Jensen says. “The value proposition must be extremely good, but there also must be a way to manufacture the material and manufacture it at scale for the application … then you have to meet price expectations because there’s no point in delivering something that’s costing 10 times more than the incumbent.”Germany’sBayer tried to producecarbon nanotube products in bulk but shut down its pilot factory more than a decade ago after the expected surge in demand failed to materialise. The material is now mainly used as a filler to strengthen plastic products. The company described the potential applications of nanotubes as “fragmented”.More promising are the graphene-based optical microchips developed by 2D Photonics’ subsidiary CamGraPhIC, which are based on research done at the University of Cambridge and Italy’s CNIT research institute.At the moment, silicon-photonics microchips convert electrical data into optical data to transmit it through fibre-optic cables, but the firm says its graphene chips deliver more data in the same period of time and at far lower cost.Single graphene crystals.Photograph: 2D PhotonicsThey consume 80% less energy and can operate in a much wider range of temperatures, reducing the need for costlywater- and energy-hungry cooling systemsfor AI datacentres.Sending data via silicon also causes delays. Jensen compares it to a 16-lane motorway that suddenly narrows to a single lane because of roadworks, forcing everything to slow down. Graphene photonics, he says, are like a motorway with hundreds of lanes.“What we’ve solved is the ability to grow consistent ultra high-performance graphene and to build it into a device,” he says. “And don’t forget, this is a material that’s one atom thick. It’s insanely difficult to do this.”View image in fullscreenBen Jensen, the chief executive of 2D Photonics.Photograph: Ermanno FissoreCamGraPhIC was founded in 2018 by the Cambridge nanotechnology professor Andrea Ferrari, who also runs the Cambridge graphene centre, and Marco Romagnoli, who leads advanced photonics at CNIT in Pisa and is the startup’s chief scientific officer.Its parent, 2D Photonics, has just securedfunding of £25mfrom backers including Italy’s sovereign wealth fund, Nato and Sony innovation funds, Bosch Ventures and the UK’s Frontier IP Group, and uses a former Pirelli photonics research site in Pisa. It plans to create a pilot manufacturing site in the Milan area to produce 200mm-wide wafers at scale, and is confident of obtaining the necessary funding of €317m (£276m) by the end of the year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It produces graphene-based electronic devices, including sensors for electric cars, and biosensors for the early detection of disease and other uses in healthcare and agriculture. It recentlysecured $55m(£41m) from investors including the United Arab Emirates sovereign wealth fund, which took a 12.8% stake in Paragraf.A more recent startup, Graphene Innovations Manchester, launched in 2021 by Vivek Koncherry, struck a deal with Saudi Arabia last December for the world’s first commercial production of graphene-enriched carbon fibre, used in construction for roofs and facades, as well as street light poles. It has started making it in Tabuk with a local partner, and says it is on track to produce 3,000 tonnes by 2026.View image in fullscreenThe 2D Photonics cleanroom at its development facility in Pisa.Photograph: 2D PhotonicsOther businesses, however, have found the going tougher. One of the sector’s first companies was Applied Graphene Materials, founded by Prof Karl Coleman in 2010 andspun out from Durham University. It launched a number of products including an anti-corrosion primer and a protective bike-detailing spray, which made it on to the shelves in Halfords. But the loss-making enterprise was wound down in 2023 and Canada’s Universal Matter acquired its main business.Ron Mertens, the owner of the website Graphene-Info, says: “As is true in the wider materials industry, things take a very long time to reach the market. Many graphene producers and developers never managed to generate meaningful revenues or become profitable.”The Gloucestershire-based Versariengrew from a garage startupin 2010. Supported by Innovate UK, a government agency, it has developed graphene powders and other products for use in sensors, low-carbon concrete, paints, inks for electronics and textiles such asUmbro running gearand prototype stealth materials for the US military.The Aim-listed company expanded into Spain and South Korea but ran into financial difficulties and was forced to place several subsidiaries in administration or voluntary liquidation in July. Versarien has been seeking to sell its assets, including its patent portfolio, and only has enough cash to keep going until the end of October.Depending on the deal, it may undertake a solvent liquidation of the company or become a cash shell. An investment deal with a Chinese partnercollapsedafter the UK government intervened to block any collaboration on technology. It would be a sad end for a once promising graphene business.Explore more on these topicsBusinessManufacturing sectorMaterials scienceChemistryTechnology startupsnewsShareReuse this content"

He also said innovation in green industries, and blocking the rise of giant tech monopolies would be vital to stronger growth in future.“I’m not welcoming the protectionist wave in the US, and that’s not good for world growth and innovation,” he said.Speaking as he accepted the prize, he said AI had “fantastic growth potential” but called on governments to develop strict competition policies to manage the growth of new tech companies. “Some superstar firms may end up dominating everything and inhibiting potential entry of new innovators. So how can we make sure that today’s innovators will not stifle future entry and innovation?”The prize committee said technological developments had helped to power sustained economic growth over the past two centuries, but warned that future gains could not be taken for granted.Mokyr, a Dutch-born American-Israeli economic historian, won the prize for his research identifying the prerequisites for sustained growth through technological progress. Aghion and Howitt, a Canadian economist, shared the award for their analysis of how “creative destruction” is key for driving growth.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The sibling duo recorded it before their debut had even come out, and so had no idea that 2003’s Gallowsbird’s Bark would receive such wild acclaim: in an 8.4 review, Pitchfork called its shambolic rock’n’roll and frontwoman Eleanor Friedberger’s arcane lyricism a “a mess of weird, undulating musical bits that are hugely intriguing despite not always making a whole shitload of sense”. They were busy fulfilling a five-album deal with Rough Trade, a luxury that was pretty much par for the course as a buzzy Brooklyn band in the time of the Strokes and Interpol – not that their Beefhearty blues had much in common with preening rock revivalism. “I thought they were so bad. I just didn’t give a shit about that stuff,” was one of Eleanor’s withering contributions to the scene oral history Meet Me in the Bathroom.Matthew and Eleanor Friedberger had moved from Chicago: in a classic older brother move, he bought her a guitar and drum kit when she was in her teens, then she roped him into playing with her when he followed her east. “We were a New York band, and there were a lot of bands where that’s what people knew about them,” says Matthew, 52, on a three-way call with his sister, 49. “That seemed to be the distinguishing feature: they were from New York and sort of new-wavy. Why were they meant to be good? I was pleased with the idea that with Blueberry Boat, at least it would be hard to lump us in with them. We wouldn’t seem like an also-ran New York City band wearing leather jackets.”If his comments sound contrarian, even contemptuous, that’s because they are, delightfully so. Matthew knew that their second album would stick out in that scene: Blueberry Boat was a 75-minute, piratical travelogue-cum-rock opera inspired by the Who’s rock suites A Quick One, While He’s Away and Rael. This one scored 9.6 on Pitchfork, racked up reams of coverage from alt-weeklies across the US and got a very noble 1/10 from NME. “It was a lucky experience to get to do something and have people react to it in its tiny corner of music,” he says. “That’s pretty much a dream come true.”Blueberry Boat was always going to stand apart, but Matthew hadn’t anticipated how the scene would have softened within just a year as the nebulous concept of “indie” got Garden State’d. By 2004, he says, they were supporting a lot of bands that were “very indie, but it was like Christian rock, or some sort of religious affiliation, and all of a sudden there would be kids sitting on the floor of some dirty venue”. They supported one such band – Eleanor insists that he doesn’t name them when he is clearly itching to – who told them: “I heard your new record:pretty gay.”One of that band later “asked to see my tits”, at the Sleater-Kinney edition of All Tomorrow’s Parties, adds Eleanor.“This is devolving fast,” she demurs.And if this sounds like ancient history, that’s because it is. The Fiery Furnaces lasted seven studio albums, regularly splitting opinion, and no more so than on2005’s Rehearsing My Choir, on which their grandmother Olga Sarantos narrated her picaresque life story (a CD my dad threatened to throw out of the car window). Being on Rough Trade, coupled with Eleanor’s then-relationship with Franz Ferdinand’s Alex Kapranos, also made them adjuncts to the UK indie scene for a while. After they quietly went on hiatus in 2011, both went solo, albeit Matthew for seven harebrained albums, generally played on one instrument apiece, released in quick succession between 2011 and 2012, and Eleanor for fourbeautiful, gnomic recordsin a 70s songwriterly vein, the last released in 2018. They have just reissued Blueberry Boat for a belated 20th anniversary repress, having got the licence back from Rough Trade, and are about to embark on a brief US-EU tour in celebration.View image in fullscreenAnarchic and unique … the Fiery Furnaces performing in New York City in 2010.Photograph: Theo Wargo/WireImageThey felt like one of the most idiosyncratic and daring bands of the 00s, creators of an anarchic and unique American songbook. Those of us who loved them really, really loved them. Among their forthcoming dates are support slots with Destroyer, AKA Canadian musician Dan Bejar, whom Eleanor has supported previously. When he first heard them, he says, he was “struck by the arrangements which were equal part reckless abandon and psychotic rigour. Then the language just got weirder and denser and dazzling. To the point that, in a lot of ways, it felt like an attack on the singer. Luckily, in this case, the singer was probably the best American rock’n’roll singer of the 21st century. So she seemed, you know, unfazed.”But today the band has just 17,000 monthly Spotify listeners. Searching “fiery furnaces” on TikTok brings up two relevant clips and dozens more Bible-bashers citing Daniel 3:8-25. It makes Blueberry Boat feel like one of the first great lost records of the century. “If the record has lived on in some big way, I haven’t noticed it,” says Matthew. It’s a rare disappearing act in an age where everything is perpetually available. Neither Friedberger is surprised or disappointed, describing themselves as temperamentally unsuited to success. “I feel like we both only have a certain capacity for trying to expose ourselves,” says Eleanor. “To be in public, to share things.”Until2006’s Bitter Tea, the Furnaces’ music seemed to demonstrably intensify with each record: as if pushing things as hard as they could while living on borrowed time. “Oh yeah, that was my aim!” Matthew laughs. As a teenager in the 80s, in books such as The Rolling Stone Album Guide, “you read about Small Faces, the Clash – you have two, three, four years and you want to make as much as possible. And see what happens – you wanna go and mix up the medicine and see what basement you can blow up.”Writing was the only part they really thought about. “It’s kind of shocking to see how much we didn’t take it seriously, except for the music,” says Eleanor. “I’d hear other acts talk about ‘my management’ and we just never had that attitude. Maybe that was to our detriment, but we just don’t have that in us.”View image in fullscreen‘It’s shocking to see how much we didn’t take it seriously, except for the music’ … Matthew and Eleanor Friedberger pictured in 2004.Photograph: Steve GullickBeing siblings made striving and contrivance impossible, says Matthew. “In another band, you can have this wonderful experience working with each other because you can really remake yourself and be another person, and project that to the people who are interested in you. We definitely weren’t ever going to do that. Being brother and sister, we’re not going to be so impressed with each other.”Back in the day, fans andcritics were fascinated by their prickly dynamic. Today, Eleanor generally stays quiet while her brother’s conversational digressions gather pace. Their rehearsals for their forthcoming tour dates are more likely to be spent talking about “family issues with our parents”, says Eleanor.When it comes to settling debates, says Matthew: “If anything, it’s too polite a committee.”“I would say we talk too much and there’s more talking than action,” says Eleanor. “That would be my complaint.”“You’d often say that in any situation,” says Matthew.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

They put out a new single, Down at the So and So on Somewhere, on Jack White’s Third Man Records that year, and played a couple of dates in 2021, but the fragments of music Matthew had written remained unfinished. “I didn’t know what to write for Eleanor,” he says. “I didn’t know how to push and actually finish something.”The Fiery Furnaces: Down at the So and So on Somewhere – videoTo do so, he says, “it’s fun to imagine a setting. Rock band is a performance style: you imagine the places you’re playing, who is going to be there. If you’re hazy about all that, it becomes much harder to make the decisions to actually finish something that you like. If you’re not going to show [recordings], you don’t finish them. Presumably that’s self-defence – if you don’t finish it, you can imagine it’s better than it is. That’s why a lot of people put things in their drawer.”They played with such a big band in 2021, he says, that it felt “impersonal” to him. “It was like I was standing on the side of the stage doing the lighting even though I was playing the whole time.”Eleanor had the inverse experience. “At the last show we did in Los Angeles, it felt so good – the sound, how I was singing – that I thought, if this is the last time I ever stand on stage, I’m going to remember this moment.” After her last solo tour, which finished in early 2020, she had thought: “Maybe I don’t want to do this any more.” It was the first time she had got off the treadmill since the band started. “And for all the reasons one can imagine – the music industry is terrible, it’s more and more expensive to travel and tour, it’s harder to make money. I’d also just moved in with someone and had never really lived in a home with someone before.”“Except your parents and your brother!” Matthew corrects her.Now, she’s excited about revisiting her demos and playing again, she says. The band’s forthcoming shows will be far more intimate, with just the two of them on stage. “If it’s just the piano and two people singing, there’s more freedom to make really bad mistakes and for people to notice it and see if it’s stimulating to them or not,” says Matthew. “So that’s fun.”‘The breakup was like an amputation that saves you’: Cate Le Bon on healing from heartache and her heavy new albumRead moreIf they were out of time in the 00s, and disappeared from view in the 2010s, maybe they are better suited to existing now, they theorise. “You can be so much weirder now and no one thinks anything of it,” says Eleanor.In trademark fashion, Matthew calls this “the Balkanisation of particularisation in these endlessly, specifically curated lives that people are supposed to lead”.As much as the Furnaces seemed like one-offs in the 00s, Stereogum’s 20th anniversary retrospective on Blueberry Boat made the smart point that“high-concept, big-swing”records by the likes of Sufjan Stevens, Wilco, the Flaming Lips, even the Streets abounded at the time. They exchange various theories about why – breaking genre conventions, technology – until Matthew lands on a conclusion. “I think people felt empowered to waste people’s time in a more aggressive way,” he says. “That’s exciting.”The reissue of Blueberry Boat is out now onEverything Nice.

I love to send them off on their quest two, maybe three times a year, and I rarely let them finish it: not because I yearn for the suffering of tiny little guys, but because I put my own comfort above them. With all due respect to mists and mellow fruitfulness, Fellowship is autumn to me: as cosy and comforting as snuggling into a blanket with a hot chocolate.Most people I know agree that Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings trilogy is as close as we will ever get to cinematic perfection. Even on the small screen, the sweeping grandeur of the scenery is breathtaking and the emotional undercurrent that drives every scene pulls you out of your living room and into Middle-Earth. But no one can quite agree on which of the three is the best. Every man I’ve ever been on a date with has put forth passionate arguments for The Two Towers supremacy based mainly on the Battle of Helm’s Deep. My most sensitive friends like Return of the King and the general concept of narrative closure. But I personally don’t think you can beat Fellowship: a bunch of new pals getting together and agreeing to Do the Good and Noble Thing is as close as you can get to a utopian society in my opinion, even if I only ever let them get a third of the way through the mission.This is key to Fellowship and LOTR as a whole: the lines of good and evil are very clearly drawn. There’s no what-aboutism to contend with. No one’s saying we should get Saruman on Question Time to defend his diabolical deforestation project or going, “I’m not saying that I agree witheverythingSauron stands for but he’s got a point about population density.” Your mum isn’t being radicalised by the Ringwraiths on Facebook. You know who the good guys are, you know who the bad guys are. It’s clear what needs to be done to sort out the creeping dark and someone with pure intentions is stepping up to do it.It’s tempting to say there is no bad time to stick Fellowship on but there is one: at the cinema in 2001 with my parents who have recently split up and palpably detest each other. For some reason that no one has ever quite pinned down since, it was decided that The Solomon Family Unit would reunite every Christmas for The Lord of the Rings: was it because both parents wanted to introduce us to Middle-Earth? Was it a catastrophically mistaken belief that this would bring some normalcy to a very not-normal situation? If we were a family who talked about things, we might find out. Whatever the reason, this very unsettling yet somehow weirdly comforting annual tradition stuck. Even now I feel a glorious thrill of dread due to more than just the rise of Sauron as the harsh whisper of Elvish creeps in and Galadriel starts her opening monologue: “The world is changed.” Lady, it sure is.You can tell from every frame of this film that the project was a labour of love. Even the most upsetting bits of Fellowship elicit a sort of pleasurable pain, like prodding a mouth ulcer with your tongue. Sometimes I pause it on Gandalf’s face when Frodo says he will take the ring to Mordor just to sit in that feeling for a little longer: a tiny throwaway moment that hits me like a ton of bricks every time. It’s that love that makes all the walking and talking of Fellowship pop. It’s what makes me feel so good when I watch it, even when Boromir’s being decimated by crossbow bolts, when the Fellowship splinters and Gandalf is dead but the quest has to continue regardless, when second breakfast is replaced with an apple. And if you can make me feel good while all that’s happeningandI’m sandwiched between my two warring parents: you’ve really done some magic.Explore more on these topicsLord of the RingsMy feelgood moviePeter JacksonScience fiction and fantasy filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But for every step forward, as this dynamic documentary shows, a further obstacle is thrown in her pathPhuong LeMon 13 Oct 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 13 Oct 2025 04.01 EDTShareBeing the first anything is a point of pride, but also a burden. Sara Shahverdi has carved her own path through a deeply conservative village in ruralIran. An experienced midwife who has delivered more than 400 babies, she has always done what is not permitted of women: to ride a motorcycle in public, to get a divorce and to live alone. Now she has taken on another herculean task: to become the first female councillor to be elected in this part of the country.Staying close to its subject, Sara Khaki and Mohammadreza Eyni’s dynamic documentary captures the full force of Shahverdi’s formidable personality. An early scene shows her barging into the home of her brothers, demanding they return the rights of land inheritance to her sisters. The film expands from Shahverdi’s private issues to take in the full scope of patriarchal oppression in her community. Here, schoolgirls as young as 12 are forced into marriage, divorce is nearly impossible to obtain, and married women have little legal protection. Shahverdi’s resounding election victory is a beacon of hope, but even her celebrations are overshadowed by misogyny. Her male supporters can dance in the streets, while women have to film the revelries through a barred window.As councilwoman, Shahverdi brings stunning changes to the village; however, her support of women and girls also incites hateful accusations about her sexuality that land her in court. Through these trials and tribulations, and moving between moods of jubilation and doubt, the documentary evocatively conveys her sisyphean exhaustion, where every step of progress is undone by new setbacks. While we might want to hear more about the specific cultural geography of the Azeri Turk community to which Shahverdi belongs, this remains a thought-provoking portrait of an extraordinary spirit.Cutting Through Rocks is at Bertha DocHouse, London, from 17 October.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsIranWomenMiddle East and north AfricareviewsShareReuse this content"

Or treat it, in some way? Will keeping it indoors – hooded so that it remains calm – and then taking it out hunting allow you to reconnect radically with nature in a way that prissy townies will never understand? Or is this just a domesticated festival of cruelty to both bird and prey and a symptom of serious depression?Philippa Lowthorpe’s intriguing, likably performed if slightly precious film – based onHelen Macdonald’s bestselling nature memoir from 2014 – addresses these questions, but can’t quite deliver the Hollywood redemption narrative that it appears to offer: the story of a woman in the depths of melancholy who is helped through the darkness and, we have to assume, out the other side, by her goshawk, whimsically named Mabel. (Macdonald used she/her pronouns at the time of publication and came out as non-binary in 2022.)Audiences might, by the closing credits, think they still don’t quite know what happens to Helen and Mabel in the end, or perhaps at any time, but then again real life can feel messy and unfinished in just this way.Claire Foy plays Macdonald in 2007, a fellow of Jesus College, Cambridge teaching the history and philosophy of science. She adores and hero-worships her dad, the award-winning photographer Alisdair Macdonald, played here by Brendan Gleeson, who inculcated in her a love of nature, and when he dies she is utterly distraught.So Helen conceives a mysterious need to buy a goshawk from a dealer. She gets her expert mate Stuart (Sam Spruell) to help her train it and becomes a superbly eccentric Cambridge don for keeping Mabel on her wrist in college but then deeply worries her mum (Lindsay Duncan) by not leaving the house: Helen and Mabel descending into squalor together.Claire Foy is clearly doing this for real: she has obviously learned to handle a goshawk – and her scenes have a tremendous authenticity. When she looks nervous with Mabel, she is genuinely nervous. When she is thrilled to get Mabel to do something, she is genuinely thrilled. With this bird, there can be no “acting”. The best moment comes when Helen has Mabel in the car, and it looks like Clarice Starling has taken Dr Lecter for a drive.So has the relationship between Helen and Mabel deepened by the end? Is there, in fact, a relationship? Perhaps this could be scheduled in a season of films about people getting up close and personal with predatory animals, along with Loach’s Kes, Hitchcock’s The Birds and Herzog’s Grizzly Man. Mabel’s ice-cold gaze is very scary.H is for Hawk screened at theLondon film festival.Explore more on these topicsLondon film festival 2025London film festivalClaire FoyBrendan GleesonHelen MacdonaldFilm adaptationsreviewsShareReuse this content"

The rumour circulated that there were full E Street Band versions of the songs from Springsteen’s 1982 solo acoustic release that were recorded, but remained unreleased and never leaked.Nebraska’s origin story had already made the album mythical: demos recorded in Springsteen’s bedroom got turned into a album. After spending literal years in the studio for his previous records, this time he walked in with finished songs. The cassette tape that he had carried around in his pocket got turned into a classic, five-star record of desolate modern folk songs about the dark side of the American dream.Surely, many fans believed, there had to be other versions of these songs that sounded more like the Springsteen they knew and loved. The topic became so entrenched in Springsteen lore that Backstreets Magazine, the fanzine devoted to the Boss, had a line on its contact page:To send us information/anonymous tips/keys to the universe: Or Electric Nebraska MP3s, that kind of thing.View image in fullscreenNebraska album artwork.Photograph: Sony MusicIn June 2025, Springsteen sat down with a journalist from Rolling Stone who asked: “What about Electric Nebraska?” Springsteen replied: “I can tell you right now it doesn’t exist.” The question seemed to be settled, until the interview was published, and the writer got off a plane to find a text from a New Jersey area code. It read, “Bruce Springsteen here … I checked our vault and there IS an Electric Nebraska record though it does not have the full album of songs!”Now, after more than four decades of wishful waiting and contentious online discussions among the fanbase, Electric Nebraska will see the light of day as part of Nebraska ’82: Expanded Edition, a multi-disc set being released on 24 October, to coincide with the release of the Springsteen biopicDeliver Me from Nowhere, which delves into this particular era. But is it worth the hype?Springsteen hasn’t had this much to live up to since CBS decided to plaster the city with “Finally, London is ready for Bruce Springsteen” posters prior to his UK live debut in 1975. The verdict: while the eight tracks recorded with the E Street Band are a fascinating historical document, when Springsteen himself said in 1998: “I went into the studio, brought in the band, rerecorded, remixed and succeeded in making the whole thing worse,” he wasn’t being self-deprecating.“Electric” here just means “not acoustic”. If you’re envisioning full-scale E Street Band treatments that turn these bleak, atmospheric laments into stadium anthems, think again. Nebraska or Mansion on the Hill are slightly more expanded instrumentally, with the addition of a Tennessee Three-type rhythm arrangement. It doesn’t make the songs better, but it does take the edge off, thus neutralising their impact.The versions of Open All Night, Reason to Believe, and Johnny 99 expand the sonic palette but are simply inferior versions of how those songs have been presented in the live show in the post-Reunion tour era. And Atlantic City is completely devoid of the sheer power and emotional depth the band has delivered on this number over the ensuing years.Downbound Train is the most astonishing derivation, delivered in a breakneck pace at odds with the lyrics and a vocal delivery that’s at least punk-adjacent. Born in the USA is the one song in this collection that most closely conforms to the fantasy of an Electric Nebraska: the songs from that album are here because the sessions for both records essentially overlapped. It’s not necessarily better than the one that broke the world open, but it probably wouldn’t have caught the attention of Ronald Reagan.Nebraska was a dark and challenging record as well as drastically different to everything that had come before it. In 1982, the lines between country music and rock’n’roll were still considered mostly impassable barriers in either direction. It’s this environment that likely fed the mythology behind Electric Nebraska – but the Boss made the right call at the right time.Explore more on these topicsBruce SpringsteenPop and rockreviewsShareReuse this content"

No wonder it’s sparking an outpouring of sadnessEleanor BiggsMon 13 Oct 2025 05.25 EDTLast modified on Mon 13 Oct 2025 05.36 EDTShareWhen I discovered Marc Maron’s influential podcast WTF, I was working in a pub. It was a weird time for me. I had just left university and had absolutely no idea what I was doing with my life, so I moved back home and took on shifts as a waitress and chamber maid.Podcasts became an escape from my reality of changing sheets on king-sized beds, folding hospital corners and rearranging tiny bottles of shampoo – and none more so thanMarc Maron’s WTF.I don’t know how I found it, or why. I don’t think I’d ever even heard of Marc Maron – a grumpy middle-aged standup comedian – before I found the podcast, let alone half the people he interviewed; comedians, musicians, actors in indie films. But its long-form interview format taught me things and made me laugh. And the podcast became – on my long walks to and from shifts, stinking of bleach and the pub’s deep fat fryer, wondering what on earth I was going to do next – a friend to me.That was more than eight years ago, and what I ended up doing next was, funnily enough, becoming a podcast producer. I now work on the Guardian’s daily news and current affairspodcast Today in Focus.Undoubtedly, one of the things that inspired me to pursue this career was WTF, the rambling interview show which had already been going for nine years by the time I found it.Over time, the show has become a comfort blanket for me. No matter who Maron is speaking to, there is a rhythm to the interview. For example – healways, alwaysshares the story of his early life with guests, telling it like the listener (and the guest) is hearing it for the first time and not the 1,600th (quickfire: Jewish, born in New Jersey, grew up in New Mexico, younger brother …). There are often tales about his love-hate relationship with his former boss, Mitzi, at the Comedy Store, and whenever he speaks to an actor he’ll tell them how he loves acting but can’t stand waiting in his trailer.Maron is a standup – these are his bits. But, more often than not over the course of an episode, a different kind of storyteller and interviewer emerges – vulnerable and compelling, with a tone that’s kept me coming back all these years.View image in fullscreenMaron with guest President Barack Obama in 2015.Photograph: Pete Souza/The White HouseIn recent times he has mused on the climate crisis, the rise of fascism and his plans to move to Canada in the wake of Trump’s re-election; he has meditated on grief (after the sudden death of his partner, Lynn Shelton, in 2020), ageing, creativity, friendship and love. Oh, and cats. Maronlovescats.After years of putting out two episodes a week to a loyal listenership, in June, Maron announced that he and his producer were ending the podcast.“We’ve decided that we had a great run,” he told us. “Basically, it’s time, folks. It’s time. WTF is coming to an end.”When I heard Maron say these words I gasped. I couldn’t believe it. No matter what was going on in my life, there had always been a new episode to escape into, Maron’s craggy face staring at me from the podcast tile. But now, there wouldn’t be.As I write, there is just one episode of WTF left. Too scared at the tears listening to the final episode might unleash, I’ve been reading the Spotify comments instead. I’m not the only listener who’s feeling emotional.“Sixty-year-old carpenter in south London, sat in his van in tears … thanks for the years, Marc …”“1685 episodes. You could listen to one a day and it would take 4.5 years to listen to them all …”View image in fullscreenMarc Maron at home in Los Angeles.Photograph: Barry J Holmes/The GuardianLots of the comments focus on the role that Maron, or his voice at least, has played in listeners’ lives over the past 16 years. Commenters write about how they became fans while changing their newborns’ nappies, with those same kids now starting secondary school. Others say the podcast has been a constant in their lives, helping them survive heartbreak and change.One listener writes that losing WTF is like losing the voice of a goofy uncle or older brother. Another, that it’s like losing a friend.I feel the same. This show taught me the kind of honesty and intimacy that’s possible in podcasting, and gave me comfort when little else did. WTF may be ending, but it totally changed the podcast landscape – and will leave a lasting impression on thousands of listeners’ lives.Explore more on these topicsPodcastsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

His mother died less than six months later. Claude was one of 11 children born to Thomas Francis McKay and Hannah Ann Elizabeth Edwards, and one of eight to survive. Hannah had always been especially receptive to his artistic and intellectual ambitions.The writing in the two sonnets has a calm clarity that seems to suggest a certain distance in time from its sad subject, but ready access to some finely etched detail. In the first, the detail often concerns body language. The narrative is intrinsically dramatic but McKay delivers it without rhetorical emphasis, through observation, pitched at a sometimes conversational level. Someone, “Reg”– perhaps one of the writer’s elder brothers – has urged him to accompany him “to the field”. He is reluctant to leave his mother but the intuitive understanding between them allows him to read in her eyes “I shall last another day”. So he accepts the permission she grants: “Her hand she slowly lifted from her lap, / And, smiling sadly in the old sweet way, / She pointed to the nail where hung my cap.” Perhaps it’s a final act of kindness; she has foreseen the closeness of her death and wants to spare her son its direct witness.The news reaches the two young men first in the form of “a faint bell ringing”. The bell suggests a call for aid may have been sounded: a bell would reach farther around the village than a human shout. Wordless communication continues predominant, and there’s a sharp contrast between the misreading of the mother’s eyes and their promised extra day of life, and the instant understanding of what’s written on the young messenger’s “frightened face”. The emphasis on wordlessness continues, this time the speaker’s own. The last couplet reveals his un-surprise : “I heard him listlessly, without a moan …” McKay at the time of writing must have had an exuberant knowledge of his own accomplishments in language. But this sonnet is a revelation of the bare spaces in consciousness and communication where language can be annihilated. Communication may take place at an instinctive level, and it’s not necessarily infallible. It may also occur without words, and “without a moan” – the sound the writer had seemingly expected himself to make in the face of such a significant loss.Poem of the week: Two sonnets by Claude McKayRead moreIn the second sonnet, time has moved on. We know this from the concluding triplet (the couplet now being embedded in a trio of lines), where as before the narrative achieves completion. This time, the image of the mother asleep, like a child, “beneath” the “breast” of the earth, offers a more poetic, perhaps Christian-tinged note of consolation. The sonnet’s concept is partly a traditional one (life and work must continue as before after a death in the community). McKay, however, is occupying larger ground beyond what might appear to be stereotype (“golden corn”, “peaceful toil”). A particular Jamaican landscape where “the trades” (the Trade winds) “come whispering off the seas” is fully present: the “golden corn” itself is reimagined and marked out by its “dark-brown tassels fluttering in the breeze”. The detail of “the school-house crumbling on the hill” is a succinct image of struggle and attainment, a perfectly placed signpost in farming country where the labour is mostly manual and relentless.It’s in the 11th line, where some of the labourers are “breaking up the sun-baked soil”, that the importance of the cooling breeze becomes apparent. In fact, the unusual concluding triplet is an address to the breeze, a plea with it to refresh the mortals working on the earth, and a suggestion, too, perhaps, that the “sleeping” mother may also somehow know its “faintly-scented” benison.Not least among McKay’s accomplishments is the enormous range of tone and subject in his sonnets. They may be trenchant political implements or celebrations of ecstatic physical love, some of the latter interpreted now to be homoerotic. Poem of the week has previously visited McKay’s work, and it is a pleasure to review here another facet of his many-sided achievement.Explore more on these topicsPoetryCarol Rumens's poem of the weekfeaturesShareReuse this content"

His plays are performed. His words are quoted. He reclines in effigy on both the Strand and the King’s Road. He even has a commemorative window in Westminster Abbey. But it was not always so.When he died in Paris, in 1900, aged just 46, the obituaries were not generous. There was a feeling of relief that an embarrassing figure had been removed the scene, and a general hope that he and his works would soon be forgotten. The Pall Mall Gazette suggested that nothing he wrote had “the strength to endure”.Just five years before, he had been the toast of London, with two successful plays running in the West End, but his arrest and conviction on charges of “gross indecency with male persons” had precipitated a very spectacular fall. Two years in prison were followed by three years of disgrace, continental exile, poverty and declining health, before the sad end at the modest Hotel d’Alsace.Only the hotel staff and handful of old friends attended the funeral, even fewer made the trip to the cemetery at Bagneux, in the outer suburbs, to see him interred. His long-suffering wife, Constance, had predeceased him, and although his two sons – 15-year-old Cyril and 14-year-old Vyvyan, survived, they were at schools in England, camouflaged with the adopted surname “Holland”, and ignorant of their father’s whereabouts. Indeed, they had been led to believe – by their strait-laced maternal relatives – that their father was already dead.The story of Oscar’s glorious posthumous rehabilitation, together with the long shadow that he cast over his two sons and continues to cast over his single grandchild, is the subject of this fascinating book – written, with an engaging combination of wit, personal candour and scholarly rigour, by the grandchild himself, Merlin Holland.The strands are both cultural and personal, and Holland plaits them together with a deft hand. Strict chronology is eschewed, in favour of a more episodic approach. This occasions some minor moments of repetition but produces a clearer sense of the unfolding drama. And the storyisdramatic, touched with comedy, tragedy, farce and considerable pathos.The struggle to secure Wilde’s legacy in the decade-and-a-half after his death is dominated by the figure of Robbie Ross, the “devoted friend” who brought Wilde’s estate back from the bankruptcy into which it had been plunged at the time of his fall. He facilitated experimental German productions of Salome, oversaw a multi-volume edition of The Works of Oscar Wilde, encouraged the young Arthur Ransome to write a first critical study of Wilde’s work, and coordinated the ambitious project to move Oscar’s grave to the fashionable Parisian cemetery, Père-Lachaise, and have it marked with a magnificent monument by the sculptor Jacob Epstein (paid for by a wealthy female admirer of Wilde’s work).Plans for John Gielgud to unveil the blue plaque on the front of Wilde’s Tite Street house were derailed when he was arrested for cottagingThis tomb, with its “demon angel” figure , plays a recurrent and entertaining role in the book, from the moment the French authorities cover it with tarpaulin due to anxieties about the sculpture’s nudity, to the later mysterious disappearance of the sculpture’s prominent “member” (which had by then become smoothed by frequent caresses); and – more recently – the author’s own battles with French bureaucracy to get the tomb listed as a monument to help protect it from the myriad lipstick kisses planted by enthusiastic votaries.In all his efforts Ross was busily hindered by the antagonism of his one-time friend (and Oscar’s former lover),Lord Alfred Douglas, who in the years following Wilde’s death had renounced his past, converted to Roman Catholicism, and married. His jealousy of Ross, and his ire at being continually presented as the “evil genius” of Wilde’s life, fuelled a ceaseless round of spite and litigation.And this Punch and Judy show, as Holland terms it, continued after Ross’s early death. Indeed, up until Douglas’s own demise in 1945 anyone who chose to write about Wilde might find themselves in the litigious lord’s crosshairs; even Vyvyan Holland was not immune.This, though, was only one of the strains faced by Oscar’s children as they confronted their paternal inheritance. The book offers poignant descriptions of their lonely childhoods – they were kept apart, sent to different schools, quartered with different friends and relations. Cyril, older and aware of the reasons for his father’s disgrace, retreated into convention. Determined to “wipe the stain away”, he joined the Royal Artillery straight after school and died from a sniper’s bullet on the Western Front in 1915, aged 30.Vyvyan, sensitive and literary, had a more complex relationship with his father’s legacy. His own literary career, as a respected translator from French, was supported by the substantial royalties that in time came from the estate - especially after the actor-manager George Alexander bequeathed back the rights toThe Importance of Being EarnestandLady Windermere’s Fan. But even this created its own problems.The late 1940s were bumper years, with major film productions and West End revivals of the plays, but they coincided with the postwar Labour government’s imposition of a one-off 50% levy on investment income. Vyvyan was landed with a tax bill for £3,600 at the very moment his own income was dwindling and the copyright on Wilde’s published works was approaching its end. He struggled to keep up, (writing an autobiography, Son of Oscar Wilde, in an effort to earn money) but in 1955 was declared bankrupt.It was an embarrassment that took place against the accelerating growth of his father’s reputation as both writer and cultural icon. Such increasing status stimulated, among other things, a long (and continuing) cavalcade of Wildean forgeries, fabrications and fantasies. They are all entertainingly detailed here, including the spiritualist volume The Ghost Epigrams of Oscar Wilde with arresting apercus, such as, “Love, like the measles, attacks only the young.”But the upward path was not always smooth. For most of the 20th century, Wilde’s growing reputation remained subject to periodic eclipse by the lingering scandal of his sexuality – a scandal that had a way of coming into focus at inopportune moments. Plans for John Gielgud to unveil the blue plaque on the front of Wilde’s Tite Street house were derailed when he was arrested for cottaging. (The task was delegated to Compton Mackenzie.) If Vyvyan became wearily accustomed to such setbacks, they greatly distressed his Australian wife, Thelma, who, as a skincare specialist with the firm Cyclax, gave beauty advice to the young Queen Elizabeth, and was anxious to whitewash the family history.It was Merlin’s growing anxieties about this project – which Thelma continued after Vyvyan’s death in 1967 - that gradually drew him into the Wildean world. After a childhood trying to avoid what seemed an embarrassing association, and a post-university career in academic publishing in the Middle East, he came to realise that honesty was what was needed. If he was going to acknowledge his grandfather it must be not as a mere “living link” with the past, but as an informed expert. And that is what he has become: the author of several important books of Wildean history and historiography – including this one.‘How far do you go in the depiction of gay lovemaking?’: Christopher Wheeldon on his new Oscar Wilde balletRead moreNot that the DNA is unimportant. He gives a hair-raising account of attending Moscow Pride in 2006, caught between neo-fascist thugs and the Russian riot police. He had gone, at the entreaty of the organisers, as “the grandson of Oscar Wilde”. It was a courageous gesture, but also a vivid example of his grandfather’s continuing and ever-evolving power. Wilde’s afterlife remains almost as rich and entertaining as his life.Matthew Sturgis is the author of Oscar: A Life (Head of Zeus).

The narrative potential of such businesses, where customers pay for a particular service and expect to receive other kinds of care, has been explored in films and novels set in taxis, hairdressers and, in Katja Oskamp’s Marzahn, Mon Amour, a chiropody clinic. Such settings open rich questions: who has the power, the one who pays or the one who shapes the customer’s body, often with alarmingly sharp implements? How human can such exchanges of cash for care or “beauty” be? What do we buy and what do we sell in these transactions?The novel sets out its stall plainly. Narrated by Ning, the salon owner and a retired boxer, the prelude ends, “Looking at the two of us, them sitting on a chair above me, and me down low, you’d think I am not in charge. But I am. I know everything about them, whether or not they tell me.” All first-person narrators are unreliable, and we are implicitly invited to question this assertion. With more certainty at the beginning and less at the end, Ning thinks she knows everything about everyone, including her employees. The workers judge and mock their customers, relying on clients not understanding “our language”. (Which language is not specified, and perhaps doesn’t matter, certainly not to most of the customers.) Seen through Ning’s eyes, everyone is trying to get what they can for as little as possible in a system with small room for humanity.The salon’s rules exaggerate, almost parody, those of the service economy. All the workers, including Ning, wear name tags that say “Susan”. “We all have black shoulder-length hair and wear black T-shirts and black pants. We are, more or less, the same height too.” It’s just easier for everyone, and a good selling point: “Dear Susan is always available and at your service! Susan never takes a day off and Susan is never fully booked if it’s you who called for her.”The business, called Susan’s, is Ning’s kingdom. There are five chairs, four workers, serving clients three at a time; “any more than that and I lose track of who is doing what and when”. Ning lives in a “tiny apartment … right above the shop” and “can’t remember the last time I spent any time away from it”. And so the book’s impressive constraints are set: one room, one day, one business.One of the challenges of the circadian novel, especially when it’s also a closed-room novel, is to channel enough backstory through the present moment to establish the significance of what might be dismissed as too routine or trivial for literary attention. The premise of this kind of writing, paying close attention to humdrum daily life, is that the real stories lie in the opening and closing of doors, the making of tea and sweeping of floors. The writer has to make the reader see such acts anew, to recognise that life arcs, shaped by war and colonialism and migration, play out in thoughtless transactions and small impulses.Thammavongsa achieves this, though there is one threadbare moment, where a dead pigeon becomes the focus of more mourning and tenderness than quite fits the character or situation. Ning tells us early on about her former life in boxing, and her recollections of this career filter through her reflections and instincts in the salon. Violence, aggression and self-defence are never far from her mind, the fighter’s deep sense of contingency and insecurity amplifying the vigilance of immigrant experience. Every time the door opens or the phone rings, Ning is alert to risk. She notices the sharpness of her tools, the flaws and vulnerability of skin.But kindness, also, seeps through in the end. There’s no disgust at tired feet or oily skin. Proudly child-free, scornful of clients’ desire to talk about their babies, Ning nonetheless keeps drawings made by the children of an employee whom she allowed to exploit her. There are developing moments of sympathy and even affection for her longest-serving worker, and beautifully understated sadness at the end.The constrained setting, deep investment in a feminised and minoritised experience and disengagement from plot will alienate some readers. They will miss a highly crafted, layered and clever novel.Pick a Colour by Souvankham Thammavongsa is published by Bloomsbury (£12.99).

Fighter jets scorch over head, tanks rumble by, the side of a building is obliterated by a rocket-propelled grenade. While Call of Duty has always focused its online matches on close skirmishes, Battlefield 6 makes you feel part of a vast military offensive, bewildering and ear-shattering, with even the quiet moments punctuated by the pop-pop of distance rifle fire, the shouts of orders and the cries for medics.It’s well known that EA’s long-running first-person shooter series has hit trouble over the last couple of years, with futuristic instalmentBattlefield 2042widely considered a disappointment. So this time round, the development team (a collective of studios including original creator DICE) has gone back to the excellent Battlefield 4 for inspiration, where the emphasis was on authentic-feeling modern military warfare on large maps with lots of players. As ever, Battlefield 6 gives you the choice of four classes – Assault, Support, Engineer and Recon – each with its own weapons and gadgets, all of which can be upgraded and customised as you level up your soldier and gain experience. It’s a hybrid system taking elements of older Battlefields as well as newer Call of Duty titles, where the Gunsmith system revolutionised weapon personalisation for first-person online shooters.View image in fullscreenBrooklyn at war … Battlefield 6.Photograph: Electronic ArtsThe best online modes are the big ones, such as Conquest and Breakthrough, which focus on taking swathes of territory from the other team by holding down objective points. There are small and mid-sized modes, too, including King of the Hill and Domination, but to Battlefield veterans they feel like gestures to a different school of thought. From the very beginning – 2002’s seminal Battlefield 1942 – this series has encouraged tactical, thoughtful play, gathering a few comrades and sneaking up on enemy bases, timing attacks with helicopter support, wearing down defences. In a good session there maybe several minutes where you are hiking across the map, or crawling towards a well-defended building. The meat-grinder feel of Call of Duty, with its turbo-charged pace and five-second shootouts, feels a long way away.Yet, when you’re caught in a battle in this game, it is exhilarating. Whether you’re on the streets of Brooklyn or the sands of Cairo, chunks of exploded masonry fly by, bullets strafe metal, tanks explode in fiery billows of flame and smoke. The visuals and sound design are astonishingly good, capturing the grainy, shaky-cam faux-documentary style of Generation Kill or Warfare, rather than the choreographed action movie carnage of CoD. If you’re lucky enough to get on a good team (and I really recommend playing with at least one or two friends), a real sense of underfire camaraderie develops.The weak point is the game’s superfluous Campaign mode, a hackneyed techno thriller set in the near future where a private military company is aiming to take control of the world, and only a hardy team of American-controlled spec-ops warriors can stop them. It’s a tired setup – and something of a cop out. By making the baddie a fictitious military corporation, the developers can pretend the story is meaningful and relevant without having to, God forbid, make a political point or implicate a country that may well be a market for the game – or an investor in Electronic Arts. It’s also hard to maintain any interest in a group of Identi-Kit tough guys who constantly spout lines such as: “There ain’t no red tape out here,” and (while staking out an enemy base on sunny Gibraltar): “I don’t know what’s more impressive, the view or the firepower.” When lead character Murphy says to a comrade: “There ain’t nobody I’d rather be in this fight with,” I wished there was an option to defect.Don’t let that put you off. For the most part, Battlefield 6 is a brilliant return to form, a thrilling, almost operatic shooter experience, which manages to combine deafening combat with tactical subtlety. How it will fit into the modern landscape of hero shooters and battle royale blast-em-ups is anyone’s guess – it deserves a shot, that’s for sure.Battlefield 6 is out now, £65Explore more on these topicsGamesPlayStation 5Xbox series S/XPCShooting gamesMMORPGreviewsShareReuse this content"

Most of the audience getting down this afternoon – it’s one of the show’s four weekly matinees – probably know these songs from first time round. The 12in records used to frame the stage, their centre labels glowing in candy colours, are a testament to the discography at director-choreographer Lisa Stevens’ disposal.Twenty numbers arranged by Mark Crossland are spread across an 80-minute production which doesn’t give much space for character development. So it is maddening to discover that this is also another one ofthose showsin which the question of how to tell the story becomes an ongoing discussion for the characters on stage rather than a matter for the writers’ room. The band’s leader Harry Wayne Casey (“KC”), played by Ross Harmon, has barely been introduced before his pal Dee (Paige Fenlon) is schooling him on11 o’clock numbersand musical-theatre trends.The tale of how Casey formed a band and lifelong friendships, while his gang fall in and out of love with each other, is always well sung but continually interrupted by their tedious conversations about “milieu” and “advancing the plot” with references to musical sensations includingHamilton. Get Down Tonight can only come off poorly from such comparisons, and scenes in a recording studio (with irresistible bass by Otto Williams) and of the group’s flashpoints have further unfortunate parallels to the far superiorThe Harder They ComeandStereophonicrespectively.View image in fullscreenBoogie shoes … Ross Harmon as Harry Wayne “KC” Casey with the ensemble.Photograph: Danny KaanNevertheless, several songs are cleverly used to underline the plot – notably the love triangle between Casey, Orly (Adam Taylor) and Gina (Annabelle Terry) which comes to a head during a nightclubbing scene that stretches across Shake Your Booty and That’s the Way (I Like It). There are smooth routines with arm rolls and disco fingers, performed in shimmering jumpsuits and sparkly platform shoes by an ensemble who accompany the principal quartet of actors. The era’s other fashions of chiffon and denim are on display in fuggy pot-smoking scenes that include Dee embracing a gatefold cover of Jim Morrison and thin discussions of the war in Vietnam. More could be made of how KC and the Sunshine Band, formed in Florida, provided an alternative to what the show describes as an industry dominated by New York and Los Angeles.Neither JF Lawton’s book nor the lyrics by Casey – who was involved in developing this often over-sentimental show – have enough depth to prevent an overall feel of disco week on Strictly with the occasional gyrating ambush from Magic Mike Live. The production, presented at the Edinburgh fringe in 2024 under the title Who Do Ya Love?, has a set by Bretta Gerecke, lighting by Jai Morjaria and costumes based on original designs by Tom Rogers that all conjure dancefloor hedonism, but you never lose yourself in the story or the music.AtCharing Cross theatre, London, until 15 NovemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreDiscoMusicalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Each is potentially a work of astonishing individual impact, yet they can come together to form something even greater than the sum of their parts.Perhaps it’s in the way that each sonata seems to pick up on and amplify the conflicts, beauties and struggles of the one before. Op 109 came to its close above a low rumble that Uchida made sound like an earthquake –Beethovenmust have thought of sound as something to be felt as well as heard. When similar deep grumbles recurred in the first movement of Op 110 – gentler and unquiet this time, contrasting with tender chords above – they felt like a recollection. The forthright little fugue variation in Op 109 found its fully grown counterpart in the huge culmination of Op 110, and the peace that was so hard won at the end of Op 111 felt like a resolution of a whole evening’s music, not just one sonata.Her Steinway sounding warm and mellow, Uchida was more generous with the sustaining pedal than some pianists, and set up some intriguing juxtapositions of mystery and decisiveness. In the slow waltz that forms the first variation of the Op 109 finale, she gave the imaginary dancers time to place their steps, but other than this she rarely lingered. The prevailing mood was of clarity and propulsive energy; perhaps when she recorded these sonatas nearly 20 years ago, she tackled the brief fast movements with more urgency, yet in this performance they still sounded dangerous and exhilarating.Late in the second and final movement, Uchida reached a trill high up on the keyboard, and stretched it out until it seemed she might never move away; then the ending unfolded around it, leading to a peace that was cathartically hard won. At the very end, she held us in silence – then gave a little start and grinned as if she’d been having a game, seeing how long she could keep us enthralled. Naturally, she had won.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicMitsuko UchidaWigmore HallreviewsShareReuse this content"

As a filmmaker, I’ve lost a connection with an actress that one can only dream of.“We all search for that someone who really gets us, right? Well, with Diane, I believe we mutually had that. I always felt she really got me so writing for her made me better because I felt so secure in her hands. I knew how vulnerable she could be.

Two episodes will air each week in the following two weeks. There will also be a separate film of the final concert of the Eras tour at Vancouver’s BC Place, entitled The Eras Tour | The Final Show, airing from 12 December.Taylor Swift scores second-biggest UK charts opening week ever with The Life of a ShowgirlRead more“It was the End of an Era and we knew it,” Swift wrote on Instagram, announcing the projects. “We wanted to remember every moment leading up to the culmination of the most important and intense chapter of our lives, so we allowed film-makers to capture this tour and all the stories woven throughout it as it wound down. And to film the final show in its entirety.”Between March 2023 and December 2024, Eras encompassed 149 concerts across five continents and became the highest-grossing concert tour in history, with over $2bn in ticket sales. With a runtime of more than three and a half hours, and later described by Swift as “absolutely the most challenging thing I’ve ever done in my life”, its setlist drew from all but one of Swift’s studio albums, with the later shows adding material from her 2024 albumThe Tortured Poets Department.Swift has already released a filmed version of the tour, entitledTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour, but its October 2023 release date meant it did not feature The Tortured Poets Department material. It became the highest-grossing tour film of all time, earning $267m from its global run in cinemas.It was later available to stream on Disney+. Financial terms for that deal, and for the new filmed projects, have not been made public.With Swift’s reference to “all the stories woven throughout [Eras] as it wound down”, the series could document the creation of her latest album The Life of a Showgirl, which was made in part during the Eras tour. “What it ended up doing was like reinvigorating every single aspect of my life, including the tour,” she has said.Taylor Swift: The Life of a Showgirl review – dull razzle-dazzle from a star who seems frazzledRead moreThe Life of a Showgirl, her 12th studio album, was released on 3 October and has been one of Swift’s most commercially successful but critically divisive albums.It has the largest single-week sales of any album in US history,beating the record set by Adele’s 25, and thesecond-highest in UK history,behind Ed Sheeran’s ÷. Butthe Guardian’s Alexis Petridis wrotethat the album has a “distinct lack of undeniable hooks and nailed-on melodies” – one of a number of relatively rare negative reviews for Swift, with Pitchfork, the Standard and others also criticising the album.Explore more on these topicsTaylor SwiftPop and rockTelevisionDisney+News CorporationnewsShareReuse this content"

August and Everything After was our first major label album, so it was a pretty big deal. Our advance was $3,000 each; I bought a 1971 cherry red VW Karmann Ghia convertible and drove it to LA.I would get up every morning and listen toPickin’ Up the Pieces by Poco, which is like the Beatles doing country music. I also had this Benny Goodman album that I was listening to a lot – my dad had picked it up as a free giveaway at a Texaco station when I was a kid.Mr Jones was on a demo we sent to all the record companies, but it was a very difficult song to finish. We didn’t have a great handle on it. It’s not a slow song, but it’s not a straight ahead, fast song either. It gallops along, so you have to get a real feel for it. It’s soul music – closer toStax Recordsthan it is to country.Our drummer couldn’t hear the song how the rest of us did – so T Bone brought in one of his heroes to play itWe looked at a few different producers but when I talked to T Bone Burnett about where the band was at, I felt like he really got it. We had a lot of potential, but I didn’t like the way we sounded – we hadn’t learned to be a band yet. We took away all of the synths and guitar effects. Our drummer Steve Bowman couldn’t hear the song how the rest of us did and so T Bone brought in one of Steve’s heroes, Denny Fongheiser to play on it. It’s a funny story now, but it was rough on Steve.Marty Jones was my best friend and we played in bands together before Counting Crows. His father,David Serva, had made it as a flamenco musician in Spain and he was back in the Bay Area doing a bunch of shows. We went to see him play and hung out with the flamenco troupe from bar to bar, all night. The next morning, I went home and wrote Mr Jones. It’s about me and Marty out that night, wishing we were cool musicians so we could talk to the girls a little better.I think it’s one of the best things I’ve ever written. We played Round Here on Saturday Night Live in 1994 and the record jumped 40 spots a week for five or six weeks. After that, Mr Jones became a big deal.David Immerglück, multi-instrumentalistAdam, David Bryson [guitarist] and I were living together in this warehouse complex in Berkeley in the late 1980s. I had been playing with Camper Van Beethoven, and had this offshoot band called Monks of Doom.I came home one evening and Adam had a new demo that he’d just done with Bryson. He played me this song called Mr Jones. It was done with this Dr Rhythm pocket drum machine that sounded like a video game or some popcorn popping, but his vocals were on another kind of level.Once T Bone got a hold of the band, it was like a complete reinvention of the Counting Crows. It was getting back to the basics of Bob Dylan, Van Morrison and the Band.Adam called me and said: “Hey, man, can you come down and play on this record?” By the time I got there, T Bone had moved us to the studio in Encino, Los Angeles – Tito Jackson’s from the Jackson 5. There were the guitars in there that Dylan had just recorded on.T Bone cued me in to play my guitar behind the tempo of the drums. He said: “If you rush ahead of the drums you sound like an adolescent jacking off too quickly.” He’s got the southern accent because he’s from Texas and his advice was just to imagine that you’ve put your feet up on the mixing board and chewing gum while you’re playing.Counting Crows was in some ways a reaction to grunge. Kurt Cobain killing himself was like its final act. Everyone was on heroin. The object was obliteration, not mind expansion. The nihilism had gone too far, the pendulum swung to something more human and more emotional. Counting Crows was folk and rock with a heavy dose of Van Morrison soul.The song never gets old. Sometimes on stage when I am rocking out with Adam, I will remember that moment when he played me the demo of the song. It’s insane.Counting Crows tour the UK and Ireland from 21 OctoberExplore more on these topicsCultureHow we madePop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

One of her best-loved songs and hailed as “one of the greatest songs of all time” by Rolling Stone, itbecame a hit all over again in 2022when it featured in the fourth season of the US TV series Stranger Things.Maggi Hambling, once described as the “original bad girl of art” and Peter Doig,whose paintings have sold for millions, are among those to contribute works interpreting the lyric for the fundraiser Sound & Vision, named after David Bowie’s 1977 hit.All the works will feature in an online auction, from 28 October to 13 November, with starting bids at £100, to raise money forthe charity War Child, which protects, educates, and stands up for the rights of children living in war zones.View image in fullscreenMidnight Wave by Maggi Hambling.Photograph: Maggi HamblingAnnouncing the project, Bush said: “All wars leave horrific scars; ruined lives, families ripped apart, life-changing injuries, trauma, and loss on a massive scale – but it’s the children who suffer the most in so many ways. Their past, present and future melt away into fear and uncertainty.“It is more important than ever we support War Child and their invaluable work providing immediate aid to children caught in conflict all over the world including in Ukraine, Gaza, Sudan and Syria.

She said Doig had asked if he could take part. “I nearly fell off my chair.

Then my daughter and I discovered the joy of staying in strangers’ homes in return for a little dogwalkingNicola SkinnerMon 13 Oct 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 13 Oct 2025 12.13 EDTShareAfter my marriage ended, I blithely thought it would be easy to enjoy holidays as a single parent. I soon found out they were either outrageously expensive, or they seemed only suitable for “traditional” families, or they were so cheap that I came home more knackered than when I’d left.My first attempt, camping with friends, was fine until I had to pack up the tent. Four hours of wrestling with it in the heat later, I hated camping. Next, the adventure holiday for single-parent families. The abseiling and caving were brilliant, but sleeping in a bunk bed ruined my back. We tried a budget all-inclusive in Tenerife, but the hordes of nuclear families were overwhelming, and pool-side conversations with other women fizzled out because I didn’t come with a handy husband for their own husbands to talk to. A trip to Mallorca with a friend and her children was brilliant, but the cost was eye-watering.Then, last autumn, a friend asked if we’d house-sit her dogs in Devon while she went to a wedding. For one tranquil weekend, we walked on the beach, and curled up by the fire in the evening. That led to house-sitting for her friend in Dorset, which also went well. Encouraged, I paid an annual £99 fee to join a house-sitting website, where, in exchange forlooking after people’s pets, you stay in their homes free of charge. Within a few days, I’d arranged a 10-day house-sit in Sussex, looking after a labrador named Buzz while his owners were abroad.View image in fullscreen‘Our daily walks gave us the opportunity to explore stunning nature spots’ … Skinner and her daughter Polly at the Temple of the Winds in Sussex.Photograph: Courtesy of Nicola SkinnerIt was our first sit for strangers, but any nerves dissipated the moment we arrived at the gorgeous four-bedroom house and met the gentle Buzz, who lived for tummy rubs. Our daily dog walks gave us the opportunity to explore stunning nature spots, and, once we returned home, we could relax in the garden for important conversations about our favourite “Ghosts” characters in theBBC sitcom.There were no expensive tourist traps to traipse through – instead, we browsed bookshops, treated ourselves to manicures, and went on kayak trips. I felt lighter and happier than I had in years, and could feel my bond with my daughter Polly strengthen every day. I’m not afraid to say that I cried with happiness. Things felt possible again.House-sitting isn’t for everyone. Some people want no responsibilities on holiday apart from choosing their next cocktail, aren’t into dogs or cats, or feel odd about sleeping in a stranger’s bed, emptying their dishwasher, and putting out their bins. But the gentle rhythm of ordinary life, with work stripped out and new places to explore, is perfect for me.It keeps me from descending into complete idleness, which leaves me feeling twitchy and oddly hollow. And, financially, house-sitting is a life-saver for a single parent. A 10-day break in a similar-sized house in the same area we stayed would set me back about £2,500 on Airbnb.As for staying in a stranger’s house, I found it nourishing. Although house-sitting is a transaction, it’s also an act of trust between strangers and animals, which has brought out my best self – my patient, loving and measured side, full of appreciation for the people and places we discover. I’ve already lined up another four days away, caring for a whippet in leafy Surrey, and, next year, I’d like to try house-sitting abroad. Thanks to a bit of creative thinking, we can see the world from the comfort of home – it just happens to be someone else’s.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThe one change that workedFamilyParents and parentingDivorceDogsPetsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As a child I remember the feisty women behind the bar at the pubs where my dad used to drink, the punk-haired cafe owner and the redoubtable librarian always up for a noisy chat when we checked out our books. That was before it became known as the lesbian capital of the UK (my gay cousin from Australia once told me she was coming to Europe: “Hebden Bridge?” I asked. “How did you know?” she gasped).Now the lass spirit of the West Yorkshire town is on display again, this time in Sally “Happy Valley” Wainwright’s new BBC One dramaRiot Women, which tells the story of a group of women in their late 50s who set up a rock band.Hebden Bridge location mapLike me, Wainwright grew up in Calderdale; like me, she’s 62. So she too must remember the days when Hebden Bridge was more famous for its flat-capped eccentricity than its edgy coolness. At university (and spookily, Wainwright and I were both at York, though we didn’t know one another), I would regularly boast that I lived close to where poet Ted Hughes grew up (he was born in Mytholmroyd, just along the valley) and near to where his erstwhile wife and fellow poet Sylvia Plath was buried (Heptonstall, on the hill above Hebden Bridge). But I certainly didn’t dwell on the smoky, cramped pubs or the greasy spoon cafes or the unremarkable warehouse-like unbranded store where my mum bought the groceries. The town felt deeply frumpy back then.In a town with a penchant for pop-up shops, one of the joys of visiting Hebden Bridge regularly is that it’s never the same twiceThings are different today. I name-drop the Nisa Local on Crown Street, where my mum buys her Guardian, because in Happy Valley it’s where Neil, the partner of Catherine Cawood’s sister, worked in Happy Valley. More thrillingly, my mother’s flat is at the top of the street where Cawood (played magnificently by Sarah Lancashire) lived: the climactic final car park scene after James Norton’s character, Tommy Lee Royce, sets himself alight must have been visible from her balcony. And now the souped-upAlbert, on Albert Street – one of my dad’s haunts in the 70s and 80s – has been transformed into the Duke of Wellington for Riot Women, with Lorraine Ashbourne, playing alongside Tamsin Greig and Joanna Scanlan, as the landlady.View image in fullscreenThe Albert pub was transformed into the ‘Duke of Wellington’ for Riot Women.Photograph: Paul Boyes/AlamyRight now I’m having breakfast opposite the Albert, at a table in the sunshine outsideLeila’s Kitchen, whose Iranian owner tells me it was the original vegetarian cafe of Hebden Bridge, set up in the 1980s. She’s run it since 2019, and her Persian breakfast – eggs, walnuts, feta cheese, salad and flatbread – is a renowned speciality, as is her noodle soup and saffron and pistachio ice-cream.In a town with a penchant for revolving doors and pop-up shops, one of the joys of visiting Hebden Bridge regularly is that it’s never the same twice. In fact, there’s currently another top-class breakfast venue, with queues heading down Valley Road while they’ve still got buns to sell:Mother, home of just-baked croissants including the almond one I tried. “It’s a bit hefty,” the assistant said as I pointed to it; in the event, I didn’t need another meal for the rest of the day.The police station I knew is now an antique shop; the newsagent’s is The Remedy, where you sit at high tables and taste a flight of winesIt’s quicker to say what has been constant rather than what’s changed since I was a child. TheTown Hall, with its big green doors, is the same (though they certainly didn’t have art exhibitions and a cafe there when I was a kid). The rush of the river, fast-flowing through the town and whizzing under the packhorse bridge that gave the town its name, is a welcome constant. Andthe Picture Houseis still there: where once I watched Grease, Jaws and An Officer and a Gentleman, the BBC premiered Riot Women here last week, as a thank you to the locals who put up with weeks of filming last summer.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was back in 1972 that a local legend called David Fletcher bought a disused mill in the centre of the town and turned it into the quintessential gift shop-cum-cafe, the business all the other shops that came after wanted to emulate (in terms of its longevity and success, anyway). TheTrades Clubwas always there, and always a trades union club – but now, still owned by the Labour party, it’s one of the funkiest live music and comedy venues in Britain. Sadly, Riot Women are a fictional band, but the October lineup included Grace Petrie (“the British folk scene’s funniest lesbian”), DJ Red Helen and Josie Long.Riot women!

Writer Olivia Petter tested dating apps for the Filter.Photograph: Teri Pengilley/The GuardianWe’ve learned lessons beyond the products themselves. “Never trust a man who calls himself ‘one of the good ones’ on the first date,” says Olivia Petter, who gamelytested dating appsfor us. While Caramel Quin learned she’s not alone going through menopause: “When I wrote “why you should trust me” as afan reviewer, I talked about being a woman in her 50s and honestly not remembering the last time I felt cold. A lot of readers got in touch, feeling seen.”In writing her monthlyfashion edits, Jess Cartner-Morley has learned that it’s “absolutely fine to ask strangers where they got their fabulous shoes/earrings/jacket. They’re generally pleased with the compliment and almost always generous enough to share the intel.”Should you always spend as much as you can afford? “Good-quality items that work well cost more money,” says Ella Foote, who wroteour guide to wild swimming. “There’s always a copy or cheaper alternative, but you do get what you pay for.” Until you don’t … “The biggest thing I’ve learned is not to judge a product by its attractiveness or its price,” says Matt Collins, our gardening writer. “Sometimes the more affordable, less stylish option delivers genuinely surprising results.”Valuable discoveriesView image in fullscreenWhy does it always rain on me?

There were just two versions that I liked, and both were made by my mother: one with lime and coconut, the other a slow-cooked black dal with cream (even nicer thanthe Dishoom version). But now a third quick-cook dal has made it into my hall of fame. And the secret? Blitzing it until very smooth, then serving with a topping of roast squash and moreish chilli cashews. It’s a revelation that’s now on my weekly rotation.Lime dal with roast squash and chilli cashewsPrep15 minCook30 minServes2600g butternut squash flesh, cut into 1cm cubes1tbsp neutral or olive oilSea salt flakes1tsp freshly ground coriander1tsp ground cumin150g red lentils, rinsed well1garlic clove, peeled½tsp turmericJuice of 1-2 limes, to taste1tsp butterChopped fresh coriander, to serveFor the chilli cashews60g cashew nuts1tsp neutral oil, or olive oil¼tsp chilli flakesHeat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7. Tip the cubed squash, oil, a teaspoon of sea salt, and the ground coriander and cumin into a roasting tin big enough to hold all the veg in one layer, and mix well to coat. Roast for 25-30 minutes, until cooked through and starting to catch at the edges.Meanwhile, put the lentils in a large pan with 500ml just-boiled water, the garlic and the turmeric, and bring to a boil. Partially cover, lower the heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 20-25 minutes, until the lentils are soft.Mix the cashews, oil, chilli and a big pinch of salt in a small baking tray. When the squash has eight minutes left, pop the cashew tray in the same oven; by the time the squash is ready, the nuts should be nicely toasted.Whisk the dal and season with lime juice and sea salt to taste. You will need quite a lot of both: think of the dal as a completely blank canvas (I used the juice of two limes and I’m embarrassed to say how much salt!). Keep adjusting and tasting until you’re happy with the seasoning, then add the butter.My final step, which takes this dish to the next level, is to blitz the dal (and the garlic clove) in batches in a high-speed blender. Taste again – it should be perfect.Divide the dal between two bowls, top with the roast squash and chilli cashews, scatter over the coriander and serve hot with rice and/or breads.Explore more on these topicsFoodQuick and easyBeans, pulses and legumesVegetablesVegetarian food and drinkFruitMain courseSide dishesrecipesShareReuse this content"

After patiently waiting for tomatoes and aubergines to be done with their performance, autumn brings its own bounty of vegetables back into play, with squash, cauliflower and dark, leafy greens being some of my favourites. They’re ideal for loading into comforting dishes to hunker down with, and lend even the most indulgent meals a bit of goodness.Sausages with squash and beans (pictured top)Prep10 minCook1 hr 10 minServes47 tbsp olive oil1 onion,peeled and finely chopped2garlic cloves,peeled and finely chopped15g rosemary,finely chopped8 good-quality pork sausages600g butternut squash,peeled, deseeded and cut into 3cm chunks400ml chicken stock2560g jars of butter beans70g sourdough breadcrumbsSalt and black pepper150g cavolo nero40g parmesanFinely grated zest of 1 lemon, plus the juice of half, and optional lemon wedges to serveOver a medium flame, heat three tablespoons of the oil in a large, shallow casserole dish for which you have a lid. Tip in the chopped onion and cook, stirring, for 15 minutes, until softened. Add the garlic and rosemary, and cook for another five minutes.Put a large frying pan on a medium-high heat, add a tablespoon of oil, then lay in the sausages and fry, turning often, for about five minutes, until nicely browned all over.Add the squash to the onion pan, pour in the stock, cover and leave to simmer for five minutes. Drain the butter beans into a sieve, rinse them under the cold tap, then stir into the sausage pan, cover and simmer for 20 minutes.Put three tablespoons of oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat, tip in the breadcrumbs and toast for about five minutes, until golden and crisp. Season with salt and leave to cool.Strip the cavolo nero leaves off the stalks, then tear them into bite-size pieces. Add these to the sausage pan, then put the lid back on and cook for five minutes, until the cabbage wilts.Mash a quarter of the butter beans with a fork to thicken the sauce and turn it creamy, then grate in the parmesan and lemon zest, and squeeze in the juice of half the lemon. Season to taste.Spoon the sausages and beans into bowls, top with the crisp breadcrumbs, and serve with a wedge of lemon if you like.Cauliflower cheese risottoView image in fullscreenSophie Wyburd’s cauliflower cheese risotto.Prep5 minCook1 hr 20 minServes41 mediumcauliflower3 tbsp olive oil, plus a drizzle to serveSea salt and black pepper30g butter1 onion,peeled and finely chopped1½ litres chicken stock, or vegetable stock300g arboriorice200g mature cheddar, grated, plus 25g extra for servingFreshly grated nutmeg15g fresh chives,finely choppedHeat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7. Halve the cauliflower, then chop one half into bite-size florets. Put the florets on a baking tray, toss with a tablespoon of the olive oil and a good pinch of salt, and roast for 30 minutes, until tender and lightly caramelised.Meanwhile, set a large, shallow saute pan on a medium heat, add the butter and two tablespoons of olive oil, then tip in the onion and cook for 20 minutes, until tender but not coloured.Coarsely grate the remaining half-cauliflower, then add to the onion pan and fry for five minutes, until reduced and softened. Meanwhile, put the stock in a medium-sized saucepan, bring to a gentle simmer, then keep warm on a low heat.Add the rice to the onion pan, and toast, stirring, for two minutes. Add the stock a ladleful at a time, stirring until the rice has absorbed each ladleful before adding the next. Repeat for about 30 minutes, until all but a ladleful of the stock has been used up and the rice is al dente.Turn off the heat, stir in the last of the stock, then cover and leave to sit for five minutes. Take off the lid, grate in the cheddar and a generous amount of nutmeg, then stir to combine and season to taste. The risotto should be loose and spoonable, so if need be, add a little more liquid at this point.Spoon the risotto into bowls, and top with the roast cauliflower and chopped chives. Finish with a little more grated cheddar and a drizzle of olive oil, then serve.Sophie Wyburd is the author of theFeederSubstack and Tucking In, published by Ebury at £22.

There were about 40 people affected.BA eventually booked us on to a flight leaving 36 hours later, but has refused to pay us the £220 compensation each due under EC regulations.It saysadverse weather was to blame and is exempted from compensation rules.I requested a formal confirmation of the cancellation to submit to my travel insurer and, on that form, BA claims“operational reasons” were the cause. Unlike adverse weather, this is not covered by the insurance policy.AC,Alfreton, DerbyshireThis is outrageous behaviour from a company that once considered itself “the world’s favourite airline”. You can’t get compensation from BA because, it says, bad weather grounded the flight, and you can’t get compensation from the insurer because the airline claims it was an operational issue.The difference is critical. Airlines are obliged to pay set sums of compensation for delayed or cancelled flights under regulationEC 261/2004. They can only get out of it if the disruption was caused by “extraordinary circumstances”.The regulation is vague on what these circumstances might be, but years of court rulings have honed the list down. Undefined “operational issues” would not be considered an excuse to avoid a payout; weather sometimes is, but only if it is exceptional and unexpected.So which was the cause? Both, says BA, hedging its bets. It claims bad weather that had disrupted previous flights had displaced crew, and that had had a knock-on effect on your journey.It ignored my questions about the whens, wheres and hows but that’s immaterial. “Knock-on” effects of bad weather are not an excuse to withhold compensation,according to the law firm Bott & Co.BA insisted it couldn’t comment further because, by then, your case was in the hands of its dispute resolution service, CEDR.This sounded to me like stalling tactics. I pointed this out and suddenly it stumped up. Since the money had to be prised out of it, I fear the other affected passengers may still be empty-handed.We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

Unruly and at times cruel, it forced me to hurdle fences, wade through bracken up to my midriff and teased me with disappearing paths and wayward waymarks.New map for Rhins of GallowayBut then, after I’d yelled profanities into the wind (there were no other hikers around to hear me), this raffishly handsome route would come over all sweetness and light. Look, it would simper: a dazzling and deserted white-sand bay! A ravishing spray of orchids! A crinkle of rocky foreshore be-flumped with seals! Once, moments after I’d cursed my way through a patch of Scottish jungle, a hare leapt from the sward just as a ruddy fox barred my way, a deer herd pronked down the cliffside and a buzzard mewed overhead; I felt like a sweaty Snow White summoning all the creatures at once, only by swearing rather than singing.“We toyed with whether to call it a ‘path’ or a ‘trail’,” said Bryan Scott, Dumfries and Galloway council’s countryside development officer and route creator. After my solo jaunt on the path/trail’s north and western stages, we were hiking a gentler south-east section together.Is there an official difference, I asked? “Well, no, but people think ‘path’ means there’s going to be some kind of a yellow brick road.”View image in fullscreenPortpatrick harbour.Photograph: Findlay/AlamyI can confirm there is no such thing around the Rhins of Galloway, the striking hammerhead peninsula at the edge of the edge of south-west Scotland. But there is an admirable almost-realised vision and a lot of potential.Southern Scotland sees a fraction of the tourists that head to the country’s lionised north: in 2024, there were 1.8m overnight visits to the Highlands andjust 520,000 to Dumfries and Galloway– and I’d wager most of those don’t make it out to the Rhins. “No doubt about it,” one taxi driver told me, “this is the land that time forgot.” It was clear the area could do with a boost; creating an 83-mile, six-stage coast path around the Rhins is part of the plan.The path is designed to improve access to this untamed, overlooked stretch of coast“One of the aims was to give people a reason to stay longer,” Scott told me as we advanced along the high clifftops to the Mull of Galloway, Scotland’s southernmost point, where a Stevenson lighthouse stands sentry over the waves. The path is designed to improve access to this untamed, overlooked stretch of coast, which, as well as more lighthouses, features ancient promontory forts, RSPB reserves, ruined castles, spectacular beaches and exotic gardens (the Gulf Stream makes this one of Scotland’s warmest spots). The problem is, Dumfries and Galloway has more than 1,100 miles of core paths that need looking after, with a team of only five to do it.View image in fullscreenThe ruins of Dunskey Castle near Portpatrick.Photograph: Barry Carlisle/Getty ImagesI’ve been following the progress of the Rhins coast path for a while, drawn to the idea of circumnavigating what is essentially an island that no one seems to visit. This year – its “soft launch”, I was told – seemed the right time.I started on Stranraer harbour, under the smart arch of corten steel marking the circular path’s beginning and end, using a GPX file of the route on my OS Maps app. From there I walked north, along the exposed shores of Loch Ryan, picking between oystercatchers and whimbrels, the alien blobs of barrel jellyfish, shaggy piles of bladderwrack and a crunchy scatter of shells. Somewhere under the loch’s blue lay Scotland’s last native oyster beds; during the second world war they were joined by surrendered U-boats, stowed here before being scuttled at sea. This area was strategically vital at that time, with parts of the D-day Mulberry harbour tested here, while flying boats, used to protect Allied shipping, were based on the headland known as the Wig.View image in fullscreenCorsewall lighthouse.Photograph: Rob Ford/AlamyThe going from Stranraer around the north of the Rhins was generally good. Highlights of the 13½ miles included military history, intriguing strandline, flower-flecked tussock and the remains of iron age settlements with views to Ailsa Craig and the isle of Arran beyond. Still, I was excited to finally see day’s end in the distance: lonely Corsewall lighthouse. Erected in 1815, the tower still protects ships in these frothy waters, but the old keepers’ quarters are now a hotel.John and Helen Harris welcomed me in. As well as running the place – “quite the challenge, in a good way, 99% of the time …” – they’re also among the volunteers helping to look after the coast path, cutting back overgrowth and reporting problems. They’re starting to get a few more walkers staying, they told me, and have compiled a folder of local rambles for guests not tramping the whole trail.I mistakenly dropped down to the sea, then followed in the hoof-prints of a flock of feral goats to get back up againI could see the attraction of basing myself here for nice day walks: I’ve stayed in few more atmospheric spots, and the five-course dinner concocted by Helen’s son Richard in the teeny kitchen was ridiculously good. Before leaving the next morning, we had a quick chat about what lay ahead. Helen reckoned I’d already done the coast path’s toughest stage; John’s expression told me I had not.John was right. The following two days – Corsewall to the pretty harbour village of Portpatrick, then Portpatrick to Port Logan’s wide, sandy sweep, around 15 miles each – were mettle-testing stuff. But also a proper adventure. I walked amid the sheep-grazed ruins of a wartime radar station to reach moaning seals. I accidentally annoyed a peregrine falcon, which spent a good 10 minutes shrieking above my head. I bounded across hills, high above the serrated rocky shore; at one point, I mistakenly dropped down to the sea, then followed in the hoof-prints of a flock of feral goats to get back up again.I also picnicked on beaches I couldn’t believe I had all to myself – shingly Salt Pans Bay, where salt was harvested from the 1640s, and awesome Ardwell Bay, a curve of turquoise-lapped gold. In the late 19th century a former clown called William Purves lived in one of the caves here. I could see why.View image in fullscreenSarah Baxter came across several lovely beaches she had all to herself.Photograph: Sarah BaxterOn the first of these two tough days, for the final miles from Killantringan lighthouse to Portpatrick, the coast path falls in step with a section of the Southern Upland Way, which ultimately makes for Cockburnspath, on the east coast. This is one of Scotland’s official Great Trails, and the difference was stark: regular waymarks; an obvious track; I even met a volunteer hacking back the overgrowth. But, then, this trail was launched 40 years ago – evidence of what can be achieved.Some of this will probably have been achieved by the time you read this. At the end of my trip, at the Mull of Galloway’s Gallie Craig cafe, Irish Sea swirling outside, Scott took on all my feedback. He’s since rewalked the trail, and a slew of new work is afoot to negotiate fences, increase signage, build a bridge and trim unruly plants. Improvement works should be completed by spring 2026. Yes, the Rhins of Galloway coast path is a little raw, but stick with it: I have high hopes it’ll mature very well.The trip was supported by theSouth of Scotland Destination Alliance.Corsewall Lighthouse Hotelhas doubles from £175 B&B; five-course dinner £49.50pp excluding drinks.

I have never been so happyAfter decades of loneliness and depression, Cathleen Caffrey had come to think of herself as a bad person. Then she learned about others who had struggled to fit in …Paula CocozzaMon 13 Oct 2025 01.55 EDTShareWhen she was 39, Cathleen Caffrey saw a brochure at herAlcoholics Anonymousmeeting. It showed people who’d got sober in their 70s, talking about “how wonderful their lives were. That gave me a hope that I hung on to for a long time,” she says. Caffrey turned 80 this year, and is decades into her sobriety, but only now feels at peace with herself.All her life, Caffrey had assumed she was “a bad person, not a lovable person, not a likable person”. Her parents separated when she was 10, and “at that point, some voice in me said, ‘Nothing’s ever gonna work.’”She grew up in California, and at school she was bright, but “very shy … I would read during recess. Or I would play hopscotch by myself.”After university, she tried graduate school, and hated it. She had a string of jobs – filingcomputer keypunch cards, as an administrative assistant, a data-processor, technical writing and editing, checking hospital databases for duplicate records – but couldn’t build a career. “ I just did not know how to do the schmoozing and teamwork. I was stuck in this mindset of, ‘There’s something wrong with me.’ And I just couldn’t break out of that.”The same pattern played out in relationships. “I was never able to find a relationship that worked for me.” They didn’t last, or they became obsessive – “another kind of addiction … And it was very painful having those fall apart over and over,” she says. “I spent quite a few years thinking I looked like theElephant Man.”Caffrey didn’t start drinking till she was 21, and then it became problematic only gradually. She went to her first Alcoholics Anonymous meeting in her 30s and has “been sober for 42 years”, but experienced depression for decades.After retiring with repetitive strain injuries in her mid-50s, she says, “I must have spent 10 or 12 hours a day lying on my back watching television. “I kept thinking, ‘I can’t do anything.’”Some members of Caffrey’s wider family had been diagnosed with autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. And when the Covid pandemic hit, she had “a chance to think” and began to explore online some of the feelings that had run through her life from childhood.“One day, the word ‘autism’ caught my eye, and I found this whole world of videos of people describing the problems they’d had as very young kids. Never feeling they belonged, never feeling as if they fit in, having a great deal of difficulty making friends. And I thought, ‘Oh my God, this is me. This is me to a T.’”Caffrey can’t afford to explore a formal diagnosis, but she now identifies as autistic. Reaching an understanding of herself has been transformational. “It was such an incredible relief to find out that what I’d always assumed was me being a bad person was just me not having understood the way I related to people.”Caffrey lives in a mobile home park for senior citizens in Santa Rosa, California, where there is an active social community. She goes to philosophy discussion groups and the oddpotluck dinner, while her rescue dog, Petunia, has a habit of approaching people with wagging tail, which “helps a lot” with interactions. “I’m more or less quietly happy a lot of the time now,” Caffrey says.When she turned 80 in July, her brother and his partner wanted to throw a party for her. “I thought, ‘What the hell?’”She invited people from the philosophy group and people she says hello to when she is walking Petunia. “And 60 people came! In my whole life, I would have figured the most who would ever come to a party for me would be 10 people. I just couldn’t believe it. It was the most amazing experience of my life,” she says. They all seemed to be happy to see me.”In her ninth decade, Caffrey has found contentment. “I’m no longer driven by wanting money, a specific relationship, or acknowledgment for achievements. I don’t feel as if I’m being driven by anything except my own wish to feel OK about my life, and to do the best I can for my dog and my family and myself. And that feels very peaceful to me.”Tell us: has your life taken a new direction after the age of 60?Explore more on these topicsLife and styleA new start after 60NeurodiversityDogsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The London cab that rode into historyThe answers to today’s questionsAlex BellosMon 13 Oct 2025 11.57 EDTLast modified on Mon 13 Oct 2025 12.46 EDTShareEarlier today I set these three puzzles, loosely based around 1729, the “taxicab number”. To read about the link between London cabs and 1729 please readthe original post.1. Square pairWhat is the smallest number that can be expressed as the sum of a pair of squares in two different ways? Hint: it is less than 100Solution12+ 72= 52+ 52= 502. Strip teaseI have five strips of wood with lengths 1, 2, 7, 17 and 29 centimetres. It is impossible to arrange any three of these strips into a triangle. I would like to add another strip of wood, of maximum length 29cm, so that I still cannot take three strips and make a triangle.How many different lengths are possible for the seventh strip, and what are they? Lengths must be a whole number of centimetres. As a bonus, what shape can I make using only these hypothetical extra strips?CORRECTION: Previously this question had the length 9. That was a mistake. Also, no two lengths can be the same.Solution3, 4 and 5In a triangle, the sum of the two smaller sides need to be larger the longest side. You can make a right-angled triangle with sides of length 3, 4 and 5.3. Sick sixthI have four numbers,a, b, c,andd.They may be whole numbers, or fractions.There are six ways to multiply two of these numbers together:ab, cd, ac, bd, ad, bc.The values of five of these products, but not necessarily in this order, are 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.What is the value of the sixth product?Solution2.4If we multiplyabxcdoracxbdoradxbcwe getabcd.Thus there must be two pairs from 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 whose product is the same.The only possibility is 2 x 6 = 3 x 4 = 12. The sixth product x 5 = 12.Thanks to George Watkins for today’s puzzles.I’ve been setting a puzzle here on alternate Mondays since 2015. I’m always on the look-out for great puzzles.

It added that he may have headed for Dubai.He had been due to speak to the nation at 7pm (1600 GMT), according to a statement from the presidency on Facebook.Rajoelina, 51, was first president from 2009 to 2014 beforereturning to power in 2023. He was increasingly isolated after losing the support of a key army unit thatjoined thousands of youths activists known as “Gen Z Madagascar”to protest against corruption and poverty. The movement had earlier turned down an invitation to meet him for dialogue and demanded his resignation.People flooded a square in front of the Antananarivo city hall on Monday, waving flags and chanting slogans, some hanging off military vehicles as they arrived, according to Agence France-Presse reporters.Among the demonstrators were soldiers from the elite Capsat unit, which played a major role in the 2009 coup during Rajoelina’s rise to the presidency after mass protests forced his predecessor Marc Ravalomanana out of power.Also present were gendarmerie officers, accused of using heavy-handed tactics during the near-daily protests over more than two weeks. They admitted in a video statement to “faults and excesses” in their response.At least 22 people were killed in the first days by security forces and others in violence sparked by criminal gangs and looters, according to the UN. But Rajoelina had disputed the toll, saying last week there were “12 confirmed deaths and all of these individuals were looters and vandals”.‘We are the last hope’: Gen Z Madagascar vows to fight on until president resignsRead moreOn Saturday, some Capsat soldiers had posted a video to social media saying: “Let us join forces, military, gendarmes and police, and refuse to be paid to shoot our friends, our brothers and our sisters.”“Close the gates, and await our instructions,” they added. “Do not obey orders from your superiors. Point your weapons at those who order you to fire on your comrades in arms because they will not take care of our families if we die.”The showdown began following the arrest of two politicians on 19 September after planning a protest against the country’s chronic power and water outages.Explore more on these topicsMadagascarFranceAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The repression that followed silenced many critical voices and left the opposition in disarray.During his brief spell of freedom this year, Ferrer had defied the authorities by criticising Cuba’s leadership on social media.He also met the head of the US diplomatic mission in Cuba, Mike Hammer, at his home in the eastern city of Santiago de Cuba.In his letter, he said “only the United States … truly stands in solidarity with the peaceful opposition and the Cuban people” – an implicit rebuke of the EU, which has angered dissidents by maintaining a political and cooperation agreement with Cuba.Ferrer was transferred directly from the prison of Mar Verde in Cuba’s south to the international airport of Santiago de Cuba, where he was met by his wife Nelva Ortega and their son José Daniel , two daughters and his ex-wife – all of whom will travel with him to Miami.Explore more on these topicsCubaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Beijing said it would retaliate if Trump did not back down.The IMF boss is right to say ‘buckle up’ – the global economy is facing multiple menacesRead moreHowever, Trump and senior US officials opened a door to a possible deal with China on Sunday. The president wrote on Truth Social: “Don’t worry about China, it will all be fine! Highly respected President Xi just had a bad moment. He doesn’t want Depression for his country, and neither do I. The U.S.A. wants to help China, not hurt it!!!”The comments have offered some comfort for investors in the US and Europe, with stocks opening mostly higher on Monday.In the US, the S&P 500 blue-chip index rose by 1.1%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index rose by 1.7%. The UK’s blue-chip FTSE 100 index rose by 0.2% in early trading, before falling slightly by 0.1% in the afternoon.Markets in much of the rest of Europe were muted, with the French Cac 40 index broadly flat, Spain’s Ibex 35 up 0.2% and Germany’s Dax up 0.3%.Most big cryptocurrencies rebounded after a deep sell-off over the weekend. Bitcoin edged up by 0.3% to more than $115,000, after falling below $105,000 on Friday. Ether had dropped to less than $3,500 but rebounded to about $4,100.Richard Hunter, of the broker Interactive Investor, said investors were hoping for a “Taco trade”, which is the idea that markets rally because “Trump Always Chickens Out” (Taco) of aggressive tariff decisions.“The president’s propensity to shoot from the hip unsettles the investment environment, even though some are already speculating that the Taco trade is alive and well,” he said.However, aheightened sense of uncertainty is pushing investors to gold,which is considered a safe haven asset. Its spot price hit another new high on Monday, rising to as high as $4,078.5 an ounce.Derren Nathan, of the broker Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “Traders may be banking on a similar pattern where American indexes entered a six-month period of almost unbroken growth helped by a string of trade deals, and growing hopes of a soft landing for the US economy.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

President Wayne Langford said previous methane reduction targets had been “absolute madness”.“Farming families have been under huge pressure for a long time now – but it looks like that’s finally coming to an end,” he said.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

That is an increase of more than 3,000 from a year earlier, and represents a 50% rise from a decade ago, the Nikkei said.The number of children born to Japanese couples fell to 686,173 – a reduction of 41,115 from the year before. The contrasting trends meant non-Japanese newborns offset the decline in Japanese births by more than half and accounted for 3.2% of all births.By nationality, Chinese women comprised the single biggest group of foreign mothers followed by women from the Philippines and Brazil.The increase is a reflection of the sharp rise in foreign residents in Japan. The number of legal foreign residents has risen to 3.95 million, the immigration services agency said last week. Many are in their 20s and 30s and are more likely to remain in the country for longer and to have children.The diverse populations now found in many Japanese towns such as Ōizumi, home todozens of nationalities, has prompted right-wing politicians to call for stricter immigration rules and betterintegration.In July’s upper house elections, the minor populist partySanseitoput in a strong performance after it campaigned opposing foreign workers.Sanae Takaichi, the new leader of the governing Liberal Democratic party who is hoping to be made prime minister this month, made immigration and “badly behaved” foreign tourists a key part of her election bid.But the labour shortage, combined with an ageing demographic, is expected to fuel more migration. The justice minister, Keisuke Suzuki, recently said the proportion of foreign residents could surpass 10% of the population by 2040 – three decades earlier than a National Institute ofPopulationand Social Security Research forecast published in 2023.Experts have called on local authorities to do more to help foreign families. “Policies and help for foreign babies born here and their families are lagging in many localities, and most rely on nonprofit organisations,” Toshihiro Menju, a visiting professor at the Kansai University of International Studies, told the Nikkei.“We need policies to create a society where foreign-national children, when they grow up, speak Japanese, earn as much as Japanese citizens do, and can support their own families,” Menju aded, warning that otherwise “we are going to have a divided society”.Explore more on these topicsJapanAsia PacificPopulationMigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Sharaz is jointly liable for the damages, the court ruled, for his role in publishing a defamatory tweet and Instagram story.‘Inconsequential’ texts, leaked letters and expensive clothes: five takeaways from the Higgins v Reynolds defamation rulingRead moreHiggins and Sharaz were also ordered to pay for 80% of Reynolds’ legal costs – a figure expected to surpass $1m.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailJustice Paul Tottle ruled Higgins’ Instagram story on 4 July 2023 – which shared a screenshot of headlines publicising Reynolds’ intentions to refer Higgins’ $2.445m personal injury settlement to the federal anti-corruption body and accused her of mishandling her alleged rape and waging a campaign of harassment – was defamatory.Tottle found Higgins had successfully defended another post accusing Reynolds of “silencing” sexual assault victim-survivors. Tottle said while he found the tweet was defamatory, Higgins’ legal team had successfully established the defence of honest opinion, fair comment and qualified privilege.In September, Higgins’ legal team filed an appeal notice against the court’s judgment and orders to pay for Reynolds’ legal fees.Reynolds’legal team argued during the trialin August and September 2024 that the senior Liberal senator had been cast as a “villain” in Higgins’ “fairytale” of a political cover up after her staffer alleged in February 2021 that she had been sexually assaulted by a colleague in Reynolds’ ministerial office in March 2019 and then had been left unsupported by her boss.Higgins told news.com.au and The Project that her alleged sexual assault had become a political “problem” for Reynolds and the wider Morrison government in the lead-up to the 2019 federal election.The junior Liberal staffer alleged she had been made to choose between her future, either by working on the looming federal election in Perth for Reynolds, or by pausing her career aspirations to work remotely from the Gold Coast, where her support network was.The court heard that Higginshad gone to the media to effect change in Parliament Houseafter her alleged rape. Higgins’ lawyer, Rachael Young SC, said Higgins had felt professionally and personally isolated, and believed she had to stay quiet because her allegation was politically inconvenient.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News USFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The legislation itself went nowhere.Then last week, Treasury revealed Anthony Albanese’s office had become involved, as the department mulled concerns raised by vocal critics, including lobbyists for cashed-up retirees.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailOn Monday, with the prime minister on a week off, the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, ended the guessing game andconfirmed a backdown.As part of a major redesign, he promised to index the threshold to alleviate fears that more Australians would be caught by the tax over time. He also ditched one of the most controversial elements – taxing unrealised gains – which investors had warned would leave people with tax bills they might not have the cash to pay. Now only future realised earnings will be hit.To recoup some of the lost revenue, Chalmers introduced a higher 40% earnings tax rate for the 8,000 accounts with balances over $10m. That threshold will also be indexed.Separately, the low-income superannuation tax offset will be increased and eligibility thresholds raised. The start date has been pushed back to July 2026.Labor’s watered-down super tax plan creates a fairer system – but it’s far from as fair as it should beRead moreInsisting he wasn’t responding to months of criticism on the front pages of newspapers or from the opposition, Chalmers said he’d found a different way “to satisfy the same objectives”.The original proposal would have raised $2.7bn, while the new approach will raise about $2bn in 2028-29 (its first full year of operation). Much of the change is from the delayed start, with $435m lost to changes to the low-income offset.Chalmers confirmed he’d had an initial discussion with the leader of the Greens, Larissa Waters, on Monday. The minor party will now formally consider its position.But another superannuation stakeholder is clearly pleased. Former prime ministerPaul Keatingwelcomed Chalmers’ announcement, saying the changes would rein in some of John Howard and Peter Costello’s policy largess, including expensive concessions introduced to win “the grey vote”.Keating has been a vocal critic of Albanese on foreign policy and the Aukus agreement, and was understood to have reservations about the $3m super plan. But Chalmers appears to have brought him back into the tent, on super at least.Keating called the new plan “a huge policy achievement”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Just 5% of the nearly $35bn committed to Australian venture capital in 2023-24 came from self-managed super funds, according industry department figures.But budget watcher Chris Richardson said the backdown was proof it is getting harder to make good policy in Australia, just as Labor insists they are up for big ideas coming out of the economic reform roundtable.“Today’s timidity worries me,”the respected economist said.Richardson is right. Broader inequity within the super system needs addressing, including elements stemming from the fact that retiree withdrawals and earnings are tax-free.If they are to fix the budget, provide growth and achieve theintergenerational fairnessAlbanese and Chalmers say Australia so badly needs, much bigger fights than this will be necessary.With huge political capital, a straightforward Senate pathway and a shambolic opposition, now isn’t the time for timidity.

They told him he must present himself at the entrance of LaSanté prison in the south of Parison 21 October to begin his sentence.The 70-year-old will be the first French postwar leader and the first former head of a European Union country to go to jail. He had already become the first former French head of state forced to wear an electronic tag after being convicted in aseparate case of corruption and influence peddlingover illegal attempts to secure favours from a judge. In that case, he was given a one-year jail term but was able to serve it with an electronic tag worn around the ankle. He wore the tag for three months before being granted conditional release.Sarkozy, who denied wrongdoing and having being part of acriminal conspiracyto seek election funding from Libya for his victorious 2007 presidential campaign, has appealed against his conviction. A new trial is expected in about six months. But the nature of Sarkozy’s prison sentence means he must go to jail as his appeal process plays out.Sarkozy was reported to have hosted 100 friends and former collaborators in Paris last week at a sort of goodbye party before going to prison.Le Figarosaid he had told guests he was innocent and should never have been found guilty. Talking about prison, he reportedly said: “I will ask for no advantages. When there is a cross to bear, you must bear it to the end.”Sarkozy is expected to have his own individual prison cell, with one hour’s exercise a day and three visits a week.La Santé prison has held some of Frances’s most famous prisoners in its 158-year history, including the terroristCarlos the Jackaland the war criminalMaurice Papon. Sarkozy is likely to be held in a special wing for vulnerable prisoners, which some call the VIP wing.It affords more privacy to prisoners, who are placed in individual cells of 9 sq metres and kept separate from other prisoners when exercising. Patrick Balkany, the former rightwing mayor of Levallois-Perret and one-time friend of Sarkozy, was held in that wing in 2019 after a conviction for tax fraud. He described to Paris Match how the isolation was psychologically demanding, but it spared him from being photographed by other prisoners.Sarkozy was found guilty of criminal conspiracy but acquitted of three separate charges of corruption, misuse of Libyan public funds and illegal election campaign funding. The public prosecutor had told the court that Sarkozy entered into a “Faustian pact of corruption with one of the most unspeakable dictators of the last 30 years” to gain election funding from Gaddafi.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

More than 91% of parcels valued at less than €150 came from China, where Temu and its fellow low-cost sellerSheinmake and dispatch most of their goods.However, controls began to be tightened in July this year, and customs duty is expected to be applied from 2028.The US this summerabolished its “de minimis” exemption, which allowed goods worth less than $800 to skip import duty, to limit the rise of Temu and Shein, while the UK chancellor has said she is reviewing a similar loophole.Paul Monaghan, the chief executive of the Fair Tax Foundation, estimates that Temu’s Irish entity facilitated consumer sales of $10bn in the EU – as its revenue figure only accounts for the company’s commission and fees from independent sellers on its marketplace.If Temu’s estimated $2bn in sales via its sellers are included in the UK, that would make the marketplace bigger than the UK retailer Next and about the same size as Primark.“Serious questions need to be asked as to why Temu has such a negligible economic and tax footprint in the UK and acrossEuropedespite its enormous sales,” Monaghan said.“What we have here is a chain of companies in a series of tax havens, that have been structured so as to leave little or no tax benefit in Europe.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Despite being a young and fast-growing company still in the investment phase, we have already paid billions of euros in taxes across European jurisdictions, and that figure will continue to rise as our operations mature.“The tax figure cited refers only to the tax paid by a single legal entity and does not include customs duties, VAT, and other taxes.“Temu entered the European market just two years ago and has invested heavily in building its platform to connect sellers and consumers more efficiently, passing those efficiencies back to consumers in the form of lower prices on quality goods. At the same time, we have been creating new growth opportunities for local sellers across Europe.“Our focus is on the long term: building a sustainable, compliant, and trusted platform that helps consumers access quality products at affordable prices while enabling local sellers across Europe to grow their businesses and reach new markets.”Explore more on these topicsRetail industryEuropean UnionEuropeChinanewsShareReuse this content"

He said rival “political forces” were “solely responsible for this chaos” after they “instigated the destabilisation” of the prime minister,Sébastien Lecornu.Lecornu, a Macron ally, held his first meeting with France’s new government after he appointed a mix of stalwarts from Macron’s centrist grouping, as well as a few faces from the upper ranks of the civil service and civil society. New arrivals included Jean-Pierre Farandou, who headed the state-run railway, SNCF, and is now labour minister.View image in fullscreenSébastien Lecornu and the agriculture minister, Annie Genevard, arrive for a meeting with the new cabinet at the prime minister’s residence in Paris.Photograph: Abaca/ShutterstockLaurent Nuñez, who served as a junior minister in the interior ministry during thegilets jaunes(yellow vests) protests of 2018 and 2019, was appointed to the key post of interior minister. He had recently served as Paris police chief, responsible for the policing of last year’s Olympic Games.It is France’s second government in a week:Lecornu’s first government collapsed after 14 hoursamid backlash over a lack of fresh faces, and he dramatically resigned last Monday. Lecornu was thenreappointed by Macron on Friday nightand quickly assembled a new administration on Sunday. “How long will it last?” several regional newspapers asked, including La Provence in the south and La République du Centre.France has lurched from crisis to crisis since Macron’s gamble on a snap election last year that led to an inconclusive result. Parliament remains divided between the three blocs: the left, the far right and the centre, with no clear majority.Some parties have called on Macron to resign. “Never forget that the mandate given by the French people is to serve, to serve and serve, and to provide answers to the questions of everyday French people, and to do everything possible for the independence of France,” Macron said. “That is the only thing that matters. The rest is the government’s business … I will continue to ensure stability.”Macron’s term ends in spring 2027. He declined to speculate on a possible dissolution of parliament and snap election if the latest government fails. “I’m not making any bets,” he said. “I want the country to move forward.”View image in fullscreenThe newly appointed members of the cabinet.Photograph: Alain Jocard/AFP/Getty ImagesLecornu faces the urgent and complex task of getting a 2026 budget through parliament by the end of the year. He told ministers: “Our only task is to surpass the political crisis.” He said that political crisis was exasperating French people and observers worldwide. He called on the government to “put egos aside” and work collegiately to find compromise.The prime minister will deliver his first key policy speech to the French parliament on Tuesday afternoon.The leftwing La France Insoumise party and the far-right National Rally are due to put down motions for a no-confidence vote. For the government to be toppled, several opposition parties would have to group together to back the vote, including the Socialists.The Socialist party has said it will wait to hear Lecornu’s policy speech before deciding. It has warned it could vote against the government unless Lecornu suspends Macron’s controversial 2023 law that installed a gradualrise in the retirement age from 62 to 64.The new cabinet is expected to present a draft budget on Tuesday morning that will include cuts on public spending. The government must give parliament the constitutionally required 70 days to scrutinise the plan before the end of the year.“We have to give this country a budget, otherwise we’re heading for catastrophe,” the new minister for external commerce, Nicolas Forissier, told Ici Berry television.Explore more on these topicsFranceEmmanuel MacronEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It won an 11.86% share of the overall vote.‘The Algarve is Chega’s kingdom’: resort city’s voters tempted by far-right partyRead moreChega’s leader, André Ventura, admitted “we wanted more” and said Sunday’s elections had not given the party the victory it wanted.Some pre-election polls had put Chega ahead in the national vote for the first time, and it had hoped its cocktail of populist policies, including stricter immigration controls and chemical castration for paedophiles, might help it win 30 of the country’s 308 municipalities.The party won almost 23% of the vote in this year’s parliamentary elections, giving it 60 MPs and making it Portugal’s official opposition party. Analysts said the local election results suggested it could underperform when its Ventura was not on the ballot.The ruling centre-right Social Democratic party (PSD) won the largest share of mayoral races, capturing 136, including Portugal’s largest cities, Lisbon and Porto, up from 114 four years ago. Its centre-left Socialist rivals won 128.Chega received the third biggest share of votes but that translated to fewer mayoralties than independent candidates, who won 20, and the Communist party, which captured 12.Ventura, a former columnist and football pundit, put on a brave face on Monday morning, telling supporters the results were “a great victory for Chega”, which was expanding to become a “party with a municipal base”.It almost trebled its vote share from the previous local elections in 2021, and will play a significant role in shaping policy in several councils.Of the three municipalities it captured, it won 49% of the vote in São Vicente, 40.5% in Albufeira in the Algarve – which Ventura has calledthe party’s “stronghold”, and the springboard for Portugal’s “conquest” by the far right – and 37% in Entroncamento.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Live footage of their release and their family reunions was broadcast on large screens around the square. The plaza has been the centre of the national campaign for their release since 250 Israelis were abducted on 7 October 2023 in the surprise Hamas attack on southern Israeli communities that killed 1,200 people and ignited the conflict.The bodies of four hostages held in Gaza and handed over to the Red Cross byHamason Monday were brought back to Israel, the army said.View image in fullscreenThe Israeli hostages arrive at Tel HaShomer hospital in Ramat Gan.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesA large crowd also massed in the southern Gazan city of Khan Younis on Monday tocelebrate the returnof nearly 1,700 Palestinians detained over the course of the war, while in the West Bank capital of Ramallah people welcomed the arrival of 88 Palestinian detainees who had been serving life sentences imposed by Israeli courts. At least one had been imprisoned for 24 years. About 160 more were deported through Egypt after their release.The Public Committee Against Torture in Israel said almost all Palestinian detainees had been held without trial as “unlawful combatants”. It noted that there were 22 minors among those released, some of the 360 Palestinian minors held in Israeli custody.The ceasefire appeared to be holding inGazaon Monday after a two-year Israeli military onslaught that has killed nearly 68,000 people. But 2.1 million surviving Palestinians there still face a deep and complex humanitarian crisis in a sealed coastal strip where the overwhelming majority of homes have been destroyed or severely damaged, and which has been starved of humanitarian supplies for many months.Tom Fletcher, the head of the UN’s humanitarian relief branch, OCHA, said aid deliveries had begun arriving in Gaza, with far more poised to enter in the coming days. “Millions of Palestinians counting on life-saving aid getting through at scale. We must make it happen,” Fletcher said while attending the peace summit at Sharm el-Sheikh.Trump, who brokered the ceasefire last week, arrived in the Red Sea resort after a short visit to Israel. He declared “a new day is rising” and signed a joint declaration with the leaders ofEgypt, Qatar and Turkey, intended to turn the ceasefire into a coherent peace plan.2:16Trump hails end of 'age of terror' and 'historic dawn' of a new Middle East – videoThe last Gaza ceasefire broke down after two months in March when Israel resumed its offensive. There are fears in the region that this truce may also prove precarious, especially given the resistance from the far-right wing of the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition.Trump insisted his 20-point proposal for maintaining peace and rebuilding Gaza would take root. “The document sets out a whole series of rules and regulations and is very comprehensive,” the US president said.The contents of the declaration signed in Sharm el-Sheikh were not immediately made public and the aspirations expressed in Trump’s 20 points, involving the disarming of Hamas and the deployment of a stabilisation force under a technocratic Palestinian committee overseen by a “peace board” chaired by the US president, present an extremely challenging task.The “summit for peace” was a virtual who’s who of Middle Eastern and European politics, while attracting other unlikely power brokers in the Trump era of international diplomacy such as the president of Fifa, Gianni Infantino. Leaders from at least 27 countries, many in Europe and the Middle East, joined the summit in Sharm el-Sheikh on Monday.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump speaks alongside Egypt’s president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, at the summit in Sharm el-Sheikh.Photograph: Evan Vucci/APThe leaders of the major Arab and regional states, including Sisi, Turkey’sRecep Tayyip Erdoğan, and the leaders of the Gulf states Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, were present. Keir Starmer and European leaders from France, Germany, Italy and Hungary also attended.However, representatives from Israel or Hamas were absent from the signing ceremony. A last-minute plan by Trump to invite Netanyahu was scuppered after Erdoğan said he would not land his plane if the Israeli prime minister attended.In Sharm el-Sheikh, Trump said he had been watching videos of the Israeli hostages being reunited with their families. “The level of love and sorrow, I’ve never seen anything like it. It’s amazing. They haven’t seen their loved ones in such a long time,” he said. “In one sense, it’s so horrible that this could take place. In another, it’s so beautiful to see a new and beautiful day is rising.”Beyond the welcoming crowd in Khan Younis, the response across Gaza to the mass detainee release was muted by the desperate circumstances and the nervousness over whether the ceasefire would stick. It was unclear how many of those freed on Monday were militants from Hamas or other armed groups, and how many had simply been swept up by Israeli forces.Some returned to meet new children born during their captivity. Others came back to find their relatives had been killed in a conflict that has seen a historically high rate of civilian casualties among Palestinians.

Naji al-Jafarawi returned on the same day his brother Saleh, a social media journalist and activist, was being buried.The International Committee of the Red Cross, which oversaw the hostage and detainee transfers, conducted brief interviews with all those released on Monday, said it had also transferred the remains of four dead hostages to the Israeli authorities.The Guardian view on peace in Gaza: the relief is real, but Trump’s promise of a ‘golden age’ rings hollow | EditorialRead moreAid workers said it was now a race against time to rush humanitarian assistance into Gaza. It has been reported that, under the ceasefire agreement, Israel will open five crossings into Gaza, including one leading from Egypt. Only one crossing, at Kerem Shalom between Gaza and Israel, has been open for aid deliveries throughout much of the conflict.“With easing of movement and access restrictions in multiple areas, we were able to pre-position medical and emergency supplies to where they are needed most, assess key roads for explosive hazards, and support displaced families in flood-prone areas,” Fletcher said, adding that Israel had given security clearance for 190,000 metric tons of humanitarian supplies to enter Gaza, including food, tent components, medicine and other essentials.Additional reporting byAndrew Rothin WashingtonExplore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestineMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelDonald TrumpAbdel Fatah al-SisinewsShareReuse this content"

This is the end of the age of terror and death and the beginning of the age of faith and hope and of God.”Netanyahu said Trump is the greatest friend Israel has ever had. “Donald Trump is the greatest friend that the State of Israel has ever had in the White House,” he told the Knesset.“No American president has ever done more for the state ofIsrael, and as I said in Washington, it ain’t even close,” the Israeli prime minister said.At least 67,869 Palestinian people have been killed and 170,105 others injured in Israeli attacks on Gaza since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said in a statement on Monday.In a statement, the health ministry said the bodies of 63 people, including 60 recovered from rubble, arrived in hospitals across theGazaStrip over the latest 24-hour reporting period.ShareUpdated at15.35 EDT"

Now it’s time to translate those victories against terrorists on the battlefield into the ultimate prize of peace and prosperity for the entire Middle East.”Repeatedly insisting that Israel’s military victory was complete, Trump’s remarks were intended as a reassurance to Arab states that he would neither allow Israel to reopen the conflict withHamasnor permit Hamas to re-establish itself inside Gaza.Trump then flew to Egypt to take the message of optimism to a summit of more than 20 world leaders dedicated to endorsing his peace plan, the rebuilding ofGazaand a limited form of Palestinian self-rule. The guarantors of the peace agreement – the US, Turkey, Qatar and Egypt – also signed a comprehensive document setting out their responsibilities in ensuring peace, and an eventual path to Palestinian self-rule.The summit was jointly hosted by Trump and the Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh. At the opening of the summit, Trump told reporters that phase two of his Gaza plan, concerning the reconstruction of the strip, was already under way. He told reporters: “Phase two has already started. The phases are all a little bit mixed in with each other. You can start cleaning up. You look at Gaza, it’s a lot of clean-up.”The US is already asking wealthy Arab states to commit large sums to Gaza, a place he described as “debris times 10”. Estimates for the reconstruction costs have reached more than $30bn.A confident Trump predicted: “Gaza will be demobilised, Hamas will be disarmed, and Israel’s security will no longer be threatened.”The US president also sent out a thinly coded message that Israel had been losing public support due to its reliance on force. He said: “There was getting to be a period of time over the last few months when the world wanted peace and Israel wanted peace. If you had gone on for another three or four more years, keeping fighting, fighting, fighting, it was getting bad, it was getting heated. So the timing of this is brilliant. I said: ‘Bibi [referring to the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu], you will be remembered for this far more than if you kept the thing going, going – kill, kill, kill.’”Trump also indicated he was going to put pressure on Arab states to sign the Abraham accords “quickly and without games”. The accords require Arab states to recognise Israel. Iran, he insisted, was also ready for peace.European diplomats are privately warning that the speed of the ceasefire means plans for an international stabilisation force and a Palestinian civil police force need to be accelerated if proposals for Hamas to be disarmed are to bear fruit. Hamas, which has governed Gaza alone since 2007, has said it is willing not to be part of the new technocratic government of Gaza, but has insisted it will only disarm on certain conditions to a Palestinian-led force.Israel has said it will not withdraw the Israel Defense Forces further from its current positions inside Gaza so long as Gaza’s network of tunnels and guns remain under the control of Hamas.France, the US and the UK have said they are willing to act as backstops to the international force, but it is recognised that the force’s credibility stems from troops coming from Muslim countries such as Indonesia and Turkey, two countries that attended the summit. France is also pressing for the force to be given a UN mandate, similar to that of the UN force in Lebanon.A separate Palestinian National Authority civilian police force has also been trained, mainly in Egypt and Jordan, to enter Gaza, but French diplomatic sources said that, unless it is deployed rapidly, it risks finding itself in conflict with a resurgent Hamas. Neither Hamas nor Netanyahu attended the summit.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He added that he wanted Sisi to sit on the board, but said he was testing opinion in the region to see if there was support for Sir Tony Blair to be on it as well.Trump, for the first time in eight years, met with the Palestinian National Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, shaking his hand and giving a thumbs up sign. Only a fortnight ago, Trump had banned Abbas from New York and the UN general assembly.The French president, EmmanuelMacron, one of the politicians most involved in keeping the two-state solution alive, said on arriving in Egypt that Abbas’s attendance “was a very good signal … It’s a recognition of the role the Palestinian Authority has to play as a legitimate entity”.“On the questions of governance, we will have a particular role to be by the side of the Palestinian Authority and to ensure it plays its part, and also that it conducts reforms for the day after.” The authority has promised to hold presidential and parliamentary elections within a year.Macron also called for the position of the West Bank, which is the subject of accelerated settlements by Israel, not to be forgotten and for continuing efforts to create a formal Palestinian state alongside Israel.We must “make the connection between Gaza and the West Bank” and “ensure that there is a path to two states, the only political perspective that truly allows for lasting peace,” he said. On the security front, Macron indicated that the Europeans would “step up” the training of Palestinian police officers in Gaza, but that France would not participate directly in the stabilisation force that is to be put in place.There is a “consensus” to have “especially regional forces and perhaps contributions from certain countries like Indonesia,” he said. These countries, however, are asking that this be done within an “international framework” – that is, at the UN. France will also co-organise a conference on humanitarian aid to Gaza with Egypt, which it will host “in the coming weeks,” Macron also specified.Explore more on these topicsIsraelHamasDonald TrumpGazaPalestineMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Trump briefly shook the prime minister’s hand and called him “his friend”, before turning his back on him and continuing to explain how he had brought peace to the Middle East without allowing the prime minister to say a word.The images were seized on by critics as evidence that Britain had been little more than a bystander while more powerful players haggled over Gaza’s future.A day earlier,Mike Huckabee, the US ambassador to Israel, had described the British education secretary as “delusional” after she talked about the UK’s “key role” in negotiating the deal.Meanwhile Gideon Sa’ar, the Israeli foreign minister,reposted a messageby the former British military officer, Richard Kemp, claiming: “The British government played no role in the ceasefire agreement, except a negative one by encouraging Hamas to resist through recognition of a nonexistent ‘Palestinian state’.”Downing Street, however, has pointed to comments by Steve Witkoff, Trump’s Middle East envoy, who posted praise on X about the role played by Starmer’s national security adviser Jonathan Powell.The prime minister’s spokesperson said on Monday: “We’ve been offering our full support for these efforts, over the last few weeks and months, including working behind the scenes with the US, Arab and European nations to help develop ideas and build consensus on the steps that need to be taken to deliver a plan for Gaza’s future.”Bronwen Maddox, the director of the Chatham House thinktank, said: “The UK has made it very clear all along that it cares about this, and that matters. For all thatIsraelcomplained about the UK recognising Palestinian statehood, that did play an important role in signalling how engaged the UK and others were in what was happening in the region.”Officials point to the roles played by Powell and Tony Blair, the former prime minister, and insist that their experience in piloting the Northern Ireland peace process proved invaluable in bringing Israel and Hamas to the negotiating table.They claim this influence was in part substantive. Point 13 of the 20-point plan, for example, deals with demilitarisation of Gaza, mirroring how important weapons decommissioning proved in the Good Friday agreement.Point 18 meanwhile calls for an “interfaith dialogue process” aimed at “emphasising the benefits that can be derived from peace” – an echo of the Forum for Reconciliation and Peace, which was set up in Northern Ireland in 1994.Some experts reject the idea that Powell, Blair or anyone in Starmer’s government could have helped shape the substance of the deal, not least because it is based on a similar one promoted by the former US president, Joe Biden, before Labour entered government.“This deal has been on the table since Biden,” said Maddox. “It has very little to do with the Good Friday agreement.”One area where Powell does appear to have had an influence however is persuading all sides to enter the negotiation process without necessarily knowing the outcome.“What Northern Ireland taught us is that taking part in the process builds its own trust and momentum,” said one official. “So even if you don’t believe the other side will stick to their commitments, you embark on phase one anyway as a way to show commitment and generate the trust, which comes later.”Starmer himself spent much of Monday talking to other world leaders in Sharm el-Sheikh, repeatedly emphasising that the UK “stands ready to play a leadership role in the reconstruction of Gaza”, according to statements from Downing Street.The prime minister told leaders including the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and Jordan’s King Abdullah that Britain could specifically help monitor the process of Hamas decommissioning its weapons.Meanwhile Hamish Falconer, the Middle East minister, is leading a three-day summit at Wilton Park dedicated to discussing the reconstruction of Gaza – with the UK offering £20m in aid towards the effort.But whether the British government will play a more direct role in any transition authority appears to remain undecided. “The precise membership and shape of that board is all still subject to discussion,” No 10 said on Monday.Explore more on these topicsGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestineIsraelForeign policyMike HuckabeenewsShareReuse this content"

The bank said almost half of consumers in a survey of 2,000 individuals were making changes to their personal finances in anticipation of Reeves’s26 November budget, with one in three building a savings buffer.What price loyalty? UK supermarket cards ratedRead moreHelen Dickinson, the chief executive of the BRC, said the looming budget had affected spending alongside milder weather, while growth in the value of food sales was mostly down to rising grocery prices.“Rising inflation and a potentially taxing budget are weighing on the minds of many households planning their Christmas spending,” she said.The BRC said UK total retail sales increased by 2.3% year on year in September, compared with a growth rate of 3.1% the previous month. That was below the latest Office for National Statistics reading for inflation across the board,August’s 3.8% annual rate.Food sales increased by a stronger 4.3% year on year, albeit asgrocery inflation acceleratesamid a fresh squeeze on living standards.Non-food spending rose by 0.7% year on year, below a 12-month average of 0.9%, as milder temperatures across the UK deterred shoppers from refreshing their autumn and winter wardrobes. Sales were propped up by spending on electrical goods, after the launch ofApple’s latest iPhoneandsmartwatch.Linda Ellett, the UK head of consumer, retail and leisure at the accountancy firm KPMG said non-food sales were growing by a meagre 1.2% on average. “Spending continues to be very targeted as consumers remain cautious,” she said.Reeves is widely expected to raise taxes in her autumn budget. However, business leaders have warned higher costs for companies would be passed on to consumers in the form of price rises, hurting household finances and the economy at large.In an intervention published late on Tuesday, the British Chambers of Commerce called on the chancellor to rule out business tax increases because companies had been left drained by higher levies she introduced in last year’s autumn budget.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They cannot plan ahead as they expect further tax demands to be laid at their feet.”The 0.7% annual decline in consumer card spending recorded by Barclays in September, came after 0.5% year-on-year growth in August. Essential spending fell 2.6%, while growth in discretionary spending slowed to 0.2%.Despite growing concerns over the chancellor’s budget, the bank said consumer confidence in households’ ability to live within their means had reached a four-year high of 78%, while confidence in personal finances remained resilient.However, it warned households remained cautious amid the prospect of higher inflation, tax increases and broader economic uncertainty.Karen Johnson, the head of retail at Barclays, said: “We’re continuing to see cautious spending, and shoppers are consistently seeking out areas they can cut back on. However, multiple retail categories have proved to be resilient in recent months, with furniture, clothing and beauty all remaining in growth since February of this year.”Explore more on these topicsRetail industryEconomicsRachel ReevesnewsShareReuse this content"

While his report was seen as central to Tory efforts to win over economically insecure Labour voters, it was largely mothballed as the party cycled through prime ministers.He also held the role as the government’s head of labour market enforcement between 2019 and 2021, but sharply attacked the Tories for backsliding on its pledges to protect workers from unscrupulous employment practices.Taylor told the Guardian Starmer’s government had the potential to make progress after the Tories had reneged on their promises.“I think it was quite clear that the previous government had not got that balance right, [and] I think this government is going to get that balance right,” he said.“Flexible work will always have an important role in our economy, but it mustn’t be at the price of the insecurity and unfairness towards workers.”Hiring Taylor – one of the country’s leading employment experts – is expected to underscore Labour’s commitment to bolstering workplace rights despite mounting pressure from businesses for the party to water down planned changes.Bosses have warned the government’s landmark employment rights bill, which includes banning zero-hours contracts and day-one rights protecting against unfair dismissal, will drive up unemployment and hurt the economy.Business groups have ramped up their lobbying before Rachel Reeves’s 26 November budget, amid criticism that the chancellor added to a slowdown in the jobs market by raising taxes on employment in last year’s budget.Ministers have, though, insisted the bill will be enacted “in full” amid intense pressure from trade unions and leftwing MPs fearful that Keir Starmer’s government will backslide on the legislation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The justice secretary, David Lammy, then ruled out the measure last week.Kate Dearden, who replaced Madders last month, said Labour was “absolutely committed” to boosting workers’ rights.“We’ll always listen carefully to feedback from businesses and from trade unions, because we want to ensure this legislation works for workers and employers alike. That’s why it’s pro-business, it’s pro-worker, and pro-growth,” she said.The creation of the Fair Work Agency, however, comes amid questions over the resourcing and the capacity of the government to oversee its tougher approach to the enforcement of its package of workers’ rights.While drawing together thefunctions and powers of the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority, along with other existing enforcement responsibilities, to create the Fair Work Agency, experts believe extra resources are also likely to be required.Explore more on these topicsEconomicsLabournewsShareReuse this content"

The rise is being driven by ransomware attacks, often by criminal actors seeking money, and society’s increasing dependence on technology which increases the number of hackable targets.The chancellor,Rachel Reeves, the security minister, Dan Jarvis, and the technology and business secretaries, Liz Kendall and Peter Kyle have written to the leaders of hundreds of the largest British companies urging them to make cyber-resilience a board-level responsibility and warning that hostile cyber-activity in the UK has grown “more intense, frequent and sophisticated”.“Don’t be an easy target,” said Anne Keast-Butler, the director of GCHQ. “Prioritise cyber risk management, embed it into your governance and lead from the top.”NCSC dealt with 429 cyber incidents in the year to September and nearly half were classed as of national significance – more than doubling in the past year. Eighteen were “highly significant”, which means they had a serious impact on the government, essential services, the mass population or the economy. Most of those were ransomware incidents, including the attacks that significantly affected Marks & Spencer and the Co-op Group.“Cybercrime is a serious threat to the security of our economy, businesses and people’s livelihoods,” said Jarvis. “While we work round the clock to counter threats and provide support to businesses of all sizes – we cannot do it alone.”The NCSC declined to comment on reports that one line of investigation into thecrippling attack on Jaguar Land Rover, which has halted manufacturing, is examining Russian involvement. It said Russia is inspiring informal “hacktivists” who are targeting the UK and the US, as well as European and Nato countries.View image in fullscreenLast month, passengers at a number of European airports, including London Heathrow, were disrupted by a cyber-attack.Photograph: Isabel Infantes/ReutersOverall, the number of attacks in the year to September represented the highest level of cyber threat activity recorded by the NCSC in nine years. Over the 12 month period, the UK and its allies uncovered a Russian military unit carrying out cyber-attacks for the first time, issued advice to counter a China-linked campaign targeting thousands of devices and raised the alarm over cyber-actors working for Iran, according to the NCSC. But the threat is also homegrown, and last week two 17-year-olds were arrested in Hertfordshire over the allegedransomware hack of children’s data from the Kido nursery chain.Hack of age verification firm may have exposed 70,000 Discord users’ ID photosRead moreHackers are also increasingly using artificial intelligence (AI) to sharpen their operations, and while the NCSC has yet to face an attack initiated by AI, it said: “AI will almost certainly pose cyber-resilience challenges to 2027 and beyond.”“We do see our attackers improving their ability to cause real impact, to inflict pain on the organisations they have breached and those who rely on them,” said Richard Horne, the NCSC’s chief executive. “They don’t care who they hit or how they hurt them. That is why we need all organisations to act.”He stressed the emotional impact of becoming a victim of cyber-attacks and said: “I’ve sat now in too many rooms with individuals who have been deeply affected by cyber-attacks against their organisations … I know the impact the disruption has on their staff, suppliers and customers, the worry, the sleepless nights.”Explore more on these topicsCybercrimeInternetGCHQRachel ReevesLiz KendallPeter KylenewsShareReuse this content"

Collapsed spying case remains bafflingDan SabbaghDefence and security editorLabour says Tory government at time failed to classify China as a threat, but plenty of evidence suggests the contraryMon 13 Oct 2025 14.51 EDTLast modified on Mon 13 Oct 2025 15.42 EDTShareThere is a baffling contradiction at the heart of the efforts of Dan Jarvis, the security minister, to explain why the prosecution of two Britons accused of spying forChinacollapsed last month. The problem, he insisted in front of MPs on Monday, was that “it was not the policy of a Conservative government to classify China as a threat to national security”.Except there is plenty of evidence to suggest that China was recognised as a threat by the previous governments in documents and public statements by ministers and officials. All this makes the failure of the government witness – Matthew Collins, the deputy national security adviser – to set this out in three separate witness statements given to the prosecution even more surprising.The context here is the ongoing fallout from the collapse of the prosecution of Christopher Cash, a parliamentary researcher, who was working for the Conservative MP Alicia Kearns at the time of his arrest, and his friend Christopher Berry, a researcher based in China. Bothwere accused of spying for Chinaunder the 1911 Official Secrets Act because the alleged offences took place between late 2021 and early 2023, when that law was still in force.The archaic legislation, now replaced by the National Security Act, required Collins – as the government witness – to label China as an enemy,redefined after a court casein July 2024 as a “current threat to national security”. But it seems he did not do so to the satisfaction of the Crown Prosecution Service, not just in his original witness statement of December 2023 but again in February and July 2025.The formal explanation continues to be it was this failure that led to the CPS abandoning its case, a month before a trial was due to start. Jarvis, so keen to distance ministers and the prime minister’s national security adviser, Jonathan Powell, from the embarrassing episode, insisted that the content of the all important evidence was a “matter for the deputy national security adviser”.Although Britain’s relationship with China will always be complex and cannot be reduced to a single word, as Jarvis tried to argue, the idea that Chinese actors were not threatening the UK between 2021 and 2023 is absurd. Kemi Badenoch, responding for the Conservatives, had plenty to aim at, starting with the same policy documents that the Labour minister had sought to offer in his defence.Jarvis cited Boris Johnson’s integrated review of defence and foreign policy published in March 2021, perhaps the best guide to the prevailing policy at the time of the alleged spying. The policy review described China as a “systemic challenge” but, as the Tory party leader was able to point out, also that it was the “biggest state-based threat to the UK’s economic security”.During this period, between August 2021 and October 2022, the Electoral Commission was hacked by Chinese actors, allowing the cyberattackers access to the electoral register of 40 million people. When the Conservatives formally attributed the hack to Chinese actors, Rishi Sunak, then the prime minister, said China was “thegreatest state-based challengeto our national security”.Against this backdrop it is unclear why Downing Street and Jarvis continue to focus on Conservative policy at the time of the alleged offences, when doing so continues to invite scepticism and further questions about whether pressure was discreetly applied on the civil servant to restrict his witness statements. There is no shortage of evidence that Labour, influenced by Powell, wants acloser relationshipwith China.An obvious solution would be to provide more information by releasing Collins’s three witness statements, redacting, if necessary, any unproven allegations against Cash and Berry. Jarvis did not rule this out on Monday, but said he could not release anything “which may still be used in any further ongoing legal processes”, with Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, still pressing for a private prosecution.This will need to be resolved. For now Labour has struggled to provide an explanation that will kill off suspicion that the government failed to supply prosecutors the information they needed to improve the climate with Beijing. If the collapse of the case really amounts to a muddle over semantics, seeing Collins’s evidence ought to help.Explore more on these topicsForeign policyChinanewsShareReuse this content"

He said the attack didn’t cause any lasting injury.Farage said he was “deeply upset” about the incident and “the words used against him echo the prime minister’s disgraceful attack on Reform during Labour conference week and wholly irresponsible comments from the leader of the Green party”.In a post on X, Reform’s head of policy, Zia Yusuf, also wrote: “Reform’s council leader George Finch has been assaulted in the street. The assailant shouted “fascist, racist” – exactly the language used by the prime minister and the leader of the Green party. They know exactly what they’re doing.”This comes after Farage accused the prime minister of inciting violence against him during his speech at the Labour party conference. During the speech,Starmer told delegatesthat the Reform leader “doesn’t like Britain” and “doesn’t believe in Britain”.In response, Farage said the prime minister had incited the “radical left” against him and accused Starmer of threatening the safety of Reform officials.In response to the incident, and the claims by Farage, a Labour spokesperson said: “Violence, harassment or intimidation is completely unacceptable and has no place in our politics or society.“Any such incidents must be thoroughly investigated and the perpetrators must be brought to justice.”Reform UK abandoning manifesto pledge of £90bn in tax cuts, deputy leader admitsRead moreA Green party spokesperson said: “There is no place for violence or intimidation in politics and using the disgraceful attack of a councillor to score cheap points is distasteful.“The Green party is committed to offering a message of hope to counter those looking to fuel division and hatred. And we will work to bring communities together and provide them with the investment they need to thrive.”Warwickshire police said it was investigating an “assault” after receiving a call at 2am on Saturday “in which a man stated he had been pushed by another man in Nuneaton”.Warwickshire county council and Finch declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsReform UKNigel FarageWarwickshireLabourFar rightGreen partyKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

A similar plan was presented at the White House where some briefing room spots were given to podcasters and other representatives of non-traditional media.Pentagon demands journalists sign pledge not to gather certain informationRead moreOn Monday, theWashington Postjoined the New York Times, CNN, the Atlantic, the Guardian, Reuters, the Associated Press, NPR, HuffPost and trade publication Breaking Defense in saying it would not sign on to the agreement.Matt Murray, the Post’s executive editor, said the policy runs counter to constitutional guarantees of freedom of the press.“The proposed restrictions undercut First Amendment protections by placing unnecessary constraints on gathering and publishing information,”Murray wrotein a statement published on X. “We will continue to vigorously and fairly report on the policies and positions of the Pentagon and officials across the government.”The Atlantic, which became embroiled in a dispute with Pentagon and White House officials earlier this year after editor Jeffrey Goldberg was accidentally added to a group chat on Signal,saidit “fundamentally” opposes the new restrictions.The new policy “constrains how journalists can report on the U.S. military, which is funded by nearly $1 trillion in taxpayer dollars annually,”a New York Times statementsaid. “The public has a right to know how the government and military are operating,” wrote the Times Washington bureau chief, Richard Stevenson.Hegseth responded on social media to statements from the Atlantic, the Post and the Times by posting a single emoji of a hand waving goodbye. Later, the defense secretary, a former Fox weekend anchor,posted a liston X of what he called “press credentialing FOR DUMMIES: Press no longer roams free Press must wear visible badge Credentialed press no longer permitted to solicit criminal acts”. He also reposted a cartoon that depicted the Atlantic as a crying baby.Reuters alsoannouncedon Monday that “our journalists will not sign the revised press pass policy”, calling the Pentagon’s new restrictions an affront to “the press protections afforded by the US constitution, the unrestricted flow of information and journalism that serves the public interest without fear or favour”.National Public Radio’s editor-in-chief, Thomas Evans,said: “We will not sign the administration’s restrictive policy that asks reporters to undermine their commitment of providing trustworthy, independent journalism to the American public.”“The restrictions secretary Hegseth is attempting to place on the press are flatly unconstitutional,” Whitney Snyder, HuffPost’s editor-in-chief, said ina statement. “HuffPost will not agree to a document clearly aimed at snuffing out actual news-gathering at the nation’s largest and best-funded federal department.”Some righ-leaning outlets have also declined to sign the document. “Newsmax has no plans to sign the letter,” the network toldthe New York Times reporter Erik Wemple. “We are working in conjunction with other media outlets to resolve the situation. We believe the requirements are unnecessary and onerous and hope that the Pentagon will review the matter further.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Let’s see if we can ride this out, because what we’re not going to do is compromise our basic academic independence.”Obama says Trump linking paracetamol to autism is ‘violence against the truth’Read moreHe also noted that the organizations that did concede to Trump should be able to say: “We’re not going to be bullied into saying that we can only hire people or promote people based on some criteria that’s been cooked up by Steve Miller,” in reference to the top White House aide andarchitect of Trump’s hardline immigration policy.Obama, whose two terms preceded the firstTrump administration, also said that companies should also have stood up against administration pressure campaign to turn back from diversity hiring.“We think it’s important, because of what this country is, to hire people from different backgrounds,” Obama said.Universities, law firms and other businesses have all reached agreements with the White House, including dropping DEI targets and agreeing to rein in campus antisemitism in exchange for restoration of federal funding. A series of powerful Washington law firms have also agreed to provide free legal services to the administration, while corporations have rolled back diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.Disney, a frequent target of political-ideological factions on the left and right, scrapped its internal “Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion” program for “Opportunity & Inclusion” to empower “all through access, opportunity, and a culture of belonging”.Elsewhere in the interview, Obama acknowledged that integrity comes at a price.“Sometimes it’s going to be uncomfortable,” he told Maron, referencing a joke that Maron made in his stand-up routine that Democrats annoyed the average American into fascism.“It cracked me up,” Obama said. “I wasn’t as funny about saying this, but four or five years ago I said: ‘Look, you can’t just be a scold all the time. You can’t constantly lecture people without acknowledging you’ve got some blind spots, too.’”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If you want to keep it shut down, fine. It’s not going to change how I approach healthcare.”The senator’s comments came as Vice-President JD Vance warned that permanent cuts to the federal workforce will only get “deeper” as the shutdown continues.Vance told Fox News’s Maria Bartiromo on Sunday Morning Futures that “the longer it goes on, Maria, the more significant they’re going to be. If you remember, we went nine days before announcing any significant layoffs.“The longer this goes on, the deeper the cuts are going to be,” Vance continued.More than4,000 federal workershave so far been identified for job terminations. The Senate has voted multiple times over the last two weeks on a stopgap funding measure but not enough Democrats have joined the proposal to reach a 60-vote threshold.Graham’s comments may indicate a hardening approach to negotiations over healthcare subsidies with or without a functioning government.“The subsidies we’re talking about here,” Graham told NBC. “If the (Obama’s) Affordable Care Act is so affordable, why, every time I turn around, are we spending $350 billion to keep it afloat?”The dispute on the network continued with Arizona senator Mark Kelly, a Democrat, criticizingRepublicansfor refusing to negotiate with Democrats.“We need a real negotiation, and we need a fix. We need this corrected for the American people. This is for so many people – their healthcare is running towards a cliff, and if we don’t fix this, it’s going to go right over it,” Kelly told host Kristen Welker on Meet the Press.Against increasing pressure to reach a deal, with both sides weighing the political cost of a lack of a resolution, House speaker Mike Johnson said on Monday that Republicans had “probably a hundred different ideas about how to fix it but we can’t do that overnight”.He said Democrats’ demands for a resolution to the healthcare subsidies issue without lengthy discussions were “impossible and inappropriate”.“It’s not a deliverable and they know it,” Johnson said. “They chose that issue because they thought it would sell well to the public and it would show they were fighting Trump. It’s all a big facade and I’m so frustrated by it.”Explore more on these topicsUS federal government shutdown 2025Trump administrationUS politicsRepublicansDemocratsUS SenatenewsShareReuse this content"

Will things naturally come back around, or is it more a matter of rock, paper, scissors where one style counters another for a short while, as the current style gets broadly adopted? – PaulI dislike the term “cyclical” for tactics because it implies inevitability. Winter, spring, summer, autumn is a cycle; what happens in football tactics is not. When older ideas are repurposed for the modern age, they come with knowledge of what went before. So, to take an extreme example, when Pep Guardiola started fielding teams in a sort of 3-2-2-3 shape, it wasn’tthe W-M used by Herbert Chapman in the late 1920s, because in the 100 years since, football has changed enormously: players are fitter, pitches are better, kit is better, we understand pressing, we have data and sophisticated analytical modelling.Equally, we should be cautious of imagining there is a preferred model – that one tactical system is necessarily better than another. It’s not that there is a best way to play and everybody is striving to achieve the style closest to that. Everything is contingent: there is only ever a best way to play for a particular set of players in particular circumstances.Next Generation 2025: 20 of the best talents at Premier League clubsRead moreThat said, there are clearly periods when one style is dominant. The arrival of Rafa Benítez and José Mourinho to English football in the summer of 2004, for instance, made control the defining attitude of the Premier League. The appointment of Pep Guardiola in 2016 brought hisjuego de posiciónto England, which has had a huge impact throughout the divisions, even as he evolved. First, there was the challenge of Jürgen Klopp, which resulted in Guardiola’s approach and GermanGegenpressingmoving closer together. Since then, he has inverted full-backs, gone to a back four comprised entirely of central defenders, and had John Stones stepping forward as the signing of Erling Haaland effectively meant the centre-forward no longer functioned as an auxiliary midfielder.Over the last few months,there has been a radical change. There seems a general acceptance, not least from Guardiola himself, that the style he brought to England is no longer effective. Last season he spoke of the likes of Bournemouth and Newcastle playing modern football – although, in context, he was talking less about having players run more with the ball (as it has been widely interpreted) than about how the crowded fixture list makes it almost impossible to prepare players properly forjuego de posición, which requires a different strategic approach for every game. In that sense, the recent shift towards more direct football is less cyclical or incremental than reactive – a means of dealing with external factors.More generally, football finds itself not so much in a cycle as in a series of competing dialectics. As the emphasis on maintaining possession grew, central defenders – at least at elite clubs – began to be selected less for their defensive qualities than for their ability to pass the ball. That meant less focus on strength or heading ability, leaving them vulnerable against big, powerful centre-forwards. Bring back the big lumbering centre-backs of old, though, and they become susceptible to a well-targeted press. But then, big centre-forwards may not be capable of the constant rapid sprints required to press effectively.And that’s just one element. We’ve got used to wide forwards who cut infield on to their stronger foot, but as centre-forwards get bigger, better at heading and perhaps less adept at vacating space for a teammate cutting infield, it may be that a preference grows for wide players who do not invert but beat the full-back on the outside to put in outswinging crosses.There are always wheels within wheels, and that means terms like “cyclical” or “incremental” will always seem reductive.With summer temperatures in North America consistently hot, will we see a return to the type of World Cup we saw in 1970 and 1982 when oppressive heat reduced the efficacy of pressing? And does this open up the tournament to teams who could pack the pitch with creative No 10s? – JonathanI enjoyedyour newsletter in Septemberabout the new defensive mentality in football, where, as you pointed out, “we are seeing a more physical game centred on crosses, set plays and giving nothing away.” Do you think we’ll see that at next year’s World Cup too? – Bethanyskip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The temperature definitely will be a factor. Consistent pressing will be very difficult and, as at the Club World Cup, I think we’ll see spells in games in which both teams effectively take a breather. Most sides, I suspect, will sit deep in a low block, which means very little space for No 10s. It may be that what ends up being effective is controlling the pace of games, remaining tight defensively and breaking down opponents through attrition. Set plays are likely to be a major factor.In 2022 we had Morocco making a surprise run to the semi-finals, and in 2018 Croatia got all the way to the final itself. Which “smaller” nation do you think could make a deep run this time around (I’ve got my eye on Norway)? – WallyIt’s slightly baffling that the World Cup is such a closed shop, when there have been shocks at the Euros, the Africa Cup of Nations and the Asian Cup. But it does seem that something about the occasion – or having to play one game more than at confederational tournaments – makes a big difference. Morocco again and Senegal are probably the likeliest African sides to have a decent run (or DR Congo if they make it through the play-offs). As you say, Norway, who have had some excellent players for a while now, are playing extremely well, and Switzerland have become a very consistent side. But the team I think could really surprise peopleis Ecuador, who have the likes of Moisés Caicedo, Willian Pacho and Pervis Estupiñán, and qualified second from Conmebol.This is an extract from Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly look from the Guardian US at the game in Europe and beyond.Subscribe for free here.Have a question for Jonathan?

But they dominated the Lions, who have suffered a string of injuries to their defense, on both sides of the ball to secure a 30-17 victory and move to 3-3 for the season.But the evening ended with players from both teams flooding the field after a fight started for the most petty of reasons. Lions safety Brian Branch refused to return a handshake from Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes after the game ended. Chiefs wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster took exception to the slight and exchanged words with Branch, who sent him to the ground with a shove to the face. Dozens of players then converged in a scrum as the scrap continued with Branch managing to dislodge Smith-Schuster’s helmet.Has Drake Maye ended the Patriots’ painful Tom Brady hangover?Read more“I did a little childish thing,” Branch said, “but I’m tired of people doing stuff in between the play and refs don’t catch it. They be trying to bully me out there and I don’t – I shouldn’t have did it. It was childish.”Lions coach Dan Campbell said Branch, who was fined for face-masking and unsportsmanlike conduct in a game against the Green Bay Packers last month, was in the wrong.CHIEFS-LIONS FIGHT 😳pic.twitter.com/H6f5gJYWsS— BrickCenter (@BrickCenter_)October 13, 2025“I love Brian Branch,” Campbell said, “but what he did is inexcusable, and it’s not going to be accepted here. It’s not what we do. It’s not what we’re about. I apologized to [Chiefs coach Andy Reid] and the Chiefs, and Smith-Schuster. That’s not OK. That’s not what we do here. It’s not going to be OK. He knows it. Our team knows it. That’s not what we do.”Reid said Smith-Schuster was left with a bloody nose after the incident. “The guy came up and hit JuJu for what looked like no reason,” Reid said. “That’s tough. But pretty good damage on JuJu’s nose.”Branch’s frustration may have stemmed from a no-call when Smith-Schusterappeared to illegally blockthe safety in the back. There was also a notable decision early in the game when the Lions had a touchdown ruled out. Detroit thought they had scored – and gone up 7-0 – when quarterback Jared Goff caught a touchdown pass from running back David Montgomery. But, despite the fact that no flag had been thrown, the officials ruled it out for illegal motion and the Lions had to settle for a field goal.“It doesn’t matter if I agree or disagree [with the penalty],” Campbell, whose team are 4-2 after the loss, said. “They said he never stopped. He stayed in motion. You can’t stay in motion. But that had no bearing on the game. We lost by 13 points.”Explore more on these topicsNFLKansas City ChiefsDetroit LionsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Working toward our goals and the process.”During the second of two off weeks in a three-week span, the subject of Belichick’s status and future with the Tar Heels was a hot topic, so much so that last Wednesday the university released brief statements from the coach and athletics director Bubba Cunningham reaffirming commitments between Belichick and the school. Reports had said the 73-year-old wanted to return to theNFLas a coach or in the media.Bill Belichick’s humiliating college football debut brings only schadenfreude or sadnessRead moreOn Monday, there was double the media turnout compared to Belichick’s normal game-week availability. University chancellor Lee Roberts and Cunningham also attended, along with other high-ranking officials in the athletics department, an unusual occurrence midway through a college season.“It’s a learning curve,” Belichick said of his time with UNC so far. “We’re all in it together. But we’re making a lot of progress and the process will eventually produce the results we want like they have everywhere else I’ve been.”The Tar Heels are 2-3 so far this season, and the teamhas underwhelmed under Belichick, who won six Super Bowls as head coach of the New England Patriots.“There’s a steeper learning curve than we all anticipated,” Cunningham said. “The gap between expectations and performance is more severe than what we expected and that’s what creates a lot of attention.”With only one game during a span of nearly a month, it has allowed off-field drama to command plenty of attention. Yet Belichick was spotted attending a high school game Friday night, perhaps an indication of normal in-season functions in terms of recruiting. Belichick said the program has approximately 40 high school players committed for the next recruiting class.Belichick is in the first year of a deal that guarantees $10m in base and supplemental pay for each of the next two seasons. Team general manager Michael Lombardi, a former NFL executive who is largely a partner with Belichick in this college endeavor, is making $1.5m for each of the next two seasons.North Carolina have been blown out in three games against Championship Subdivision opponents, including a 38-10 belting from Clemson in the most recent game. The Tar Heels surrendered 28 first-quarter points in that game and many UNC fans left early, leaving the stadium half-empty.“Everybody’s most interested in the final score and I’m at the top of that list,” Belichick said. “But it’s a process. You build a culture, you build a program, and eventually the results will come. When will that happen? Hopefully as soon as possible. We’re working hard to get there.”Also last week, the school announced that cornerbacks coach Armond Hawkins has been placed on suspension for violating rules connected to improper benefits. He’s on leave while the school “further investigates other potential actions detrimental” to the team and school.The turbulence comes aftermonths-long tabloid-level interestinvolving Belichick’s 24-year-old girlfriend, Jordon Hudson, who has been on the sidelines prior to games.Explore more on these topicsCollege footballCollege sportsNFLUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

New England appear to have found one after a few short years in the wildernessOliver ConnollyMon 13 Oct 2025 03.20 EDTLast modified on Mon 13 Oct 2025 10.19 EDTShareYou have to feel for the Browns, Jets, and Bears. Those franchises have spent decades in quarterback purgatory, rotating through prospects and placeholders. Meanwhile, after just five years of searching, the Patriots – the post-Tom Brady Patriots – appear to have found the guy.Five years. From Brady to Cam Newton to Mac Jones to Bailey Zappe to Maye’s first choppy season to this: a 23-year-old quarterback who looks like a top-five starter and MVP candidate.Last week was his breakout: a road win in Buffalo, where Maye went throw-for-throw with Josh Allen and outplayed the reigning MVP in the fourth quarter. But Sunday in New Orleans may have been even more impressive. Fresh off an upset win over the division favorites, a trip to a lousy Saints team had potential for a letdown. And the Saints teased an upset early. They ripped off a big play on the opening snap of the game, before stalling out in the redzone and settling for a field goal. It took Maye all of four plays to respond, uncorking a 53-yard deep ball to DeMario Douglas for the go-ahead touchdown.Drake Maye goes 53 yards deep to Pop Douglas!NEvsNO on CBS/Paramount+https://t.co/HkKw7uXVntpic.twitter.com/H87yHASZmt— NFL (@NFL)October 12, 2025It was Maye at his best, climbing through the pocket to deliver a strike downfield. From there, he didn’t let up: Maye torched the Saints in every area of the field. His first half was so searing thateven North Carolinawas forced totweet. He finished 18-of-26 for 261 yards with three touchdowns and no turnovers. And it could have been more if not for a trio ofquestionable officiating calls.It was his fifth straight game with at least 200 yards and a passer rating north of 100. Only Patrick Mahomes, Dak Prescott, and Dan Marino have ever done that at age 23 or younger.The best quarterbacks turn difficult road games into ho-hum wins. They don’t put the ball in harm’s way, keep the offense chugging and make the decisive throws on crucial downs. The Patriots needed every bit of Maye’s near perfection to squeeze by the Saints. They couldn’t run the ball against a stout front. Their defense gave up multiple chunk plays. This was a game that had to be won by Maye’s right arm. And he delivered under fire.Maye was hit a few times and sacked once, but the pressure he faced was constant. It didn’t matter. Maye threw all three touchdown passes under pressure, with all three traveling 20 yards or more in the air.It’s not just the numbers though. It’s how Maye carries himself. He’s confident and composed in the pocket, bouncing through reads to find open targets. When needed, he can take off and create with his legs. As a rookie, he was a little chaotic, fleeing the pocket at the first sign of trouble. But this season, he’s been more like Brady, conforming to the confines of the scheme and getting the ball where it needs to go in a hurry.Drake Maye statsFor the season, Maye is up to 10 passing touchdowns, two rushing touchdowns and just two interceptions. He’s halved his Turnover Worthy Play rate from his rookie year, when he was constantly trying to conjure magic out of broken plays. Now, he’s picking his moments. He hasn’t committed a TWP in three games, per PFF.Coming out of college, Maye was billed as a big-armed bomber. Evaluators questioned his ability to process sophisticated coverages and operate a complex offense. Too loose. Too reckless. But Josh McDaniels, in his third tour as Patriots offensive coordinator, has unleashed the full breadth of his scheme. Maye isn’t being limited; he’s being trusted.The Patriots are shapeshifting weekly again, and Maye is piloting the offense like an eight-year vet.His growth has accelerated the Patriots’ timeline. If there were to be second-year progress, you imagined it would be a slow burn. There would still be the highlight throws, while Maye spent the season trying to cut his brain-farts-per-game in half. That would be progress. Instead, Maye has smashed expectations. Six games into his second season, he’s turned into one of the league’s best – and he’s made the Patriots division contenders again.Bears fans will take some comfort in seeing the development of Caleb Williams. But if you’re a Browns or Jets fan, you have to wince. Because this is what it’s supposed to look like when a franchise quarterback arrives. And for the rest of the league’s quarterback-starved franchises, it’s yet another reminder of how cruel and cyclical this sport can be. The Patriots went from the greatest of all time to a possible great in half a decade. Some teams spend a quarter of a century looking – and still don’t find anyone.Finding a franchise quarterback is about more than winning games. It alters the personality of a fanbase and franchise. For 20 years, the Pats lived the gilded life. But the last few seasons have been about failing to build a bridge from Brady to whatever would come next. They’ve found the answer now. Prepare for your Masshole friends to rediscover their Brady-era bluster.MVP of the weekView image in fullscreenJaxon Smith-Njigba was in an understandably chipper mood after Sunday’s game.Photograph: Phelan M Ebenhack/APJaxon Smith-Njigba, WR, Seattle Seahawks.Against a stifling Jaguars defense, Seattle’s only way forward was for Sam Darnold to look for Smith-Njigba, anywhere and everywhere. The receiver responded with eight catches for 162 yards and a touchdown on 13 targets, as the Seahawks snuck past the Jags 20-12. Seattle’s defense led the way, hounding Trevor Lawrence and dropping him a season-high seven times. But it was Smith-Njigba who carried the Seahawks’ offense, making up all 117 of the Seahawks’ initial 117 yards through the air. That included a 61-yard touchdown and maybe thenastiest routewe’ll see from a receiver all year.Jaxon Smith-Njigba just beat new#JaguarsCB Greg Newsome on his very first snap with his new team — a 61-yard TD.JSN is entering superstardom territory.pic.twitter.com/Bf7KJMPUr7— Ari Meirov (@MySportsUpdate)October 12, 2025Video of the weekThe Dolphins were on the wrong side of yet another disappointing, late defeat. They took a one-point lead over the Chargers with 48 seconds left, after Tua Tagovailoa found Darren Waller for his fourth touchdown of the season. The Chargers then popped a 40-yard return on the ensuing kickoff. From there, Justin Herbert and Ladd McConkey took over:WILD PLAY BY HERBERT AND MCCONKEY.LACvsMIA on CBS/Paramount+https://t.co/HkKw7uXVntpic.twitter.com/9zWXv9zzGD— NFL (@NFL)October 12, 2025Hoo boy. That is mean. Somehow, Herbert was able to evade two oncoming pass-rushers, slipping past the first before tossing the other to the deck. He found McConkey in the flat, who put a Dolphins’ corner on skates to move the ball in range for the game-winning field goal.It sums up the Chargers’ season: squeaking by on the excellence of Herbert and his surrounding playmakers as his offensive line flails. And it sums up the Dolphins’ defense, too: a pass-rush that struggles to finish and a floundering secondary. With the defeat, the Dolphins fell to 1-5. Miserable second-half collapses have become standard for Mike McDaniel’s team. With another rough loss, he’s running out of time to save his job.Stat of the weekView image in fullscreenJustin Fields struggled all day against the Broncos in London.Photograph: Daniel Hambury/EPAMinus-10. That’s the net passing yards Justin Fields finished with in the Jets’ 13-11 loss to the Broncos in London. It’s the fewest in any game since the Chargers had minus-19 in 1998, according to theAssociated Press. Even then, the Chargers had Ryan Leaf making his third professional start. Fields was making his49th.We know who Fields is now: an exceptional runner who struggles to decipher the passing game. He’s late to read defenses, late to let the ball go and struggles with the rhythmic demands of the league. And against a fearsome Broncos defensive front, Fields’ flaws were brutally exposed. He was sacked as many times (nine) as he completed a pass.Despite falling to 0-6 and his quarterback’s continuing struggles, Jets head coach Aaron Glenn said post-game he is not considering benching Fields. “There’s 11 games left,” Fields said. Based on Sunday’s performance, that sounds more like a threat than words of encouragement.Elsewhere around the leagueView image in fullscreenPatrick Mahomes’s Chiefs are 3-3 after their win over the Lions.Photograph: Ed Zurga/AP-- The Chiefs’ loss to the Jaguars in Week 5 looks more like a blip than a crisis after Kansas City dominated the Detroit Lions in a 30-17 win on Sunday night. Yes, the Lions have a depleted secondary but Mahomes – who had three passing TDs and another rushing – was excellent as he found Travis Kelce time and again. And remember that Mahomes has another target, Rashee Rice, returning from suspension next week. The Lions shouldn’t be too disheartened, many of their injured players will return in a month or so, just in time for a late season charge. The game also featuredan entertainingly petty scufflebetween the teams after Brian Branch apparently refused to high-five Mahomes at the end of the contest.-- “They wasn’t bucked up,” Panthers running back Rico Dowdle said after gaining 239 yards from scrimmage and scoring a touchdown against the Cowboys. On the list of Dallas’ offseason sins, not extending Dowdle after he rushed for 1,000 yards last season is rising. The Panthers scooped him up on a bargain deal, and he ran all over the Cowboys’ hapless defense in Sunday’s 30-27 win. Note fromNFLResearch: Dowdle’s 239 scrimmage yards are the most by a player in a game against his former team in league history.Baker Mayfield EVADES the sack and gets the first down with his legs on 3rd & 14 🤯(via@NFL)pic.twitter.com/KneHj9cY2o— Bleacher Report (@BleacherReport)October 12, 2025-- Who had Baker Mayfield as an MVP frontrunner six weeks into the season? The Bucs quarterback kept up his early-season heater in a 30-19 win over the Niners, wholost star linebacker Fred Warner for the seasonto a horrible ankle injury. It was a game in which Mayfield, already down two starting receivers, lost rookie phenom Emeka Egbukato a hamstring injury. The Bucs were also forced to play theirsixth-stringguard. Neither setback bothered Mayfield, who completed 17-of-23 pass attempts for 256 yards and two touchdowns with no interceptions. And he added another play to his MVP reel. On a crucial third-and-14,Baker went full Beast Mode, slipping away from a sack, scrambling, stiff-arming a defender, then diving through two tacklers to pick up a first down. Two plays later, he delivered a 45-yard dart to rookie Tez Johnson for a touchdown.-- It was another disastrous performance for the Cowboys’ defense, but their offense continues to be excellent despite missing all five of their starters on the offensive line. Dak Prescott completed 25 of 34 pass attempts for 261 yards and three touchdowns with no turnovers or sacks against the Panthers. George Pickens was his go-to target, and he fried Carolina’s undermanned secondary for 168 yards and a touchdown on nine grabs. The Prescott-to-Pickens connection has been everything Dallas hoped for after acquiring the former Steelers receiver in the offseason. Attention will quickly turn to Pickens’s upcoming contract extension. Will Jerry Jones fork over $100m-plus for another receiver after inking CeeDee Lamb to a long-term extension and trading away Micah Parsons, in part, to save money?-- It was a survive and advance week for the Colts, who needed a late redzone stop to knock off a feisty Cardinals team 31-27. Indy’s offense continued to roll, putting up 30 points for the fourth time this season. But Indy’s defense struggled to contain a Cardinals offense led by backup quarterback Jacoby Brissett, who may have forced some in Arizona to take a sideways glance at Kyler Murray.-- What is going on in Indianapolis during warmups? Backup quarterback – and potential trade candidate – Anthony Richardsonsustained an orbital fracturein the locker room prior to the Colts’ game against the Cardinals. According toESPN, Richardson was hit in the eye by an exercise band when a device malfunctioned. Richardson was not the only one who suffered before the game: Charvarius Ward was ruled out with a concussion after heaccidentally collidedwith tight end Alec Ogletree.-- The hampered Ravens dropped to 1-5 after losing 17-3 at home to the Rams, making it the worst start to a season in Jon Harbaugh’s 18-year tenure with the franchise. Baltimore will hit the bye at the lowest ebb of the Harbaugh era. If they can get the bulk of their starters back from injury after the break, they could still make a playoff run. But the odds of turning the season around are dwindling. Since the current playoff format started in 2020, only one team – Washington in 2020 – has started 1-5 and made the playoffs.Explore more on these topicsNew England PatriotsNFLUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The man from Slovenia ended 2025 as he began it, dominating a coveted Italian classic, Il Lombardia, to win the “race of the falling leaves”for the fifth consecutive time.The 27-year-old started his European season by winning the Tuscan gravel race, Strade Bianche. He closed it having matched Italian icon Fausto Coppi’s record of five Lombardy wins and Eddy Merckx’s achievement of winning three “monument” races, the Tour de France and the world road race title in the same year.‘I’m the total opposite to Cav and Brad’: Geraint Thomas on how a normal bloke won the Tour de FranceRead moreIn late July, however, a weary Pogacar talked about early retirement and a sense of burnout, even ashe took his fourth yellow jersey. His mid-season low came towards the end of that Tour win, when he seemed withdrawn and disgruntled, as the race closed on Paris. There were whispered rumours that he had been asked to back off a little and resist further stage wins to avoid reducing the Tour to a procession.In fact, Pogacar told Slovenian media on Monday that he had come close to quitting the 2025 Tour, while leading the race, due to a worsening knee injury. “The day after the stage finish on Mont Ventoux, I had problems with my knee and started to have doubts about whether I would be able to continue,” he said, adding that the cold weather during the subsequent Alpine stages didn’t help. “It was cold and my body went on the defensive. My body was in shock. I had had enough of everything.”After a post-Tour sabbatical, during which he trained in kit bearing the messages “Do Not Disturb” and “No Photography”, he came back, seemingly revitalised, winning the world and European road races titles. Only Remco Evenepoel, the world and Olympic time-trial champion, was able to hang on to his back wheel.By the end of the season, Pogacar was insatiable. “I always say, seven years in a row, this is my best season,” he said after winning in Lombardy on Saturday. “And again I can say this is the best season so far.”In comparison, Jonas Vingegaard, second to Pogacar in the Tour, rebooted himself to takevictory in a troubled Vuelta a España, where the presence of the Israel Premier-Tech team led to mass pro-Palestinian protests and the cancellation of the final stage in Madrid.That team is now to undergo a rebrand, after pressure from rival teams, race organisers andeven their own star rider, Derek Gee, who cited “serious concerns” which he said “weighed heavily” on his conscience, forced change.Over the season, the only rider to come close to matching Pogacar’s spring-to-autumn longevity has been a revitalised Tom Pidcock, the Briton who chased him over the Tuscan hills to second place in Siena back in February and was in hot pursuit on Saturday in Lombardy, finishing sixth.Pidcock’s rebirth, which led to his best-ever finish in a Grand Tour, third in the Vuelta, was mirrored by another Ineos Sport exile and fellow Olympic mountain biking champion, Pauline Ferrand-Prévot, who took thefirst French win in the Tour de Francethis century.View image in fullscreenPauline Ferrand-Prévot’s weight loss became a talking point after she won the Tour de France Femmes.Photograph: Jérôme Delay/APFerrand-Prévot’s climbing performances on the final weekend of the Tour de France Femmes overwhelmed past champions Demi Vollering and Kasia Niewiadoma, and led to jubilation in the Alps.But her win also sparked a debate about extreme weight loss in the women’s peloton, with even Ferrand-Prévot admitting it was unsustainable and rival rider Marlen Reusser saying “we secretly hoped she wouldn’t be successful.”Asked by Dutch journalists if she should lose more weight to compete with Ferrand-Prévot, Vollering responded: “I want to set a good example. I hope I can win again and show girls you don’t have to be super-skinny and that if you have the power and you train hard, you can make it.”There were other breakthrough performances in French cycling, with the most notable coming from teenager Paul Seixas, whose win in the Tour de l’Avenir, allied to third place behind Pogacar and Evenepoel in the European Championships, led to roadside banners proclaiming “Seixas is better than sex”.Great things are now expected from the Lyon-based rider, but given the pressures being heaped on him, many are hoping that unlike other French prodigies, he can survive the hype and prosper.The year however, has belonged to Pogacar, yet again. Some are enthralled by his domination, others are left cold by his long solo attacks, while others find it unsettling. Whichever camp you fall into, it’s an indication of cycling’s inability to ever reconcile itself with its troubled past that some remain sceptical of extraordinary performances.Explore more on these topicsTadej PogacarCyclinganalysisShareReuse this content"

Ødegaard twice attempted to carry on after treatment before being replaced by Martín Zubimendi, and Arteta said the 26-year-old had left the ground with his knee in a brace.Martín Zubimendi: ‘I have to adapt but Arsenal signed me because they like what I do’Read moreArsenal said last week that tests showed Ødegaard had sustained medial collateral ligament damage and the midfielder withdrew from the Norway squad for their5-0 victory over Israelon Saturday in a World Cup qualifier and a friendly with New Zealand on Tuesday.He is not thought to require surgery but it is understood he is not expected to return before the next international break, which starts on 10 November. That would rule him out of seven matches: Premier League games against Fulham, Crystal Palace, Burnley and Sunderland, Champions League games against Atlético Madrid and Slavia Prague and a Carabao Cup tie against Brighton.Arsenal hope that Ødegaard, who has missed games in this campaign because of a shoulder injury and was out for almost two months last season with an ankle issue picked up on international duty, could return for the north London derby against Tottenham on 23 November.Eberechi Eze has been deputising for Ødegaard in a creative midfield role in recent weeks, and the England Under-21 forward Ethan Nwaneri has also proved capable of filling in.Ødegaard will join Gabriel Jesus, Kai Havertz and Noni Madueke on the sidelines. The summer signing Piero Hincapié, who has been restricted to one substitute appearance, is expected to return from a groin injury after this international break.Explore more on these topicsArsenalnewsShareReuse this content"

But while Wales gaveBelgiuman early fright, two Kevin De Bruyne penalties and a Thomas Meunier strike paved the way to a comeback victory that all but quashes their hopes of automatically qualifying for the World Cup.Nathan Broadhead, on as a substitute, pulled a goal back but almost immediately Leandro Trossard struck to cap a victory this time featuring just the six goals. Joe Rodon headed in to giveWalesa welcome leg up but Belgium stirred to maintain their pristine qualifying record; their last defeat in a qualifier here in June 2015, when Gareth Bale scored to propel Wales towards Euro 2016. Wales will likely have to do it the hard way if they are to reach North America next summer.Nick Woltemade seals Germany’s win over spirited Northern IrelandRead moreFor Wales, it was a galling rollercoaster of an evening and, as Bellamy acknowledged, they have now breached the Belgium defence five times across two matches with nothing to show for it. “That’s hard to take,” said the Wales manager. “I honestly love playing these top teams because your heart is in your mouth at times, you’re really living on the edge.”For many supporters, the topic of conversation upon departure centred on not another historic night in Cardiff but the sight of Brennan Johnson coaxing a rat off the pitch after Thibaut Courtois failed to get to grips with the invader.Bellamy demanded an intensity from his side to match the electricity in the stands. This stadium played the hits pre-match: Yma o Hyd, Zombie Nation, a light show to boot. The players emerged to a giant banner strewn across the Canton Stand: “Tan Yn Eu Gwaed (Fire in their Blood), Welshmen will not yield.”View image in fullscreenA rat evades Thibaut Courtois during the World Cup qualifier in Cardiff.Photograph: Charlotte Wilson/Offside/Getty ImagesThere was a typically rousing anthem, too, for which the captain Ben Davies – on his 100th cap – stood with his eldest son by his side and his youngest resting over his left shoulder. Davies applied his game face, though his eyes appeared watery. Who could blame him?Wales arrived to the pitch turbocharged, Bellamy applauding as Mark Harris, the Oxford striker preferred to Johnson, who entered approaching the hour, forced Zeno Debast into a panicked clearance inside two and a half minutes. Wales were everything they were notin the opening stages at Wembley last Thursdayand they led inside eight minutes, an unmarked Rodon heading in a delicious Sorba Thomas corner, their third in relatively quick succession. Rodon rushed off in celebration, his rusty knee slide leaving him on his backside, every outfield player joining the party.For seven minutes, Wales were in dreamland – until the German referee, Daniel Siebert, headed to the VAR monitor, to take a look at a potential handball by Ethan Ampadu. A communal groan followed the initial hush and then Siebert pointed to the penalty spot. Ampadu was penalised for his right hand halting Charles De Ketelaere’s dink and a couple of minutes later De Bruyne sent Karl Darlow the wrong way from 12 yards.Bellamy was booked for his explicit protestations and will subsequently serve a touchline ban in Liechtenstein next month. Suddenly the place was deflated and Belgium breezed through the gears, chiefly Jérémy Doku. Trossard punched a diagonal pass out towards the right flank and while Wales considered it a lost cause, Doku did not and retrieved the ball from close to the corner flag. The Manchester City winger gobbled up about 40 yards of turf but that was nothing compared to Meunier, who flew forward from inside his own half to send a first-time finish zooming past Darlow. From there things threatened to unravel, Rodon preventing Trossard from a near-certain third goal and then De Bruyne blasted over after Doku left Ben Cabango in a heap.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He proved virtually unstoppable in Brussels in June and was a constant menace again here. His next magic trick? Slipping the ball through the legs of Davies, who had James with him in support, and racing to the byline to fashion another chance. Doku wasted a chance to establish some breathing space in the 69th minute, sending a shot too close to a grateful Darlow when looking for the far corner.Davies was forced off through injury a minute later and just as it seemed Wales had settled, De Bruyne was standing over another spot-kick with 15 minutes of regular time to play. Trossard found himself cornered by red shirts, but James made a brainless decision to intercept the ball with his right arm. De Bruyne dispatched another penalty low, this time into the opposite corner.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersWalesBelgiummatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Instead, it was Nick Woltemade, courtesy of his maiden goal for his country, who endorsed his status as Germany’s man of the moment. It would not be a World Cup without Germany and it surely will not be a World Cup without Germany. They are, however, clearly still a work in progress.Julian Nagelsmann will enjoy more comfortable evenings on the touchline. For all their technical superiority, Germany failed to properly punish aNorthern Irelandteam who showed wonderful tenacity and grew in belief as the clock ticked down. The scale of frustration at not claiming a point depicted how much they put into this game.De Bruyne double in Belgium win deals huge blow to Wales’ World Cup hopesRead moreThere was fury from their manager, Michael O’Neill, at what he described as the “ridiculous” allowance of two minutes of stoppage time. Plucky losers? No thanks, with O’Neill reflecting on a “sore” outcome.Wirtz played on the fringes, which will only intensify chatter about when – or if – he will justify Liverpool’s faith. How the Germans could have done with Wirtz’s influence, having been made to sweat by a young team who refused to grant them an inch.“I expected this kind of game,” said Nagelsmann. “It is hard to relax in these games.”The occasion of O’Neill’s 99th match in charge had witnessed one of the team’s finest performances of his two spells asSlovakia were vanquishedhere on Friday. This raised hopes that Northern Ireland may not need the back door playoff route likely to be afforded them following Nations League progress. The raucous atmosphere was unaffected by the absence of Conor Bradley, who was exceptional in the Slovakia win, but banned for the follow-up.Nagelsmann had ruffled feathers by labelling Northern Ireland unattractive long-ball merchants afterthe sides met in Cologne last month. The ex-Bayern Munich coach sort ofapologised for his remarkson the eve of this fixture by pointing out they are a very good long-ball team. Nagelsmann insisted he meant no offence. It seemed to be taken anyway.View image in fullscreenKarim Adeyemi misses a good chance to put Germany two up after being set up by Florian Wirtz.Photograph: Ramsey Cardy/Sportsfile/Getty ImagesIt felt poetic, then, that in the 14th minute Northern Ireland had the ball in the net after a punt from their own half. The problem was, Paddy McNair had been offside before the stramash that preceded Daniel Ballard firing beyond the stranded Oliver Baumann.Wirtz started the match on the right side of the attack, duly swapping flanks with Karim Adeyemi. Woltemade, keen to continue his fine touch at Newcastle, played as the focal pointGermany had been building momentum before the simple moment that opened Woltemade’s international account. From David Raum’s inswinging corner, Woltemade found space in an otherwise congested six-yard box to bundle past Bailey Peacock-Farrell with a shoulder. O’Neill had cause to be furious at the lack of pressure placed on the gangly striker. Woltemade will remember the time and place and despite the scrappiness of the goal.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Jamie Reid fired wildly over the bar after Ethan Galbraith’s trickery. Ali McCann’s half-volley from distance flew only narrowly beyond the upright. Germany passed up an opportunity of their own, Jonathan Tah clumsy with his pass as the unmarked Leon Goretzka waited.Galbraith’s booking in first-half stoppage-time means he will miss Northern Ireland’s trip to Slovakia next month, another suspension blow for O’Neill.Adeyemi should have settled matters within two minutes of the restart. The Borussia Dortmund man was sent clean through on goal by Wirtz after the hosts botched a free-kick, but sent his shot beyond the right post. It was an extraordinary miss by one so talented.Wirtz claimed in vain for a penalty after tumbling theatrically under a Shea Charles challenge. Deployment of the dark arts only emphasised Germany’s lack of comfort. O’Neill had replaced Reid, of Stevenage, with Exeter’s Josh Magennis.It was endearing, then, to see moments of panic when Northern Ireland flung balls into the penalty area. Galbraith further raised home hope on the hour with a low drive that Baumann scrambled across his goal to save.Serge Gnabry, who like Wirtz had been peripheral, stung the palms of Peacock-Farrell with 20 minutes to play. Germany needed the leeway of a second goal that subsequently never looked like coming. Callum Marshall almost punished that with an effort on the turn that Baumann held at the second attempt.In a wonderfully chaotic ending, Germany clung on.

The sentiment is not an exclusively American thing. “Attack wins you games, defence win you titles,” Sir Alex Ferguson once said. And he should know, having won quite a lot of them with Manchester United.As England look forward to next summer’sWorld Cup, which will be co-hosted by the US, Canada and Mexico, the idea has come to resonate, mainly because of how miserly they have been at the back under Thomas Tuchel.Why there is no such thing as a perfect football tactic | Jonathan WilsonRead moreThey will secure automatic qualification with two games to spare if they beat Latvia on Tuesday night. It ought not be beyond them given Latvia could only draw 2-2 here with the Group K whipping boys, Andorra, on Saturday. And givenEnglandhave been virtually impregnable in the campaign under Tuchel.The table shows five wins out of five with five clean sheets, Jordan Pickford keeping them all. The goalkeeper returned another last Thursday inthe 3-0 friendly win against Walesat Wembley, his eighth in a row for England, breaking a record he shared with Gordon Banks. You have to go back a year to find the last England game when Pickford conceded;the 2-1 Nations League defeat against Greeceat Wembley. Tuchel’s England have been breached in one match – the3-1 friendly defeat against Senegalin June when Dean Henderson was in goal.That was no slight on Henderson, rather a reflection of Senegal’s superior quality compared with everything else Tuchel has faced. This really cannot be overlooked. Wales are the next-highest country at No 30 while a Serbia team in disarray are 34th. Albania are 66th; Latvia and Andorra well into the triple digits.Drill a little deeper into the numbers and it is hard to ignore the one about how Pickford has been required to make two saves during qualification;one against Latvia, the otheragainst Serbia. But this is not only about Pickford, rather the unit he anchors. As he was quick to point out, it is about the XI as a defensive collective, starting with the captain, Harry Kane, up front.It is about good habits and relationships; the setting of standards. If it is not the glamorous side of the game, the one that excites the fans, it remains fundamental. England were criticised for their lack of spark under Gareth Southgate at Euro 2024. Their resilience almost overcame everything as they conceded four goals en route to the final,which they lost 2-1 against Spain.View image in fullscreenJordan Pickford made his name for England at Russia 2018 with his penalty shootout heroics against Colombia.Photograph: Simon Stacpoole/Offside/Getty Images“What we’ve got is that solid base,” Pickford said. “Once we know we’re defending like that as a unit, it gives us the freedom to go and create chances at the other end. Keeping clean sheets is good, but if you keep having that momentum defensively, you get better positions on the ball and you create more opportunities to score and win the game.”Pickford, who is primed to sign a new long-term contract at Everton, has been the constant in Tuchel’s defensive unit during qualification and it feels as though it is John Stones, who is back to fitness, and Marc Guéhi as the preferred centre-half pairing, with Ezri Konsa also pushing. The worries are in the full-back positions.It seems like a long time ago that Southgate was ribbed for having a right-back fetish. Kyle Walker and Kieran Trippier are out of the picture and Trent Alexander-Arnold does not appear to have Tuchel’s trust. He is also injured at present. Reece James is the first choice, but his fitness problems are well documented; he, too, is out with an injury. Konsa is in line to fill in against Latvia, as he did against Wales.At left-back, Tino Livramento started in the 5-0 away win against Serbia in September, which was surely Tuchel’s biggest game. As such, Livramento is probably the player in possession of the shirt, although he is another injury casualty. Which leaves Djed Spence, who, like Livramento, has been repurposed from right-back, and Myles Lewis-Skelly, who has lost his place in Arsenal’s starting lineup. Tuchel has made clear that he needs Lewis-Skelly to “perform at club level on a regular basis … to just be a good citizen in camp will not be enough to stay the whole year”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But there is a reason why he has remained the undisputed No 1 – his shot-stopping reflexes are excellent and his concentration levels have improved as he has grown in experience. The most recent example came against Wales when he was a virtual bystander for the first 55 minutes and then made two good saves.“I’m always moving with the game,” Pickford said. “I always stay in the moment when I am not doing anything. My coaches used to say: ‘Don’t be bored, don’t go trying to invent work, let the work come to you. If there is a cross 16 yards out, don’t come and think you have to go and do it because you have not done anything for 15 minutes.’ That is something I have definitely learned and there is a big improvement on that side of it.”Of Pickford’s remarkable England statistics, one stands out. He has made a single error that has led to a goal – inthe 2-2 friendly draw against Belgiumin March 2024. He has never let England down. He intends to be the foundation stone for glory.Explore more on these topicsEnglandJordan PickfordWorld Cup 2026World CupWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

England’s head coach said potential is not enough and made clear that the challenge for the 27-year-old, who has 18 goals in 64 international appearances, is to become more consistent.“That is the headline for him,” Tuchel said.“To keep on pushing himself to the limit. The limit for him is very, very high. Maybe higher than for others. He has the potential, but potential is a dangerous word with high-level sports.Marcus Rashford must stave off sense of anticlimax after Barcelona switch | Jonathan WilsonRead more“You have to reach your personal best on a regular basis.

The quality I see in training, the finishing with both legs and with the head. He is explosive, he is fast, he is strong in the air so where are the limits? There are no limits, but the numbers don’t reach the potential. He needs to push himself into goal involvements. That means goals and assists. He knows that from me.”Rashford has struggled to impress forEnglandon a regular basis and was left out of the Euro 2024 squad by Gareth Southgate.

He has scored three goals for Barca sincejoining the La Liga champions on loanthis summer.“He is still on that,” Tuchel said. “He still has to make these decisions. He is in that moment, he is young enough to take the right decisions and not let go. Otherwise, he will be disappointed in 10 years at what could have been and what he made of it.”Rashford, who has scored once in five games for Tuchel, enjoyed a revival during a loan spell at Aston Villa last season. “That was quite a bold move because to go in a working team, and a team that was well settled and played a hard-working style, that was a very, very good move for him and he settled in very quickly,” Tuchel said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Pressed on whether he would be prepared to entrust the Real Madrid player with a similar role if he returns to the squad, Tuchel said: “I guess so.”England will qualify for the World Cup if they beat Latvia.

That alone ensures the 32-year-old’s Lionesses career will leave an indelible mark on English football. Her entry on to the list of England greats had been guaranteed a year earlier, though, as one of the key heroines of the summer of 2022.When Leah Williamson prepared to raise the Euro 2022 trophy at Wembley after England’s victory against Germany had secured the Lionesses’ first major trophy, she chose to angle it slightly into the direction of the woman next to her, Bright, her vice-captain, so they could lift it together, acknowledging Bright’s major contribution. As the pair held aloft the 60cm-high trophy, weighing 6.7kg, Bright’s tattooed forearm was centre stage in front of the white fireworks erupting behind them in a colourful scene of euphoria.WSL talking points: Arsenal face dilemma and Blindkilde Brown gives Wiegman nudgeRead moreWhen Bright wore the armband a year later in Sydney, in the absence of the injured Williamson, her team were not quite able to add another trophy, but their run to the final was historic nonetheless, in a tournament Bright had done well simply to get to, weeks after knee surgery.Bright is a player who prefers to do her talking on the pitch. Members of the media covering the Lionesses have not had much insight into her personality, perhaps best shown in July 2023 at a press conference in Brisbane, when Bright was preparing to captain England in their tournament opener against Haiti.ESPN’s Tom Hamilton asked Bright how it felt to be captaining England at a World Cup; those listening perhaps expected a patriotic or emotional answer, and Bright, focused on the task, said plainly: “Things just stay the same. With or without the armband, my behaviour is the same, my mentality is the same.”View image in fullscreenMillie Bright captained England on their run to the 2023 World Cup final.Photograph: Rick Rycroft/APThat summer it was also usually others such as Lucy Bronze who spoke publicly about issues such as the team’s dispute with the Football Association over commercial deals. Bright’s captaincy was more about crunching tackles and bruising physical duels, which she usually won.Before all that, she was a key figure in the generation of England players that transformed how the Lionesses viewed success, being part of squads that reached the semi-finals at Euro 2017 and at the 2019 World Cup as they built towards glory. It is the lifting of a much smaller trophy, though, that perhaps Lionesses fans will most fondly remember when they think back on Bright’s career, after she became something of a cult hero when thrust up front by Sarina Wiegman for an Arnold Clark Cup game against Germany at Molineux in February 2022.Wiegman’s surprise tactic workedas the defender struck late, with all the composure of a classic centre-forward. The Lionesses recorded a first home-soil victory over Germany and Bright – much to the amusement of fans – collected the golden boot, graciously passed to her by Alexia Putellas after they had tied with two goals each.Bright scored six times across 88 caps. For long spells it had felt certain she would reach a century. Could she have? Bright opted towithdraw from selectionfor last summer’s Euros, where England successfully defended their trophy, saying it was “the right thing for my health and my future” because she felt she could not give 100% mentally or physically. She underwent a knee operation and analysed much of the European Championship on a podcast with her best mate, the former England player Rachel Daly.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Bright later said she was “at peace” with the decision. The main beneficiaries of this retirement could be Chelsea, for whom she continues to play a key role. She will now be able to rest somewhat during international breaks and perhaps extend her career. A Chelsea player since 2014, she has been involved in every major trophy their women’s team have won.As for England, Bright’s experience is something any international setup would miss, but the time may well be right for younger blood to get a chance and, as attention starts to turn towards 2027, perhaps this is an ideal moment for Bright to pass the torch. It feels pretty unlikely – albeit not impossible – that Bright would have been in England’s starting side for the 2027 World Cup in Brazil; the final of that competition will be less than a month before her 35th birthday.The future looks – ahem – bright, when it comes to centre-backs in contention for England, whether it be the Manchester United captain, Maya Le Tissier, 23, the emerging Arsenal centre-back Katie Reid, 19, who has impressed so much in the early stages of this season, or Bright’s Chelsea teammate Brooke Aspin, 20, who is recovering from a knee injury. Esme Morgan, 24, has 16 caps, and the 26-year-old Lotte Wubben-Moy still has plenty to offer, and that’s without mentioning the centre-backs who won this year’s European Championship, Leah Williamson and Jess Carter, along with the Manchester City captain, Alex Greenwood. It is not certainly not a problem position for Wiegman who, fitness permitting, appears spoilt for choice.Explore more on these topicsMillie BrightEngland women's football teamWomen’s Euro 2025Women's World Cup 2023Women's World CupWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I pursued and it fell through when word came out that there were investigations going on, so that was difficult. I had to just accept the fate and that this whole process is bigger than me.”Burrell, who played as a centre, leftNewcastleat the end of the 2021‑22 season, after which he made his ­experiences public.An investigation by theRugby Football Unionfound that “on the balance of probability” ­Burrell’s claims were likely true, but it could not definitively prove that most of the abuse happened at Newcastle.The club later said that the only proven incidents during his time there, which involved racist messages in a players’ WhatsApp group and incidents on an away day and a night out, were “gravely concerning” and “incredibly disappointing”, but that they were unable to take disciplinary action against ­individuals due to “no further actionable ­evidence” such as names or dates being provided.Burrell said much of the racism he experienced was “something that’s dressed up as banter” and that he had also experienced “several traumatic experiences” while playing for England, for whom he made 15 appearances between 2014 and 2016. Burrell also said there were “undertones of discrimination” throughout English rugby.Explore more on these topicsRugby unionRaceNewcastleEngland rugby union teamRugby Football UnionnewsShareReuse this content"

After the centre-back said she would not be a part of England’s European title defence in Switzerland, she underwent surgery on a knee injury.Bright’s announcement has come on the eve of Sarina Wiegman naming her squad for England’s friendlies against Brazil and Australia this month. Bright said it was the right time because it was “important to make these big decisions when you’ve got a clear mind”. She described the summer as “probably the hardest moment of my life”.Speaking onThe Rest is Football: Daly Brightness podcast, which she co-hosts with her friend and former England teammate Rachel Daly, the Chelsea centre-back said: “I’ve been weighing this up for a long time. It’s one of those decisions no one can make for you. It’s a feeling and I’m at peace with it. Having the summer to reflect, fix my knee, and get my head straight really put things into perspective. As you get older, your priorities change. I’ve been craving family time, time with friends, and time for myself.”Bright played every game asEngland won the Euroson home soil in 2022 and captained the side to the2023 World Cup finalin Australia, with Leah Williamson absent through injury. The 32-year-old has played 88 times for the Lionesses, scoring six goals.View image in fullscreenMillie Bright (left) and Rachel Daly with the Euros trophy after England’s win in 2022.Photograph: Lynne Cameron/The FA/Getty ImagesWiegman paid tribute to Bright, saying: “Millie will for ever be an England legend for what she has given to her country, and I could never have enough words to praise her impact during my time. Whether she had the armband or not, she is a true leader.“I know how much respect there is for Millie within the game – not just because she has won so many trophies but because of the way she conducts herself. She has made such a big contribution to English football both on and off the pitch and we all have a lot to thank her for. Even though her playing time with the Lionesses may be over, I know she has so much more to give the game.”Bright said a contributing factor was that as she watched England battle to a second European title there “wasn’t one part of me that thought I’d made the wrong decision”.“It felt right,” she said of retiring from England duty. “Physically, I’m at that crossroads – can I be 50% for each, for England and for Chelsea? I want to be all in. To give myself the best chance of doing that and be the best for my club, I probably need to rein it in a little bit. I’m really proud of my England career and just want to say a massive thank you to everyone for your support, especially over the summer. It’s never an easy decision, but it feels like the right one.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Not just someone who was there, but someone who grabbed every opportunity with both hands and wanted to make change.”She added: “I want to be remembered for what I did on the pitch too, someone who’d do anything for anyone, who was reliable, and who gave everything, heart and soul, every single game. But ultimately, I want to be remembered as a true Lioness, someone who represented her country in the right way.”Explore more on these topicsMillie BrightEngland women's football teamChelsea WomenWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

Some, including the rugby league and cricket events, involve working with international co-hosts.The symposium on Tuesday includes a keynote address from former New Zealand cricketer Lou Vincent, who was banned in 2014 for match-fixing. Victoria police assistant commissioner Cindy Millen said Australian competitions remain a focus of both domestic and international match-fixing syndicates.“Investigations into this type of criminality require law enforcement agencies both across the country and internationally to respond with a coordinated approach, incorporating all our partners,” she said, adding the focus remains on “mitigating the risk of infiltration by organised crime”.Explore more on these topicsAustralia sportGamblingWomen's Asian Cup 2026newsShareReuse this content"

Gabon’s 4-3 win over the Gambia meansIvory Coasthave to defeat Kenya at home despite thrashing Seychelles 7-0. In Group C, three teams –Benin, South AfricaandNigeria– can still claim top spot in Tuesday’s finale.EgyptMohamed Salah scored twice as Hossam Hassan’s side beat Djibouti 3-0 on Wednesday in Casablanca and made up formissing out on Qatar 2022by reaching the finals with a game in hand. This will be Egypt’s fourth finals, even though they have yet to win a game. Bizarrely, the Pharaohs did qualify for the first World Cup, in 1930, but missed their boat from Marseille to South Americaafter a storm delayed them.MoroccoThe undisputed neutrals’ favourites at the last finals became the first African nation to reach the 2026 showpiece with a 5-0 thumping of Niger on 5 September in Rabat. The Qatar 2022 semi-finalists qualified from Group E with two games to spare after Tanzania’s 1-1 draw in Congo-Brazzaville. The Atlas Lions have reached the finals six times and willco-host the 2030 editionalongside Portugal and Spain (the three opening matches will be played in Uruguay, Argentina and Paraguay).TunisiaLikewise, the Carthage Eagles qualified with two games to spare in Group H. Mohamed Ben Romdhane’s last-gasp winner and the defiance of the goalkeeper, Aymen Dahmen, in Malabo against Equatorial Guinea ensured Tunisia reached the finals for a seventh time, although they have yet to progress beyond the group stage.AlgeriaVladimir Petkovic’s side secured their place with a comfortable 3-0 win over Somalia on Thursday. Mohamed Amoura scored twice, taking the Wolfsburg striker’s tally in the qualifying campaign to eight, and the captain, Riyad Mahrez, added another. Victory put them four points clear of second-placed Uganda in Group G with one round of matches remaining. It will be Algeria’s fifthWorld Cupfinals appearance but first since Brazil in 2014.GhanaMohamed Kudus got the winner at home to Comoros as Ghana celebrated qualification on Sunday. In the end, the Black Stars’ result was academic as their nearest rivals, Madagascar, lost 4-1 in Mali. Ghana have now reached five of the last six World Cup finals but their manager, Otto Addo, has played down expectations, claiming the current crop of players are “nowhere close” to the team that reached the 2010 quarter-finals.Cape VerdeThe Blue Sharks will make their World Cup debut at the 2026 finals after topping Group D with a 3-0 home win over Eswatini, leaving Cameroon to wait on a playoff place.

Connor Metcalfe’s first goal for his country just before half-time restored parity, before Mitch Duke’s header from Martin Boyle’s free-kick three minutes into the second half completed the Socceroos’ revival. After failing to beat Bahrain and Indonesia, Australia ended their campaign with wins over Japan and the Saudis to qualify automatically, their sixth World Cup in a row.View image in fullscreenAustralia’s Mitch Duke heads the winner against Saudi Arabia in Jeddah.Photograph: Robert Cianflone/Getty ImagesIranThere was no little drama as Team Melli twice came from behind to draw 2-2 with their Group A rivals Uzbekistan on 25 March thanks to a double from Mehdi Taremi. Iran first reached the finals in 1978 but in six tournaments have yet to venture beyond the group stage. Their finest hour thus far came against the USA in Lyon at the 1998 finals, a 2-1 victory sparking delirium in the streets of Tehran. They met again in Qatar, the group match ending 1-0 in the Americans’ favour after a goal from Christian Pulisic in the 38th minute.JapanThe Samurai Blue cruised through their qualifying campaign, sealing their ticket with three group games to spare. Japan became the first nation to book their place through qualifiers by beating Bahrain 2-0 in Saitama after Daichi Kamada and Takefusa Kubo scored in the second half. They will compete in their eighth successive World Cup. In Qatar, Hajime Moriyasu’s side reached the last 16 only to lose to Croatia on penalties.JordanAli Olwan’s hat-trick triggered jubilation in Jordan as the 2023 Asian Cup runners-up qualified for their first World Cup finals on 5 June after beating Oman 3-0 in Muscat as South Korea beat Iraq 2-0. Jordan’s ruler, King Abdullah II, was pictured wearing a national team jersey as he watched the game from the Jordan embassy in London, where he was on a visit.South KoreaKorea reached their 11th consecutive finals with victory over 10-man Iraq at Basra Stadium on 5 June for what is expected to be Son Heung-min’s swansong. The Tottenham great and Taegeuk Warriors captain will turn 34 during the finals and has said it will be his last tournament. Korea’s formidable qualifying record is bettered only by Brazil, Germany, Italy, Argentina and Spain, although their underwhelming exit at the 2023 Asian Cup led to Jürgen Klinsmann being replaced by Hong Myung-bo, who oversaw victories against Oman, Jordan, Iraq and Kuwait in qualifying.UzbekistanWelcome, the White Wolves, who finally reached a World Cup finalssome 2,800 miles from home with a drab 0-0 draw with the United Arab Emirates in Abu Dhabi. The Uzbeks are finally making an impact at senior international level, having reached the quarter-finals of the Under-17 World Cup, last 16 of the global Under-20 tournament and the Paris Olympics. In Abdukodir Khusanov, who made his (albeit shaky) Manchester City debut aged just 20, and the 22-year-old winger Abbosbek Fayzullaev, Timur Kapadze has two burgeoning talents at his disposal.See the full AFC standingshere.EuropeA total of 54 nations (Russia are suspended) are slugging it out for a place at next year’s finals.

New Zealand reached the World Cup for the first time in 16 years by beating New Caledonia 3-0 at Auckland’s Eden Park, the fortress of their 15-player code cousins the All Blacks. The win didn’t come easy, however. Goalless in the first half, Darren Bazeley’s side lost their captain, Chris Wood, to a hip injury early in the second. Only after an hour did Michael Boxall end the stalemate, scoring his first international goal aged 36. Kosta Barbarouses doubled New Zealand’s lead shortly after, before Eli Just wrapped up the result in the 80th minute.See the full OFC standingshere.South AmericaThe six direct spots have all been all filled.Boliviasecured the confederation’s playoff place with a surprise 1-0 win over Brazil in El Alto.ArgentinaThe holders claimed their spot on 25 March when Bolivia drew 0-0 with Uruguay. The big question hovering over Lionel Scaloni’s world champions is whether Lionel Messi will play at the finals. The Inter Miami forward has remained coy about his intentions. “Well, it’s like I’ve said before. I don’t think I’ll play the next World Cup – not because of age, but the most logical thing is that I won’t,” said Messi after helping Argentina beat Venezuela 3-0 last month. The evergreen 38-year-old then backtracked slightly, adding: “It’s about taking it one day at a time, trying to feel good, and above all being honest with myself. When I feel good, I enjoy it. When I don’t, honestly, I suffer, and I’d rather not be there. So we’ll see.”View image in fullscreenLionel Messi celebrates his second goal in the 3-0 win against Venezuela last month.Photograph: Luis Robayo/AFP/Getty ImagesEcuadorLa Trireached the finals – for the fifth time this century – on 10 June, a goalless draw against Peru in Lima enough to assure Ecuador’s place with two matches to spare. Ecuador, who finished second in the standings, beat the team who finished top, Argentina, 1-0 in Guayaquil in a match that ended with both sides reduced to 10 players by red cards. Argentina’s Nicolás Otamendi was sent off in the 31st minute and the hosts capitalised on their numerical advantage when Enner Valencia scored a penalty in first-half stoppage time. Ecuador were also reduced to 10 men when the Chelsea midfielder Moisés Caicedo was dismissed in the 50th minute.ColombiaColombia are a colourful feature of any finals and, after missing out on Qatar 2022, are back after James Rodríguez led his side to a 3-0 defeat of Bolivia on 4 September, Néstor Lorenzo’s side reaching the 2026 tournament with a game to spare.La Tricolorprogressed to the quarter-finals in 2014 and in Luis Díaz boast one of the game’s most compelling talents. The winger scored 30 goals in his last two seasons at Liverpool, helping them win the Premier League, and has been in scintillating form since a summer move to Bayern Munich. One to watch: Benfica’s record signing, Richard Ríos. The 25-year-old has made a dazzling start to life at the Estádio da Luz after his move from Palmeiras.UruguayMarcelo Bielsa, once the toast of Elland Road, guidedLa Celesteto their fifth successive World Cup with an impressive 3-0 victory against Peru at the Estadio Centenario on 4 September. In a mixed campaign Uruguay still managed to beat Brazil in Montevideo and surprise Argentina in Buenos Aires. The 70-year-old former Leeds manager is set for a third World Cup as a head coach. In 2002,El Loco’s Argentina side crashed out in the group stage but he led Chile to South Africa 2010 where they were beaten in the last 16 by Brazil. Bielsa has talent at his disposal, too. Edinson Cavani and Luis Suárez may have gone, but the Real Madrid midfielder Federico Valverde brings the fire. His club manager, Xabi Alonso, has compared him with a peak Steven Gerrard, saying: “Every manager would like a Valverde on the team.”BrazilCarlo Ancelotti’s side extended Brazil’s record as the only team to play at every World Cup by beating Paraguay 1-0 on 10 June to finish fifth in the standings, their lowest qualifying position. The five-time winners will make their 23rd appearance in next year’s tournament but, with limited preparation time after arriving in May from Real Madrid, the Italian coach is relying on team spirit and individual talent. “I think more tactical work is needed to refine game strategy. All of this can be very important, but the most important part is not the strategy, it is the attitude of the players on the pitch. For that, it doesn’t take much time to prepare,” says Ancelotti.ParaguayFor the first time since 2010 Paraguay will participate in the World Cup after a tricky 0-0 draw at home against Ecuador on 4 September. Gustavo Alfaro’s side impressed by holding off their opponents to snare the crucial point they needed. Miguel Almirón, who left Newcastle in January, and the former Brighton midfielder Julio Enciso, now at Strasbourg, are two players familiar to Premier League adherents. Almirón was 16 years old in 2010 and the Atlanta United captain still recalls watching Paraguay’s first match – a 1-1 draw with Italy in Cape Town – with his friends at his home in the San Pablo neighbourhood of Asunción. “That fills you with pride, to see your country in this huge competition,” Almirón said. “You always dream of that.”See the full Conmebol standingshere.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026World Cup 2026 qualifiersWorld CupUS sportsexplainersShareReuse this content"

TikTok has more than 30 million UK users.“These safety-critical workers are the frontline of protecting users and communities from deepfakes, toxicity and abuse,” the letter said.It also claims that TikTok is looking to replace the moderators with artificial intelligence-driven systems and with workers in countries such as Kenya and the Philippines.8:21How TikTok harms boys and girls differently – videoThe signatories also accuse Chinese-owned TikTok of union-busting by announcing the job cuts eight days before workers were due to vote on union recognition with the CWU’s tech branch.“There is no proper business case for making these redundancies. TikTok’s revenues are booming –with a 40% increasefor the UK and Europe alone,” the letter said. “Yet the company has decided to cut corners. We believe this decision is an act of union-busting – at the cost of workers’ rights, user safety and the integrity of online information.”The letter is also signed by Ian Russell, the father of Molly Russell, a British teenager who took her own life after viewing harmful content online, the Meta whistleblower Arturo Bejar and Sonia Livingstone, a professor of social psychology at the London School of Economics.It asks the committee to examine the implications of the redundancies for online safety and workers’ rights and what legislative steps can be taken to prevent offshoring of content moderation or replacing human moderators with AI.Asked to comment on the letter, Onwurah said the jobs cut plans indicated that TikTok’s commitment to content moderation was under review, which “given the clear role that the recommendation algorithms used by TikTok and other platforms play in exposing users to large volumes of harmful and misleading content is a matter of significant concern”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

How does this announcement align with that commitment?”A TikTok spokesperson said: “We strongly reject these claims. We are continuing a reorganisation that we started last year to strengthen our global operating model for Trust and Safety, including concentrating our operations in fewer locations globally, ensuring we maximise effectiveness and speed as we evolve this critical function for the company with the benefit of technological advancements.”According to TikTok, the company has been engaging with the CWU voluntarily and has offered to continue discussions with the union once the current redundancy consultation has concluded.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

He also said innovation in green industries, and blocking the rise of giant tech monopolies would be vital to stronger growth in future.“I’m not welcoming the protectionist wave in the US, and that’s not good for world growth and innovation,” he said.Speaking as he accepted the prize, he said AI had “fantastic growth potential” but called on governments to develop strict competition policies to manage the growth of new tech companies. “Some superstar firms may end up dominating everything and inhibiting potential entry of new innovators. So how can we make sure that today’s innovators will not stifle future entry and innovation?”The prize committee said technological developments had helped to power sustained economic growth over the past two centuries, but warned that future gains could not be taken for granted.Mokyr, a Dutch-born American-Israeli economic historian, won the prize for his research identifying the prerequisites for sustained growth through technological progress. Aghion and Howitt, a Canadian economist, shared the award for their analysis of how “creative destruction” is key for driving growth.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So the industry needs to be more careful because it’s not going to stop there.“AI companies need to know that we will be putting in these subject access requests en masse. They have a statutory obligation to respond. If an individual member reasonably believes that their data is being used without their consent, we want to find out.”Fleming said he hoped the tactic would push tech companies and producers resistant to being transparent about the sources of their AI content to strike an agreement on performers’ rights.“What we’re trying to do is use people’s individual rights to make it so hard for tech companies and producers to not enter into collective rights,” said Fleming.As the union has 50,000 members, significant numbers of them making subject access requests would create a “hassle” for firms unwilling to negotiate, he added.Under data protection law, individuals have the right to ask for all the information an organisation holds about them. Organisations normally have one month to reply to a subject access request.“It’s not a silver bullet,” Fleming added. “It’s not easy to do because they may well have got data from somewhere else. A lot of people are behaving very recklessly and immorally.”Monroe said she believed that Norwood had copied both her image and her mannerisms.Monroe said: “I move my head quite a lot when I’m acting. I noticed in the last few seconds of Tilly’s show reel, that is exactly what she did. Other people have also said, ‘Those are your mannerisms. That’s how you act.’”Liam Budd, industrial official for recorded media at Equity UK, said the union was taking Monroe’s concerns seriously. The AI production company Particle6, which launched Xicoia earlier this month, confirmed it was working with the union “to address any concerns”.A spokesperson for Particle6 added: “Briony Monroe’s likeness, image, voice or personal data have not been used in any way to create Tilly Norwood.“Tilly was developed entirely from scratch using original creative design. We do not and will not use any performer’s likeness without explicit consent and fair compensation.”Although he would not comment on Monroe’s complaint, Budd said: “We’ve had increasing numbers of members getting in touch about specific infringements where they believe that their image or voice has been used without their consent to then create an output which can identify them or resembles them in some way.“It’s been a lot more common in the audio space because the technology is much easier. You don’t need many recordings to create a digital replica of a voice.”But Norwood represented a new challenge for the industry, said Budd, because “we haven’t really seen the launch of a wholly synthetic actor” before.Equity UK has been in negotiations with the UK production trade body Pact (Producers Alliance for Cinema and Television) about AI, copyright and data protection for more than a year.Fleming said: “The bosses are not asking questions about where this data has come from. Privately, they will admit that it is impossible to ethically use AI because it has been scraped and trained on data where the provenance is at best unclear.“But nine times out of 10, we know it’s been used completely outside of the existing copyright and data protection framework.”Max Rumney, the deputy chief executive of Pact, said its members needed to use AI technology in production or they would be at a commercial disadvantage to those firms with no collective agreements with unions, who did not remunerate actors, writers and other creatives.But he added that there was no transparency from tech companies on what content or data had been used to train foundation models, the technology that underpins AI tools such as image generators.“The foundational models have been trained without permission on the films and programmes of our members,” said Rumney.“Our members want human creative expression in their films and programmes. They value this and consider that this is what makes UK productions so compelling and innovative.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Tilly Norwood (AI character)Trade unionsnewsShareReuse this content"

But two decades on, not every UK graphene company has made the most of that potential. Some show promise but others are struggling.Extracted from graphite, commonly used in pencils, graphene is a latticed sheet of carbon one atom thick, and is highly effective at conducting heat and electricity. China is the world’s biggest producer, using it to try to get ahead in theglobal race to produce microchipsand in sectors such as construction.In the UK, a graphene-enhanced, low-carbon concrete was laid at a Northumbrian Water site in July, developed by the Graphene Engineering Innovation Centre (GEIC) at the University of Manchester and Cemex UK.“The material when it came out of academia was hyped to death … but the challenge is going from lab to fab,” says Ben Jensen, the chief executive of 2D Photonics, a startup spun out from the University of Cambridge that makes graphene-based photonic technology for datacentres.Jensen alsoinvented Vantablackcoatings, made of carbon nanotubes – rolled-up sheets of graphene – and known as the world’s “blackest black” because it absorbs 99.96% of light, at the UK company Surrey NanoSystems that he founded in 2007. The material’s artistic rights weresold exclusively to the sculptor Anish Kapoor, and BMW used it on its X6 coupe to create the “blackest black car” six years ago.View image in fullscreenAn untitled Vantablack work by Anish Kapoor on display in Venice in 2022.Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian“This is the challenge when you have new materials trying to displace an incumbent technology,” Jensen says. “The value proposition must be extremely good, but there also must be a way to manufacture the material and manufacture it at scale for the application … then you have to meet price expectations because there’s no point in delivering something that’s costing 10 times more than the incumbent.”Germany’sBayer tried to producecarbon nanotube products in bulk but shut down its pilot factory more than a decade ago after the expected surge in demand failed to materialise. The material is now mainly used as a filler to strengthen plastic products. The company described the potential applications of nanotubes as “fragmented”.More promising are the graphene-based optical microchips developed by 2D Photonics’ subsidiary CamGraPhIC, which are based on research done at the University of Cambridge and Italy’s CNIT research institute.At the moment, silicon-photonics microchips convert electrical data into optical data to transmit it through fibre-optic cables, but the firm says its graphene chips deliver more data in the same period of time and at far lower cost.Single graphene crystals.Photograph: 2D PhotonicsThey consume 80% less energy and can operate in a much wider range of temperatures, reducing the need for costlywater- and energy-hungry cooling systemsfor AI datacentres.Sending data via silicon also causes delays. Jensen compares it to a 16-lane motorway that suddenly narrows to a single lane because of roadworks, forcing everything to slow down. Graphene photonics, he says, are like a motorway with hundreds of lanes.“What we’ve solved is the ability to grow consistent ultra high-performance graphene and to build it into a device,” he says. “And don’t forget, this is a material that’s one atom thick. It’s insanely difficult to do this.”View image in fullscreenBen Jensen, the chief executive of 2D Photonics.Photograph: Ermanno FissoreCamGraPhIC was founded in 2018 by the Cambridge nanotechnology professor Andrea Ferrari, who also runs the Cambridge graphene centre, and Marco Romagnoli, who leads advanced photonics at CNIT in Pisa and is the startup’s chief scientific officer.Its parent, 2D Photonics, has just securedfunding of £25mfrom backers including Italy’s sovereign wealth fund, Nato and Sony innovation funds, Bosch Ventures and the UK’s Frontier IP Group, and uses a former Pirelli photonics research site in Pisa. It plans to create a pilot manufacturing site in the Milan area to produce 200mm-wide wafers at scale, and is confident of obtaining the necessary funding of €317m (£276m) by the end of the year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It produces graphene-based electronic devices, including sensors for electric cars, and biosensors for the early detection of disease and other uses in healthcare and agriculture. It recentlysecured $55m(£41m) from investors including the United Arab Emirates sovereign wealth fund, which took a 12.8% stake in Paragraf.A more recent startup, Graphene Innovations Manchester, launched in 2021 by Vivek Koncherry, struck a deal with Saudi Arabia last December for the world’s first commercial production of graphene-enriched carbon fibre, used in construction for roofs and facades, as well as street light poles. It has started making it in Tabuk with a local partner, and says it is on track to produce 3,000 tonnes by 2026.View image in fullscreenThe 2D Photonics cleanroom at its development facility in Pisa.Photograph: 2D PhotonicsOther businesses, however, have found the going tougher. One of the sector’s first companies was Applied Graphene Materials, founded by Prof Karl Coleman in 2010 andspun out from Durham University. It launched a number of products including an anti-corrosion primer and a protective bike-detailing spray, which made it on to the shelves in Halfords. But the loss-making enterprise was wound down in 2023 and Canada’s Universal Matter acquired its main business.Ron Mertens, the owner of the website Graphene-Info, says: “As is true in the wider materials industry, things take a very long time to reach the market. Many graphene producers and developers never managed to generate meaningful revenues or become profitable.”The Gloucestershire-based Versariengrew from a garage startupin 2010. Supported by Innovate UK, a government agency, it has developed graphene powders and other products for use in sensors, low-carbon concrete, paints, inks for electronics and textiles such asUmbro running gearand prototype stealth materials for the US military.The Aim-listed company expanded into Spain and South Korea but ran into financial difficulties and was forced to place several subsidiaries in administration or voluntary liquidation in July. Versarien has been seeking to sell its assets, including its patent portfolio, and only has enough cash to keep going until the end of October.Depending on the deal, it may undertake a solvent liquidation of the company or become a cash shell. An investment deal with a Chinese partnercollapsedafter the UK government intervened to block any collaboration on technology. It would be a sad end for a once promising graphene business.Explore more on these topicsBusinessManufacturing sectorMaterials scienceChemistryTechnology startupsnewsShareReuse this content"

AI is also being developed to help manage hospitals, from optimising bed capacity to tackling supply chains.But while experts say the technology could bring myriad benefits for healthcare, they say there is also cause for concern, from a lack of testing of the effectiveness of AI tools to questions over who is responsible should a patient have a negative outcome.Prof Derek Angus, of the University of Pittsburgh, said: “There’s definitely going to be instances where there’s the perception that something went wrong and people will look around to blame someone.”The Jama summit on Artificial Intelligence, hosted last year by the Journal of the American Medical Association, brought together a panoply of experts including clinicians, technology companies, regulatory bodies, insurers, ethicists, lawyers and economists.Theresulting report, of which Angus is first author, not only looks at the nature of AI tools and the areas of healthcare where they are being used, but also examines the challenges they present, including legal concerns.Prof Glenn Cohen from Harvard law school, a co-author of the report, said patients could face difficulties showing fault in the use or design of an artificial intelligence product. There could be barriers to gaining information about its inner workings, while it could also be challenging to propose a reasonable alternative design for the product or prove a poor outcome was caused by the AI system.He said: “The interplay between the parties may also present challenges for bringing a lawsuit – they may point to one another as the party at fault, and they may have existing agreement contractually reallocating liability or have indemnification lawsuits.”Prof Michelle Mello, another author of the report, from Stanford law school, said courts were well equipped to resolve legal issues. “The problem is that it takes time and will involve inconsistencies in the early days, and this uncertainty elevates costs for everyone in the AI innovation and adoption ecosystem,” she said.The report also raises concerns about how AI tools are evaluated, noting many are outside the oversight of regulators such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).Angus said: “For clinicians, effectiveness usually means improved health outcomes, but there’s no guarantee that the regulatory authority will require proof [of that]. Then once it’s out, AI tools can be deployed in so many unpredictable ways in different clinical settings, with different kinds of patients, by users who are of different levels of skills. There is very little guarantee that what seems to be a good idea in the pre-approval package is actually what you get in practice.”The report outlines that at present there are many barriers to evaluating AI tools including that they often need to be in clinical use to be fully assessed, while current approaches to assessment are expensive and cumbersome.Angus said it was important that funding was made available for the performance of AI tools in healthcare to be properly assessed, with investment in digital infrastructure a key area. “One of the things that came up during the summit was [that] the tools that are best evaluated have been least adopted. The tools that are most adopted have been least evaluated.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)HealthMedical researchnewsShareReuse this content"

Fighter jets scorch over head, tanks rumble by, the side of a building is obliterated by a rocket-propelled grenade. While Call of Duty has always focused its online matches on close skirmishes, Battlefield 6 makes you feel part of a vast military offensive, bewildering and ear-shattering, with even the quiet moments punctuated by the pop-pop of distance rifle fire, the shouts of orders and the cries for medics.It’s well known that EA’s long-running first-person shooter series has hit trouble over the last couple of years, with futuristic instalmentBattlefield 2042widely considered a disappointment. So this time round, the development team (a collective of studios including original creator DICE) has gone back to the excellent Battlefield 4 for inspiration, where the emphasis was on authentic-feeling modern military warfare on large maps with lots of players. As ever, Battlefield 6 gives you the choice of four classes – Assault, Support, Engineer and Recon – each with its own weapons and gadgets, all of which can be upgraded and customised as you level up your soldier and gain experience. It’s a hybrid system taking elements of older Battlefields as well as newer Call of Duty titles, where the Gunsmith system revolutionised weapon personalisation for first-person online shooters.View image in fullscreenBrooklyn at war … Battlefield 6.Photograph: Electronic ArtsThe best online modes are the big ones, such as Conquest and Breakthrough, which focus on taking swathes of territory from the other team by holding down objective points. There are small and mid-sized modes, too, including King of the Hill and Domination, but to Battlefield veterans they feel like gestures to a different school of thought. From the very beginning – 2002’s seminal Battlefield 1942 – this series has encouraged tactical, thoughtful play, gathering a few comrades and sneaking up on enemy bases, timing attacks with helicopter support, wearing down defences. In a good session there maybe several minutes where you are hiking across the map, or crawling towards a well-defended building. The meat-grinder feel of Call of Duty, with its turbo-charged pace and five-second shootouts, feels a long way away.Yet, when you’re caught in a battle in this game, it is exhilarating. Whether you’re on the streets of Brooklyn or the sands of Cairo, chunks of exploded masonry fly by, bullets strafe metal, tanks explode in fiery billows of flame and smoke. The visuals and sound design are astonishingly good, capturing the grainy, shaky-cam faux-documentary style of Generation Kill or Warfare, rather than the choreographed action movie carnage of CoD. If you’re lucky enough to get on a good team (and I really recommend playing with at least one or two friends), a real sense of underfire camaraderie develops.The weak point is the game’s superfluous Campaign mode, a hackneyed techno thriller set in the near future where a private military company is aiming to take control of the world, and only a hardy team of American-controlled spec-ops warriors can stop them. It’s a tired setup – and something of a cop out. By making the baddie a fictitious military corporation, the developers can pretend the story is meaningful and relevant without having to, God forbid, make a political point or implicate a country that may well be a market for the game – or an investor in Electronic Arts. It’s also hard to maintain any interest in a group of Identi-Kit tough guys who constantly spout lines such as: “There ain’t no red tape out here,” and (while staking out an enemy base on sunny Gibraltar): “I don’t know what’s more impressive, the view or the firepower.” When lead character Murphy says to a comrade: “There ain’t nobody I’d rather be in this fight with,” I wished there was an option to defect.Don’t let that put you off. For the most part, Battlefield 6 is a brilliant return to form, a thrilling, almost operatic shooter experience, which manages to combine deafening combat with tactical subtlety. How it will fit into the modern landscape of hero shooters and battle royale blast-em-ups is anyone’s guess – it deserves a shot, that’s for sure.Battlefield 6 is out now, £65Explore more on these topicsGamesPlayStation 5Xbox series S/XPCShooting gamesMMORPGreviewsShareReuse this content"

But there is no guarantee that the ceasefire will end Palestinian sufferingMon 13 Oct 2025 13.46 EDTLast modified on Mon 13 Oct 2025 14.37 EDTShareThe reprieve brought by the end of fighting in Gaza is immense. In Israel, therelease of the living hostageshas led to widespread elation. In Gaza and the West Bank there are also celebrations, as up to 2,000 Palestinian detainees start to be released – though there is distress, too, due touncertainty about who is being freedand where they will be sent. In northern Gaza, people can finally return todig through rubblefor the remains of an estimated 10,000 missing people.As recently as three weeks ago, the likelihood of a ceasefireappeared remote. But it has taken effect, and on Monday Donald Trump travelled from Jerusalem, where he was cheered in the Knesset, to Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt. There, he joined ahigh-powered peace summitof more than 20 world leaders, including Sir Keir Starmer. The plan for peace begun there is due to be continued at a conference in the UK. The US president, acting with international partners, did make this deal happen – despite, not because of, Israel’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu.Hopes that the deal marks the first step toward Palestinian statehood are understandable – but, given historical precedent, somewhat optimistic. It offers no clear path to sovereignty for Palestinians and risks splitting, for the foreseeable future, Gaza from the West Bank. Then there is the utter devastation this war leaves behind. The lack of any timeline for Palestinian self-determination inMr Trump’s plangives the lie to vainglorious references, in his Knesset speech, to the “historic dawn” of a “golden age”.The US president could not help himself polarising and personalising the deal in his speech. In a moment of relief – with the hostage release, ceasefire and resumption of aid – he chose to recast it as a morality play in which he alone restored Israel’s honour after supposed betrayal by former US presidentsObama and Biden. This despite the Biden administrationa year agohaving attempted a similar deal: a ceasefire tied to humanitarian access and eventual political talks.A plan that denies one side meaningful agency cannot yield legitimate peace. The ceasefire and aid trucks are to be welcomed. But this is not yet political progress. Without mechanisms guaranteeing Palestinian participation and control over their own institutions, any deal risks freezing subjugation under the language of peace.Gaza’s people desperately need humanitarian aid– and food and medicinesmust be the first priority. But reconstruction cannot wait. Amid 60m tonnes of rubble, Palestinians need help restoring homes, schools, hospitals, mosques and other institutions shattered by Israel’s invasion. For Gaza’s transitional administration to succeed, funding must flow quickly and security gaps be filled. Like much of Mr Trump’s peace plan, references to an international stabilisation force and a proposed “board of peace”, withSir Tony Blair, are alarmingly vague.Strong international support for thePalestinian Authority, enabling it to take over from Hamas, is probably the most promising possibility. The enormous suffering of the past two years means the moral case for a resolution to the conflict is arguably more urgent than ever. But while the ceasefire, the return of the hostages and commitment by Hamas to “demilitarise” Gaza should be acknowledged as positive steps, Mr Trump’s record gives little reason to believe he will deliver – or feel bound to try. Short-term relief does not mean that the prospect of a Palestinian state has been brought closer.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Apart from people rushing to work or walking their dogs, the place seemed relatively deserted. Even some of the most popular coffee spots had more vacant seats than occupied ones. This day feels like a holy day – not because it actually is one (it’s Simchat Torah Eve) – but because of the return ofthe last 20 living hostagesfrom Hamas captivity. There was no need to ask where everyone was. Thousands had gathered in “hostages square” in Tel Aviv (formerly known as Museum Square – and who knows if that name will ever return). Others were glued to their television screens at home, as if it were the World Cup final. Thinking about it, the war’s final act trumps even that. Apparently, the sound of silence can be full of joy.Ever since the deal was struck and the war finally came to an end, it seemsIsraelhas been under the influence of the best drug imaginable. Strolling through the streets now, you see people smiling for no reason – or perhaps for the best reason of all. Even the serious faces worn by TV anchors have been replaced by cheerful ones. “Today is the day I smile,” said one correspondent gladly this morning, stating the obvious. But as the TV presenters and panellists persisted with the good news theme, you could not help but notice the other footage. As the buses and Red Cross vehicles drove through the Gaza Strip on their mission to bring the hostages back, the scene was one of destruction – ruins of cities where people once lived.The fight for the hostages and the calamity inGazaare two sides of the war’s coin. That will remain the case in the days to come. But as time goes on, more and more focus will probably shift to Gaza, its rehabilitation, and the truth that lies beneath all the rubble.Israeli hostages released: all living captives freed as Trump tells Knesset ‘age of terror’ is over – latest updatesRead moreThe curtain-raiser will come later today in the resort city of Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt, where theleaders’ summit on Gazawill convene. Perhaps this meeting, and those that will inevitably follow (given that the plan for “the day after” could hardly be resolved in a single day) will set a timeline for a new international governing body and security force to actually take control of the Gaza Strip. As if there were any doubt about the urgency of this, even by the weekend some news reports suggested that Hamas hadalready reasserted controlof Gaza as part of its own version of “law and order”.Only at noon today, almost in the final minute of stoppage time, did Egypt announce that Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, had also been invited to the summit. Given that Netanyahu had been reluctant to end the war ever since it began – no matter the cost – this decision seemed to be an attempt to tie him to the “day after” scenario for both Israel and Gaza. Unlike the first phase, which brought the hostages home, the second offers Israel no tangible gains. It’s all about Gaza’s rehabilitation. Considering that many Israelis viewed the end of the war as a price worth paying to bring the hostages back, one must wonder: will they seek a return to the battlefield once all Israelis are safely home? Netanyahu’s attendance in Sharm el-Sheikh, alongside Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian National Authority, should have provided an answer to that question. However, just an hour later – after the Israeli media celebrated his imminent attendance –his office statedthat he had to politely decline due to the proximity to the start of the holy day in Israel.View image in fullscreenUS president Donald Trump with Israel prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the Knesset, 13 October 2025.Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/APWhatever Netanyahu’s true reason may be, perhaps the bottom line remains: this summit, coordinated byDonald Trumpwith world leaders, is a way of signalling to Israel that Gaza is no longer under its sole authority. The war is over – as Trump keeps saying – and now others will take charge. Of course, any initiative in Gaza will still need to work closely with the Israeli government. But the question remains whether it will be a cooperative effort or a matter of direct orders – much like the way Trump compelled Israel to accept the deal to end the war.Speaking in the Israeli parliament today, Trump said: “Israel, with our help, has won all that they can by force of arms – you’ve won. Now it is time to translate these victories against terrorists on the battlefield into the ultimate prize of peace and prosperity for the entire Middle East.” This statement may come as no surprise, given his previous remarks declaring that “the war is over”. It also aligns withthe scheduled visitto Israel by the president of Indonesia tomorrow: Israel doesn’t have diplomatic relations with Indonesia, and the visit might suggest another “peace deal” is coming. But (not to spoil the celebrations), one must ask: where do the Palestinians fit into this vision? Is an independent state really just around the corner? Does that include the West Bank, and does it mean the end of all settlements? That seems a premature conclusion, to say the least. And if that is not forthcoming, is lasting peace really likely?But that is just one unresolved issue among many. Others were evident during the early celebrations on Saturday evening in Hostage Square, where, behind the displays of happiness and relief, deeper truths emerged. The most notable moment of the evening came when Trump’s envoy, Steve Witkoff, attempted to praise Netanyahu for his role in achieving the deal. The crowd – far more familiar with his failures – booed loudly. Not once, not twice. Every time his name was mentioned, the crowd jeered. The rhythmic chant, “Thank you, Trump” only emphasised whom Israelis view as their true saviour.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But even if that’s true for now, Trump – as he’s proven countless times before – is like a child who quickly tires of old toys. At some point, he will probably abandon the Middle East and redirect his attention elsewhere: the Russia-Ukraine conflict (after all, there’s still time to chase next year’s Nobel prize), his battle against immigration, or the war he’s declared on US democracy itself.

It will only drive people underground and normalize government control over the internetMon 13 Oct 2025 08.00 EDTShareLike the “war on drugs” or the “war on terror”, a “war on child abuse” has too often been used to justify authoritarian overreach. Governments across the world are expanding surveillance, weakening encryption, and curtailing freedoms under the guise of staunching the proliferation of sexual images and videos of children – but these measures don’t actually solve the problem.The EU wants to scan every message sent in Europe. Will that really make us safer?  | Apostolis FotiadisRead moreIn Europe, the latest proposal for a“chat control” regulationput forward by the Danish presidency would require every internet-connected device to include government spyware, as easy to activate as Alexa or Siri.It would scan not only for known child sexual abuse material (CSAM) but also, in practice, would flag artwork, fan fiction, family photos and chats, relying onunreliable AI classifiers– whichscientists warncan’t be implemented safely.In the UK,Apple faced legal actionearlier this year after refusing to build a secret government backdoor into its devices, while the secure chat app Signal has indicated it wouldrather exit from the UKthan comply with the government’s demand to weaken encryption. Globally, laws like the UK’sOnline Safety Act, Australia’sunder-16 social media ban, and an increasing number of USstate lawsare mandating age verification not just for porn sites, but also for platforms like Reddit and Discord. The result is the over-censorship of legal content as “harmful to minors”, or platforms like Blueskyshutting off service altogetherin certain states.These restrictions are driving users underground. Since these laws took effect,virtual private network (VPN) usage has soared, as has usage of the privacy-centric Tor browser, whichreached its highest level everthis year – nearly 20 million daily users, six times its long-term average. This surge is a warning sign. Tor was created by the US navy to counter authoritarian regimes when the “open Internet” was official US policy. Now, as western democracies restrict free communication online, they’re becoming the authoritarians Tor was designed to circumvent, while the Tor network becomes the new “open Internet”.Tor’s new popularity brings misguided calls to hobble itIn response to Tor’s growing popularity comeproposals to defund or backdoor the browserto curb its misuse for CSAM distribution. But Tor’s entire value lies in its resistance to government surveillance. Backdooring it would destroy its core function. With that said, a massive expansion of Tor’s user base is not a net win for children, as it will only expand the underground market for illegal content.The alternative is for governments to step back. Allow anonymous internet use of mainstream platforms instead of driving new users to Tor. Let platforms continue the voluntary scanning they already do for real CSAM,without expanding mandatesinto artwork, fiction or consensual adult content. Recognize that keeping children safe online is ultimately a parental responsibility, not a pretext for Big Brother surveillance.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On the contrary, prevention requires privacy. Survivors need confidential support services. Potential perpetrators need discreet help before they offend. Research shows about half of those seeking out CSAM on Tor are looking for help to stop – yetthree-quarters cannot access it. Meanwhile, while billions flow into surveillance tech, prevention and harm-reduction programs such as the UK’sSafer Living Foundationare losing funding and shutting down.We can also better help children by using enforcement resources more effectively. Authorities havedeprioritizedfighting in-person crimes for an expanding category of image offences. This has diverted child protection resources into arrests overfictionand artwork, ensnaringLGBTQ+ people and teenagersmore often than abusers. In research that myorganization is conducting, we have found that authorities don’t even distinguish between real abuse and fantasy material in statistics. Refocusing on actual abuse is the least that children deserve.By adopting a more balanced and rights-respecting approach, privacy tools such as Tor can remain as specialized instruments rather than becoming essential apps for ordinary internet users. Inevitably, there will still be some child abusers that misuse that freedom, and police can and should still pursue them, as theyalready do.Accepting that human rights set firm and legitimate boundaries on police power is not minimizing or normalizing abuse. The more governments push against this, the more they become the authoritarians thatTorwas set up to guard against, and the more essential such tools become.

But the policy has support across the USMon 13 Oct 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 13 Oct 2025 11.22 EDTShareFor four years, New Mexico has been on a distressing losing streak. The state hasconsistently ranked last in the nationfor child wellbeing, as determined by factors including household income, educational outcomes, and child mortality. And over the past decade, whenever New Mexico hasn’t placed 50th, it’s been 49th.But in its ongoing efforts to shake off that unenviable distinction, the state is poised to achieve a significant first. In September, governor Michelle Lujan Grisham – who made affordable childcare a centerpiece of her 2018 campaign – announced that New Mexicowill offer free universal childcare. No other state in the US currently provides this essential service.The program is projected to save families an average of $13,000 each year. That’s a windfall almost anywhere, but it’s a particularly life-changing sum in a state that has, by one measure, the highest child poverty rate in the nation. AndNew Mexicomay offer a model for other jurisdictions seeking to strengthen the social safety net, particularly as the Trump administration does its level best to shred it.New Mexico made childcare free. It lifted 120,000 people above the poverty lineRead moreChildcare for a single infant is nowmore expensive than public college tuition in 38 states, and each year, the price of daycarepushes 134,000 families below the poverty line. In New Mexico, childcare can cost overa third of the median single parent’s income. The resulting financial toll has nationwide consequences: according to one study, the inadequate childcare systemcosts the economy $122bn each year. Meanwhile, the personal toll disproportionately falls on mothers. Amid sky-high daycare prices and return-to-office policies, workforce participation among women with young childrenis declining, threatening their career development and future earnings.The market alone can do little to lower prices. Providing kids with well-trained, nurturing caregivers in a safe and engaging environment is labor-intensive, with teacher-child ratios as low as one-to-three recommended for the youngest charges. Plus, there’s limited room for cost-cutting in an industry that is, by strict necessity, highly regulated. All of this means that care costs more to provide than most families can afford, making it, in formertreasury secretary Janet Yellen’s words: “a textbook example of a broken market.”Despite this, the US spends a smaller proportion of public dollars onearly childhood educationthan almost all other wealthy countries. The Biden administration’s American Rescue Plan infused the industry with funding that helped keep centers open, employees in work, and moved kids off of waitlists and into care. However, this subsidy expired in 2023, and Donald Trump’s return to office has since imperiled the already meager federal childcare offerings.The perennially underfunded Head Start program, which marked its 60th anniversary last year and provides education and healthcare to children from very low-income families, appears firmly in the Trump regime’s crosshairs: the administration closedhalf of its regional offices this spring. These days, Trump no longer denies that Project 2025 is his handbook for filleting the federal government – and that plan calls fordefunding Head Start entirely. The White Housebriefly consideredcarrying out the recommendation in its 2026 budget.This makes New Mexico’s commitment all the more necessary. Under Lujan Grisham’s administration, the state has made astonishing strides in addressing the childcare crisis. Since 2022, it’s offered free care to families earning up to400% of the federal poverty level, and now, by broadening the program to include families of all incomes, another 12,000 children are expected to gain access. In addition to supporting kids and parents, New Mexico incentivizes higher wages by providing more money to daycares offering entry-level salaries of at least $18 per hour. That’s below a living wage for a childless adult, but it’s considerably more than the state’s $12-an-hour minimum. The state legislature must vote next year to sustain the funding – and, as it’s controlled by Democrats, is expected to do so.New Mexico primarily pays for its program through its Early Childhood Trust Fund, which the state endowed using revenue from oil and gas. However, it’s entirely possible to support families without relying on extractive industries. Connecticut is deploying its budget surplus to create a childcare endowment that’s projected tofund free daycarefor families earning less than $100,000 a year. And Washington DCraised taxes on high earnersto increase pay for early childhood educators, making it easier to recruit staff while expanding the number of available daycare seats.Even more ambitious models are found abroad. In Denmark,all children over six months old have a guaranteed right to care, either in centers that are part of the broader public education system or with home-based providers. Parents pay no more than a quarter of the fee. And Canada’s Liberal Party government is implementing a plan that hopes to lower childcare costs toabout $7 USD a day. Although not all provinces are on track to reach the 2026 target deadline, prices have declined across the country.The idea of creating similar resources for working families in the US isn’t mere fantasy – policies addressing childcare affordability are broadly popular, particularly among those who have kids. Fully92% of American parentsof children under five support universal childcare, as do79% of Republicanswith kids under 18.With all hope, New Mexico won’t long hold the distinction of being the nation’s only jurisdiction offering early childhood education for all. In New York City, where a year of infant care costs $26,000, mayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani has made free public daycare a pillar of his campaign. Enacting such a program in America’s largest city likely faces a steep uphill battle, despite the fact that it would allow thousands of mothers to join the workforce and produce$670m in annual earnings. Butthree-quarters of New Yorkers support universal childcare– which suggests that voters may be ready for the fight.Katrina vanden Heuvel is editor and publisher of the Nation, a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, and a contributor to theWashington Post, the New York Times and the Los Angeles TimesExplore more on these topicsNew MexicoOpinionChildrenChildcareParents and parentingcommentShareReuse this content"

Now it’s rearing its head againMatthew Avery SuttonFrom Silicon Valley to Michigan, the biblical figure is in the headlines. The shift from pulpits to politics is familiar – and dangerousMon 13 Oct 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 13 Oct 2025 16.07 EDTShareTwo scenes from the past two weeks capture something unsettling – and familiar –about American public life. In San Francisco,a tech billionaire delivereda sold‑out, off‑the‑record lecture series on the antichrist. In Michigan, a man rammed his pickup truck into a Latter‑day Saints meetinghouse during Sunday worship, opened fire and set the building ablaze, apparently believing that Mormons are the antichrist.The antichrist is clearly back. But perhaps he has never really left.As a historian of American apocalypticism, I’ve traced how this symbol – a protean figure cobbled together from obscure biblical passages – has repeatedly migrated from pulpits to politics and back again.Almost a century ago, fundamentalists mapped European dictators and New Deal bureaucrats on to biblical prophecy. During the cold war, evangelicals scanned Moscow and Jerusalem for signs of the Beast. In the first Gulf war, some Christians argued that Saddam Hussein was the antichrist who was rebuilding the Tower of Babel.Inside tech billionaire Peter Thiel’s off-the-record lectures about the antichristRead moreWhenever American power felt threatened or social change accelerated, antichrist talk surged. Today’s version arrives with AI, deepfakes and venture funding. And with bullets.Peter Thiel’s “Antichrist” lectures, consisting of four sessions organized by the ACTS 17 Collective, weremarketed as explorationsof “the theology, history, literature, and politics of the Antichrist”. Tickets sold out. Reports andattenders who shared detailswith the media and online say Thiel warns that fear of technological progress and especially efforts to regulate AI could become the pretext for acharismaticpower to centralize control in the name of “peace and safety”, a scenario he threads to New Testament warnings. One attender reported that Thiel went further, likening anti‑tech sentiment itself to the work of the antichrist.Others have traced the same themes in Thiel’s recent interviews. This summer he suggested that an antichrist of our age would present as a humanitarian regulator – he evenfloated Greta Thunbergas an analogy – arguing that fixation on “existential risk” can be a gateway to consolidating authority. Thiel claims that warnings about Armageddon may seduce elites into empowering a one‑world administrative order, which is the very thing apocalyptic texts have long seemingly foretold.The lectures have drawn scrutiny not only because of the content but because of the context. Notes from the first session leaked online before they were taken down; the attender who posted them was barred from the remaining talks. Meanwhile, protests outside highlighted the tension between a lecture on end‑times authoritarianism and the speaker’s stake in real‑world surveillance tools. (Thiel’s champions counter that AI anxiety, not AI itself, is the highway to the antichrist – a view that, whatever one thinks of it theologically, conveniently aligns with Silicon Valley’s anti‑regulatory instincts.)I do not doubt Thiel’s interest in Christian ideas. He draws on serious sources. But dressing political theory in apocalyptic robes carries risks. When powerful actors reframe ordinary policy debates such as about guardrails for AI as a battle against the antichrist, they raise anxieties, delegitimize compromise and insinuate that democratic deliberation is spiritually suspect.Whatever Thiel may believe, the “mark of the beast” does not live in theFederal Register.Then, just this past week, 40‑year‑old Thomas Jacob Sanford drove a flag‑festooned pickup through the front of a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter‑day Saints meetinghouse, fired multiple rounds into the congregation, and used gasoline to start a fire. Four worshipers were killed and eight injured; Sanford died in a shootout with officers.As investigators work through motive and means, a troubling detail has emerged. A local city council candidate who had spoken with Sanford a week earlier recalled a tirade against Latter‑day Saints during whichSanford declaredthat Mormons were “the antichrist”.Labelling neighbors “antichrist” is not simply an insult; in this very Protestant American culture, it marks the enemy of God and humanity, the architect of persecution, the final deceiver. Once your opponents become eschatological villains, the normal habits of politics and pluralism feel like complicity with evil. In extreme cases, violence begins to look sanctifying.Americans have repeatedly reached for the antichrist to make sense of social disruption and geopolitical dread. During the 1930s, some Christians mapped Mussolini, Stalin and Hitler on to prophecy charts and then read Franklin Roosevelt’s growing administrative state through the same lens. In the 1970s and ’80s, the oil crisis, detente, and the Iranian Revolution revived antichrist talk on radio programs and in runaway bestsellers. After 9/11, anxiety about terror networks and nuclear proliferation resurrected the motif yet again.The symbol is elastic. For a century, Christian apocalypticists have alternated between expecting a singular charismatic ruler and warning that a globalized administrative order, often buttressed by new technologies, could institutionalize the Beast’s control. That’s why a four‑part antichrist seminar hosted at a tech hub and a gunman railing against an antichrist church can coexist without contradiction. The word itself is a vocabulary for fear – a way of translating the headlines of the day into a cosmic drama that explains who we are and what we must do.Three currents are converging and as a result we are likely to see more Antichrist talk and action. First, technology really does feel apocalyptic. AI systems collapse time and space, digest private life and promise both miracles and mischief. It’s unsurprising that Silicon Valley’s most famous contrarian wants to set the theology of the antichrist against the politics of AI regulation.Second, institutions are brittle. Trust in media, universities, churches and government is low. In such periods, apocalyptic binaries flourish. They offer certainty, heroes and villains. They also make it easier to justify bending rules in the name of rescue.Third, the American tradition of naming enemies as “antichrist” is a proven mobilizer. It corrals attention, consolidates factions, and gives a transcendent sheen to temporal fights.Rather than fuel this fire, politicians, ministers, and tech leaders should stop baptizing their agendas in apocalyptic waters. It is one thing to warn about genuine dangers and argue for or against regulation. It is quite another to imply that one’s opponents are enlistments in the armies of the Beast. A democracy cannot function if routine governance is reimagined as tribulation.The late modern west has no monopoly on antichrist thinking. What’s notable about this moment is not simply that antichrist talk is back, but that it is coming from all ends of our social spectrum: from a sealed room on the Embarcadero and from a burning church inMichigan.The stakes are not theoretical. In San Francisco, the antichrist was a thought experiment about governance and technology. In Grand Blanc, antichrist became the curse that prefaced a massacre.Apocalyptic language has always helped some Americans to feel they know where history is headed. They use the Bible’s most cryptic passages to explain the past, understand the present and predict a future in which they prevail. In the end they vanquish all of their enemies and receive their just reward.But it can also push a nation toward the very nightmares it imagines. If we want to keep politics human and humane, we should retire the antichrist from our debates and leave the Beast in Revelation – where he belongs.Matthew Avery Sutton is a Guggenheim Fellow and author of the forthcoming Chosen Land: How Christianity Made America and Americans Remade Christianity(Basic Books), in addition to five prior books on Christianity.

Withthese wordsthe US president rejected the international scientific consensus and evidence that we can all check daily with a basic thermometer. He has also announced he iswithdrawing the USfrom the Paris climate agreement, signed in 2015 by 195 UN countries. The US joins an axis of deniers including Yemen, Iran and Libya, countries that signed the agreement but never ratified it.Paradoxically, Trump’s reversal provides an opportunity for others to advance the climate agenda: to sketch out the blueprint of a possible new world order without the US, even if Washington was the architect of the old one.A new arrangement could even emerge at the UN climate summit,Cop30, in Brazilnext month. Success will depend on the leadership capability of an unlikely duo: the host country, which is one of the founding Brics nations, and the EU, still the core political community in a fractured western alliance.There is almost always a grain of truth in what Trump claims. He is not totally wrong when heaccusesthe UN of being toothless. As he said in his speech: “All they seem to do is write a really strongly worded letter and then never follow that letter up.”In 1995, Angela Merkel, then the German environment minister, opened thefirst Copin Berlin, saying that global warming was “the greatest political challenge”. And yet, after 30 Cops and 30 years, the numbers seem to suggest that decades of “words” have produced only more hot air.In 1995, global C02 emissions stood at23.5bn tonnes; 30 years later, the level has reached a new record of38bn tonnes. When Merkel tried for the first time to forge an agreement on gradually stopping the use of fossil fuels, 85% of total energy consumption came from oil, gas and coal. Today, that has onlydropped to 80%. More worryingly, whereas we all accepted 10 years ago in Paris that the rise in global temperature must be kept well below 2C above preindustrial levels so as not to lose control of the “weather machine”, in Europe, according to theCopernicus observatory, we have already passed the 2.4C mark.Clearly, we are failing. Multilateralism is in crisis and this may even be one of the reasons behind the appeal of populists such as Trump. But the rest of the world now has a (final) chance to show that “global” problems can still be solved collectively. Trump’s decision topull the US outof a global system for addressing the climate crisis could be the window of opportunity we were waiting for. An opportunity somewhat like the one EU countries took advantage of in 2020 when they produced anunprecedented agreementon tackling the economic damage done by the pandemic. Consensus on issuing common debt was possible only because the UK, traditionally a sceptic on the matter, had removed itself from the EU.But what exactly is to be done at the next US-free Cop? Some of the most difficult issues facing Cop30 risk getting lost in bitter negotiations: the “loss and damage” facility, for example, meant to compensate poor countries for climate-related disasters. Other discussions – such as that on the energy transition – seem paralysed by opposition from interest groups such as farmers, homeowners or European carmakers, who fear they will have to foot the bill.The objective is still the right one, but the language, the metrics and the incentives must change. It must be made clear first and foremost that mitigating the effects of the climate crisis is an opportunity for innovation. The debate can’t permanently be about who bears the costs and who has the right to compensation. This is ultimately about an investment that will make our societies more resilient to global heating and less dependent on an energy model that is unstable and expensive.No less important is the method we use to resolve such global challenges. The Cops, for instance, have a result/cost ratio which nobody could call “sustainable”. Do these conferences have tomove to a different countryevery year? How about basing the meeting permanently in one or a small number of places, each focusing on a handful of specific challenges?Perhaps it is time to refocus Cop’s mission: today, it involves diplomats negotiating frantically on the wording of a final communique, along with thousands of side events that have no impact on decision-making. It could instead focus on solutions to climate-related problems drawing on best practice globally, so that policymakers can identify how to scale up what works.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And the EU, which, as the part of the world most vulnerable to trade wars and no longer able to rely on the US, desperately needs new friends.Brazil and the EU must come together around a pragmatic agenda. Alongside them should be India, Canada, the UK, Australia (the host of Cop31) and, yes, China. These seven may not be like-minded on many vital issues, but they still represent about half of the world’s emissions, population and GDP. I would argue that if they struck an agreement most of the other parties would follow.The US under the influence of Trump and his Maga followers is missing in action and will be for the foreseeable future, despite sharing the same planetary and climatic conditions – includinglife-threatening wildfiresand blizzards – as the rest of us. This is a grave mistake, but there is at least now an opportunity to shape a world that can function more efficiently without a hegemonic power.

Those rights are in dire perilMon 13 Oct 2025 10.23 EDTLast modified on Mon 13 Oct 2025 12.01 EDTShareImagine a movement arising in this country that seeks to overthrow established power. Imagine that it begins with a series of rebellions, in Scotland and south Wales perhaps, that shut down workplaces, confront police and soldiers (sometimes peaceably, sometimes with crude weapons), set up roadblocks and lay siege to the places where fellow protesters are imprisoned and government officials are meeting.Imagine that this movement goes on to smash or disable machinery across the country. Imagine that it organises a general strike, nixing much of the UK’s economic activity for three months. Imagine that it keeps protesting in the same places by the same means, gradually eroding the resistance of the state.Keir Starmer’s Labour government would doubtless do everything in its power not just to stop these individual actions but to prohibit the movement. What am I describing? The origins and development of the Labour party.The Labour party arose from a long wave of protests by workers against capital, calling for workers’ rights and for sweeping democratic reforms. These protests and their organisers came to be known as the labour movement. Its early actions includedthe radical war in Scotland,the Merthyrand Newportrisings in south Wales,the Swing riotsin England andthe General Strike of 1842. No such protests would have meant no such movement. No such movement would have meant no such party.Yet somehow, the party that arose from protest has formed, in terms of our rights to free expression and democratic challenge, the most illiberal government the UK has suffered since the second word war. ThisLabourgovernment would have banned the labour movement.Over 40 years, starting with the Public Order Act 1986, our rights to assemble and challenge power have been severely curtailed. That act was followed by theTrade Union Act 1992, the Criminal Justice Act 1994, the Terrorism Act 2000, theSerious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, thePolice, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022and thePublic Order Act 2023. Between them, they have largelybound and gagged effective protest.Any government that fails to contest and reverse this trend, even if it did nothing to add to this bleak legacy, sides with illiberalism. Far from doing so, Starmer’s has already gone further than the Conservatives dared, byclassifying a civil disobedience group– Palestine Action – as a terrorist organisation and banning it. It has also (so far with remarkably little resistance)inserted a clauseinto its crime and policing bill enabling the police to stop demonstrations “in the vicinity of a place of worship”. As our towns and cities are so richly endowed with religious buildings, that means almost any urban area.But its latest proposal is even worse. The home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, has announced that the policeshould be able to stop proteststhat have a “cumulative impact”, by recurring in the same place. She will also consider “powers to ban protests outright”.Mahmood has sought to justify these measures with the claim that repeated protests can leave religious groups, especially the Jewish community, feeling unsafe. It is worth noting that a Conservative home secretary, Suella Braverman, forced avery similar measurethrough parliament in 2023 (which was later struck down by the courts) using anentirely different argument: that repeated environmental protests were causing disruption to businesses and travellers. Illiberal people seek to stop protest. They will seize on any argument that justifies this urge.It is essential that Jews in Britain are fiercely protected against antisemitic hate and antisemitic attacks. We must be perpetually vigilant against anyone who uses the Israeli government’s genocide in Gaza as an excuse for antisemitism. This hate crime must be prosecuted, wherever it arises. But linking this disgusting crime to the act of protesting against the genocide, however peacefully and respectfully, as the governmenthas explicitly done, triggers two grim thoughts.The first is that it is using the horrific terrorism in Manchester last week as a good moment for shutting down dissent. The second is that it treats protests against Israeli government actions as protests against the Jewish community in Britain. Otherwise, it’s hard to understand why Mahmood and the prime minister should have called for onlyone thing to be cancelledthe following day to respect the grief of British Jews: not football matches, concerts, car boot salesandprotests, but solely the silent and peaceful Palestine protest in London. Jewish people in this country haverepeatedly warned against such conflations, which can themselves constitute antisemitism.Mahmood’s proposals, as well as being profoundly illiberal in their own right, add a new storey to the tower of authoritarian measures in whose shadow we live. We suffer the “cumulative impact” of a long succession of anti-protest laws. Labour is waging a concerted attack on the thing that made it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Thanks to the protests of the past, we’ve overthrown the corrupt old elites and achieved democracy. Well, I hope one day our descendants will look back on our system and wonder how it could ever have passed for democracy, and why we tolerated it for so long.First-past-the-post elections delivering a massive majority on 34% of the vote? One second’s participation in decision-making every five years?Presumed consentin between? Governments claiming to represent us, but responding instead to press barons and corporations? Politics on sale to the highest bidder, through political donations and paid lobbying?Thisis democracy?Thisis a system that requires no challenge?Those who opposed the labour movement two centuries ago also believed their political system was unimprovable. In 1830, when a tiny minority was allowed to vote and entire cities were unrepresented, the prime minister, the Duke of Wellington,told parliamentthat neither he nor the leader of the opposition could see any means by which “the state of the representation could be improved”. The existing system deservedly “possessed the full and entire confidence of the country”.Our political ancestors knew that to be effective you have to keep coming back. You have to turn up where it counts. You have to make a nuisance of yourself. You must be noisy, obstructive, annoying. One by one, all these rights have been struck down. Now the last remaining attribute of effective dissent – persistence – is also to be banned.Protestis allowed, as long as it’s invisible, transient and useless. But the moment protest ceases to be effective is the moment democracy dies.George Monbiot is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

That she’d be ashamed. But mostly, I was terrified they’d send me home. Again. That I wasn’t sick enough. That I was just another hormonal woman with a flair for drama.This was week five of what I now know is hyperemesis gravidarum (HG), a condition where pregnancy nausea and vomiting go full Tarantino. I’d already been to the emergency department five times in two weeks. No diagnosis. Just a rinse-and-repeat routine: some staring down the tiles while holding a tie-and-twist vomit bag, some pokes and wriggles to find my dehydrated veins, some fluids and the awkward assurance that “baby is like a parasite, it will take everything it needs”. As if maternal suffering were a footnote. As if I were the side salad to the main course of foetal development.Among family members, the chorus was louder. Vomiting seven or eight times a day is, apparently, normal. “You should be grateful” and “There’s a reason God placed heaven under the feet of the mother.” Apparently, martyrdom is the price of admission.Don’t call it morning sickness: ‘At times in my pregnancy I wondered if this was death coming for me’Read moreI started to believe them. Maybe I was weak. Maybe I was exaggerating. Maybe I was failing at the one thing my body was biologically designed to do.But that night, on a stretcher, my body gave out. I couldn’t stand. My head was splitting. I hadn’t kept down food or water in four days. I’d already vomited four times that day – but not enough, I thought, to justify calling an ambulance and clogging up ED yet again. The debate in my head was about whether I was an impostor or someone genuinely suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum (HG).But then I came across anarticlethat validated what I’d suspected all along: diagnosis can be tricky. Featuring astudyof 300 Australians with severe nausea, it said HG leads to poor quality of life and negatively affects social, occupational and domestic functioning. So much so that more than half considered terminating their pregnancy. Ninety per cent considered not having more children. Only half found commonly used anti-nausea treatments effective.The article reflected my bed-ridden days, where I was fully reliant on my mother to do basic chores, unresponsive to oral antiemetics and living in a fog of dehydration and dread. HG doesn’t just affect your stomach, it hijacks your entire life.The first real validation came from a pathologist who said, “Oh, sounds like that thing PrincessKatehad.” Not because it was a royal condition, but because I felt like someone understood.View image in fullscreenPrince William, Duke of Cambridge, and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, in December 2012, leaving the hospital in London where she had been treated for HG.Photograph: Danny Martindale/WireImageHGis a debilitating condition routinely dismissed as “just morning sickness” because as many as80%of pregnant women experience some form of nausea and vomiting. But HG is not a spectrum, it’s a cliff. And once you fall off it, there’s no soft landing.I learned HG isn’t just bad luck – it can run in families. Specific gene variantslinkedto appetite regulation, inflammation and placental development may help explain why some bodies react this way to pregnancy. I ticked every box: motion sickness, migraines and a family tree full of women who “just got on with it”. But instead of this being seen as biological vulnerability, I framed it as personal failure. I wasn’t sick – I was soft.Historically,treatmentsfor HG ranged from mercury and morphine to electric shock and radiotherapy. One physician even injected his patient with her husband’s blood. By the 1960s, the medical enthusiasm fizzled out – just as women’s rights were gaining traction. Funny, isn’t it? Motherhood was too sacred to be touched, even by science.Why are women who suffer extreme sickness in pregnancy told it’s all in their heads?Read moreAs someone navigating HG while living in Australia, with family ties across multiple cultures, I’ve been struck by the universality of the minimisation. There’s a cross-cultural rush to romanticise motherhood while silencing its pain. It’s not that people mean to be cruel. The dismissal of HG isn’t usually malicious – it’s ambient. It seeps in through the cracks of culture, religion, medicine and memory. It’s the grandmother who says “We all went through it”, the friend who chirps “You’ll forget once you have the kid”, the nurse who shrugs “Baby gets everything it needs” and sends you home with a pamphlet and a pat on the back. It’s the glorification of motherhood as divine suffering, where pain is proof of love and silence is strength. And when that narrative becomes gospel, HG becomes invisible.And the freakiest betrayal? It’s from women themselves. Again, it’s not conscious. Like all good bias, it’s baked in. We grow up believing our bodies are meant to suffer. And this is what stands behind thelag inmedical understanding and public consciousness. HG lacks concrete diagnostic protocols, consistent care pathways and financial investment in effective treatments.I now have a hospital management plan and I’ve successfully shooed away any termination ideations. I’m waiting eagerly for the baby to be out and the much-promised “this will pass, and your memories will fade” to arrive. There will almost certainly not be a second pregnancy, given the recurrence risk of about24%.I’m writing this hoping that a few more people will learn about the condition, fostering compassion and community consciousness about the silent pains of motherhood. Fourteen weeks into pregnancy, I fear what else there is about motherhood that I don’t know and will learn the hard way.Generations of women have quietly suffered and survived. Some died. But it doesn’t have to be this way.In Australia, support is available atBeyond Blueon 1300 22 4636,Lifelineon 13 11 14, and atMensLineon 1300 789 978.

Members and trade union affiliatesvoted to back, first the findings of a UN commission of inquirythat Israel is committing genocide, and second that the government must do all it can to prevent it.It is now two weeks since this motion was passed, but still the Labour government refuses to recognisethe genocide in Gazaand allowsthe supply of weaponsto Israel.Over the past 40 years in parliament, I have witnessed at first-hand the democratic deficit in our political system. For too long, top-down political parties have disempowered their membership and crushed internal debate. Now,Your Partywill try to do something unprecedented in British politics: forge a mass, democratic party from scratch.When we launched,we announcedthat members would decide the policies, the strategy and even the name. In the meantime, we called it Your Party.It was an apt choice because it expressed the essence of what we are trying to build: a new kind of political party that belongs to its members.In November, we are hosting our inaugural founding conference. This will be the moment that members come together to decide the direction of the party, the models of leadership, and the strategies we need to win. We want our conference to be participatory, open and democratic. Members will be chosen at random to come to the conference in person and debate our founding documents. Then, every member will get the final say online through one member, one vote.This conference will not come out of the blue. It will be the product of a series of mass,regional assembliesup and down the country. More than just rallies, these assemblies will be an opportunity for communities to come together to discuss and debate the key questions facing the future of our party and our country.A democratic party isn’t an end in itself. It will provide the space for people to organise, together, for a radically different society. When highly centralised political parties answer to nobody but themselves, you get policies that nobody asked for. You get privatisation of our public services. You get austerity. You get 4.5 million childrenliving in povertyin one of the richest countries in the world. When political parties are democratically accountable to their members, you get policies that the British people want and need.I’ll go further: undemocratic parties produce undemocratic societies, where a small section of society owns the resources we all need to survive. Democratic parties produce democratic societies; where wealth and resources are owned by us all. Take public ownership, for example. Currently, a small number of companies control the production of basic resources, to the detriment of us all. Everyone relies on these services, yet it isunaccountable shareholderswho decide how they are run. Public ownership means giving communities the power to decide how to run the services they provide and consume. This is the heart of socialism: the extension of democracy into every sphere of life. And that is at the heart of Your Party.For too long, people have been shut out of our political system. We are doing things differently: we are putting power in your hands. Those who want to stand in the way of transformative change want to suppress the rights, voices and power of ordinary people. Their greatest fear is democracy – because democracy is our greatest strength.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Thelatest statisticsreleased by the Home Office, showing religiously motivated offences at a record level, are deeply disturbing. But for those who have witnessed some of the appalling scenes on our city’s streets in recent months, they will not be surprising.Over the past two years, Jewish people have faced a rising tide of antisemitism, and the heinous terrorist attack in Manchester on Yom Kippur was a terrible reminder of just how pervasive this poisonous form of hatred continues to be. Between January and June, the Community Security Trust reported more than 1,500 antisemitic incidents. A survey by the Institute for Jewish Policy Research found that 35% of Jewish people feel unsafe in the UK.A terrifying increase in anti-Muslim hatred has left many British Muslims feeling the same way. Two days after the horrific events at Heaton Park synagogue, a mosque was set alight in Peacehaven. A suspected arson with the intent to endanger life, it was the latest in a long line of violent assaults on Muslim places of worship. In July, one man was sentenced after videoing himself releasing wild rats next to a mosque in Sheffield. In the same week, another pleaded guilty to terrorism offences after planning to burn down a mosque in Greenock.The idea that attacks against our Jewish and Muslim communities are isolated incidents is ignorant at best. At worst, this thinking is deeply dangerous. The violence we have witnessed is the result of rapidly deepening divides in our society which, if left to fester and grow, could tear our way of life apart.For Londoners, this is profoundly distressing. Our diverse city must always be a place where people of all faiths and none can live side by side in the knowledge that they aren’t just safe to be who they are – they are celebrated for it. Today, though, extremists are attempting to exploit our fears to divide us for their own gain, and their ideas are being allowed to infect mainstream political debate.As a city and as a society, we must put a stop to this. The London I know isn’t a city where people feel scared go to their synagogue or mosque, or fear wearing a hijab or a kippah in public. My London – the London I’ll keep standing up for – is a city where Muslim, Jewish and Christian leaders come together to celebrate Iftar, and people walking home from Friday prayers wish their neighbours shalom Shabbat. A place where we come together to condemn violence against places of worship, knowing that any attack on our neighbour’s freedom of religion is also an attack on our own.The London I love is the one I saw on a cloudy morning last November. Across the capital, thousands of people came together to visit care homes, clean up parks and cook for those in need. Jewish, Muslim, and Christian, Hindu, Buddhist, and Sikh, they were all taking part in Mitzvah Day: the UK’s largest faith-led day of social action.Founded by a Jewish Londoner, Laura Marks, Mitzvah Day has become a staple of life for many communities in the capital. City Hall is no different. Preparing for the day by packing boxes full of fresh vegetables for vulnerable Londoners with my colleagues, I found myself reflecting on our reasons for being there.Grounded in Jewish tradition, Mitzvah Day asks us to do good deeds – or mitzvot – for our community. For Muslims like me, that feels very familiar; zakat, or giving to the needy, is one of the five pillars of our religion. In the call to love your neighbour, my Christian friends hear a similar chance to put their beliefs into practice through acts of charity. My Hindu and Sikh friends embody this in seva, or selfless service.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Let Manchester be a turning point | Jonathan FreedlandRead moreThat morning, each of us found inspiration in our own faith. But, drawing on our different traditions, we also found a common cause: building a better future for the community we are proud to share. In homeless shelters and food banks across the country, many others did the same. Together, we showed that our diversity is a strength to be celebrated, not a weakness to be hidden. That, when faced with darkness and despair, hope and unity will always prevail.I don’t see my faith as something that sets me apart from my fellow Londoners, because I believe our different beliefs can bring us closer. As some seek to score cheap political points by weaponising a series of appalling events to turn us against one another, we can find an antidote to hatred in the sense of purpose we share in our churches, mosques and synagogues, our mandirs, temples and gurdwaras.Sadly, some politicians and commentators seem unwilling to defend this common humanity, choosing instead to exacerbate tensions by appealing to our worst instincts. This is reckless and wrong, revealing callous disregard for the safety of the people they are supposed to serve. Now, more than ever, we must resist the forces of division and unite to build stronger, kinder communities where we can live together in peace.Sadiq Khan is the mayor of LondonDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It is quite another to develop a coherent alternativeGet ourbreaking news email,free appordaily news podcastMon 13 Oct 2025 02.23 EDTLast modified on Mon 13 Oct 2025 21.43 EDTShareThe federal government’s announcement of a A$600mrescue packagefor Glencore’s copper smelting and refining operations in Mount Isa and Townsville marks a definitive shift in Australia’s industry policy.The announcement follows the $2.4bn rescue of theWhyalla steelworks, and a smaller assistance package formetals smelter Nyrstar.At the time it was announced, the Whyalla rescue could be seen as a one-off special case. The steelworks’ owner, Sanjeev Gupta, had run into financial difficulties associated with the collapse of its major financier, Greensill Capital. The rescue plan included support for a transition from unsustainable blast furnace technology to “green steel”, though this remains problematic.By contrast, Swiss giantGlencoreis a highly profitable corporation that has made a business decision to close its copper operations. The bailout will keep those operations going for three years, after which the same issue will likely re-emerge.In combination with the Nyrstar bailout, we now see an expectation that federal and state governments will undertake such rescues regularly, on a 50-50 cost-sharing basis.A final break with neoliberalismThis shift marks a final break with the policy framework (variously called “neoliberalism” or “economic rationalism”) under which intervention of this kind was seen as an undesirable “distortion” of the market, to be undertaken only in emergencies, if at all. The underlying assumption was that market signals would yield the most efficient allocation of resources.This shift is not occurring in isolation. Neoliberal ideas have been in retreat since the global financial crisis of 2008.China has presented its own, state-led model as a superior alternative, and has sought to use control of “critical minerals” as an instrument of geopolitical strategy. Its plan last week totighten export controlson critical minerals sparked an angry response from the US president, Donald Trump, who threatened to impose 100% tariffs on China in retaliation.The US has been backing away from free-trade ideas since the election of the first Trump administration in 2016, and has now abandoned them altogether.More questions than answersBut it is one thing to abandon the dogmas of neoliberalism. It is quite another to develop a coherent alternative.A framework that includes bailouts of mineral processing operations as a routine policy tool raises some major questions.What are the criteria for such a bailout?What, if anything, should the public receive in return?What (presumably) unintended consequences arise if failing operations receive assistance while their competitors do not?In the light of recent policy discussions, it might seem sensible to focus on minerals deemed “critical” in the context of digital technology and the clean energy transition. Australia maintains alist of these minerals.However, the recent rescues have been for minerals (iron, lead, zinc and copper) not on this list, although both zinc and copper are classed as “strategic”.Looking at evidence from theUnited States,United KingdomandEuropean Union, as well as Australia, is unhelpful, as it expands the list of minerals considered “critical” in at least one major jurisdiction to well over 50 elements. Only a handful of naturally occurring metals (including silver, cadmium, gold, mercury and technetium) fail to make at least one of these lists.Tough choices need to be madeIf we are to have a policy based on strategic support of mineral smelting, we will need a much more stringent test, and some hard choices as to which minerals really matter.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Or should we let the US industry, now protected by high tariffs, take the burden of challenging China’s dominance?Mining giant Rio Tinto iscurrently in talkswith the federal and New South Wales governments to avert the shutdown of the nation’s largest aluminium smelter in the Hunter region. There is also concern the accelerated retirement of theGladstone power stationmay imperil Rio Tinto’s Boyne smelter.China has a stranglehold on the world’s rare-earths supply chain. Can Australia break it?Read moreThe provision of assistance to highly profitable companies such as Glencore and Rio Tinto raises further questions. For example, should such assistance require a return to the public, such as the government taking an equity stake in the company concerned?Alternatively, we might consider that assistance for mineral processing only makes sense if the minerals in question will one day be more scarce and costly than they are now.Should we set an advance requirement for a higher return to the public in periods of high prices, asQueensland has donewith coal?Finally, should strategic efforts of this kind be coordinated with allies, and if so, which allies? In the past, it would have been natural to line up with the US against the possibility of trade coercion from China. But now, at least in trade policy, the US is moreadversary than ally.We need to explore regional partnerships with friendly neighbours such as Indonesia and (slightly further afield) South Africa.Like it or not, the days of free-market trade policy and a rules-based international order are over.

Donald Trump, Keir Starmer, Emmanuel Macron, Pedro Sánchez and othersare meeting“to end the war in the Gaza Strip, enhance efforts to achieve peace and stability in the Middle East, and usher in a new era of regional security and stability”.If the ceasefire holds, this language is an augur of the future. One where there is no reckoning, no addressing of root causes. Only a hurtling into the imperatives of cleanings-up and workings-out. All the while illegal occupation continues, and another chapter of Israel’s violations is furtively closed without accountability not only forIsrael, but for its sponsors.There is an Arabic expression,hameeha harameeha– meaning “its protector is its thief”, that comes to mindas those who have plied Israel with weaponry gather to figure out how to achieve peace in Gaza. Over the coming weeks and months, a Gaza even more devastated than what has been shown to the world so far will come into view. Already the colossal scale of what needs to be rebuilt is becoming clear. People arereturning to their homesin Gaza Cityto find a wastelandflattened to the horizon by bombs andthen bulldozers. In the images of the area, even the sunlight looks different and otherworldly. I couldn’t figure out why, until I realised it was because there were no structures to filter it. No shade, no shadows. A home returned to is just a plot on which to pitch another tent and wait for aid. But this time, with less risk of being bombed in your sleep.People in Gaza have been released from the fear of death, but what of the life they now face? What of thethousands of orphans, and the wounded or maimed children with no surviving families? It is not just the infrastructure of large parts of Gaza that has been destroyed, it is also the social fabric. Family lineages across two, three,four generationshave been wiped out. What of the thousands of parents who haveburied their children? And of all those who have collected the body parts of their loved ones? How to even begin to think about addressing such mass trauma when there isn’t even a roof to gather under? I asked a man from Gaza about his brother, who had lost all his children and his wife in one strike. Where is he now? “Just constantly walking around, circling the rubble” of the site where they died. “Lost.”View image in fullscreenPalestinians women in Gaza City, 12 October 2025.Photograph: Majdi Fathi/NurPhoto/ ShutterstockThe death toll will certainly rise, as bodies that could not previously be retrieved are pulled out of the rubble. At least 10% of Gaza’s population has beeneither killed or injured, and that is a conservative estimate.It is important that these facts are not simply totted up and brushed aside as the costs of war. The assault must end, but the terms on which it is ended, and on which the path to peacemaking and reconstruction is based, are crucial. The crimes that have been committed cannot be redressed, or even prevented from recurring, if the conditions that enabled their perpetrators continue.This is a difficult thing to insist on when you are dealing with a genocide. The scale of the death and violence, the erasure of the conditions for life, make the cessation of that erasure the most urgent, the only focus. But with that comes exculpation, and worse. Already Donald Trump is taking a victory lap for his peacemaking, after enabling what has taken place for months. Jared Kushnerpraised Israel’s conduct:“Instead of replicating the barbarism of the enemy, you chose to be exceptional.” StarmerlaudedTrump for securing the deal, and focused on the importance of letting in humanitarian aid. He will,No 10 has said, pay “particular tribute” to the US president in Sharm el-Sheikh. And so now we have a crime without criminals, a genocide withoutgénocidaires, a wretched population who, we are to believe, have been brought low by Hamas, and must be fed and watered while the world works out what to do with them. An entire history across Palestine of Israeli impunity and dominion, one of repetitiveethnic cleansing, military rule, expansion of settlements – and nowexplicit rejectionof Palestinian self-determination – is erased, again.This time, that exoneration, that framing of what has happened as tragic and finally over, is even more urgent, because the responsibility of countries that have supported Israel and silenced its critics is clearer than ever. Of course you would rush to Sharm el-Sheikh if you were representing a government that provided arms,restricted protestand refused either to endorsedeclarations of genocide, or toobserve the rulingsof the ICC when it issued an arrest warrant for Benjamin Netanyahu. Peace in Gaza represents an opportunity to forget; to erase from the collective consciousness an era in which some western countries took a bludgeon to international norms and institutions, and indeed their own domestic politics, in order to force through the destruction of Gaza.But many all over the world who have witnessed the massacre, and all that went into sustaining it for two whole years, will not so easily forget. The secure future of those inGaza, andPalestinein general, is not something that can be delivered by the thieves-turned-protectors. Without the empowerment of the Palestinian people and their self-determination, there can be no faith or trust in Israel or its allies to deliver that constantly invoked “lasting peace”. The killings have mercifully stopped for now in Gaza, but there must now be a refusal to normalise what will follow – a return to a status quo in which we all keep on pretending that Palestinian life is viable under the authority of Israel.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I wanted to do something so niche, so consuming, I could lose myself in it. I was in a funk that needed urgent lifting.It started as a distraction. I was battling addiction and mental illness, spending so long in clinics and therapists’ rooms my vitamin D count had bottomed out.In my younger days, I loved bushwalking but had no friends left to do it with. I couldn’t carry a pack anyway, as my back health was terrible due to lack of exercise.Somehow I heard about a weekend introduction to birds at The Briars, Mt Martha, run byBirdsAustralia (now BirdLife Australia).A wholesome course of nature studies seemed harmless enough. I could get out of the house – and my long-sleeved shirts – for a couple of days.I went and it was a bit, ahem, obscure. I’m ashamed to say the lengthy talks about bird taxonomy made me fidget like a child. There were slideshows, nature walks and dusty bird specimens laid out on a table in lines.Here’s to the birdwatchers! Optimistic, slightly eccentric custodians of wonder and joy and passion and loveRead moreA spark was lit but it wasn’t very bright.Everything changed when I enrolled in Tafe and studied David Malouf’s novel Fly Away Peter.The elegiac descriptions of Jim’s response to birds ignited me:This creature that I could catch so easily in my hands, feeling the heart beat and the strong wings flutter against my palms … has been to Siberia. Its tiny, quick eye has seen something big. A whole half of the Earth.Who could resist? I wanted to see for myself the godwits and sandpipers that poor, doomed Jim studied in the Gold Coast hinterland in 1914.[Sadly, some of those migratory shorebirds are in as much trouble now as a soldier in the trenches, with one species, the curlew sandpiper, dropping in number dramatically in the last 20 years.]So I bought binoculars and began watching birds. I frequented parks and wetlands. I got a key to Werribee’s Western Treatment Plant. I went on beginner’s outings and began climbing a learning curve that hasn’t levelled out yet.It’s ridiculously easy to observe birds. Like cloud spotting, you need only stay still and pay attention (you can even watch birds – or clouds – out your window).Suddenly shapes in the sky, on the water and in the trees take on a name and a meaning. Your perceptions expand, you “get” the bird species and a new dimension of the world is exposed.Pinpointing birds involves a quantum leap, a jolt of comprehension. You gaze at a branch or follow a jerky movement, twiddling the knob of your binoculars. Suddenly, you discern the bird that was there all along.It’s a heightened state with a strange loss of self. The more birds you recognise, the more you feel part of the natural world.Once you start experiencing birds, it’s difficult to stop. Your “bird radar” is never turned off. Many birders will admit to pulling over on busy roads to check out a bird of prey above, or screaming to a halt when a brolga or banded lapwing come into view.Above a busy Caulfield crossroad I once saw five pelicans slowly revolve in a circle, floating on the summer thermal currents. Pulling over wasawkward.I took to birds pretty late but now can’t remember a time when I didn’t scour the sky.Of course, birding is not all joy and transcendence. You can’t understand birds without learning about the conservation issues they face.Take the orange-bellied parrot. It may be on the road to recovery but, for a wealthy country, Australia has far too many endangered birds, many without plans for their revival (known as recovery plans).The critically endangered bush stone-curlew is of great significance to many First Nations peoples. According to Wurundjeri elder Aunty Joy Murphy Wandin, the bird is part of the land; when it cries, it gives a message of warning.We must heed the warning and step up conservation. To do that, we must care a lot more.I’m passionate about classAvesthe way others love pop stars or sports teams. I swapped one addiction for another and I don’t mind at all.Debbie Lustig is aMelbourne writer, birdwatcher and occasional wildlife rescuerExplore more on these topicsAustralian bird of the year 2025OpinionBirdwatchingBirdscommentShareReuse this content"

But it won’t end a noxious multibillion-dollar industry that devastates the lives of two sets of victims. The first are those cheated out of money, often by people posing as potential romantic or business partners in what are known as“pig‑butchering” schemes. The second are those who are forced to cheat them, working in conditions amounting to modern slavery.The recent study,Scam: Inside Southeast Asia’s Cybercrime Compounds, by Ivan Franceschini, Ling Li and Mark Bo, paints a terrifying picture of the sector. Workers are trafficked into heavily guarded, prison-like compounds, where they are routinely abused and tortured for failing to meet targets, or extorted for ransoms. Others take the jobs willingly, but find that they cannot repay ruinous charges for food and accommodation. Their work requires them to be connected to the outside world round the clock, yet they are too terrified to seek help because of the surveillance and violence they endure.Reports of people being forced into criminality in online scam centres in south-east Asia first emerged in 2018. Five years later, the UN Human Rights Office reported that120,000 peoplehad been forced to carry out online scams in Myanmar alone, with another 100,000 in Cambodia. The Cambodian police boast that theyrounded up 3,000 suspectsfrom 19 countries this summer, in their biggest crackdown yet.But scam centres have now been identified in Serbia, Peru,Pakistan, central Africa and most recentlyTimor-Leste. One NGO worker told the authors of Scam that a common scenario might be “a Chinese perpetrator residing in Cambodia [using] a trafficked Filipino individual to deceive a US citizen, using credit cards from Dubai for money laundering”.The trafficking ofWang Xing, a Chinese actor, to Myanmar in January highlighted the brazenness of these criminals. But as China and others turn up the heat, the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crimewarnsthat syndicates are targeting individuals from countries with limited diplomatic or consular resources, citing more than 700 Ethiopian nationals rescued in Myanmar this year. Satellite internet services and solar power have allowed operators to move to remoter areas. Deepfake technology is opening up new avenues for scamming.Corrupt officials, from local police to senior politicians, allow these enterprises to thrive. When victims are rescued, authorities frequently prosecute them as scammers or fine them for immigration offences. Assistance may come instead from white-hat hackers, local NGOs or business people from the victim’s homeland. Remarkably, even some scam targets have put aside their anger and helped those tasked with exploiting them after learning the full story.Criminal syndicates prosper by extracting and exploiting data, and working across transnational boundaries to evade control. To fight them, governments must share intelligence and target networks, not isolated compounds. Cooperation needs civil society – yet China and others distrust it. Technology companies must stop their platforms being used for organised crime; WhatsApp recentlydeleted 6.8m accountslinked to online scam centres. Above all, however, authorities must ensure that traumatised victims are not punished as perpetrators.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Netflix tackles the horrific ‘Monster of Florence’ murdersIt was a brutal killing spree that gripped Italy – yet so little is still known. Why were lovers murdered in their cars? Why were their sexual organs often targeted? AuthorTobias Jonessifts the evidenceTobias JonesMon 13 Oct 2025 13.02 EDTLast modified on Mon 13 Oct 2025 21.30 EDTShareSome criminal cases are so vast that even the number of victims is uncertain: in the case of the unsolved “Monster of Florence” crimes that have grippedItalyfor half a century, it is known that seven couples were murdered. But some say it’s eight, and at least another 16 murders have been connected to the case. The number of suspects almost matches that of the victims. First there was thepista sarda, the Sardinian line of enquiry into the swinging, pimping Vinci brothers who probably had a hand in the “first” murder in 1968. In the 1990s, a rapist, Pietro Pacciani, was convicted and then cleared. In 2000, Pacciani’s co-accused, Mario Vanni and Giancarlo Lotti, were sentenced to life and 28 years respectively for the murders committed between 1981 and 1985.Gianluca Monastra, author of Il Mostro di Firenze, writes that it’s a case in which “there’s a seductive and ever more abstract ballet of hypotheses … it’s a story in which everything can seem true, as can its contrary.” Filled with intrigue and sex (most of the victims were young couples making out in the countryside), it has spawned its fair share of obsessives, who have come to be known as monsterologists. The frequency with which evidence suddenly appeared or disappeared has persuaded some monsterologists to suspect that elements within law enforcement were involved.Milva Malatesta was burned in a car along with her three-year-old sonDebate about the Monster’s identity will reignite this month with the release of Stefano Sollima’s four-partNetflixdrama, The Monster of Florence, on 22 October. Son of the film director Sergio, Sollima has decided to concentrate only on the beginning of the story, on thepista sarda, a choice that means the series never moves beyond act one of the Monster tragedy – a sequel is presumably in the works.The actual facts are grim. In 1974, a couple kissing in a car in Sagginale, north-east of Florence, were murdered. The woman’s breasts and pubic area were stabbed 97 times. Nothing further happened until a burst in the 1980s. The Monster struck twice in 1981, then again in 1982, 83, 84 and 85. The same H-series gun cartridges were used in every murder – the stabbings and surgical cuttings only occurred after the monster had shot and killed his victims.There was a creepy ritualism to the murders. Each time the victims were in states of arousal in a car. The man was killed first. Usually the women were sexually mutilated. A part of one victim’s breast was posted to the only woman on the investigative team. All the murders happened in the countryside north-east and south-west of Florence, often in or very near a small town called San Casciano.But 1974 may be the wrong place to start the story. In 1982, an anonymous tip persuaded investigators to link the gun used by the Monster, a Beretta .22 series 70, to an earlier crime: in 1968, Barbara Locci and her lover, Antonio Lo Bianco, had been murdered in the latter’s car as they made love with Locci’s son asleep on the back seat. They were the “first” or “eighth” couple.Locci’s husband, Stefano Mele, was imprisoned for that 1968 murder and thus excluded as a Monster suspect. But Mele was thought to have had Sardinian accomplices. Three brothers, called Vinci, had all been Barbara Locci’s lovers. One of them, Salvatore Vinci, had often been Locci’s husband’s lover as well.There was a fluidity and abusiveness to many of these relationships. It seems that Salvatore Vinci probably pimped out Locci. In 1985, after a trial in which he was cleared of killing his first wife Barbarina back in 1960, Salvatore Vinci disappeared.Sollima is exactly the man you would want to tackle this start of the tortuous story. The kingpin of Italian crime series for the last two decades, he directed Romanzo Criminale (the series, not the film) and Suburra (the film, not the series). He directed the cops-and-ultras film ACAB, and produced the series. He has also been a co-director on famous Roberto Saviano adaptations, from ZeroZeroZero to Gomorrah.View image in fullscreenLovers … 1981 victims Stefano Baldi and Susanna Cambi.Photograph: ShutterstockHis new series captures the weird giddiness of the Monster case because each of the four episodes is told from a separate point of view: those ofMele and his brother Giovanni who was imprisoned for eight months, but later released without charge, and the two Vinci brothers. The same scenes appear in subsequent episodes but now the viewer sees things differently and scoffs at their previous gullibility.But in never leaving thepista sarda, the series feels slightly gullible as well. The Sardinian line of enquiry was abandoned, at least by investigators, in 1989. Michele Giuttari, the lead investigator on the case for almost seven years, believes it was a deliberate red herring and that the ballistics connections between the 1968 and 1974 murders remain unproven.In the 2000s, in the aftermath of the convictions of Vanni and Lotti, Giuttari (who had become chief inspector for the Investigative Group for Serial Crimes) concentrated on who commissioned the murders. “There was a superior level, it’s useless to deny that,” Giuttari said recently. Pacciani was mysteriously wealthy and Giuttari hypothesised that the murderers were commissioned in order to cull body parts for satanic masses. He revealed connections between prostitution and participants in orgiastic parties organised by a Sicilian guru called Salvatore Indovino in San Casciano.It’s almost impossible to conclude from the evidence that all the murders were committed by a single culpritGiuliano Mignini, the public prosecutor in Perugia, also took the case in new directions. Many suspects had spoken about a doctor’s role in the killings, without naming him. Mignini investigated the unexplained death in 1985 of a 35-year-old gynaecologist and freemason, Francesco Narducci, who had been fished out of Lake Trasimeno, Umbria, one month after the last double murder. No autopsy was conducted. Mignini disinterred Narducci and claimed that he had been murdered.The conspiracy theories, and tangential murders, mounted up. In 1982, Elisabetta Ciabani, a friend of one of the Monster’s 1981 victims, Susanna Cambi, was found disembowelled in her room in Scicli, Sicily. Francesco Vinci was killed – hog-tied and set on fire in his car – in 1993. A few days later, Milva Malatesta, a woman who had been in a relationship with Vinci, was murdered – also burned in a car – along with her three-year-old son.There are so many connections, but it’s hard to know if they mean anything. Members of the Malatesta family worked in a factory owned by the doctor’s family. Malatesta’s brother maintains that one of those most closely involved in the official investigation had been present at parties where his sister was part of the carnal offering.View image in fullscreenIn the dock … Marco Bullitta as Stefano Mele in the Netflix series.Photograph: Emanuela Scarpa/ NetflixBy now, it’s widely accepted that the “Monster” label covers an actual conspiracy – in the sense of “plotting together”. It’s almost impossible to conclude from the evidence that all the murders were committed by a single culprit. The crimes appear collective: the killings were probably watched, the body parts passed on. Most now believe not in a single monster but in monsters. In 2019, Paul Russell, an Italy-based producer, titled his documentary Monsters of Florence (Paramount+/Netflix). “The whole case is a source of fantasies,” he tells me.The fantasies aren’t only sexual, but investigative. Public prosecutors became “monsterologists”, speculating about masonic lodges and satanism and often appearing borderline paranoid themselves. Mignini maintained that if Narducci’s body was present in his actual grave it must have been swapped twice. Giuttari thought a stone cairn implied satanism. The Perugia and Florence prosecutors started a turf war over who held ultimate responsibility for the case: Mignini opened an investigation into the chief prosecutor in Florence and arrested, and imprisoned, the journalist, Mario Spezi, on charges including libel which were later dropped (Spezi was the co-author of Douglas Preston’s book, The Monster of Florence, which made veiled accusations against the son of one of the original Sardinian suspects). Mignini was later accused, and cleared, of abuse of office.That’s what the Monster story can do to people. Public prosecutors, journalists, film-makers and barflies become fixated. But as we pile up names, facts and distant connections, the story slips from the true crime genre into a fable about the evasiveness of truth.The Monster of Florence is on Netflix from 22 October. Per Elisa, the TV adaptation of Tobias Jones’s true crime book, Blood on the Altar, is on ITVX and Netflix Italia.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTelevisionTV crime dramaDramaNetflixItalyEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

It gives an artist a unique opportunity to work on an epic scale and animate this colossal post-industrial space all the way from piazza floor to girdered roof. Artists haveput the sun in here,built slides, openeda crackfrom one end of the floor to another. YetMáret Ánne Saraseems either scared, repelled or just uninspired by it. She has built a little fort of sticks to hide away from the vastness. That’s the best I can say about her installation – that a small child might enjoy it as a pretend stockade. This easy-to-escape maze of trees actually reminds me of an upmarket adventure playground.It’s hard to understand why Tate Modern didn’t ask Sara for a bit more, well, art. She must have submitted drawings. Did these not suggest it was all going to be rather slight? You do know, they might have gently said, this is the spaceAi Weiwei carpeted with sunflower seeds, andRachel Whiteread filled with a simulacrum of Arctic ice?When you stand on theTurbine Hallbridge looking down, the main part of Sara’s installation is swallowed up in the scale of its setting, the weakly spiralling wooden fences failing to impose themselves at all on the eyes or imagination. You hope it will be better inside. But when you enter, you don’t feel immersed. The neatly cut shafts of raw wood and bark are not that high, nor are they lashed very close together. It’s skimpy. Any atmosphere is dissipated by the views you keep getting of the Turbine Hall.There is no confrontation with the realities of living close to nature. Why not serve reindeer meat, perhaps?This is a thin, unengaged excuse for land art that entirely fails to carry you off into the world of the Sámi that Sara wants you to respect and understand. The Sámi have a long history of oppression by the nation states in which their ancestral lands are enclosed, their shamans even persecuted as witches. So it’s exciting that Sámi artists are now making their culture visible, showing how a tradition of intimacy with nature might inspire a world in climate crisis. I’ve seen powerful, magical contemporary Sámi art. But not here.View image in fullscreen‘Neat arrangements of reindeer skulls’ … the artist with a detail of her work.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianReindeer herding, which plays a crucial economic and ritual role for the Sámi, is represented at the other end of the Turbine Hall by a column of hides flowing up from ground to ceiling. They are suspended between chains and white neon tubes in an imposing yet vacuous minimalist stack. It’s coolly decorative. The animal skins are washed and clean. They look like rugs.The main part of this commission, the weedy tree maze, has well-cleaned and neat arrangements of reindeer skulls and bones. There is no shock or confrontation with the realities of living close to nature in an installation that would suit a hotel lobby. Instead Sara has farmed out the content of the work to the audio recordings about Arctic life on headphones installed by reindeer hide-covered seats. They come with a warning that you will hear descriptions of animal slaughter. But the stories and viewpoints, intercut with bits of plangent Nordic sound, are miserable rather than eye-opening. Of course the point is that climate change makes this fragile ecosystem tougher. But why not confront us with this visually, physically? Butcher and serve reindeer meat perhaps. Just make it real. Somehow.View image in fullscreenAn installation that would suit a hotel lobby … the artist and Queen Sonja of Norway with the reindeer skulls.Photograph: Jack Taylor/ReutersThe biggest problem with the recordings is that you don’t need to be here to hear them. This is essentially a podcast that could be listened to anywhere – though I don’t think it would be Spotify’s biggest hit. And you don’t need to have been to the edge of the Arctic to know that when you leave behind cities and towns, when you are in a natural landscape, there is an immensity, solitude and strangeness that can be overpowering. Land artists as well as landscape painters find ways to make us feel that in a museum, to isolate us among stones or wood or fur and put us in another place,as Andy Goldsworthy’s recent Edinburgh retrospective did. But Sara, with such an extreme and spectacular natural world to share, makes the most desultory gestures towards making us feel what it’s like. She tells instead of shows, lectures instead of lures.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

August and Everything After was our first major label album, so it was a pretty big deal. Our advance was $3,000 each; I bought a 1971 cherry red VW Karmann Ghia convertible and drove it to LA.I would get up every morning and listen toPickin’ Up the Pieces by Poco, which is like the Beatles doing country music. I also had this Benny Goodman album that I was listening to a lot – my dad had picked it up as a free giveaway at a Texaco station when I was a kid.Mr Jones was on a demo we sent to all the record companies, but it was a very difficult song to finish. We didn’t have a great handle on it. It’s not a slow song, but it’s not a straight ahead, fast song either. It gallops along, so you have to get a real feel for it. It’s soul music – closer toStax Recordsthan it is to country.Our drummer couldn’t hear the song how the rest of us did – so T Bone brought in one of his heroes to play itWe looked at a few different producers but when I talked to T Bone Burnett about where the band was at, I felt like he really got it. We had a lot of potential, but I didn’t like the way we sounded – we hadn’t learned to be a band yet. We took away all of the synths and guitar effects. Our drummer Steve Bowman couldn’t hear the song how the rest of us did and so T Bone brought in one of Steve’s heroes, Denny Fongheiser to play on it. It’s a funny story now, but it was rough on Steve.Marty Jones was my best friend and we played in bands together before Counting Crows. His father,David Serva, had made it as a flamenco musician in Spain and he was back in the Bay Area doing a bunch of shows. We went to see him play and hung out with the flamenco troupe from bar to bar, all night. The next morning, I went home and wrote Mr Jones. It’s about me and Marty out that night, wishing we were cool musicians so we could talk to the girls a little better.I think it’s one of the best things I’ve ever written. We played Round Here on Saturday Night Live in 1994 and the record jumped 40 spots a week for five or six weeks. After that, Mr Jones became a big deal.David Immerglück, multi-instrumentalistAdam, David Bryson [guitarist] and I were living together in this warehouse complex in Berkeley in the late 1980s. I had been playing with Camper Van Beethoven, and had this offshoot band called Monks of Doom.I came home one evening and Adam had a new demo that he’d just done with Bryson. He played me this song called Mr Jones. It was done with this Dr Rhythm pocket drum machine that sounded like a video game or some popcorn popping, but his vocals were on another kind of level.Once T Bone got a hold of the band, it was like a complete reinvention of the Counting Crows. It was getting back to the basics of Bob Dylan, Van Morrison and the Band.Adam called me and said: “Hey, man, can you come down and play on this record?” By the time I got there, T Bone had moved us to the studio in Encino, Los Angeles – Tito Jackson’s from the Jackson 5. There were the guitars in there that Dylan had just recorded on.T Bone cued me in to play my guitar behind the tempo of the drums. He said: “If you rush ahead of the drums you sound like an adolescent jacking off too quickly.” He’s got the southern accent because he’s from Texas and his advice was just to imagine that you’ve put your feet up on the mixing board and chewing gum while you’re playing.Counting Crows was in some ways a reaction to grunge. Kurt Cobain killing himself was like its final act. Everyone was on heroin. The object was obliteration, not mind expansion. The nihilism had gone too far, the pendulum swung to something more human and more emotional. Counting Crows was folk and rock with a heavy dose of Van Morrison soul.The song never gets old. Sometimes on stage when I am rocking out with Adam, I will remember that moment when he played me the demo of the song. It’s insane.Counting Crows tour the UK and Ireland from 21 OctoberExplore more on these topicsCultureHow we madePop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Our love of her films is pretty much the only cultural taste I inherited from her. I was about 10 when she first let me watch a VHS off the grown-up shelf. She picked Baby Boom. I might wonder what the appeal of a film about a high-flying 80s businesswoman inheriting a baby was to a kid – were it not so plainly funny, spanning Keaton’s talents from screwball to synonymous with comfort, and a curious lens on adult life. My next Keaton wasFather of the BrideI and II, which made Keaton – and Steve Martin – feel even more like my movie parents.As a teenager I got into her Woody Allen roles, but I confess I’ve never seen most of her serious work. Instead, it’s her dalliances with the indignities of ageing – in Book Club, Hampstead – that I watch with my mum and nana. Keaton felt so ingrained in my life, not to mention showing that you can be lovable as a deeply idiosyncratic woman existing outside conventional beauty standards; I can’t imagine crying about the death of any other actor. Last night, mum texted me to say she had just finished Baby Boom and was about to start Something’s Gotta Give. At that exact moment, I was watching the credits roll on the latter.‘Diane Keaton taught me the power of real world revenge’Benjamin LeeView image in fullscreenRelatably wimpy … Keaton (left), Goldie Hawn and Bette Midler in The First Wives Club.Photograph: Paramount/AllstarI wasn’t having the best time in 1997. I’d started a new school in a new area and the kids just didn’t take to me (I was gawky, living in what they deemed the wrong side of the tracks and, worst of all, clearly, if not openly, gay). I was an easy target for bullies so I needed to find a way to cope with the barrage and while Carrie was on my rewatch rotation, frustratingly telekinesis wasn’t coming easy (I had stared at so many things for so long but alas). Then we rented out The First Wives Club andDiane Keatontaught me the power of real world revenge. She was a relatably wimpy doormat finding strength in getting her own back and I too found hope in wishing, and quietly planning, for the very worst to happen to those who wronged me. There was something empowering about her embracing and justifying bitter, targeted pettiness, a sap who became a survivor and turned into my unlikely high school mascot. When they went low, I went back to The First Wives Club.‘I found her irresistible’Emma BrockesDiane Keaton: ‘I love Woody. And I believe my friend’Read moreWhen I met Diane Keaton 11 years ago in LA, she turned up to the interview fully in role as “Diane Keaton”: that is, as a person of impossible charm and assiduous vagueness – la-di-da – in a bowler hat and fingerless mesh gloves. Keaton was then 68 and still very much in her prime. I found her irresistible, as everyone who met her did, a woman of radical, thrilling, eccentric style in an industry of dull conformists. It took steel to be that way, and around the edges of her persona I thought I could see it. Do you know she made a second income flipping houses? Or that her relationship with Warren Beatty ended because, she wrote in her memoir, “I wanted to be Warren Beatty, not love him”? Celebrity culture didn’t suit her, she told me, because – raise a glass, tip the bowler – “I don’t fit.”‘She was the dream Boomer’Catherine BrayView image in fullscreenSo Diane … Keaton and Jack Nicholson in Something’s Gotta Give (2003).Photograph: Cinematic/AlamyFor a certain cohort of elder millennials and the younger half of Gen X, Diane Keaton was about the same age as your own mother, and for me, she always represented an idealised version of that much-maligned generation, the Boomers. Keaton was the way you want this generation to be: stylish in the 1970s, feminist in the 1980s, hilarious in the 1990s and ageing aspirationally into the new millennium, with Keanu Reeves’ sexy doctor character in Something’s Gotta Give chasing her with lines like: “How great is it for you that I’m not intimidated by your brilliance?” Quite apart from her onscreen roles, she campaigned to protect wildlife, preserve architectural history and was a vocal ally to the LGBTQ+ community. Boomers who wonder why they can’t seem to get it right with their adult kids: be more Diane.‘She walks on the broken glass of contradictions of what it meant to be a modern woman in the late 70s’Priya ElanView image in fullscreenDitzy … Keaton in Looking for Mr Goodbar (1977).Photograph: Paramount/AllstarAs a child I fell for Diane Keaton, the comedic ditz. But it wasn’t until recently I discovered her greatest dramatic performance, Looking for Mr Goodbar. Conventionally read as a parable against the single life, the film is really a fascinatingly nuanced look at one person’s attempt to find themselves through their sexuality, navigating the choppy sea to independence and swimming against a tide of societal expectation. Keaton dispenses with her usual comedy tics to play Theresa Dunn, a scoliosis survivor with a deeply enmeshed Catholic family who enters the pre-Aids singles-bar scene in an attempt to find, well, not love per se, but herself. The film de-centres Theresa from the male characters (who are all monstrous) to portray a character walking on the broken glass of contradictions of what it meant to be a modern woman in the late 70s. As the film builds ominously to its chilling climax, you realise you have been watching one of the greatest horror films ever made.‘I conflated her with my mom’Richard LawsonView image in fullscreenComplex … Keaton in Baby Boom (1987).Photograph: United Artists/AllstarOf the few VHS tapes my childhood household owned, 1987’s Baby Boom was among the most precious. Charles Shyer’s witty and wistful comedy of interruption – about a greed-is-good 1980s Manhattan businesswoman who is suddenly saddled with a distant relative’s infant daughter – was such a favourite of my professionally accomplished mother that I, as a kid, began to conflate fiction with reality. In financier JC Wyatt’s smart haircut, I saw my mom’s. Ditto JC’s sardonic humour, her occasional fluster, the compassionate humanity lying underneath a tough exterior. In some senses, JCwasmy mom and thus Diane Keaton was, too. It was only when I got a bit older and saw more of Keaton’s work that I realised what a departure this was for the actor, a chance to play a bit flintier than she normally did. It’s a performance I’ve revisited again and again over the years, first with my family and then on my own.Baby Boom is a nostalgia vector, to be sure. But it is also a valuable window into the complex talent of a legendary actor often thought of as one thing: a flouncer, a sweet mess, a whimsical dream girl. Those qualities are certainly present in Shyer’s film, gradually teased out as JC’s circumstances realign her priorities. But there is something unique in there, too, a harder facet of Keaton’s ability that I only wish she’d gotten to, or chosen to, explore more of later in her career. At least we’ll always have Baby Boom, with its achingly lovely music underscoring scenes of a woman buckling under dual allegiances, struggling to and then succeeding in finding her own way to have it all – just as Keaton did, just as mom did.‘She seemed hotter than all the bronzed Barbies’Amy FlemingView image in fullscreenDeftly original … Keaton at the Oscars in 2004.Photograph: Francis Specker/AlamyI was spellbound by Diane Keaton when I was a tween in the 80s. I would always watch the Woody Allen films she was in when they came on TV – Sleeper, Annie Hall, Manhattan. As a girl yet to experience a romantic relationship, I found them, and especially her, hilarious and fascinating.What a contrast she was to the women in the TV shows I’d grown up with – The A Team, Wonder Woman, Dukes of Hazzard, Bewitched, Dynasty. She seemed hotter than all of them while dressing androgynously and not showing off bronzed Barbie-doll legs or pouting.Deftly original, her screen presence felt like permission to be weird, contrary, complicated, funny and so deeply into your own interests as to not be remotely intimidated by or in thrall to verbose, idiotic, self-absorbed men.‘Her coltish energy was relatable and deeply desirable’Leslie FelperinAs the child of east coast Jews, I was raised on Woody Allen movies. But that only emphasised how out of sync I felt growing up in California in the 1970s at a time when all the girls aspired to look like Cybill Shepherd, Farrah Fawcett or Suzanne Somers, all assorted shades of ultra-femme blonde. With her menswear borrowings and goofy hats in Annie Hall, Diane Keaton offered a style that was uniquely her own but also eminently copyable for an adolescent girl.View image in fullscreenOddly powerful … Woody Allen and Keaton in Annie Hall (1977).Photograph: United Artists/AllstarThere was something oddly powerful about it too, as if Keaton and all of us young women cloning her style were asserting that we didn’t want to look like the Übermensch power-shiksas the men said they wanted; we wanted to look like the men themselves, the guys who desired Annie in spite of, perhaps because of, all her brittleness, her anhedonia, her performative la-di-da poise. Her coltish energy was relatable and deeply desirable, and you can’t but admire how she evolved that style over the years into something that worked exceedingly well in middle-age, all chunky knitwear and tweed coat – quiet luxury before that was even a phrase.‘I’m still singing and whooping along to her solo’Hollie RichardsonI was a daughter of divorce in the 90s; watching The First Wives Club with my mum was a rite of passage. While Goldie and Bette spit out the big laugh lines, Diane’s doormat Annie – “the one who can’t manage a single declarative sentence” – is most relatable in learning to stand up for herself. And it is so satisfying. The “I’m sorry!” she screams at her husband, his new girlfriend and her therapist is just incredible. But, of course, it’s the final scene, where Annie at last gets the guts to do her solo in You Don’t Own Me, that leaves its joyous mark. “Just let me be myself,” she warbles, shaking out her head. The trio, all fabulously dressed in white, join in and spill out on to the street. My mum sent it to me on Saturday, after the news of Diane’s death, and I’m still singing and whooping along to it with a tear in my eye.‘The scene in Manhattan when she yells at her dog Waffles is an absolute masterclass’Andrew PulverView image in fullscreenRecognisably human … Woody Allen and Diane Keaton in Manhattan (1979).Photograph: Ronald GrantWithout the sardonic delivery of, say, Tina Fey or Sarah Silverman, Diane Keaton was, in retrospect, a tiny bit overmatched in Woody Allen’s “early, funny” comedies; Allen, after all, had some claim to be the funniest human being ever during his early 70s pomp. But if her gag delivery was a little shaky, she more than made up for it with her brilliant acting chops, able to inhabit roles with great skill: you totally believed she was a ditsy future-world poetess addicted to the Orb, or a Russian maiden unhappily married to a herring merchant. She really came into her own as Allen’s films evolved into fully conceived comedy-dramas, with their fully rounded and recognisably human characters, rather than blizzards of skits. Annie Hall suited her well – it seems you could hardly get a cigarette paper between Annie and Keaton’s real-life persona – but Manhattan, her last Allen film until a brief cameo in Radio Days, may be her most accomplished performance. Her character, emotionally needy journalist Mary Wilkie, is introduced superbly, intimidating Allen’s Isaac with a rapid-fire critique of the art show they are visiting (“It was perfectly integrated and it had a marvellous kind of negative capability. The rest of the stuff downstairs was bullshit!”); and the scene in which she simultaneously argues with Michael Murphy’s Yale, fields a call from even more emotionally needy therapist Donny, and yells at her dog Waffles is just an absolute masterclass. Her later comedies were fun, for sure, but never match up to this.‘Keaton fought for, and won, the right to be smart and creative, screwed-up and restless’Charlotte O’SullivanView image in fullscreenAngsty … Allen and Keaton in Annie Hall.Photograph: United Artists/AllstarKeaton doesn’t make a single duff move in Annie Hall, Woody Allen’s zippy, raw ode to doomed love. But she’s especially awesome in the bit where fidgety heroine, Annie, has an out-of-body experience. It’s been established that wannabe singer Annie routinely gets stoned before having intercourse with comedian boyfriend, Alvy (Allen) and that these days, even when high, Annie is finding Alvy less likely to float her boat than sink it. Here, the couple are on holiday in the Hamptons, and a typically hot-to-trot Alvy demands she ditch the drugs. Once sprawled on top of her, he remarks “You seem sorta distant”. When Annie mutters, “I’m fine!” you can all but picture her gritted teeth.Soon her ghost-like inner self is padding out of the bed, sitting on a chair and drawling, “Alvy, do you remember where I put my drawing pad? Because while you two are doing that, I think I’m gonna do some drawing.” Allen is king of zingers, but Keaton more than holds her own by being nakedly real. Keaton lets her shoulders get slumpy. Her voice sounds almost whiny. Meanwhile, watch the expression on the face of her “ghost”. Annie slips from looking stern, to indulgent, and finally (once she remembers her beloved drawing pad) ecstatic. Annie is clearly in a funk and Keaton, with great skill, puts us inside this character’s teeming brain. It’s been said that in Annie Hall the actor isn’t doing a whole lot, because she’s just being herself. What hooey!Annie laid the groundwork for a bunch of other frazzled females on a herky-jerky quest for meaning. Elaine from Seinfeld. Clementine from Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Frances Ha. Fleabag. Insecure’s Issa Dee. It’s not about where these women live (though many of themdocrash around NYC), it’s about a state of mind. Keaton fought for, and won, the right to be smart and creative, screwed-up and restless. Angsty Hall. That Keaton was allowed to bring this magnificently awkward character to life – and that her performance continues to have a cultural impact – makes me happy beyond words.‘A movie star who was entirely the same in real life’Catherine ShoardMy half an hour on the phone with Diane Keaton two years ago could have been quite stressful. There was a delay on the line, she’d asked for topics in advance but hadn’t read them, she only wanted to talk about doors anyway and then her dog vomited up a rock.View image in fullscreenIn-the-moment … Keaton attends a Lakers game in Los Angeles with Jack Nicholson in 2003.Photograph: Vince Bucci/Getty ImagesYet I was left totally beaming. Keaton waswildlynice. I’ve never been complimented so much in 30 minutes. But she was also responsive, curious, quick, surprising (read: all over the shop), warm but not soft (called herself a bitch for having a black Mercedes, was rigorously puritanical about victim culture). Unless it was about dogs – then she was hypnotically soppy.‘God, life is so strange’: Diane Keaton interviewed in 2023 on dogs, doors, wine and why she’s ‘really fancy’Read moreThese qualities have substantial overlap with her movie persona (at least the comedy one – she was also a skilled actor who played loads of prickly people) – and are why everyone loved her. But it was a unique experience to meet a movie star who was just entirely like that in real life. She also seemed, I should say, really cheerful – which tracks. Note how different to her peers she looks onthat iconic Vanity Fair cover, not only in terms of surgery and swaddle, but smile.Outside small children, Keaton was the most in-the-moment and bracingly unreflective person I’ve ever met. Maybe this spontaneity had something to do with why she was quite so magnetic on screen, as well as great company on the blower. I thinkthat interviewwas the last one she did. I’m beyond honoured – and very sad.Explore more on these topicsDiane KeatonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Or treat it, in some way? Will keeping it indoors – hooded so that it remains calm – and then taking it out hunting allow you to reconnect radically with nature in a way that prissy townies will never understand? Or is this just a domesticated festival of cruelty to both bird and prey and a symptom of serious depression?Philippa Lowthorpe’s intriguing, likably performed if slightly precious film – based onHelen Macdonald’s bestselling nature memoir from 2014 – addresses these questions, but can’t quite deliver the Hollywood redemption narrative that it appears to offer: the story of a woman in the depths of melancholy who is helped through the darkness and, we have to assume, out the other side, by her goshawk, whimsically named Mabel. (Macdonald used she/her pronouns at the time of publication and came out as non-binary in 2022.)Audiences might, by the closing credits, think they still don’t quite know what happens to Helen and Mabel in the end, or perhaps at any time, but then again real life can feel messy and unfinished in just this way.Claire Foy plays Macdonald in 2007, a fellow of Jesus College, Cambridge teaching the history and philosophy of science. She adores and hero-worships her dad, the award-winning photographer Alisdair Macdonald, played here by Brendan Gleeson, who inculcated in her a love of nature, and when he dies she is utterly distraught.So Helen conceives a mysterious need to buy a goshawk from a dealer. She gets her expert mate Stuart (Sam Spruell) to help her train it and becomes a superbly eccentric Cambridge don for keeping Mabel on her wrist in college but then deeply worries her mum (Lindsay Duncan) by not leaving the house: Helen and Mabel descending into squalor together.Claire Foy is clearly doing this for real: she has obviously learned to handle a goshawk – and her scenes have a tremendous authenticity. When she looks nervous with Mabel, she is genuinely nervous. When she is thrilled to get Mabel to do something, she is genuinely thrilled. With this bird, there can be no “acting”. The best moment comes when Helen has Mabel in the car, and it looks like Clarice Starling has taken Dr Lecter for a drive.So has the relationship between Helen and Mabel deepened by the end? Is there, in fact, a relationship? Perhaps this could be scheduled in a season of films about people getting up close and personal with predatory animals, along with Loach’s Kes, Hitchcock’s The Birds and Herzog’s Grizzly Man. Mabel’s ice-cold gaze is very scary.H is for Hawk screened at theLondon film festival.Explore more on these topicsLondon film festival 2025London film festivalClaire FoyBrendan GleesonHelen MacdonaldFilm adaptationsreviewsShareReuse this content"

As his paintings go on show, novelistAlan Hollinghurstcelebrates this fierce talentAlan HollinghurstMon 13 Oct 2025 00.01 EDTShareWhat Denton Welch’s life was like before his accident we know from the books he wrote after it. They give a picture of a teenager’s experience unparalleled in its vividness and oddity. Welch was born in Shanghai in 1915, to an American mother and an English businessman father, and brought to England when he was four. In his first book, 1943’s Maiden Voyage, he describes his return to China in 1932, after he’d run away from Repton school in Derbyshire.All his characteristics as a writer are evident from the start: an astonishing candour of response to sensations of all kinds, with childlike repulsion registered as keenly as attraction; a clarity of style unbothered by literary convention; and a fierce solipsism, his sense of others exact and often unsparing, but his overwhelming purpose the record of his own needs, excitements and perceptions: not just things seen but the acutely subjective feelings they stir up in him.For his short1945 novel In Youth Is Pleasure, he wrote in the third person about a holiday he’d spent at the age of 15 with his father and two elder brothers at a country-house hotel in Surrey. The book enlarges our sense of a central paradox in Welch. On the one hand there is his hunger for wild physical sensation, focused here on a scoutmaster camping in the woods nearby with two teenage boys, who stir fantasies of a homoerotic alternative to the conventional family Welch keeps trying to escape from.View image in fullscreenThe Postern, Tunbridge, by Denton Welch.Photograph: Denton Welch. Courtesy John Swarbrooke Fine ArtOn the other there is his yearning for old and poignantly fragile things, his precocious connoisseurship of buildings, decoration, porcelain andobjets de vertu. From childhood he’d developed a very personal taste, pursued through his short adult lifetime in sharp-eyed visits to Kentish junk shops and sales, so that his various makeshift homes became little museums of his sensibility – not of what he called “boringly 18th-century revival taste”, but of vigorous, bright, eclectic non-English taste, “‘Walter Scott’ beautiful”. His assemblage of objects is illustrated in many carefully posed photographs, and reflected more obliquely in a number of his paintings and drawings.There’s a further telling glimpse of Welch, 20 by now, and a student at Goldsmiths school of art in London. This is the beautiful portrait by his friend Gerald Leet, which shows him reclining on a sofa in grey flannels and a yellow roll-neck sweater, but barefoot, and with something a little provocative about him – a boyish odalisque in glasses and warm English clothes. The book loosely held in his left hand, and covering his crotch, is Poems and Essays of Oscar Wilde, in the recent Collins Pocket Classics series. His blue eyes, much paler than in Welch’s self-portraits, have a memorable intensity. They signal his strong private sense of himself, and of what he has it in him to do.View image in fullscreenStriking … Self-Portrait.Photograph: Denton Welch. Courtesy John Swarbrooke Fine ArtAt Goldsmiths, Welch, working mainly in the life room and from casts, had been rather tentatively “feeling his way”. We cannot know how far or in what direction he would have gone if he’d finished his schooling. In June 1935 he was knocked off his bicycle on an open stretch of road south of London, and suffered severe injuries to his spine and a number of internal organs. His months in hospital and in nursing homes are described in his final book A Voice Through a Cloud, not quite finished at the time of his death, aged 33, in 1948. Through those 13 years between accident and death his determination and hunger for life bore fruit in defiantly original creativity, as both writer and artist.Welch’s pictures, some of which have just gone on show at John Swarbrooke Fine Art in London, are as unmistakably his own as his books are, though they tend to be more heavily worked, and are sometimes wonderfully elaborate. The accretion of small units of sensation in his prose has a clear parallel in the way he described working on a picture by a process of addition, starting with a vase of flowers and introducing unanticipated elements as he went on: “Evolution, not planning!”But where the delight of the prose lies in its absolute transparency, that of the most interesting pictures lies in their obscurity. For his own books, he designed elaborate jackets, endpapers, frontispieces, title-pages and complex section-headings involving his private repertoire of living and inanimate things, trees, books, shells, cats and cupids. Often one cannot be sure if an object in a Welch picture is drawn from life or from other depictions of it, in sculpture, porcelain, woodwork or embroidery. The mutating animal and vegetable forms that he had known since childhood in the strapwork and plasterwork of great Elizabethan houses are recreated in his designs. Later drawings and watercolours take on the air of densely worked engravings.Welch’s landscapes are more or less free of the surreal juxtapositions of his vivid and sometimes sinister still lifes; though the late Cottage in the Wood teems with unsettling storybook detail. He disparaged his portraits of other people, which tend to be simple and striking and not notably sympathetic. But there are also seven arresting self-portraits (none exhibited in his lifetime), austere in colouring and composition, some more conscious than others of models reaching back to the Renaissance. Unlike the books’ energetic attempts to recapture his youth, these are sombre confrontations with the present, and with questions, no doubt, about the future too.Strange Discoveries: The Art of Denton Welchis at John Swarbrooke Fine Art in London until 30 OctoberExplore more on these topicsArt and designfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The sibling duo recorded it before their debut had even come out, and so had no idea that 2003’s Gallowsbird’s Bark would receive such wild acclaim: in an 8.4 review, Pitchfork called its shambolic rock’n’roll and frontwoman Eleanor Friedberger’s arcane lyricism a “a mess of weird, undulating musical bits that are hugely intriguing despite not always making a whole shitload of sense”. They were busy fulfilling a five-album deal with Rough Trade, a luxury that was pretty much par for the course as a buzzy Brooklyn band in the time of the Strokes and Interpol – not that their Beefhearty blues had much in common with preening rock revivalism. “I thought they were so bad. I just didn’t give a shit about that stuff,” was one of Eleanor’s withering contributions to the scene oral history Meet Me in the Bathroom.Matthew and Eleanor Friedberger had moved from Chicago: in a classic older brother move, he bought her a guitar and drum kit when she was in her teens, then she roped him into playing with her when he followed her east. “We were a New York band, and there were a lot of bands where that’s what people knew about them,” says Matthew, 52, on a three-way call with his sister, 49. “That seemed to be the distinguishing feature: they were from New York and sort of new-wavy. Why were they meant to be good? I was pleased with the idea that with Blueberry Boat, at least it would be hard to lump us in with them. We wouldn’t seem like an also-ran New York City band wearing leather jackets.”If his comments sound contrarian, even contemptuous, that’s because they are, delightfully so. Matthew knew that their second album would stick out in that scene: Blueberry Boat was a 75-minute, piratical travelogue-cum-rock opera inspired by the Who’s rock suites A Quick One, While He’s Away and Rael. This one scored 9.6 on Pitchfork, racked up reams of coverage from alt-weeklies across the US and got a very noble 1/10 from NME. “It was a lucky experience to get to do something and have people react to it in its tiny corner of music,” he says. “That’s pretty much a dream come true.”Blueberry Boat was always going to stand apart, but Matthew hadn’t anticipated how the scene would have softened within just a year as the nebulous concept of “indie” got Garden State’d. By 2004, he says, they were supporting a lot of bands that were “very indie, but it was like Christian rock, or some sort of religious affiliation, and all of a sudden there would be kids sitting on the floor of some dirty venue”. They supported one such band – Eleanor insists that he doesn’t name them when he is clearly itching to – who told them: “I heard your new record:pretty gay.”One of that band later “asked to see my tits”, at the Sleater-Kinney edition of All Tomorrow’s Parties, adds Eleanor.“This is devolving fast,” she demurs.And if this sounds like ancient history, that’s because it is. The Fiery Furnaces lasted seven studio albums, regularly splitting opinion, and no more so than on2005’s Rehearsing My Choir, on which their grandmother Olga Sarantos narrated her picaresque life story (a CD my dad threatened to throw out of the car window). Being on Rough Trade, coupled with Eleanor’s then-relationship with Franz Ferdinand’s Alex Kapranos, also made them adjuncts to the UK indie scene for a while. After they quietly went on hiatus in 2011, both went solo, albeit Matthew for seven harebrained albums, generally played on one instrument apiece, released in quick succession between 2011 and 2012, and Eleanor for fourbeautiful, gnomic recordsin a 70s songwriterly vein, the last released in 2018. They have just reissued Blueberry Boat for a belated 20th anniversary repress, having got the licence back from Rough Trade, and are about to embark on a brief US-EU tour in celebration.View image in fullscreenAnarchic and unique … the Fiery Furnaces performing in New York City in 2010.Photograph: Theo Wargo/WireImageThey felt like one of the most idiosyncratic and daring bands of the 00s, creators of an anarchic and unique American songbook. Those of us who loved them really, really loved them. Among their forthcoming dates are support slots with Destroyer, AKA Canadian musician Dan Bejar, whom Eleanor has supported previously. When he first heard them, he says, he was “struck by the arrangements which were equal part reckless abandon and psychotic rigour. Then the language just got weirder and denser and dazzling. To the point that, in a lot of ways, it felt like an attack on the singer. Luckily, in this case, the singer was probably the best American rock’n’roll singer of the 21st century. So she seemed, you know, unfazed.”But today the band has just 17,000 monthly Spotify listeners. Searching “fiery furnaces” on TikTok brings up two relevant clips and dozens more Bible-bashers citing Daniel 3:8-25. It makes Blueberry Boat feel like one of the first great lost records of the century. “If the record has lived on in some big way, I haven’t noticed it,” says Matthew. It’s a rare disappearing act in an age where everything is perpetually available. Neither Friedberger is surprised or disappointed, describing themselves as temperamentally unsuited to success. “I feel like we both only have a certain capacity for trying to expose ourselves,” says Eleanor. “To be in public, to share things.”Until2006’s Bitter Tea, the Furnaces’ music seemed to demonstrably intensify with each record: as if pushing things as hard as they could while living on borrowed time. “Oh yeah, that was my aim!” Matthew laughs. As a teenager in the 80s, in books such as The Rolling Stone Album Guide, “you read about Small Faces, the Clash – you have two, three, four years and you want to make as much as possible. And see what happens – you wanna go and mix up the medicine and see what basement you can blow up.”Writing was the only part they really thought about. “It’s kind of shocking to see how much we didn’t take it seriously, except for the music,” says Eleanor. “I’d hear other acts talk about ‘my management’ and we just never had that attitude. Maybe that was to our detriment, but we just don’t have that in us.”View image in fullscreen‘It’s shocking to see how much we didn’t take it seriously, except for the music’ … Matthew and Eleanor Friedberger pictured in 2004.Photograph: Steve GullickBeing siblings made striving and contrivance impossible, says Matthew. “In another band, you can have this wonderful experience working with each other because you can really remake yourself and be another person, and project that to the people who are interested in you. We definitely weren’t ever going to do that. Being brother and sister, we’re not going to be so impressed with each other.”Back in the day, fans andcritics were fascinated by their prickly dynamic. Today, Eleanor generally stays quiet while her brother’s conversational digressions gather pace. Their rehearsals for their forthcoming tour dates are more likely to be spent talking about “family issues with our parents”, says Eleanor.When it comes to settling debates, says Matthew: “If anything, it’s too polite a committee.”“I would say we talk too much and there’s more talking than action,” says Eleanor. “That would be my complaint.”“You’d often say that in any situation,” says Matthew.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

They put out a new single, Down at the So and So on Somewhere, on Jack White’s Third Man Records that year, and played a couple of dates in 2021, but the fragments of music Matthew had written remained unfinished. “I didn’t know what to write for Eleanor,” he says. “I didn’t know how to push and actually finish something.”The Fiery Furnaces: Down at the So and So on Somewhere – videoTo do so, he says, “it’s fun to imagine a setting. Rock band is a performance style: you imagine the places you’re playing, who is going to be there. If you’re hazy about all that, it becomes much harder to make the decisions to actually finish something that you like. If you’re not going to show [recordings], you don’t finish them. Presumably that’s self-defence – if you don’t finish it, you can imagine it’s better than it is. That’s why a lot of people put things in their drawer.”They played with such a big band in 2021, he says, that it felt “impersonal” to him. “It was like I was standing on the side of the stage doing the lighting even though I was playing the whole time.”Eleanor had the inverse experience. “At the last show we did in Los Angeles, it felt so good – the sound, how I was singing – that I thought, if this is the last time I ever stand on stage, I’m going to remember this moment.” After her last solo tour, which finished in early 2020, she had thought: “Maybe I don’t want to do this any more.” It was the first time she had got off the treadmill since the band started. “And for all the reasons one can imagine – the music industry is terrible, it’s more and more expensive to travel and tour, it’s harder to make money. I’d also just moved in with someone and had never really lived in a home with someone before.”“Except your parents and your brother!” Matthew corrects her.Now, she’s excited about revisiting her demos and playing again, she says. The band’s forthcoming shows will be far more intimate, with just the two of them on stage. “If it’s just the piano and two people singing, there’s more freedom to make really bad mistakes and for people to notice it and see if it’s stimulating to them or not,” says Matthew. “So that’s fun.”‘The breakup was like an amputation that saves you’: Cate Le Bon on healing from heartache and her heavy new albumRead moreIf they were out of time in the 00s, and disappeared from view in the 2010s, maybe they are better suited to existing now, they theorise. “You can be so much weirder now and no one thinks anything of it,” says Eleanor.In trademark fashion, Matthew calls this “the Balkanisation of particularisation in these endlessly, specifically curated lives that people are supposed to lead”.As much as the Furnaces seemed like one-offs in the 00s, Stereogum’s 20th anniversary retrospective on Blueberry Boat made the smart point that“high-concept, big-swing”records by the likes of Sufjan Stevens, Wilco, the Flaming Lips, even the Streets abounded at the time. They exchange various theories about why – breaking genre conventions, technology – until Matthew lands on a conclusion. “I think people felt empowered to waste people’s time in a more aggressive way,” he says. “That’s exciting.”The reissue of Blueberry Boat is out now onEverything Nice.

No wonder it’s sparking an outpouring of sadnessEleanor BiggsMon 13 Oct 2025 05.25 EDTLast modified on Mon 13 Oct 2025 05.36 EDTShareWhen I discovered Marc Maron’s influential podcast WTF, I was working in a pub. It was a weird time for me. I had just left university and had absolutely no idea what I was doing with my life, so I moved back home and took on shifts as a waitress and chamber maid.Podcasts became an escape from my reality of changing sheets on king-sized beds, folding hospital corners and rearranging tiny bottles of shampoo – and none more so thanMarc Maron’s WTF.I don’t know how I found it, or why. I don’t think I’d ever even heard of Marc Maron – a grumpy middle-aged standup comedian – before I found the podcast, let alone half the people he interviewed; comedians, musicians, actors in indie films. But its long-form interview format taught me things and made me laugh. And the podcast became – on my long walks to and from shifts, stinking of bleach and the pub’s deep fat fryer, wondering what on earth I was going to do next – a friend to me.That was more than eight years ago, and what I ended up doing next was, funnily enough, becoming a podcast producer. I now work on the Guardian’s daily news and current affairspodcast Today in Focus.Undoubtedly, one of the things that inspired me to pursue this career was WTF, the rambling interview show which had already been going for nine years by the time I found it.Over time, the show has become a comfort blanket for me. No matter who Maron is speaking to, there is a rhythm to the interview. For example – healways, alwaysshares the story of his early life with guests, telling it like the listener (and the guest) is hearing it for the first time and not the 1,600th (quickfire: Jewish, born in New Jersey, grew up in New Mexico, younger brother …). There are often tales about his love-hate relationship with his former boss, Mitzi, at the Comedy Store, and whenever he speaks to an actor he’ll tell them how he loves acting but can’t stand waiting in his trailer.Maron is a standup – these are his bits. But, more often than not over the course of an episode, a different kind of storyteller and interviewer emerges – vulnerable and compelling, with a tone that’s kept me coming back all these years.View image in fullscreenMaron with guest President Barack Obama in 2015.Photograph: Pete Souza/The White HouseIn recent times he has mused on the climate crisis, the rise of fascism and his plans to move to Canada in the wake of Trump’s re-election; he has meditated on grief (after the sudden death of his partner, Lynn Shelton, in 2020), ageing, creativity, friendship and love. Oh, and cats. Maronlovescats.After years of putting out two episodes a week to a loyal listenership, in June, Maron announced that he and his producer were ending the podcast.“We’ve decided that we had a great run,” he told us. “Basically, it’s time, folks. It’s time. WTF is coming to an end.”When I heard Maron say these words I gasped. I couldn’t believe it. No matter what was going on in my life, there had always been a new episode to escape into, Maron’s craggy face staring at me from the podcast tile. But now, there wouldn’t be.As I write, there is just one episode of WTF left. Too scared at the tears listening to the final episode might unleash, I’ve been reading the Spotify comments instead. I’m not the only listener who’s feeling emotional.“Sixty-year-old carpenter in south London, sat in his van in tears … thanks for the years, Marc …”“1685 episodes. You could listen to one a day and it would take 4.5 years to listen to them all …”View image in fullscreenMarc Maron at home in Los Angeles.Photograph: Barry J Holmes/The GuardianLots of the comments focus on the role that Maron, or his voice at least, has played in listeners’ lives over the past 16 years. Commenters write about how they became fans while changing their newborns’ nappies, with those same kids now starting secondary school. Others say the podcast has been a constant in their lives, helping them survive heartbreak and change.One listener writes that losing WTF is like losing the voice of a goofy uncle or older brother. Another, that it’s like losing a friend.I feel the same. This show taught me the kind of honesty and intimacy that’s possible in podcasting, and gave me comfort when little else did. WTF may be ending, but it totally changed the podcast landscape – and will leave a lasting impression on thousands of listeners’ lives.Explore more on these topicsPodcastsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Two episodes will air each week in the following two weeks. There will also be a separate film of the final concert of the Eras tour at Vancouver’s BC Place, entitled The Eras Tour | The Final Show, airing from 12 December.Taylor Swift scores second-biggest UK charts opening week ever with The Life of a ShowgirlRead more“It was the End of an Era and we knew it,” Swift wrote on Instagram, announcing the projects. “We wanted to remember every moment leading up to the culmination of the most important and intense chapter of our lives, so we allowed film-makers to capture this tour and all the stories woven throughout it as it wound down. And to film the final show in its entirety.”Between March 2023 and December 2024, Eras encompassed 149 concerts across five continents and became the highest-grossing concert tour in history, with over $2bn in ticket sales. With a runtime of more than three and a half hours, and later described by Swift as “absolutely the most challenging thing I’ve ever done in my life”, its setlist drew from all but one of Swift’s studio albums, with the later shows adding material from her 2024 albumThe Tortured Poets Department.Swift has already released a filmed version of the tour, entitledTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour, but its October 2023 release date meant it did not feature The Tortured Poets Department material. It became the highest-grossing tour film of all time, earning $267m from its global run in cinemas.It was later available to stream on Disney+. Financial terms for that deal, and for the new filmed projects, have not been made public.With Swift’s reference to “all the stories woven throughout [Eras] as it wound down”, the series could document the creation of her latest album The Life of a Showgirl, which was made in part during the Eras tour. “What it ended up doing was like reinvigorating every single aspect of my life, including the tour,” she has said.Taylor Swift: The Life of a Showgirl review – dull razzle-dazzle from a star who seems frazzledRead moreThe Life of a Showgirl, her 12th studio album, was released on 3 October and has been one of Swift’s most commercially successful but critically divisive albums.It has the largest single-week sales of any album in US history,beating the record set by Adele’s 25, and thesecond-highest in UK history,behind Ed Sheeran’s ÷. Butthe Guardian’s Alexis Petridis wrotethat the album has a “distinct lack of undeniable hooks and nailed-on melodies” – one of a number of relatively rare negative reviews for Swift, with Pitchfork, the Standard and others also criticising the album.Explore more on these topicsTaylor SwiftPop and rockTelevisionDisney+News CorporationnewsShareReuse this content"

One of her best-loved songs and hailed as “one of the greatest songs of all time” by Rolling Stone, itbecame a hit all over again in 2022when it featured in the fourth season of the US TV series Stranger Things.Maggi Hambling, once described as the “original bad girl of art” and Peter Doig,whose paintings have sold for millions, are among those to contribute works interpreting the lyric for the fundraiser Sound & Vision, named after David Bowie’s 1977 hit.All the works will feature in an online auction, from 28 October to 13 November, with starting bids at £100, to raise money forthe charity War Child, which protects, educates, and stands up for the rights of children living in war zones.View image in fullscreenMidnight Wave by Maggi Hambling.Photograph: Maggi HamblingAnnouncing the project, Bush said: “All wars leave horrific scars; ruined lives, families ripped apart, life-changing injuries, trauma, and loss on a massive scale – but it’s the children who suffer the most in so many ways. Their past, present and future melt away into fear and uncertainty.“It is more important than ever we support War Child and their invaluable work providing immediate aid to children caught in conflict all over the world including in Ukraine, Gaza, Sudan and Syria. Projects like Sound & Vision harness the power of art and music to make a real difference to children living through war.”View image in fullscreenKate Bush photographed in London, 1978.Photograph: Gered Mankowitz/Iconic ImagesDoig has contributed two signed pieces: The Hill, on the theme of the crucifixion, and Child of War depicting a child looking at a figure on horseback. Hambling’s contribution is titled Midnight Wave.Charlie Calder-Potts, Britain’s youngest female official war artist who worked with the British army in Afghanistan, and who has since travelled the world creating work in Iran, Pakistan, Tajikistan and at Yazidi refugee camps in Iraq, has created a new work.So too have Corbin Shaw, known for textiles, prints and flags capturing modern-day Britishness through ancient crafts; Susie Hamilton, a former artist-in-residence at St Paul’s Cathedral whose portraits of doctors, nurses and patients facing Covid-19 are held by the Science Museum; and Unskilled Worker, AKA Helen Downie, who discovered painting aged 48 and shot to industry-wide fame, growing an Instagram following of more than 280,000 followers.The exhibition, curated byArton a Postcard and sponsored by DHL, will go on display at Iconic Images Gallery in Piccadilly, London, from 4-8 November. Contributors also include LUAP, Hannah Lim, Kate McCrickard, Erin Lawlor, Gill Button, Adam Dix, David Harrison, Gideon Rubin, Boo Saville, Shezad Dawood, Natalia González Martín, while Peter Messer and Nick Grindrod will return after taking part in last year’s Sound & Vision.View image in fullscreenAnd If I Only Could I’d Make a Deal With God by Susie Hamilton.Photograph: Susie HamiltonBush follows in the footsteps of Bowie as a supporter of War Child. Bowie helped curate a fundraising exhibition for the charity in 1994 calledLittle Pieces from Big Stars,which 30 years later was the inspiration for the first Sound & Vision last year with artists responding to the lyric “We like dancing and we look divine” from his song Rebel Rebel.The curator Gemma Peppé, the founder of Art on a Postcard, said Bush’s lyric had “prompted some great contemporary artists to produce some vibrant and evocative work”. She said Doig had asked if he could take part. “I nearly fell off my chair. That’s a testament to the great work War Child does.”Charlotte Nimmo from War Child UK, which is present in a number of active conflict zones including Ukraine and Gaza, said: “We are delighted to announce that Sound & Vision is returning, this year inspired by lyrics from the incredible Kate Bush. This is made possible thanks to the immense generosity of both Kate and her team, as well as the iconic artists that are creating and donating pieces inspired by Kate’s lyrics.War Child’s Sound & Vision 2025 will be exhibited at Iconic Images Gallery from 4-8 November.

His plays are performed. His words are quoted. He reclines in effigy on both the Strand and the King’s Road. He even has a commemorative window in Westminster Abbey. But it was not always so.When he died in Paris, in 1900, aged just 46, the obituaries were not generous. There was a feeling of relief that an embarrassing figure had been removed the scene, and a general hope that he and his works would soon be forgotten. The Pall Mall Gazette suggested that nothing he wrote had “the strength to endure”.Just five years before, he had been the toast of London, with two successful plays running in the West End, but his arrest and conviction on charges of “gross indecency with male persons” had precipitated a very spectacular fall. Two years in prison were followed by three years of disgrace, continental exile, poverty and declining health, before the sad end at the modest Hotel d’Alsace.Only the hotel staff and handful of old friends attended the funeral, even fewer made the trip to the cemetery at Bagneux, in the outer suburbs, to see him interred. His long-suffering wife, Constance, had predeceased him, and although his two sons – 15-year-old Cyril and 14-year-old Vyvyan, survived, they were at schools in England, camouflaged with the adopted surname “Holland”, and ignorant of their father’s whereabouts. Indeed, they had been led to believe – by their strait-laced maternal relatives – that their father was already dead.The story of Oscar’s glorious posthumous rehabilitation, together with the long shadow that he cast over his two sons and continues to cast over his single grandchild, is the subject of this fascinating book – written, with an engaging combination of wit, personal candour and scholarly rigour, by the grandchild himself, Merlin Holland.The strands are both cultural and personal, and Holland plaits them together with a deft hand. Strict chronology is eschewed, in favour of a more episodic approach. This occasions some minor moments of repetition but produces a clearer sense of the unfolding drama. And the storyisdramatic, touched with comedy, tragedy, farce and considerable pathos.The struggle to secure Wilde’s legacy in the decade-and-a-half after his death is dominated by the figure of Robbie Ross, the “devoted friend” who brought Wilde’s estate back from the bankruptcy into which it had been plunged at the time of his fall. He facilitated experimental German productions of Salome, oversaw a multi-volume edition of The Works of Oscar Wilde, encouraged the young Arthur Ransome to write a first critical study of Wilde’s work, and coordinated the ambitious project to move Oscar’s grave to the fashionable Parisian cemetery, Père-Lachaise, and have it marked with a magnificent monument by the sculptor Jacob Epstein (paid for by a wealthy female admirer of Wilde’s work).Plans for John Gielgud to unveil the blue plaque on the front of Wilde’s Tite Street house were derailed when he was arrested for cottagingThis tomb, with its “demon angel” figure , plays a recurrent and entertaining role in the book, from the moment the French authorities cover it with tarpaulin due to anxieties about the sculpture’s nudity, to the later mysterious disappearance of the sculpture’s prominent “member” (which had by then become smoothed by frequent caresses); and – more recently – the author’s own battles with French bureaucracy to get the tomb listed as a monument to help protect it from the myriad lipstick kisses planted by enthusiastic votaries.In all his efforts Ross was busily hindered by the antagonism of his one-time friend (and Oscar’s former lover),Lord Alfred Douglas, who in the years following Wilde’s death had renounced his past, converted to Roman Catholicism, and married. His jealousy of Ross, and his ire at being continually presented as the “evil genius” of Wilde’s life, fuelled a ceaseless round of spite and litigation.And this Punch and Judy show, as Holland terms it, continued after Ross’s early death. Indeed, up until Douglas’s own demise in 1945 anyone who chose to write about Wilde might find themselves in the litigious lord’s crosshairs; even Vyvyan Holland was not immune.This, though, was only one of the strains faced by Oscar’s children as they confronted their paternal inheritance. The book offers poignant descriptions of their lonely childhoods – they were kept apart, sent to different schools, quartered with different friends and relations. Cyril, older and aware of the reasons for his father’s disgrace, retreated into convention. Determined to “wipe the stain away”, he joined the Royal Artillery straight after school and died from a sniper’s bullet on the Western Front in 1915, aged 30.Vyvyan, sensitive and literary, had a more complex relationship with his father’s legacy. His own literary career, as a respected translator from French, was supported by the substantial royalties that in time came from the estate - especially after the actor-manager George Alexander bequeathed back the rights toThe Importance of Being EarnestandLady Windermere’s Fan. But even this created its own problems.The late 1940s were bumper years, with major film productions and West End revivals of the plays, but they coincided with the postwar Labour government’s imposition of a one-off 50% levy on investment income. Vyvyan was landed with a tax bill for £3,600 at the very moment his own income was dwindling and the copyright on Wilde’s published works was approaching its end. He struggled to keep up, (writing an autobiography, Son of Oscar Wilde, in an effort to earn money) but in 1955 was declared bankrupt.It was an embarrassment that took place against the accelerating growth of his father’s reputation as both writer and cultural icon. Such increasing status stimulated, among other things, a long (and continuing) cavalcade of Wildean forgeries, fabrications and fantasies. They are all entertainingly detailed here, including the spiritualist volume The Ghost Epigrams of Oscar Wilde with arresting apercus, such as, “Love, like the measles, attacks only the young.”But the upward path was not always smooth. For most of the 20th century, Wilde’s growing reputation remained subject to periodic eclipse by the lingering scandal of his sexuality – a scandal that had a way of coming into focus at inopportune moments. Plans for John Gielgud to unveil the blue plaque on the front of Wilde’s Tite Street house were derailed when he was arrested for cottaging. (The task was delegated to Compton Mackenzie.) If Vyvyan became wearily accustomed to such setbacks, they greatly distressed his Australian wife, Thelma, who, as a skincare specialist with the firm Cyclax, gave beauty advice to the young Queen Elizabeth, and was anxious to whitewash the family history.It was Merlin’s growing anxieties about this project – which Thelma continued after Vyvyan’s death in 1967 - that gradually drew him into the Wildean world. After a childhood trying to avoid what seemed an embarrassing association, and a post-university career in academic publishing in the Middle East, he came to realise that honesty was what was needed. If he was going to acknowledge his grandfather it must be not as a mere “living link” with the past, but as an informed expert. And that is what he has become: the author of several important books of Wildean history and historiography – including this one.‘How far do you go in the depiction of gay lovemaking?’: Christopher Wheeldon on his new Oscar Wilde balletRead moreNot that the DNA is unimportant. He gives a hair-raising account of attending Moscow Pride in 2006, caught between neo-fascist thugs and the Russian riot police. He had gone, at the entreaty of the organisers, as “the grandson of Oscar Wilde”. It was a courageous gesture, but also a vivid example of his grandfather’s continuing and ever-evolving power. Wilde’s afterlife remains almost as rich and entertaining as his life.Matthew Sturgis is the author of Oscar: A Life (Head of Zeus).

Food courier protagonist, Souleymane, is hopefully in the process of altering his destiny, and this key scene is carried by fantastic acting fromAbou Sangaré: trembling violently as a lifetime’s tension and struggle, as well as the daily grind of an app wage slave, comes pouring out.Souleymane is a kind of every-immigrant, clinging on at the margins of the French capital. Hailing fromGuinea, he sublets the delivery app account of Cameroonian Emmanuel (Emmanuel Yovanie) in order to work. Under constant pressure to meet food delivery targets, he needs money in order to pay fellow Guinean Barry (Alpha Oumar Sow), who is coaching him how to pass his asylum interview the day after next. But the harassed Souleymane struggles to reproduce the details of the political repression story that Barry recommends he tell.Riding shotgun with Souleymane as he crosses the Parisian boulevards, the film features some of the hairiest cycling scenes since Buster Keaton. Director Boris Lojkine shoots France’s ever-shifting capital with hazy impressionistic beauty, occasionally breaking out of shallow focus with a sobering crystalline composition to situate his protagonist in this capitalist warren. But Souleymane is the constant focal point and in a precarious position – not just traffic-wise, but also economically and emotionally. As he needily bugs the app’s call centre, then loses his rag with a restaurateur behind on his orders, the film watches these micro-humiliations steadily erode his soul.In its intimate accompaniment of an immigrant trying to make ends meet, Lojkine’s film is reminiscent ofRamin Bahrani’s 2005 New York-set drama Man Push Cart– though it’s even less sentimental in the full swing of the digital age, often curtly ending scenes as if on the same tight schedule as Souleymane. But the issues are fundamentally the same: the enforced invisibility of a class of economic migrants who are now so numerous that many game the system, doubling their exploitation. Sangaré’s exemplary, unfeigned performance helps them speak.Souleymane’s Story is in UK and Irish cinemas from 17 October.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsMigrationParisFranceGuineaAfricareviewsShareReuse this content"

Her life is split between borders and constant goodbyes, a transient emotional state vividly captured in Maria Lisa Pichler and Lukas Schöffel’s intimate portrait. In the opening scene, Maria drives along her local roads, pointing out the houses left empty by those who have moved abroad for work opportunities. Under the precarious forces of economy, it seems as if a whole community is gradually evaporating.Structured around Maria’s monthly drives, the film juxtaposes her home life with her professional duties. Simple scenes of family gatherings bristle with tension. Maria’s son Ionuț laments her absence, which he deems to be a sign of emotional neglect. But as the primary breadwinner Maria takes on the gruelling job to provide a better future for her children. In another poignant parallel, we see her ageing parents whose ramshackle farmhouse contrasts sharply with the middle-class apartments of her Austrian clients. There’s a bitter irony in how Maria makes a living by caring for other people’s relatives, while unable to fully tend to her own.Misunderstood by her loved ones at home and ostracised by anti-migrant rhetoric in Austria, Maria finds herself locked in an impossible paradox with no easy answer. The only people who can fully understand her predicament are fellow Romanian workers who, like her, live between worlds. The current reality of global wealth inequality further intensifies the cycle of separation. In a crucial scene between Maria’s teenage children and their friends, many have already spoken of migrating despite their deep love for their home country. While there are no easy solutions to the struggles of migrant workers, the film lends a beautifully human touch to a topic so often reduced to mere statistics.Tomorrow I Leave is on True Story from 17 October.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsRomaniaAustriaMigrationCare workersSocial carereviewsShareReuse this content"

Most of the audience getting down this afternoon – it’s one of the show’s four weekly matinees – probably know these songs from first time round. The 12in records used to frame the stage, their centre labels glowing in candy colours, are a testament to the discography at director-choreographer Lisa Stevens’ disposal.Twenty numbers arranged by Mark Crossland are spread across an 80-minute production which doesn’t give much space for character development. So it is maddening to discover that this is also another one ofthose showsin which the question of how to tell the story becomes an ongoing discussion for the characters on stage rather than a matter for the writers’ room. The band’s leader Harry Wayne Casey (“KC”), played by Ross Harmon, has barely been introduced before his pal Dee (Paige Fenlon) is schooling him on11 o’clock numbersand musical-theatre trends.The tale of how Casey formed a band and lifelong friendships, while his gang fall in and out of love with each other, is always well sung but continually interrupted by their tedious conversations about “milieu” and “advancing the plot” with references to musical sensations includingHamilton. Get Down Tonight can only come off poorly from such comparisons, and scenes in a recording studio (with irresistible bass by Otto Williams) and of the group’s flashpoints have further unfortunate parallels to the far superiorThe Harder They ComeandStereophonicrespectively.View image in fullscreenBoogie shoes … Ross Harmon as Harry Wayne “KC” Casey with the ensemble.Photograph: Danny KaanNevertheless, several songs are cleverly used to underline the plot – notably the love triangle between Casey, Orly (Adam Taylor) and Gina (Annabelle Terry) which comes to a head during a nightclubbing scene that stretches across Shake Your Booty and That’s the Way (I Like It). There are smooth routines with arm rolls and disco fingers, performed in shimmering jumpsuits and sparkly platform shoes by an ensemble who accompany the principal quartet of actors. The era’s other fashions of chiffon and denim are on display in fuggy pot-smoking scenes that include Dee embracing a gatefold cover of Jim Morrison and thin discussions of the war in Vietnam. More could be made of how KC and the Sunshine Band, formed in Florida, provided an alternative to what the show describes as an industry dominated by New York and Los Angeles.Neither JF Lawton’s book nor the lyrics by Casey – who was involved in developing this often over-sentimental show – have enough depth to prevent an overall feel of disco week on Strictly with the occasional gyrating ambush from Magic Mike Live. The production, presented at the Edinburgh fringe in 2024 under the title Who Do Ya Love?, has a set by Bretta Gerecke, lighting by Jai Morjaria and costumes based on original designs by Tom Rogers that all conjure dancefloor hedonism, but you never lose yourself in the story or the music.AtCharing Cross theatre, London, until 15 NovemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreDiscoMusicalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Each is potentially a work of astonishing individual impact, yet they can come together to form something even greater than the sum of their parts.Perhaps it’s in the way that each sonata seems to pick up on and amplify the conflicts, beauties and struggles of the one before. Op 109 came to its close above a low rumble that Uchida made sound like an earthquake –Beethovenmust have thought of sound as something to be felt as well as heard. When similar deep grumbles recurred in the first movement of Op 110 – gentler and unquiet this time, contrasting with tender chords above – they felt like a recollection. The forthright little fugue variation in Op 109 found its fully grown counterpart in the huge culmination of Op 110, and the peace that was so hard won at the end of Op 111 felt like a resolution of a whole evening’s music, not just one sonata.Her Steinway sounding warm and mellow, Uchida was more generous with the sustaining pedal than some pianists, and set up some intriguing juxtapositions of mystery and decisiveness. In the slow waltz that forms the first variation of the Op 109 finale, she gave the imaginary dancers time to place their steps, but other than this she rarely lingered. The prevailing mood was of clarity and propulsive energy; perhaps when she recorded these sonatas nearly 20 years ago, she tackled the brief fast movements with more urgency, yet in this performance they still sounded dangerous and exhilarating.Late in the second and final movement, Uchida reached a trill high up on the keyboard, and stretched it out until it seemed she might never move away; then the ending unfolded around it, leading to a peace that was cathartically hard won. At the very end, she held us in silence – then gave a little start and grinned as if she’d been having a game, seeing how long she could keep us enthralled. Naturally, she had won.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicMitsuko UchidaWigmore HallreviewsShareReuse this content"

Fighter jets scorch over head, tanks rumble by, the side of a building is obliterated by a rocket-propelled grenade. While Call of Duty has always focused its online matches on close skirmishes, Battlefield 6 makes you feel part of a vast military offensive, bewildering and ear-shattering, with even the quiet moments punctuated by the pop-pop of distance rifle fire, the shouts of orders and the cries for medics.It’s well known that EA’s long-running first-person shooter series has hit trouble over the last couple of years, with futuristic instalmentBattlefield 2042widely considered a disappointment. So this time round, the development team (a collective of studios including original creator DICE) has gone back to the excellent Battlefield 4 for inspiration, where the emphasis was on authentic-feeling modern military warfare on large maps with lots of players. As ever, Battlefield 6 gives you the choice of four classes – Assault, Support, Engineer and Recon – each with its own weapons and gadgets, all of which can be upgraded and customised as you level up your soldier and gain experience. It’s a hybrid system taking elements of older Battlefields as well as newer Call of Duty titles, where the Gunsmith system revolutionised weapon personalisation for first-person online shooters.View image in fullscreenBrooklyn at war … Battlefield 6.Photograph: Electronic ArtsThe best online modes are the big ones, such as Conquest and Breakthrough, which focus on taking swathes of territory from the other team by holding down objective points. There are small and mid-sized modes, too, including King of the Hill and Domination, but to Battlefield veterans they feel like gestures to a different school of thought. From the very beginning – 2002’s seminal Battlefield 1942 – this series has encouraged tactical, thoughtful play, gathering a few comrades and sneaking up on enemy bases, timing attacks with helicopter support, wearing down defences. In a good session there maybe several minutes where you are hiking across the map, or crawling towards a well-defended building. The meat-grinder feel of Call of Duty, with its turbo-charged pace and five-second shootouts, feels a long way away.Yet, when you’re caught in a battle in this game, it is exhilarating. Whether you’re on the streets of Brooklyn or the sands of Cairo, chunks of exploded masonry fly by, bullets strafe metal, tanks explode in fiery billows of flame and smoke. The visuals and sound design are astonishingly good, capturing the grainy, shaky-cam faux-documentary style of Generation Kill or Warfare, rather than the choreographed action movie carnage of CoD. If you’re lucky enough to get on a good team (and I really recommend playing with at least one or two friends), a real sense of underfire camaraderie develops.The weak point is the game’s superfluous Campaign mode, a hackneyed techno thriller set in the near future where a private military company is aiming to take control of the world, and only a hardy team of American-controlled spec-ops warriors can stop them. It’s a tired setup – and something of a cop out. By making the baddie a fictitious military corporation, the developers can pretend the story is meaningful and relevant without having to, God forbid, make a political point or implicate a country that may well be a market for the game – or an investor in Electronic Arts. It’s also hard to maintain any interest in a group of Identi-Kit tough guys who constantly spout lines such as: “There ain’t no red tape out here,” and (while staking out an enemy base on sunny Gibraltar): “I don’t know what’s more impressive, the view or the firepower.” When lead character Murphy says to a comrade: “There ain’t nobody I’d rather be in this fight with,” I wished there was an option to defect.Don’t let that put you off. For the most part, Battlefield 6 is a brilliant return to form, a thrilling, almost operatic shooter experience, which manages to combine deafening combat with tactical subtlety. How it will fit into the modern landscape of hero shooters and battle royale blast-em-ups is anyone’s guess – it deserves a shot, that’s for sure.Battlefield 6 is out now, £65Explore more on these topicsGamesPlayStation 5Xbox series S/XPCShooting gamesMMORPGreviewsShareReuse this content"

As a child I remember the feisty women behind the bar at the pubs where my dad used to drink, the punk-haired cafe owner and the redoubtable librarian always up for a noisy chat when we checked out our books. That was before it became known as the lesbian capital of the UK (my gay cousin from Australia once told me she was coming to Europe: “Hebden Bridge?” I asked. “How did you know?” she gasped).Now the lass spirit of the West Yorkshire town is on display again, this time in Sally “Happy Valley” Wainwright’s new BBC One dramaRiot Women, which tells the story of a group of women in their late 50s who set up a rock band.Hebden Bridge location mapLike me, Wainwright grew up in Calderdale; like me, she’s 62. So she too must remember the days when Hebden Bridge was more famous for its flat-capped eccentricity than its edgy coolness. At university (and spookily, Wainwright and I were both at York, though we didn’t know one another), I would regularly boast that I lived close to where poet Ted Hughes grew up (he was born in Mytholmroyd, just along the valley) and near to where his erstwhile wife and fellow poet Sylvia Plath was buried (Heptonstall, on the hill above Hebden Bridge). But I certainly didn’t dwell on the smoky, cramped pubs or the greasy spoon cafes or the unremarkable warehouse-like unbranded store where my mum bought the groceries. The town felt deeply frumpy back then.In a town with a penchant for pop-up shops, one of the joys of visiting Hebden Bridge regularly is that it’s never the same twiceThings are different today. I name-drop the Nisa Local on Crown Street, where my mum buys her Guardian, because in Happy Valley it’s where Neil, the partner of Catherine Cawood’s sister, worked in Happy Valley. More thrillingly, my mother’s flat is at the top of the street where Cawood (played magnificently by Sarah Lancashire) lived: the climactic final car park scene after James Norton’s character, Tommy Lee Royce, sets himself alight must have been visible from her balcony. And now the souped-upAlbert, on Albert Street – one of my dad’s haunts in the 70s and 80s – has been transformed into the Duke of Wellington for Riot Women, with Lorraine Ashbourne, playing alongside Tamsin Greig and Joanna Scanlan, as the landlady.View image in fullscreenThe Albert pub was transformed into the ‘Duke of Wellington’ for Riot Women.Photograph: Paul Boyes/AlamyRight now I’m having breakfast opposite the Albert, at a table in the sunshine outsideLeila’s Kitchen, whose Iranian owner tells me it was the original vegetarian cafe of Hebden Bridge, set up in the 1980s. She’s run it since 2019, and her Persian breakfast – eggs, walnuts, feta cheese, salad and flatbread – is a renowned speciality, as is her noodle soup and saffron and pistachio ice-cream.In a town with a penchant for revolving doors and pop-up shops, one of the joys of visiting Hebden Bridge regularly is that it’s never the same twice. In fact, there’s currently another top-class breakfast venue, with queues heading down Valley Road while they’ve still got buns to sell:Mother, home of just-baked croissants including the almond one I tried. “It’s a bit hefty,” the assistant said as I pointed to it; in the event, I didn’t need another meal for the rest of the day.The police station I knew is now an antique shop; the newsagent’s is The Remedy, where you sit at high tables and taste a flight of winesIt’s quicker to say what has been constant rather than what’s changed since I was a child. TheTown Hall, with its big green doors, is the same (though they certainly didn’t have art exhibitions and a cafe there when I was a kid). The rush of the river, fast-flowing through the town and whizzing under the packhorse bridge that gave the town its name, is a welcome constant. Andthe Picture Houseis still there: where once I watched Grease, Jaws and An Officer and a Gentleman, the BBC premiered Riot Women here last week, as a thank you to the locals who put up with weeks of filming last summer.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was back in 1972 that a local legend called David Fletcher bought a disused mill in the centre of the town and turned it into the quintessential gift shop-cum-cafe, the business all the other shops that came after wanted to emulate (in terms of its longevity and success, anyway). TheTrades Clubwas always there, and always a trades union club – but now, still owned by the Labour party, it’s one of the funkiest live music and comedy venues in Britain. Sadly, Riot Women are a fictional band, but the October lineup included Grace Petrie (“the British folk scene’s funniest lesbian”), DJ Red Helen and Josie Long.Riot women!

My sister’s old bank isCoinbrasserie, where she and I recently reminisced, while sipping a delicious and reasonably priced bottle of fizz, about the ancient art of cashing cheques in the very room where she’d done just that. The cashier’s counter from my own former bank, round the corner on Market Street, has been moved to the shop next door which is full of rhubarb and ginger cake and strawberries and cream cupcakes: but they’re not baked goods, they’re bath time treats – it’s theYorkshire Soap Company.

Unruly and at times cruel, it forced me to hurdle fences, wade through bracken up to my midriff and teased me with disappearing paths and wayward waymarks.New map for Rhins of GallowayBut then, after I’d yelled profanities into the wind (there were no other hikers around to hear me), this raffishly handsome route would come over all sweetness and light. Look, it would simper: a dazzling and deserted white-sand bay! A ravishing spray of orchids! A crinkle of rocky foreshore be-flumped with seals! Once, moments after I’d cursed my way through a patch of Scottish jungle, a hare leapt from the sward just as a ruddy fox barred my way, a deer herd pronked down the cliffside and a buzzard mewed overhead; I felt like a sweaty Snow White summoning all the creatures at once, only by swearing rather than singing.“We toyed with whether to call it a ‘path’ or a ‘trail’,” said Bryan Scott, Dumfries and Galloway council’s countryside development officer and route creator. After my solo jaunt on the path/trail’s north and western stages, we were hiking a gentler south-east section together.Is there an official difference, I asked? “Well, no, but people think ‘path’ means there’s going to be some kind of a yellow brick road.”View image in fullscreenPortpatrick harbour.Photograph: Findlay/AlamyI can confirm there is no such thing around the Rhins of Galloway, the striking hammerhead peninsula at the edge of the edge of south-west Scotland. But there is an admirable almost-realised vision and a lot of potential.Southern Scotland sees a fraction of the tourists that head to the country’s lionised north: in 2024, there were 1.8m overnight visits to the Highlands andjust 520,000 to Dumfries and Galloway– and I’d wager most of those don’t make it out to the Rhins. “No doubt about it,” one taxi driver told me, “this is the land that time forgot.” It was clear the area could do with a boost; creating an 83-mile, six-stage coast path around the Rhins is part of the plan.The path is designed to improve access to this untamed, overlooked stretch of coast“One of the aims was to give people a reason to stay longer,” Scott told me as we advanced along the high clifftops to the Mull of Galloway, Scotland’s southernmost point, where a Stevenson lighthouse stands sentry over the waves. The path is designed to improve access to this untamed, overlooked stretch of coast, which, as well as more lighthouses, features ancient promontory forts, RSPB reserves, ruined castles, spectacular beaches and exotic gardens (the Gulf Stream makes this one of Scotland’s warmest spots). The problem is, Dumfries and Galloway has more than 1,100 miles of core paths that need looking after, with a team of only five to do it.View image in fullscreenThe ruins of Dunskey Castle near Portpatrick.Photograph: Barry Carlisle/Getty ImagesI’ve been following the progress of the Rhins coast path for a while, drawn to the idea of circumnavigating what is essentially an island that no one seems to visit. This year – its “soft launch”, I was told – seemed the right time.I started on Stranraer harbour, under the smart arch of corten steel marking the circular path’s beginning and end, using a GPX file of the route on my OS Maps app. From there I walked north, along the exposed shores of Loch Ryan, picking between oystercatchers and whimbrels, the alien blobs of barrel jellyfish, shaggy piles of bladderwrack and a crunchy scatter of shells. Somewhere under the loch’s blue lay Scotland’s last native oyster beds; during the second world war they were joined by surrendered U-boats, stowed here before being scuttled at sea. This area was strategically vital at that time, with parts of the D-day Mulberry harbour tested here, while flying boats, used to protect Allied shipping, were based on the headland known as the Wig.View image in fullscreenCorsewall lighthouse.Photograph: Rob Ford/AlamyThe going from Stranraer around the north of the Rhins was generally good. Highlights of the 13½ miles included military history, intriguing strandline, flower-flecked tussock and the remains of iron age settlements with views to Ailsa Craig and the isle of Arran beyond. Still, I was excited to finally see day’s end in the distance: lonely Corsewall lighthouse. Erected in 1815, the tower still protects ships in these frothy waters, but the old keepers’ quarters are now a hotel.John and Helen Harris welcomed me in. As well as running the place – “quite the challenge, in a good way, 99% of the time …” – they’re also among the volunteers helping to look after the coast path, cutting back overgrowth and reporting problems. They’re starting to get a few more walkers staying, they told me, and have compiled a folder of local rambles for guests not tramping the whole trail.I mistakenly dropped down to the sea, then followed in the hoof-prints of a flock of feral goats to get back up againI could see the attraction of basing myself here for nice day walks: I’ve stayed in few more atmospheric spots, and the five-course dinner concocted by Helen’s son Richard in the teeny kitchen was ridiculously good. Before leaving the next morning, we had a quick chat about what lay ahead. Helen reckoned I’d already done the coast path’s toughest stage; John’s expression told me I had not.John was right. The following two days – Corsewall to the pretty harbour village of Portpatrick, then Portpatrick to Port Logan’s wide, sandy sweep, around 15 miles each – were mettle-testing stuff. But also a proper adventure. I walked amid the sheep-grazed ruins of a wartime radar station to reach moaning seals. I accidentally annoyed a peregrine falcon, which spent a good 10 minutes shrieking above my head. I bounded across hills, high above the serrated rocky shore; at one point, I mistakenly dropped down to the sea, then followed in the hoof-prints of a flock of feral goats to get back up again.I also picnicked on beaches I couldn’t believe I had all to myself – shingly Salt Pans Bay, where salt was harvested from the 1640s, and awesome Ardwell Bay, a curve of turquoise-lapped gold. In the late 19th century a former clown called William Purves lived in one of the caves here. I could see why.View image in fullscreenSarah Baxter came across several lovely beaches she had all to herself.Photograph: Sarah BaxterOn the first of these two tough days, for the final miles from Killantringan lighthouse to Portpatrick, the coast path falls in step with a section of the Southern Upland Way, which ultimately makes for Cockburnspath, on the east coast. This is one of Scotland’s official Great Trails, and the difference was stark: regular waymarks; an obvious track; I even met a volunteer hacking back the overgrowth. But, then, this trail was launched 40 years ago – evidence of what can be achieved.Some of this will probably have been achieved by the time you read this. At the end of my trip, at the Mull of Galloway’s Gallie Craig cafe, Irish Sea swirling outside, Scott took on all my feedback. He’s since rewalked the trail, and a slew of new work is afoot to negotiate fences, increase signage, build a bridge and trim unruly plants. Improvement works should be completed by spring 2026. Yes, the Rhins of Galloway coast path is a little raw, but stick with it: I have high hopes it’ll mature very well.The trip was supported by theSouth of Scotland Destination Alliance.Corsewall Lighthouse Hotelhas doubles from £175 B&B; five-course dinner £49.50pp excluding drinks.

There were just two versions that I liked, and both were made by my mother: one with lime and coconut, the other a slow-cooked black dal with cream (even nicer thanthe Dishoom version). But now a third quick-cook dal has made it into my hall of fame. And the secret? Blitzing it until very smooth, then serving with a topping of roast squash and moreish chilli cashews.

Roast for 25-30 minutes, until cooked through and starting to catch at the edges.Meanwhile, put the lentils in a large pan with 500ml just-boiled water, the garlic and the turmeric, and bring to a boil. Partially cover, lower the heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 20-25 minutes, until the lentils are soft.Mix the cashews, oil, chilli and a big pinch of salt in a small baking tray. When the squash has eight minutes left, pop the cashew tray in the same oven; by the time the squash is ready, the nuts should be nicely toasted.Whisk the dal and season with lime juice and sea salt to taste. You will need quite a lot of both: think of the dal as a completely blank canvas (I used the juice of two limes and I’m embarrassed to say how much salt!). Keep adjusting and tasting until you’re happy with the seasoning, then add the butter.My final step, which takes this dish to the next level, is to blitz the dal (and the garlic clove) in batches in a high-speed blender. Taste again – it should be perfect.Divide the dal between two bowls, top with the roast squash and chilli cashews, scatter over the coriander and serve hot with rice and/or breads.Explore more on these topicsFoodQuick and easyBeans, pulses and legumesVegetablesVegetarian food and drinkFruitMain courseSide dishesrecipesShareReuse this content"

After patiently waiting for tomatoes and aubergines to be done with their performance, autumn brings its own bounty of vegetables back into play, with squash, cauliflower and dark, leafy greens being some of my favourites. They’re ideal for loading into comforting dishes to hunker down with, and lend even the most indulgent meals a bit of goodness.Sausages with squash and beans (pictured top)Prep10 minCook1 hr 10 minServes47 tbsp olive oil1 onion,peeled and finely chopped2garlic cloves,peeled and finely chopped15g rosemary,finely chopped8 good-quality pork sausages600g butternut squash,peeled, deseeded and cut into 3cm chunks400ml chicken stock2560g jars of butter beans70g sourdough breadcrumbsSalt and black pepper150g cavolo nero40g parmesanFinely grated zest of 1 lemon, plus the juice of half, and optional lemon wedges to serveOver a medium flame, heat three tablespoons of the oil in a large, shallow casserole dish for which you have a lid. Tip in the chopped onion and cook, stirring, for 15 minutes, until softened. Add the garlic and rosemary, and cook for another five minutes.Put a large frying pan on a medium-high heat, add a tablespoon of oil, then lay in the sausages and fry, turning often, for about five minutes, until nicely browned all over.Add the squash to the onion pan, pour in the stock, cover and leave to simmer for five minutes. Drain the butter beans into a sieve, rinse them under the cold tap, then stir into the sausage pan, cover and simmer for 20 minutes.Put three tablespoons of oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat, tip in the breadcrumbs and toast for about five minutes, until golden and crisp. Season with salt and leave to cool.Strip the cavolo nero leaves off the stalks, then tear them into bite-size pieces. Add these to the sausage pan, then put the lid back on and cook for five minutes, until the cabbage wilts.Mash a quarter of the butter beans with a fork to thicken the sauce and turn it creamy, then grate in the parmesan and lemon zest, and squeeze in the juice of half the lemon. Season to taste.Spoon the sausages and beans into bowls, top with the crisp breadcrumbs, and serve with a wedge of lemon if you like.Cauliflower cheese risottoView image in fullscreenSophie Wyburd’s cauliflower cheese risotto.Prep5 minCook1 hr 20 minServes41 mediumcauliflower3 tbsp olive oil, plus a drizzle to serveSea salt and black pepper30g butter1 onion,peeled and finely chopped1½ litres chicken stock, or vegetable stock300g arboriorice200g mature cheddar, grated, plus 25g extra for servingFreshly grated nutmeg15g fresh chives,finely choppedHeat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7. Halve the cauliflower, then chop one half into bite-size florets. Put the florets on a baking tray, toss with a tablespoon of the olive oil and a good pinch of salt, and roast for 30 minutes, until tender and lightly caramelised.Meanwhile, set a large, shallow saute pan on a medium heat, add the butter and two tablespoons of olive oil, then tip in the onion and cook for 20 minutes, until tender but not coloured.Coarsely grate the remaining half-cauliflower, then add to the onion pan and fry for five minutes, until reduced and softened. Meanwhile, put the stock in a medium-sized saucepan, bring to a gentle simmer, then keep warm on a low heat.Add the rice to the onion pan, and toast, stirring, for two minutes. Add the stock a ladleful at a time, stirring until the rice has absorbed each ladleful before adding the next. Repeat for about 30 minutes, until all but a ladleful of the stock has been used up and the rice is al dente.Turn off the heat, stir in the last of the stock, then cover and leave to sit for five minutes. Take off the lid, grate in the cheddar and a generous amount of nutmeg, then stir to combine and season to taste. The risotto should be loose and spoonable, so if need be, add a little more liquid at this point.Spoon the risotto into bowls, and top with the roast cauliflower and chopped chives. Finish with a little more grated cheddar and a drizzle of olive oil, then serve.Sophie Wyburd is the author of theFeederSubstack and Tucking In, published by Ebury at £22.
