Do you say the same about Tory MPs banned from China?“This government will continue to stand up for the rights of our MPs to speak their mind, whatever their party.”The Labour MPEmily Thornberry, who is chair of the Commons foreign affairs committee, told Sky News she was “completely gobsmacked” by the Tory leader’s comments, adding: “This is nonsense. You have to stand up for what’s right, Kemi Badenoch, and you should stand in solidarity with other parliamentarians who were just going to Israel and the West Bank to find out what was going on.”On X, the Liberal Democrat leader,Ed Davey, accused Badenoch of “unbelievably poor judgment” and “another complete shocker”.But Badenoch hit back at Lammy on X, saying: “Unlike China,Israelis our ally and a democracy. A good foreign sec would be able to make that distinction.“PerhapsLabourMPs could put UK national interest first and do their jobs instead of campaigning for airports in Kashmir or promoting Hamas propaganda in parliament.”However, Richard Fuller, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, took a very different stance. “Any member of parliament who goes on an official trip should be, I would think, welcomed in any country,” he told Times Radio.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Democracy isn’t a guarantee in life. Freedom isn’t guaranteed.”Thornberry said it was the first time Israel had ever refused British MPs access to the country. Yang and Mohamed were part of a delegation organised by the Council for Arab-British Understanding (Caabu) and Medical Aid for Palestinians (Map), which said they had run such trips to the occupied West Bank for more than a decade.While Israel’s assault on Gaza after the 7 October 2023 has been the focus of international attention, its airstrikes on the West Bank have killed 261 Palestinians and 40,000 have been forced from their homes, according to thePalestinian-Israeli rights group B’tselem.Explore more on these topicsKemi BadenochDavid LammyIsraelLabourConservativesLiberal DemocratsEmily ThornberryShareReuse this content"

Giant ran last year at the Royal Court in London and will transfer to theWest Endlater this month, with Lithgow and Levey resuming their roles.Lithgow thanked the audience for “welcoming me to England” and said “it’s not always easy when you welcome an American into your midst”, highlighting that this moment was “more complicated than usual” for relations between the US and the UK.He remembered seeing Laurence Olivier’s “astounding performance” at the Old Vic in the playDanceof Death in the late 1960s. “I have thought about him and stolen from him in just about every performance I have ever played on stage,” he added.View image in fullscreenCo-presenters Beverley Knight and Billy Porter at the Olivier awards.Photograph: Neil Mockford/WireImageGiant’s tally of three Olivier awards on Sunday night was matched by two musicals:The Curious Case of Benjamin ButtonandFiddler on the Roof.The former, based on the short story by F Scott Fitzgerald and with music and lyrics by Jethro Compton and Darren Clark, won best new musical, outstanding musical contribution (for Clark and Mark Aspinall’s orchestrations and arrangements) and best actor in a musical (John Dagleish as the hero who is born old and grows younger each day). Dagleish, who won an Olivier award in 2015 for portraying Ray Davies in the Kinks musical Sunny Afternoon, said that his late mother had been his “plus one” on that occasion. He dedicated the award to her and said that “she would have loved” The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.Previously stagedat the fringe venue Southwark Playhouse in 2019, it is now running in the West End’s Ambassadors theatre which recently opened its own on-site custom-built pub, the Pickled Crab, named after a Cornish watering hole in the musical.Fiddler on the Roof, which received afive-star Guardian reviewat Regent’s Park Open Air theatre and is transferring to the Barbican next month, had received a total of13 Olivier nominations, equalling arecord set by the musical Hamilton in 2018.The classic musical – composed by Jerry Bock, with lyrics by Sheldon Harnick and book by Joseph Stein – won nine Tony awards in 1965 for its original Broadway production. Director Jordan Fein’s new production won Oliviers for best musical revival, best set design (Tom Scutt) and best sound design (Nick Lidster).The ceremony, which celebrates the cream of London theatre, was hosted by the actorsBeverley Knight, a winner at the 2023 awards, and Billy Porter, who is starring as the Emcee in Cabaret. It opened with Knight and Porter performing Luck Be a Lady from the musical Guys and Dolls.Romola Garai achieved the unusual feat of beating herself to win the award for best actress in a supporting role. She had been nominated twice in that category, recognising her performances in Giant andThe Years.The latter brought her victory. Based on Nobel prize-winner Annie Ernaux’s memoir, The Years (at the Almeida theatre) also received the best director prize, with Norwegian theatre-makerEline Arbobecoming the sixth woman to win that award at the Oliviers.Garai said The Years had been the “greatest privilege of my life” and thanked “my family of Annies” [all the cast share the main role of Annie as well as playing supporting characters]. She called Arbo a “genius” who “put all women’s life on stage”. Garai also thanked her husband for his support while she took on the two productions.View image in fullscreenRomola Garai, winner of the best actress in a supporting role award for The Years.Photograph: Dave Benett/Max Cisotti/Getty ImagesArbo previously directed The Years forInternationaal Theater Amsterdam, the world-renowned company which also staged Robert Icke’s modern-day version of Sophocles’s Oedipusseveral years ago.Oedipus, which Icke directed with a newWest Endcast, won best revival and best actress for Lesley Manville as Jocasta.Icke praised his “24-carat team” including the producer Sonia Friedman, who he said the industry was “lucky to have”. (Garai, too, thanked Friedman, who produced The Years.) The experience of making Oedipus had been joyous for the ensemble, added Icke, who jokingly observed “incest really brings people together”. Manville noted Icke’s “care and precision” as a director in her speech.The award for best actress in a musical went to Imelda Staunton for her roof-raising turn inHello, Dolly!at the Palladium. It was Staunton’s 14th nomination and fifth win at the Oliviers. The most-lauded individual in Olivier awards history is lighting designer Paule Constable, who has received 17 nominations, and won her sixth award for Oliver! (shared with Ben Jacobs). Constable announced her retirement from theatre earlier this year.The prize for best theatre choreographer went toChristopher Wheeldonfor the Michael Jackson bio-drama MJ the Musical, best costume design went to Gabriella Slade for the colourful rollerskating trains inStarlight Express, andMaimuna Memontook the award for best actress in a supporting role in a musical forNatasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812.Lesley Manville calls for better funding for UK regional theatreRead moreLayton Williams, meanwhile, became the first Olivier winner in history to be recognised for portraying an iceberg (he took best supporting actor in a musical for the zanyTitanique). Mark-Anthony Turnage’s Festen at the Royal Opera House won two prizes: best new opera production and outstanding achievement in opera (fortenor Allan Clayton).The National Theatre, the Old Vic and the Coliseum were among the major venues whose shows’ nominations did not result in a win, althoughRufus Norrisreceived a special award for his 10-year tenure as director of the National.Established in 1976, the Olivier awards are overseen by theSociety of London Theatre.

An Israeli military official, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with regulations late on Saturday, said that account was “mistaken”.The Gaza paramedic killings: a visual timelineRead moreThe almost seven-minute video, which the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said on Saturday was recovered from the phone of Rifat Radwan, one of the men killed, appears to have been filmed from inside a moving vehicle. It shows a red fire engine and clearly marked ambulances driving at night, using headlights and flashing emergency lights.The vehicle stops beside another that has driven off the road. Two men get out to examine the stopped vehicle, then gunfire erupts before the screen goes black.Fifteen Palestinian paramedics and rescue workers, including at least one UN employee, were killed in the incident in Rafah on 23 March, in which theUN said Israeli forces shot the men “one by one”and then buried them in a mass grave.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the incident was still under investigation. It added: “All claims, including the documentation circulated about the incident, will be thoroughly and deeply examined to understand the sequence of events and the handling of the situation.”The official said the initial report received from the field did not describe lights but that investigators were looking at “operational information” and were trying to understand whether this was due to an error by the person making the initial report.“What we understand currently is the person who gives the initial account is mistaken. We’re trying to understand why,” the official added.According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha), the PRCS and civil defence workers were on a mission to rescue colleagues who had been shot at earlier in the day, when their clearly marked vehicles came under heavy Israeli fire in the Tel al-Sultan area of Rafah. A Red Crescent official inGazasaid there was evidence of at least one person being detained and killed, as the body of one of the dead had been found with his hands tied.The shootings happened one day into the renewed Israeli offensive in the area close to the Egyptian border after the breakdown of a two-month ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.Israeli strikes onGazaon Sunday killed at least 44 people, rescuers said. “The death toll as a result of Israeli air strikes since dawn today is at least 44, including 21 in Khan Younis,” civil defence agency spokesperson Mahmud Bassal told AFP.One such strike killed six people on Al-Nakheel Street in the Al-Tuffah neighbourhood of Gaza City, where a group had gathered near a bakery, Bassal said. Among the dead were three children, he confirmed.On Sunday evening, Hamas said it had fired a barrage of rockets at cities in Israel’s south on Sunday in response to Israeli “massacres” of civilians in Gaza.The IDF said about 10 projectiles were fired, but most were successfully intercepted. Israel’s Channel 12 reported a direct hit in the southern city of Ashkelon.Israeli emergency services said they were treating one person for shrapnel injuries and teams were en route to locations of fallen rockets. Smashed car windows and debris lay strewn on a city street, videos disseminated by Israeli emergency services showed.The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, had ordered a strong response to the rocket attack, his office said.Another Red Crescent worker on the mission last month, Assad al-Nassasra, is still reported missing and the organisation has asked the Israeli military for information on his whereabouts.A survivor of the incident, the Palestinian Red Crescent paramedic Munther Abed, has said he saw Nassasra being led away blindfolded by Israeli troops.The 27-year-old volunteer was in the back of the first ambulance to arrive on the scene of an airstrike in the Hashashin area of Rafah before dawn on 23 March when the vehicle came under intense Israeli fire.His two Red Crescent colleagues sitting in the front were killed but he survived by throwing himself to the floor of the vehicle. “The door opened, and there they were – Israeli special forces in military uniforms, armed with rifles, green lasers and night-vision goggles,” Abed told the Guardian. “They dragged me out of the ambulance, keeping me face down to avoid seeing what had happened to my colleagues.”Adeb was detained for several hours before being released.‘I heard them take their last breath’: survivor recounts Gaza paramedic killingsRead moreThe UN and Palestinian Red Crescent have demanded an independent inquiry into the killing of the paramedics.Israeli media briefed by the military have reported that troops had identified at least six of the 15 dead as members of militant groups and killed a Hamas figure named Mohammed Amin Shobaki.None of the 15 killed has that name and no other bodies are known to have been found at the site. The official declined to provide any evidence or detail of how the identifications were made, saying he did not want to share classified information.“According to our information, there were terrorists there but this investigation is not over,” he told reporters.Abed – a volunteer for 10 years – was adamant there were no militants travelling with the ambulances.Jonathan Whittall, the interim head of Ocha in the occupied Palestinian territory, dismissed allegations that the people who died were Hamas militants, saying staff had worked with the same medics previously in evacuating patients from hospitals and other tasks.“These are paramedic crews that I personally have met before,” he said. “They were buried in their uniforms with their gloves on. They were ready to save lives.”The Israeli military official said the troops had informed the UN of the incident on the same day and initially covered the bodies with camouflage netting until they could be recovered, later burying them when the UN did not immediately collect the bodies.The UN confirmed last week it had been informed of the location of the bodies but that access to the area was denied by Israel for several days. It said the bodies had been buried alongside their crushed vehicles – clearly marked ambulances, a fire truck and a UN car.Explore more on these topicsIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaIsrael-Gaza warGazaUnited NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

Months before Taylor Swift’s Eras tour had even reached UK shores last summer, British fans wereestimated to have lost more than £1mafter tickets went on sale.Oasis fans who fell victim to scammers in their desperation to secure tickets to the Manchester band’s UK reunion shows this summerlost £346 each on average, according to a Lloyds bank analysis of its own data.There have also been warnings that fans of Lady Gagawill be targetedafter tickets for her forthcoming UK arena tour went on sale on Thursday.Lloyds bank has previously said more than 90% of reported cases started with fake adverts or posts on social media, and they usually involve people being tricked into sending money via bank transfer. However, many people do not report the crime, often because they are embarrassed about falling victim to a con, or in some cases because the amount involved was relatively small.The research by Nationwide found that just over half (51%) of those polled would consider buying tickets from “questionable sources” to avoid missing out, increasing their chances of falling victim to fraud.

They said the study’s findings highlighted the need for “careful monitoring”.Prof Samuele Cortese, the senior lead author of the study, from the University of Southampton, said the risks and benefits of taking any medication had to be assessed together, but for ADHD drugs the risk-benefit ratio was “reassuring”.“We found an overall small increase in blood pressure and pulse for the majority of children taking ADHD medications,” he said. “Other studies show clear benefits in terms of reductions in mortality risk and improvement in academic functions, as well as a small increased risk of hypertension, but not other cardiovascular diseases. Overall, the risk-benefit ratio is reassuring for people taking ADHD medications.”About 3 to 4% of adults and 5% of children in the UK are believed to have ADHD, a neurodevelopmental disorder with symptoms including impulsiveness, disorganisation and difficulty focusing, according to the National Institute forHealthand Care Excellence (Nice).Doctors can prescribe stimulants, such as methylphenidate, of which the best-known brand is Ritalin. Other stimulant medications used to treat ADHD include lisdexamfetamine and dexamfetamine. Non-stimulant drugs include atomoxetine, an sNRI (selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor), and guanfacine.The study of children, adolescents and adults states: “There is uncertainty regarding whether medications that are used for the treatment of ADHD may lead to cardiovascular diseases, and concerns remain around their cardiovascular safety.” It found allADHD medicationswere associated with small increases of blood pressure and heart rate, except guanfacine, which led to decreased blood pressure and heart rate.There were no significant differences regarding the impact on blood pressure and heart rate between stimulants (including methylphenidate and amphetamine) and non-stimulants (atomoxetine and viloxazine). The researchers advised people with existing heart conditions to discuss the side effects of ADHD medications with a specialist cardiologist before starting treatment.Dr Ulrich Müller-Sedgwick, a consultant psychiatrist and expert on ADHD, said most clinicians prescribing ADHD medication understood the cardiovascular risks and followed Nice guidelines for monitoring blood pressure, pulse and weight. “We need more detailed guidelines for scenarios when ADHD medication needs to be adjusted or stopped,” he said.Last year, a thinktank warned that theNHSwas experiencing an“avalanche of need”over autism and ADHD, and said the system in place to cope with surging demand for assessments and treatments was “obsolete”. The number of prescriptions issued in England for ADHD medicationhas risen by 18% year on yearsince the pandemic, with the biggest rise in London.Dr Tony Lord, a former chief executive of the ADHD Foundation, said the long-term benefits of ADHD medication were well established, and included a reduced risk of anxiety and depression, eating disorders, harm from smoking, improved educational outcomes and economic independence.“Sadly ignorance about ADHD medications persists – a throwback to the 80s and 90s when ADHD medications were mistakenly viewed as a morality pill that made naughty, fidgety disruptive children behave – which of course it is not,” he said.“It is simply a cognitive enhancer that improves information processing, inhibits distractions, improves focus, planning and prioritising, self monitoring and reduces impulsivity of thought and action.”Explore more on these topicsAttention deficit hyperactivity disorderChildrenDrugsMedical researchUniversity of SouthamptonHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Trump was also mollified by the findings of the internal investigation.The disclosures nonetheless triggered a “forensic review” by the White House information technology office, which found that Waltz’s phone had saved Goldberg’s number as part of an unlikely series of events that started when Goldberg emailed the Trump campaign last October.According to three people briefed on the internal investigation, Goldberg had emailed the campaign about a story that criticized Trump for his attitude towards wounded service members. To push back against the story, the campaign enlisted the help of Waltz, their national security surrogate.Goldberg’s email was forwarded to then Trump spokesperson Brian Hughes, who then copied and pasted the content of the email – including the signature block with Goldberg’s phone number – into a text message that he sent to Waltz, so that he could be briefed on the forthcoming story.Waltz did not ultimately call Goldberg, the people said, but in an extraordinary twist, inadvertently ended up saving Goldberg’s number in his iPhone – under the contact card for Hughes, now the spokesperson for the national security council.A day after thatGoldberg story was published, on 22 October, Waltz appeared on CNN to defend Trump. “Don’t take it from me, take it from the 13 Abbey Gate Gold Star families, some of whom stood on a stage in front of a 30,000 person crowd and said how he helped them heal,” Waltz said.According to the White House, the number was erroneously saved during a “contact suggestion update” by Waltz’s iPhone, which one person described as the function where an iPhone algorithm adds a previously unknown number to an existing contact that it detects may be related.The mistake went unnoticed until last month when Waltz sought to add Hughes to the Signal group chat – but ended up adding Goldberg’s number to the 13 March message chain named “Houthi PC small group”, where several top US officials discussed plans for strikes against the Houthis.Waltz said in the immediate aftermath of the incident that he had never met or communicated with Goldberg. He also suggested on Fox News that Goldberg’s number had been “sucked” into his phone, seemingly in reference to how his iPhone had saved Goldberg’s number.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Reached by phone on Saturday, Goldberg said: “I’m not going to comment on my relationship with Mike Waltz beyond saying I do know him and have spoken to him.”Mike Waltz’s team set up at least 20 Signal chats for national security work – reportRead moreTrump was briefed on the findings of the forensic review last week around the time he decided to keep Waltz, a person familiar with the matter said. Trump accepted Waltz’s mea culpa and haspublicly defended himin recent weeks since the group chat situation became public.When Trump left the White House on Thursday, he was joined aboard Marine One by his chief of staff, Susie Wiles, his personnel chief, Sergio Gor, and Waltz, which aides took as a show of support for the embattled national security adviser.Waltz also appears to have also engendered some sympathy from inside Trump’s orbit over the group chat because the White House had authorized the use of Signal, largely because there is no alternative platform to text in real time across different agencies, two people familiar with the matter said.Previous administrations, including the Biden White House, did not develop an alternative platform to Signal, one of the people said. As a temporary solution, the Trump White House told officials to use Signal as they had done during the transition instead of regular text-message chains.Explore more on these topicsSignal group chat leakTrump administrationThe AtlanticUS politicsUS militaryUS national securitynewsShareReuse this content"

Seized by Russia in spring 2022 and shut down for safety reasons a few months later, it remains on the frontline of the conflict, close to the Dnipro River.Map showing the location of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plantRussia has said it intends to retain the site and switch it back on, without being specific as to when. Alexey Likhachev, head of Russian nuclear operator Rosatom, said in February it would be restarted when “military and political conditions allow”.Meanwhile, Donald Trump has expressed an interest in taking control of it,though this possibility is considered very remote.Kotin said Energoatom was prepared to restart the plant but it would require Russian forces to be removed and the site to be de-mined and demilitarised.He said such a restart by Ukraine would take anywhere “from two months to two years” in an environment “without any threats from militaries”, while a Russian restart during wartime “would be impossible, even for one unit [reactor]”.Kotin said the six reactors could only be brought online after the completion of 27 safety programmes agreed with Ukraine’s nuclear regulator, including testing the nuclear fuel in the reactor cores because it had exceeded a six-year “design term”.That raises questions about whether Russia could restart the plant after a ceasefire without incurring significant risk. The plant was already unsafe, Kotin said, given that it was being used as “a military base with military vehicles present” and there were “probably some weapons and blasting materials” present as well.Russiahas acknowledgedthat it has placed mines between the inner and outer perimeters of the plant “to deter potential Ukrainian saboteurs” while inspectors from the IAEA nuclear watchdoghave reportedthat armed troops and military personnel are present at the site.Last month,the US Department of Energy saidthe Zaporizhzhia plant was being operated by an “inadequate and insufficently trained cadre of workers”, with staffing levels at less than a third of prewar levels.The US briefing said Ukrainian reactors, though originally of the Soviet VVER design, had “evolved differently” from their Russian counterparts and “particularly the safety systems”. Russian-trained specialists acting as replacements for Ukrainian staff were “inexperienced” in operating the Ukrainian variants, it said.Kotin said an attempt to restart the plant by Russia would almost certainly not be accepted or supported by Ukraine. It would require the reconnection of three additional 750kV high-voltage lines to come into the plant, he said.A nuclear reactor requires a significant amount of power for day-to-day operation, and three of the four high-voltage lines came from territories now under Russian occupation. “They themselves destroyed the lines,” Kotin said, only for Russia to discover engineers could not rebuild them as the war continued, he added.Only two lines remain to maintain the site in cold shutdown, a 750kV line coming from Ukraine, and a further 330kV line – though on eight separate occasions shelling disrupted their supply of energy, forcing the plant to rely on backup generators.Experts say a pumping station has to be constructed at the site, because there is insufficient cooling water available. The June 2023 destruction by Russian soldiers of the Nova Kakhova dam downstream eliminated the easy supply of necessary water from the Dnipro river.Two civilians were reportedly killed by Russian missile attacks on Sunday, including one in a ballistic missile strike in an eastern district of Kyiv; while Russia said it captured a border village near Sumy in north-east Ukraine.Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia had launched more than 1,460 guided aerial bombs, nearly 670 attack drones, and more than 30 missiles over the past week. The Ukrainian president said: “The number of air attacks is increasing.”US-brokered ceasefire talks have only achieved limited results thus far. Both sides agreed to stop attacking energy targets, though each accuses the other of violations; while a maritime ceasefire agreed to by Ukraine has not been accepted by Russia.A Russian official involved in the negotiations said on Sunday that diplomatic contacts between Russia and the US could come again as early as next week.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaNuclear powerEnergyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

There has never been a class action of this kind done in the UK before, there hasn’t been a call-up like this one before.“There are many, many families all over the UK, and there have been for five decades, who suffer in silence. We have to do something radical that involves everybody, that doesn’t cherrypick certain cases. And that’s the idea of a class action.”He said event organisers had recorded 3,000 deaths involving the police in the UK over the past 50 years, during which time four police officers have been convictedover a killing.Those involved in the tribunal and legal action included Sieta Lambrias, the sister of Mikey Powell who died from positional asphyxia after police restraint in 2003, and Shirley Sylvester, the cousin of Roger Sylvester, who died after being restrained by eight police officers in 1999.Samantha Patterson, whose brother Jason McPherson died in 2007 after being stopped and searched by police, said: “We’ve explored all avenues. We’ve done campaigns. We’ve written letters. We’ve met with prime ministers, Home Office secretaries, everybody that you would think. Something needs to change.View image in fullscreenJason McPherson, who died in 2007 after being stopped and searched by police.Photograph: People’s Tribunal on Police Killings“Jason died nearly 20 years ago, and I’m still hearing about cases that are similar to what happened to Jason that night.”McPherson died after collapsing at a police station where he was taken to be searched, and an inquest into his death criticised the police for not following procedure properly.Patterson said her brother’s death, and their campaign for justice, had taken a huge toll on her family, including her mother who died shortly after McPherson’s inquest. “In my head, my mum died because she put all her faith into that inquest and she got nothing out of it,” she said.“She didn’t get any justice for her son. And my other brother, he still has the effects of Jason’s death on him every single day.”Family of man who died in custody say four-year wait for CPS decision is ‘form of torture’Read moreFero said the number of people involved in the class action is quickly rising into the hundreds. A legal team of barristers is working to establish what shape the class action will take.“It is about seeking prosecutions, it is about seeking compensation, but it’s also about recognition that the state has failed to protect its own citizens,” said Fero.“It’s an absolute scandal. And it’s a purposeful deflection that the government has employed to put something there which appears to be judicial, but essentially it has no power.“The focus has been on improving the system and there’s an acceptance of the deaths that have happened before – we’re not going to accept them.”The tribunal was organised by a collective of campaign groups, including United Families and Friends Campaign, Migrant Media and 4WardEverUK, with the aim of “exposing the extent of the injustice” and placing it on the international stage.It also aimed to highlight the disproportionate impact of police killings on black people, and key themes explored included torture, terror, state cover-ups and black resistance.Organisers said they rejected the terminology “deaths in custody” as it was “inaccurately narrow and misleading”, and does not cover killings of people who have not been arrested or sectioned.Explore more on these topicsDeaths in custodyPoliceRacenewsShareReuse this content"

Trump said Boardman’s portrait of the former US president Barack Obama was “wonderful”, but “the one on me is truly the worst”.In her first comment since the incident, Boardman said Trump’s comments meant that her “intentions, integrity and abilities were, in my opinion, called into question”.View image in fullscreenBoardman at the 2019 unveiling of her Trump portrait in Denver.Photograph: Jesse Paul/Colorado Sun/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockBoardman rebuked the president’s claims in a statement, saying she had “completed the portrait accurately, without ‘purposeful distortion’, political bias, or any attempt to caricature the subject, actual or implied”.The artist said that while she acknowledged Trump’s right to comment, the “additional allegations that I ‘purposefully distorted’ the portrait, and that I ‘must have lost my talent as I got older’ are now directly and negatively impacting my business of over 41 years, which now is in danger of not recovering”.Discussing her work with the Colorado Times Recorder in 2019, she acknowledged that there would “always be anger at a president from one side or the other. It is human nature.”In response to Trump’s criticism, officials said the portrait would be removed, and it has been since. Boardman says that for the first six years after she painted the portrait, she “received overwhelmingly positive reviews and feedback”, but that since Trump’s comments “that has changed for the worse”.View image in fullscreenPeople looking at an empty spot on the wall where Boardman’s portrait of Trump once hung. Colorado officials removed the painting after Trump’s criticism.Photograph: Jason Connolly/AFP/Getty ImagesBoardman was born in Britain, and her website says she spent years travelling around Australia, Papua New Guinea, New Zealand, Malaysia, the Middle East, Europe and the US while “conducting a successful career in airline travel and business”.In 1985, she began studying techniques of the old masters in Germany and built a successful career as an artist, eventually winning a nationwide “call for artists” by Colorado’s state capital of Denver, to paint the official portraits of presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump.Trump guards his image closely. In January 2025, before his inauguration, he released a portrait that was variously described by critics as serious or ominous, and seemed to reference his 2023 mugshot.That image was taken after he was charged with attempting to overturn his 2020 election loss to Joe Biden in the state of Georgia – a charge Trump denied.After Trump’s criticism of Boardman, his envoy Steve Witkoff confirmed the White House had been sent a new work from Moscow, which was a gift from Vladimir Putin. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov described it as a “personal gift”.Witkoff described the picture as a “beautiful portrait” by a “leading Russian artist”.Explore more on these topicsArtDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Now the likes of Musk and Bezos are in controlSun 6 Apr 2025 13.00 EDTShareJust days beforeDonald Trump’s inauguration in January, Blue Origin, the space company owned by billionaireJeff Bezos, launched its New Glenn rocket, named for John Glenn, the Mercury astronaut who was the first American to orbit the Earth. Around 2am on 16 January, the 30-story rocket powered by seven engines blasted off into the Florida night from Cape Canaveral’s historic launch complex 36, which first served as a Nasa launch site in 1962.The flight’s end was marred by a failure to bring the booster rocket back for further use, but the successful launch and orbit still marked a watershed moment forBlue Originin its bid to compete with SpaceX, the company owned by Elon Musk, for dominance over American spy satellite operations. During the Trump administration, it is likely that both companies will play significant roles in placing spy satellites into Earth orbit, which could mean that the United States intelligence community will be beholden to both Bezos and Musk to handle the single most complex and expensive endeavor in modern espionage.In fact, Musk and Bezos are in a position during the Trump administration to personally exert significant influence over the direction of the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency and the rest of theUS national securityapparatus. The two pro-Trump billionaires have already been awarded massive contracts with the US intelligence community, including some that predate Trump’s first term in office.The emergence of Musk, Bezos and a handful of other pro-Trump billionaires as key players in US intelligence marks a radical change in US spy operations, which have traditionally been controlled by career government officials working closely with a few longstanding defense and intelligence contractors, giant corporations such as Lockheed Martin, RTX and Northrop Grumman that are adept at lobbying both Democrats and Republicans in Washington. But with Musk, Bezos and other pro-Trump Silicon Valley figures gaining an edge through their personal ties to Trump, civil servants in the intelligence community may be reluctant to deny them ever-larger contracts, especially since Trump has already fired several inspectors general who investigated Musk’s businesses in other areas of the government.Anticipating big rewards, Musk is reportedly joining forces with other pro-Trump billionaires to try to carve up the defense and intelligence business. SpaceX is working with Palantir, a hi-tech data analytics intelligence contractor co-founded by Peter Thiel, one of the most prominent rightwing figures in Silicon Valley; Anduril, a new defense contractor founded by 32-year-old pro-Trump tech bro Palmer Luckey; and several other Silicon Valley firms toform a consortiumgeared towards loosening the grip of the defense industry’s traditional players.Tech leaders eager to get into intelligence contracting have long complained that the business has become so consolidated around a few big players that it is nearly impossible for outsiders to compete, leading to a lack of innovation. “Consolidation bred conformity,” argued Shyam Sankar, the chief technology officer of Palantir, in a widely read public memo,The Defense Reformation.Swapping one oligarchy for anotherIt is hard to separate Silicon Valley’s calls for breaking up the oligarchy now controlling the defense and intelligence business from the eagerness of pro-Trump tech bros to grab as much power and cash as possible while creating a new oligarchy of their own.“The idea of overturning the contracting process did intrigue me, but now, under Trump, I think it is just about greed,” observed Greg Treverton, a former director of the National Intelligence Council, the intelligence community’s top analytical arm. “Now, with Trump, it is mostly about money and connections.”In the eyes of their critics, tech entrepreneurs offer a simplistic, black-and-white picture of the defense and intelligence business in which Silicon Valley conveniently has all the answers.“Beware the instant expert,” said Peter Singer, a defense analyst at the New America Foundation. “It’s like they are saying ‘I watched a YouTube video and now I know everything.’ They have this narrative that only Silicon Valley can drive innovation.”Elon Musk, satellite spymasterAs he eagerly slashes and burns through the ranks of federal employees with his Doge apparatus, Musk has emerged as the most powerful and polarizing figure in the Trump administration. But what is less well known is that Musk has also gained an influential role in the US intelligence community despite never having served inside the spy world.Musk’sSpaceXhas already become one of the main rocket contractors launching American spy satellites and is seeking to overcome the edge held by United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin, the traditional giant in the niche. In addition, Starlink, Musk’s commercial satellite communication network, is playing a critical role in US foreign policy, providing internet service in remote regions of the world including in Ukraine, where it operates a communications network for the Ukrainian army. Starlink’s role in the Ukraine war has placed Musk squarely in the middle of the dispute between Trump and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Meanwhile, questions about whether Musk is assuming a dual role as both a player in Trump’s national security policymaking and a major contractor grew after he received a private briefing at the Pentagon on 21 March and visited the CIA headquarters 10 days later.SpaceX has a head start over Blue Origin in the spy satellite business, and Musk has a big lead over Bezos in Trump world. But Blue Origin and Bezos are working hard to catch up in both.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Since the 2024 election, though, Bezos has turned himself into a Trump booster, lavishing praise and large donations on the president while also working to transform the Washington Post’s opinion page, which he says should focus on “personal liberties and free markets”.Bezos’s move into an alliance with Trump has put him in a position to expand his reach into the spy satellite business while also protecting the large stake he already holds in other aspects of intelligence. The billionaire, the second-richest person in the world after Musk, has been involved in the spy world for more than a decade through Amazon Web Services, a cloud computing subsidiary of Amazon, which Bezos founded and where he remains executive chair. Amazon Web Services has managed the CIA’s classified cloud since it won a $600m contract with the spy agency in 2013, and dramatically expanded its intelligence role when it was awarded a $10bn contract to manage the NSA’s classified cloud in 2022 through a program code-named “Wild and Stormy”.Palmer Luckey and Silicon Valley’s clique of young defense contractorsPlenty of other Silicon Valley billionaires are also seeking to crowd into Washington alongside Musk and Bezos. Palantir’s Thiel is a mentor of the vice-president, JD Vance, and his firm has a longstanding relationship with the intelligence community that is likely to expand under Trump. The CIA’s investment firm, In-Q-Tel, was one of the early backers of Palantir after its 2003 founding, and the company has had a major role in the development of data integration and data analytics systems for the intelligence community. Palantir is nowseeking a broader rolein developing AI for both the Pentagon and the intelligence community.Luckey, who made his name as a virtual reality entrepreneur by founding Oculus, has become a prominent new face at the intersection of Trump world and national security. Luckey’s Anduril now has a contract with the US army to develop battlefield virtual reality headsets, which would allow data to be sent directly to soldiers while also allowing them to control unmanned drones and other weapons. In addition, Anduril won a $642m contract with the Marine Corps to develop countermeasures against small drones in March. Luckey first supported Trump in 2016, when that was an unpopular position in Silicon Valley, but now that Trump is back, he has said that he’s on an “I told you so tour”, trumpeting his America-first political views.Luckey said in a recentinterview: “I don’t think the United States needs to be the world police. It needs to be the world’s gun store.”Google once committed to not building artificial intelligence for weapons or surveillance in a watershed moment of divorcing tech from the defense and intelligence industry. Earlier this year, though,the company scrapped that pledge. The campaign by the tech bros to win bigger roles for themselves in defense and intelligence represents a return to Silicon Valley’s roots. Hi-tech originally grew in northern California because of its early connections to the military and defense industrial base in the region, observed Margaret O’Mara, a tech industry historian at the University of Washington.“Silicon Valley has always been in the business of war,” O’Mara said.Explore more on these topicsUS national securityElon MuskJeff BezosSpaceXBlue OriginDonald TrumpEspionageanalysisShareReuse this content"

I’m going to die’: Music producer Itay Kashti on his kidnapping ordealSteven MorrisAs his attackers are jailed for eight years, Kashti speaks about resilience, recovery after being targeted in attackSun 6 Apr 2025 09.00 EDTShareAs he lay on the floor of a remote Welsh cottage, having been battered by a gang of masked kidnappers and handcuffed to a radiator pipe, musician and record producer Itay Kashti was heartbroken to imagine he would never see his family again.“I thought: ‘This is it. I’m going to die and this is the end of my story.’ I felt it was the final scene from a movie. I was thinking about my children.”He had a few moments to puzzle over why he was the victim in this story. He isn’t a very wealthy man and is not a high-profile figure. He wondered if it might be his roots in Israel. “I thought maybe I had been targeted for my background and somebody had decided to abduct an Israeli to make a point or gain something. But I really didn’t know.”Mahmoud Khalil ‘felt as though he was being kidnapped’, lawyers sayRead moreThe bizarre and disturbing details of Kashti’s ordeal were laid bare at a sentencing hearing at Swansea crown court when his three attackers – Faiz Shah, 22, Mohammad Comrie, 22, and Elijah Ogunnubi-Sime, 20 –were imprisoned for eight yearsfor kidnap.Believing they could make a million-pound ransom, thetrio lured Kashti from his London base to the rented cottage in Carmarthenshire. They beat him, threatened to kill him and secured him to the pipe, but Kashti managed to wriggle free and call for help.Judge Catherine Richards, who sentenced the men, from West Yorkshire and south London, ruled they had twin motives. They had targeted an “innocent” and “hard-working” man for his perceived wealth but there may also have been a political angle and he had been picked on because of his “Jewish heritage”. The judge said, as the three plotted the kidnap, they persuaded themselves that Kashti was “less worthy” of their respect and compassion.Kashti, 45, who immigrated to the UK from Israel in 2007, said: “I was stigmatised and dehumanised. The assumption was that a rich Jew lives in London, works in music, he must have money.”Speaking to the Guardian in his studio in north London surrounded by guitars and amplifiers, Kashti spoke carefully and quietly: “I live a peaceful life and I’m not a political person. There was no reason to go for a person like myself.”Nine months on, he is still trying to recover his sense of security. He cycles or takes the tube to his studio from his east London home but he is not completely at ease.“We all have a safety bubble. And that safety bubble has been burst for me. I’m more conscious of trouble that could emerge, danger that could happen, unpredictable scenarios that could pop out. When new people reach out, I have to be a bit more vigilant. I guess it’s going to take me some time until I feel fully settled.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The arrangement was that they would send a car to pick me up. They did mention that I didn’t have to bring anything but I took my Martin acoustic [a beloved guitar].”When he walked into the cottage, he sensed “something eerie, not quite right. As I stepped in towards one of the bedrooms, three guys, all masked, jumped at me and started hitting and kicking me on the head,” he said.“They said they were going to kill me and they chained me, handcuffed me to a pipe that came out of the radiator. I was bleeding, shocked.”Then, suddenly, there was silence. Kashti later found out that the kidnappers had panicked and fled. He managed to unhook himself from the pipe, grabbed his phone and his guitar. He pointed to the blood stains still visible on the guitar case. “I didn’t want to leave the guitar. I dragged it along.”Outside, he phoned his wife and police. “I was hiding behind some bushes. The police were there fairly quickly, in about 15 to 20 minutes.”Kashti said his eyes were so badly bruised and swollen that he looked like Sylvester Stallone’s boxer character, Rocky Balboa, after a brutal fight. “The left eye was completely swollen. It was closed.” He said doctors in Wales and at the Moorfields Eye hospital in north London did an excellent job to help his physical rehabilitation.His emotional recovery has taken longer. “It took me a few weeks to land back to reality. Most people didn’t know about what I’d been through and that separated me from everyone. You can’t just break it in a conversation and move on. It’s going to take a lot of time, and I don’t know what’s waiting for me, but I’m trying not to dwell.”Kashti has appeared in a couple of videos as a musician, one about the legal system in Israel and another expressing solidarity with Israeli hostages taken during Hamas’s 2023 attack on Israel. But he said there was nothing that should have made him a target.He said he was not angry with the attackers. “I hope that the jail experience will turn them into better people. If they do turn into better people, then it was worth locking them up.”Explore more on these topicsSwanseaCrimeAntisemitisminterviewsShareReuse this content"

It started: “Are you sitting down?”As an officer in Cheshire constabulary’s major crime review team, Colbourne had been tasked with solving a puzzle that had confounded police for 25 years: who wasBaby Callum?The newborn boy had been found wrapped in two bin bags by a dog walker in woodland near a theme park in Warrington on the morning of 14 March 1998, sparking a nationwide search for his parents.The discovery had a profound effect on the Cheshire town. Hundreds of young women were rounded up and some arrested. Schoolgirls were questioned and swabbed for DNA.The abandoned baby was buried in a tiny white coffin after a funeral paid for by donations at an Asda supermarket. Yet still no one came forward.But then, a quarter of a century later came the answer. A routine review identified an unusually close match between Callum and the DNA of another man whose profile had since been uploaded to the national database after an unrelated arrest.His name was Matthew Sharkey, now 28. Further tests confirmed he was the older brother of Callum – and he had unwittingly solved one of the force’s deepest mysteries. “That’s quite a significant moment,” said Colbourne, who retires in two months.The chance discovery led to the knock on the door that Joanne Sharkey, now 55, said she had been expecting for 25 years.Last week, the former council officer, who a judge said had led an unblemished life before and after Callum’s death, was sentenced after admitting killing her newborn son while in the grip of severe post-natal depression.She was handed a two-year prison term, suspended for two years, meaning she could walk out of Liverpool crown court with her family, who have supported her since her arrest in 2023.The judge, Mrs Justice Jennifer Eady, refused to jail Sharkey on the condition that she commits no further offences and undergoes mental health treatment. Eady accepted powerful psychiatric evidence about the defendant’s mental illness at the time.“The evidence is clear,” the judge said as Sharkey wept in the dock. “Not a day has passed when you have not dwelt on these matters, appreciating the horrendous nature of your crime … I am satisfied that this very sad case calls for compassion: no useful purpose would be achieved by immediate imprisonment.”Three detectives involved in the investigation have spoken of their relief at finally solving the puzzle.Former DI Jo Miller, who fronted a number of the media appeals in 1998, said: “Today brings a lot of closure for me and I’m sure it brings a lot of closure for the people of Warrington and the community that lived through the investigation at the time.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Her mental health had spiralled after the birth of her older son, Matthew, in July 1996.She told no one she was pregnant, including her husband, hiding her bump behind baggy clothing and saying her size was the result of overeating at Christmas. She gave birth alone at home in Croxteth, north Liverpool, before suffocating her child and wrapping him in bin bags.The detectives would not be drawn on whether they believed it was right that Sharkey was not taken into immediate custody for her actions.But DI Hannah Friend, the head of Cheshire’s major crime review team, stressed how the “really tragic” case highlighted the importance of comprehensive postnatal support.She said: “It’s a difficult one because you pour your heart and soul into these investigations. We always remember the victim at the centre of it. It’s very difficult to balance all the considerations, but we’re very much thinking of that little baby.”Explore more on these topicsCheshirePostnatal depressionMental healthEnglandHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

I like to think of each piece I make as a poem, written in wood.”JoJo Wood is one of the world’s leading spoon-carvers. She has 26,000 followers on Instagram and has been photographed by the world-renowned photographer Rankin, who is best known for his portraits of Kate Moss, David Bowie and Queen Elizabeth II.She, too, is passionate about how woodworking can benefit mental wellbeing.“I have spoken regularly over the years about my own mental health experiences within craft and how I have seen craft help other people,” said Wood, whose father is Robin Wood, the founder of Spoonfest, the annual celebration of wooden spoon-carving (“It’s the Glastonbury of the spoon-carving world,” said his daughter. “Tickets sell out within minutes of going on sale.”)The earliest known woodcarvings were made more than 12,000 years ago. But carving has become the perceived domain of older, white men. Those at the heart of the new movement, however, are seeking to attract a new breed of followers and carvers.View image in fullscreenJoJo Wood is one of the world’s leading spoon-carvers. She says her workshops are now ‘a really mixed group’.Photograph: Rankin“I remember going into a feminist rage when I was 18 and helping my dad set up Spoonfest, because I realised the lineup was entirely blokes,” said Wood. “I determined to give women and younger people a platform. We’re finally really getting somewhere: those attending and holding spoon-carving workshops now are a really mixed group.”The pastime is, nevertheless, still self-selecting in some ways, she said. “A lot of spoon-carving tends to happen in the countryside, so it is still quite white – and it’s also weighted towards those with the time, money and transport to get out into the countryside.”To try to counter this, Wood co-foundedPath Carvers, a social enterprise based in Birmingham that brings traditional crafts and creative arts into urban areas.The group holds free woodcarving workshops, including one for young people who have been involved in knife crime: as they teach the young people to carve spoons, Dr Katharina Karcher from the University of Birmingham discusses the history and cultural significance of knives.View image in fullscreen‘There’s a joy in the immediacy of making something really beautiful with your own hands,’ says woodcarving teacher Sophie Sellu.Photograph: Daisy Wingate-Saul“We liked the strapline: ‘Solving knife crime with a knife,’ said Sean Vivide, the co-founder of Path Carvers.Spoon-carving is now so popular that there areworkshopsin almost every county across the UK. There is aSpoontownweekend camping festival near Canterbury in England – and theGreat Scottish Spoon Hooliin Cardross, near Stirling.“Every time we start a new workshop, it fills up immediately,” said Vivide. “There is a never-ending stream of those wanting to learn: the only thing stopping us opening more is a lack of teachers.”Sophie Sellu, a woodcarver in south-east London, loves teaching woodcarving.“When I hold workshops – which are mainly attended, coincidentally, by young women – I love seeing people coming in noisy and fast, and, within minutes, becoming silent, slow and meditative,” she said.“But while the creation is slow, there’s a joy in the immediacy of making something really beautiful with your own hands that you can use right away, like a spoon or brush.”Through her business,Grain and Knot, Sellu sells wooden objects for up to £600 made from storm-fallen and reclaimed timber.“I was drawn to woodcarving by the therapeutic element,” she said. “It’s so quiet and focused: you’re constantly evaluating the natural material you’re working with, so there’s no time to think about anything else.Maryanne McGinn, now 72, has been woodcarving for 10 years. “I started when I was unhappy, angry and resentful, and searching for a new direction,” she said.“When you carve, you have to concentrate so hard that everything else disappears: there is no room for you to ruminate on the things that would normally pester you. You get into a flow state. It’s a wonderful sensation.”Explore more on these topicsCraftMental healthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But there are ways to protect yourself – and the earlier you start, the betterPhil DaoustSun 6 Apr 2025 09.00 EDTShareI’ve broken just one bone in my 61 years – my fibula, the smaller of the two that connect your knee to your ankle. I was skiing, I caught my left foot on some ice and the rest of my body just rotated around it until something snapped. Yeah, ouch. I made a full recovery, but I’d rather not break anything else. I definitely don’t want to become so frail thatjust sneezing or coughingmight fracture a rib, or gravity alone could crack my spine.Like broken hips and wrists, these are all possibilities with the bone disease osteoporosis. In Britain alone, an estimated 3.5 million people live with porous and fragile bones – and one in two women and one in five men over 50 will have a fracture as a result,according to the Royal Osteoporosis Society(ROS). The older you are, the more likely you are to be affected.Queen Camilla, the ROS’s president since 2001, lost her mother and her grandmother to osteoporosis. “My family and I watched in horror as my mother quite literally shrank in front of our eyes,”she said in 2011. “She lost about eight inches in height and became so bent that she was unable to digest her food properly, leaving her with no appetite at all … I believe that the quality of her life became so dismal, and her suffering so unbearable, that she just gave up the fight.”As with dementia, it’s easy to feel powerless in the face of osteoporosis. The risks are higher if you’re a woman (much higher, in fact, mostly because of hormonal changes during menopause), if you have a low BMI, if you suffer from certain diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, or if there’s a family history of osteoporosis. Smoking and heavy drinking also increase the danger, and it’s naive to think that most people can stop those at the drop of a hat. But simpler lifestyle changes can do a lot to improve your chances of escaping or surviving the disease.Diet is a good start, though the advice is mostly what you get in any other context. “Calcium and vitamin D are two nutrients well known to be important for bones,”says the ROS. “But there are many other vitamins, minerals and nutrients that are vital to help your bones stay healthy and strong. Try not to become too concerned with getting all these in your diet. If you enjoy a healthy, balanced diet, you’re probably getting everything you need.” That said, in Britain the weak winter sun means that from the end of September to the beginning of Aprilyou should consider taking a vitamin D supplement.View image in fullscreen‘My mother quite literally shrank in front of our eyes’ … Queen Camilla’s parents, Rosalind and Bruce, on their wedding day in 1946. Rosalind died of osteoporosis in 1994.Photograph: Keystone/Getty ImagesExercise is vital, and not just any exercise. Although older people are often encouraged to avoid weight-bearing exercises, presumably to avoid wear and tear on their joints, bones actually benefit from them. That’s especially true if they involve some kind of impact – anything from the gentle shocks of walking or climbing stairs, through running, skipping or racket sports, to jumping in basketball or volleyball. Personally, I’m going to give skipping another go, though I have two left feet and usually end up with the rope wrapped around both of them.Most of these are safe even if you have osteoporosis. The ROS advises sticking to low-impact exercise if you’ve had spinal fractures or many broken bones. In general, though: “The higher the impact, the better for your bones.”“The basics – strength training, impact-based movement and proper nutrition – apply to men and women,” addsTara LaFerrara, a Texas-based personal trainer and creator of the Broads fitness app. “But women, especially post-menopause, face a higher risk of osteoporosis due to hormonal changes that accelerate bone loss. That means it’s even more important for women to prioritise lifting heavy, eating enough protein and calcium, and getting vitamin D to maintain bone strength and prevent fractures later in life.” Why protein? “To maintain muscle mass, support bone health, boost metabolism, balance blood sugar and improve mood.”Muscle, of course, will cushion your bones in the event of a fall. But since the best way to survive a fall is to not have one, you should do as much as you can toimprove your balance. The ROS recommends tai chi, dance, yoga and pilates, and hasa brief guide to exerciseson its website. The NHS has how-tos forsideways walking, simple grapevines, heel-to-toe walks and step-ups. Lunges – forward and reverse – are also good, but challenging. Once you’ve nailed the basics, you can make things harder with aBosu ballor a wobble cushion.None of this, however, is guaranteed to spare you from osteoporosis. To detect this, your doctor may send you for a Dexa scan, which uses low-level X-rays to measure the density of your bones. But the first step is usually to complete aFrax questionnaire, a “fracture risk assessment tool” developed by the University of Sheffield. (The ROS website has a similar“risk checker”.)View image in fullscreen‘I lie down in an ugly hospital smock while the scanner head moves slowly over me’ … Daoust has a Dexa scan at 25 Harley Street, part of Phoenix Hospitals.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianThe questionnaire neatly sums up 11 of the main risk factors for osteoporotic fractures: age; sex; weight and height; whether one or both of your parents has ever broken a hip; whether you smoke; whether you drink three or more units of alcohol a day; whether you have a disorder that is strongly associated with osteoporosis, such as type 1 diabetes; whether you have rheumatoid arthritis; whether you have taken the type of steroids known as glucocorticoids, such as cortisol; and whether you’ve already had a “low-trauma” fracture as an adult. That’s a break that didn’t involve a lot of force, or even had no obvious cause.Most of us could answer those questions without too much trouble. This will be enough to give an initial estimate of your likelihood of getting a fracture in the next 10 years. If that’s high enough, you’ll probably be referred for a Dexa scan, to measure a 12th risk factor – your bone mineral density.The NHS won’t give you a scan just because you ask for one. Even if you go to a private clinic, it will need to be signed off by a qualified medical practitioner. “You have to have a clinical risk factor or two before you can have a scan,” says Prof David Reid, an osteoporosis specialist and fundraising ambassador for the ROS.I’d certainly be unlikely to get one in the normal scheme of things. Reid takes me through the Frax questionnaire, decides my skiing accident does not count as low-trauma, and declares: “Your risk in the next 10 years of having a major osteoporotic fracture is 4% – which is obviously very tiny – and for a hip fracture half a per cent.” He could consult the NationalOsteoporosisGuideline Group recommendations, he says – “but I don’t need to because I know what it would say, which is to give lifestyle advice alone. And it doesn’t tell you to measure bone density.”What would tip me into Dexa territory? A low-trauma fracture, for a start. If I’d broken my fibula in less dramatic circumstances, that would raise my overall risk to 9.9% and my chance of a hip fracture to 2%.View image in fullscreenBalancing act … Phil Daoust working on his bone strength.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianEven without that, I manage to wangle a Dexa scan so I can report what it’s like. And it’s like being a sheet of A4 in a flatbed scanner: I just lie down in an ugly hospital gown while the scanner head moves slowly over me, building up pictures of my hips and spine that can be viewed almost immediately, alongside figures for how I compare with other men of a similar vintage.I’m not claustrophobic – I’m perfectly happy inside an MRI machine, for example – but even if I was, I don’t think there’d be anything in the experience to trigger me. It’s completely painless, and Wendy Best, the radiographer who carries out the scan at 25 Harley Street, reassures me I’m getting much less radiation than I would from a standard X-ray. The same technology can be used for a body composition scan, which will reveal how much of you is muscle and fat, as well as bone. If you’re a bit self-obsessed, as I am, this is fascinating stuff.There is no doubt osteoporosis can be gruelling. Camilla paints a bleak picture of her mother’s last years, back in the 1990s: “When we tried to speak to the doctors about my mother, they just didn’t want to know. Their attitude was: ‘It’s just another old woman – just take another paracetamol.’” But if you do have the condition, there are a number of medicines that can help, either by slowing down the cells that break down bone or by stimulating the cells that build it – or both. The most commonly used drugs, bisphosphonates, belong to the first group, known as antiresorptives. For women, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) can strengthen bones by increasing oestrogen levels. “There haven’t been many studies comparing HRT with other osteoporosis drug treatments,” says the ROS. “But it’s thought that HRT probably reduces the risk of breaking a bone by a similar amount.” Doctors may additionally prescribe calcium and vitamin D.To what extent can exercise reverse bone loss? When I asked for people’s stories on social media, one woman told me she had been on bisphosphonates for eight years, and running for two and a half. Her last scan, a year ago, showed a “significant improvement”, which she felt was “definitely down to the running”. She’s now starting weight training. Another woman, 66, was diagnosed as “borderline osteoporotic” and is now in year eight of fighting “this nasty bone disease” with weights and other resistance work. “My osteoporosis has completely reversed itself,” she says.Then I spoke to Karen Hancock, 69, diagnosed with osteopenia – a less severe and even more widespread version of osteoporosis – at 52 after she got pneumonia and cracked a rib coughing. She had previously broken a wrist while hill-walking. At the time of her diagnosis, Hancock had been a keen runner for more than 40 years, with a best marathon time of just over three hours, and was on HRT because of early menopause.Hancock still runs, still takes HRT, and has been weight-training for more than a decade. Her bones don’t seem to be getting any worse, she says, and she’s never been diagnosed with full-blown osteoporosis. But although she seems to be doing everything right, nor has she reversed the osteopenia. “If I fall – which I tend to do running because I’m a bit clumsy – I do break things,” she says. “I fell walking in 2023 and broke my elbow and had to have metalwork put in. So I suppose I am at risk of the classic old lady thing of a fractured hip. It’s a bit of a puzzle, because I’m not the classic person who never does any exercise.”View image in fullscreenRadiographer Wendy Best checks the scan.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianSarah Leyland, an osteoporosis nurse and the ROS’s clinical adviser, advises against placing too much faith in exercise as a cure. “There does seem to be some new evidence coming out that you may get some improvements. You might actually see bone density improving; you might actually be able to reduce fracture risk with the right kind of exercise. But it’s quite early research, and we just don’t have the studies to show that it makes enough difference in someone who’s already in a higher-risk group. So we talk about it ascomplementary. We speak to people with very low bone density or people who’ve had fractures, and I think there’s a lack of evidence to say you can do exercise instead of taking medication.”As for my own scan results, no, I don’t have osteoporosis or osteopenia. On a chart that’s colour-coded green for normal bone mass, yellow for low, and red for osteoporosis, I appear as a little black dot near the top of the green zone. “Bone density is above the upper limit of normal for age at all sites,” the report states. Disappointingly, Reid tells me this doesn’t mean I have Superman-strength bones.Thanks to the Frax questionnaire, I was pretty relaxed about what the scan might throw up, and it turns out I was right to be. All the same, seeing that little dot in the green makes me determined to keep it there.Explore more on these topicsOsteoporosisFit for everHealthQueen CamillafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Instead, it’s a source of frustration as I crunch my legs into airplane seats and wait for them to go numb.Only after discovering Celebheights.com did I truly understand the depth of feeling – both excitement and rage – that height can inspire.It was 2019 and I was a cadet journalist reporting from the hustings, and had been barred from a brewery tour after someone nabbed the only other size 13 protective boots required for entry. So I sat alone in the break room, cursing my oversized hooves, and developed a theory that a certain wannabe prime minister had nabbed the final size 13s. I turned to the internet, where I stumbled on Celebheights.com. A whole new world opened.Its rigorous mission statement impressed me. “Heights are bare feet estimates,” it promised, derived from quotations, resumes, picture comparisons and in-person encounters.View image in fullscreenA grid of the most popular pages on Celebheights.com – ‘a thriving community of stature-obsessed keyboard warriors’.Photograph: Celebheights.comMore than a crowd-sourced database of A, B, C and D-grade celebrities’ heights, Celebheights.com is a thriving community of stature-obsessed keyboard warriors.At its heart is founder and moderator, “Admin Rob”: a self-appointed judge who hears pleas from opposing sides about why one star should be robbed of a quarter inch (Heath Ledger) or why another should be awarded an extra eighth to compensate for hunching (Roger Federer).Launched in 2004 (and retaining that era’s web design), it gained fame in 2015 when it was featured on the(criminally short-lived) Mystery Show podcast. One episode sees host Starlee Kine sift through Jake Gyllenhaal’s listing to hunt down his true height. Every commenter sounds like a madman: “I should see him shaven!” one enthusiast quips.But Gyllenhaal’s page is just the tip of the iceberg. Mariah Carey’s entry has amassed 1360 comments since 2004. Carey has repeatedly said she’s 5’9”, but her listing was adjusted down after a torrent of vitriol from commenters proclaiming she was anywhere from 5’8½” down to 5’2”.Complicating calculations is Carey’s penchant for high heels. Trigonometric arguments about a specific shoe’s heel height – and how much it would add to her standing – are routine.Debate intensified in 2005, when user Patricia Carey wrote: “My daughter is 5’9” I should know I’m her mother!” This was quickly discounted as a fake.View image in fullscreenFurious debate rages over Mariah Carey’s height.Photograph: Celebheights.comConjecture continues to this day. Rob has shot down requests to close comments: “The only time an argument should end is when they get measured … Until then I think every celebrity’s height can still be discussed until the end of time.”View image in fullscreenOften, the site’s moderator conducts field research – in the form of celebrity meet-and-greets.Photograph: Celebheights.comWhen he’s not moderating swears and death threats, he’s conducting field research.Rob has made it his life mission to meet-and-greet as many celebrities as possible, ideally back-to-back. Comparing them to his own height – 5’8” – is his only acceptable test.His success rate in convincing celebrities to remove their shoes for barefoot measurement is unclear. When they refuse,such as with Sam Neill,Rob provides separate heel measurements – for the celebrity and himself.But even a celebrity whose height Rob has confirmed personally can be up for debate.Actor Brendan Fraser’s was initially listed as 6’3½”,based on a 2008 Guardian interview, but later changed to 6’2½” after Rob was able to get aphoto with him at a 2019 fan meet, albeit with the actor refusing to remove his fedora.This did not satisfy one commenter, who insisted Fraser’s “maximum morning height” – Celebheights jargon for how humans are tallest each morning before their spine gradually compresses through the day – was surely 6’3½”, before shrinking to 6’3” by lunchtime and 6’2.75” by bedtime.Some commenters do, however, provide valuable insights.“He’s a massive lift wearer,” user Simon wrote after claiming to have met Russell Crowe at a party 10 years earlier. “He got pretty tipsy and took his shoes off. He wasn’t particularly tall before. But when those shoes came off he was probably 5’8½”, max 5’9”.Could you walk across the UK in a perfectly straight line? Inside YouTube’s strangest challengeRead moreSurprisingly, even celebrities whose fame is built on being short have been caught fibbing. Danny DeVito has publicly claimed he stands “five feet short” on “a really good day” – though the figure is disputed.“In August of 2007, I was in the same subway car as someone that looked just like Danny DeVito,” Celebheights commenter MilkyB offered in 2019. “Based on the height of the doppelganger, I’m confident in saying he is 4’10½” at a minimum.”This led me down a DeVito wormhole. I re-emerged hours later with a cursed algorithm, now bombarded with ads for Danny DeVito cardboard cutouts.A mere human, I quickly caved, and now share my bedroom with a lifesize Danny. Infuriatingly, the manufacturer appears to have fallen for DeVito’s lies: cardboard Danny stands at 5’ tall.Explore more on these topicsCultureInternet wormholeInternetCelebrityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Only one of the 20 top Michelin-starred restaurants now serves a medium: the Ledbury in Notting Hill. At the rest, diners are offered 125ml or a whole bottle at 750ml.Hannah Crosbie, the Guardian’s wine critic, said it was something she had noticed and “found quite interesting”.“Any time there’s a big changing of tides or a notable difference in the way we drink wine, it really is a reflection of the culture and how we’re drinking now,” she said. “First of all, I’d say it’s reflective of people just drinking less generally.”Crosbie said it felt “like a more health-conscious decision” but could sometimes be a convenient excuse to have a glass of wine instead of skipping it altogether. “Instead of not getting wine, you get a smaller glass of wine.”View image in fullscreenThe Ledbury in Notting Hill, north-west London: a last holdout for the larger glass of wine?Photograph: Britta Jaschinski/ShutterstockAnother reason, Crosbie said, was that consumers were increasingly trying wines they would not have tried in the past.“The average person – particularly in metropolitan areas, not speaking for the whole of the country – is now more adventurous with their wine choices than they’ve ever been,” she said. “So instead of perhaps having a bottle and just sticking on one wine for the entire night, they would instead want to try lots of different things and, again, in order to keep on top of what they were drinking, they would just have smaller glasses so they could try as much as they can.”She cited the rise of bars focusing on natural wines – those that are typically organic and use minimal processing – as these “tend to have much smaller bistro ISO-style glasses [smaller wine glasses for tasting] and that naturally lends itself to a smaller serve.”Jono Hawthorne, the chef patron at Chef Jono at V&V in Leeds, agreed and added that price was also a huge factor. He still serves large glasses but has noticed a trend towards customers wanting smaller glasses of higher-priced wines.“The rise of smaller wine bars, especially natural and low-intervention wine, has led to more expensive wines being offered to customers,” said Hawthorne, who worked at Michelin-starred restaurants such as Noma and the Box Tree and competed on MasterChef: The Professionals before running his own kitchen.Price is something he is conscious about when it comes to his own customers, offering affordable fine-dining options including creative five-course menus priced at £45. “If you put a 250ml glass of wine on a menu, it would be the price of a bottle to some people,” he said.View image in fullscreenChains such as Pizza Express, Wetherspoon’s and All Bar One appear to be resisting the trend.Photograph: Kumar Sriskandan/AlamyBut the good news for those unsatisfied by smaller servings is that chains such as Wetherspoon’s, Pizza Express and All Bar One appear to be resisting the trend.“A small glass of wine doesn’t sound right, does it?” said Sanda Anlezark, over a bottle shared with her friend Jean Collingwood in All Bar One in Manchester city centre. The pair, 20 years retired from careers in advertising sales, were taking advantage of a Thursday deal at the chain where buying two glasses gets the rest of the bottle free – and were surprised to hear that wine sizes appeared to be shrinking.Collingwood agreed. “The best thing is when you don’t have to ask, the person behind the bar goes … [she nods, conspiratorially] … and brings you a large.”What if you went to a bar that only served small glasses? “It wouldn’t bother me,” said Anlezark. “You’d get a bottle.”Explore more on these topicsWineAlcoholFood & drink industryRestaurantsHospitality industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Late last year the not-for-profit Biodiversity Council commissioned a survey of 3,500 Australians – three times the size of the oft-cited Newspoll and representative of the entire population – to gauge what they thought about the environment. The results tell a striking story at odds with the prevailing political and media debate.A vast majority of people – 96% – said more action was needed to look after Australia’s natural environment. Nearly two-thirds were between moderately and extremely concerned about the loss of plants and animals around where they live.Unsurprisingly, the cost of living was way ahead when people were asked to nominate the issues they would like leaders to prioritise. But the environment was in a peloton of four issues vying for second place, alongside housing, healthcare and the economy.From blackening skies to barely casting a shadow – the Carnaby’s cockatoo faces a bleak futureRead moreOn what they would like to see done, three-quarters of respondents said they would back stronger national nature laws, including the introduction of clear environment standards against which development proposals could be measured and potentially rejected.Any survey should be treated cautiously, but the Biodiversity Council’s director, James Trezise, says it is not a one-off – the results are consistent with the findings of similar surveys in 2022 and 2023.They are also clearly at odds with where Anthony Albanese ended this term of parliament, with Peter Dutton’s support. After bowing toan aggressive industry-led backlash in Western Australiato shelve a commitment to create a national Environment Protection Agency, the prime minister rushed through a lawto protect Tasmanian salmon farmingfrom an environmental review.Get Guardian Australia environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as an emailLongtime campaigners say it meant the term began with a government promising the environment would be “back on the priority list”, including a once-in-a-generation revamp of nature laws, but finished with existing legislation being weakened in a way that could yet have broader ramifications.The message from peer-reviewed science is blunt: Australia is in an extinction crisis.Over the past decade, more than 550 Australian species have been either newly recognised as at risk of extinction or moved a step closer to being erased from the planet.KoalaAustralia tops global rankings for mammal extinction – at least 33 species have died out since European invasion. Illustration: Meeri AnneliThefull list of threatened Australian animals, plants and ecological communitiesnow has more than 2,200 entries. It includes some of the country’s most loved native species, including the koala, the Tasmanian devil, the northern hairy-nosed wombat and a range of the type of animals that Australians take for granted: parrots, cockatoos, finches, quolls, gliders, wallabies, frogs, snakes and fish. Scientists say that, unless something is done to improve their plight, many could become extinct this century.Partly, this is linked to a global threat – what is described as the world’s sixth mass extinction, and the first driven by humans. But part of it is specifically Australian and avoidable.A 2021 government state-of-the-environment report found the country’s environment was inpoor and deteriorating healthdue to a list of pressures – habitat loss, invasive species, pollution and mining, and the climate crisis. Australia tops global rankings for mammal extinction – at least 33 species have died out since European invasion and colonisation – and is number two behind Indonesia for loss of biodiversity.The overriding question from scientists and conservationists who dedicate their lives to protecting the country’s unique wildlife is: what will it take for national leaders to take the issue seriously? And will this campaign – and the next parliament – be a last chance to hope for something better?“A lot of people in the scientific and conservation community have found the last three years exceptionally frustrating. A lot was promised but in the end we went backwards,” Trezise says.“The survey shows there is a clear mismatch between what Australians expect the government to be doing and what it is actually doing. And it found there has been a decline in trust in politicians on the issue, particularly the major parties.”Over the next week, Guardian Australia’s environment team will tell the stories of passionate people trying to circumvent this in their own quiet way by working to save threatened animals.This work is most often done with little, if any, government support. One of the findings from the Biodiversity Council is the extent to which Australians overestimate the federal government’s commitment to biodiversity. Most guess that about 1% of the budget is dedicated to nature programs, a proportion that theGreens have said they would argue forfrom the crossbench, and that would translate to about $7.8bn a year.Trezise says that, while funding for nature has increased since Labor was elected in 2022, the reality is that in last month’s budget, on-ground biodiversity programs received just 0.06% of spending – or just six cents for every $100 committed.Lesley Hughes, professor emerita at Macquarie University and a senior figure in environmental science as a member of the Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists and the Biodiversity Council, says it is a “deeply depressing” figure given that most people would think even 1% was a “pathetically small amount” to save species from extinction and preserve places they care about. “I do think it shows politicians totally underestimate how much people care about nature,” she says.She says it is tied to a broader lack of understanding that a healthy biosphere is “our life support system”. “We should treat it as a precious heritage item that is irreplaceable, and we need to see ourselves as part of nature,” she says. “We are just another species.“OK, we’re a clever, resilient and adaptable species, but we’ve destroyed so much because we haven’t seen ourselves as being dependent and a part of it.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The singer and activistPeter Garretthad first-hand experience of how nature is considered in government decision-making, having served as Labor environment minister between 2007 and 2010. Garrett blocked development proposals more than other environment ministers but says nature protection was rarely seen as a first-order issue by leaders in government and bureaucracy. He has seen no substantial improvement since leaving parliament.“That’s a tragedy, particularly given the policy commitments that the current government had when it came into power,” the Midnight Oil singer says.“The problem that we have is that, whether it’s at a federal or at a state level – and notwithstanding the best intentions and efforts of environment ministers and [non-government organisations] and scientists who advocate on behalf of nature – when it comes to the final decisions that are taken in the cabinet room by political leaders through the prism of economics, nature always comes last. There are exceptions to that, but very few.”View image in fullscreenDean Arthurell of Carnaby Crusaders at his property in Lower Chittering, Western, Australia with a Carnaby’s black cockatoo.Photograph: Lisa Favazzo/The GuardianGarrett says addressing that requires a shift in thinking at the top of government but also across the community. He agrees Australians love nature but says it often becomes a lower-order issue at the ballot box. It means that while conservation gains are possible – for example, anexpansion in protected areasand support for First Nations ranger programs under Labor in this term – they mostly happen in places that no one wants to exploit.“It’s very difficult in this country to break the cognitive dissonance between us loving our wildlife and enjoying an incredible environment and actually putting resolute steps in place to make sure that it’s protected, even if that comes at a cost,” Garrett says.Trezise says that is backed up by another finding from the survey – that while people care about nature and want more done to protect it, they have little real insight into how steep the decline has become, or what a biodiversity crisis actually means.Part of what it means goes beyond what is captured by a threatened species list. It also refers to the loss of diversity within species and ecosystems, including local extinctions of once abundant creatures.This has become a common story for many Australians who have watched the disappearance of wildlife from particular areas during their lifetimes. To give one example: Brendan Sydes, the national biodiversity policy adviser at the Australian Conservation Foundation, lives in central Victoria.Grey-crowned babblers, birds with a curved beak and distinctive cry that are found across tropical and subtropical areas, were common in nearby bush earlier this century but have vanished.Are we going to see unfettered housing developments and oil and gas exploration basically take over every square metre of the continent?Peter Garrett“For us there’s a sort of a continuing discussion of: have you heard these birds recently?” he says. “And the answer is: maybe they’ve gone, maybe we’re not going to see them any more. And that’s the legacy of fragmentation of habitat and the vulnerability that results from that.“The same thing is happening with other once-common species. And once something’s gone from the area, it’s likely gone forever.”Sydes says it is easy to become immune to this sort of decline. “It’s become a sort of feature of Australian nature,” he says. “We really need strong, dedicated action for it to start to turn around.”How to respond to this is a deeply challenging question. It could start with an end to the government greenlighting the clearing of forest and woodlands relied on by threatened species. The Australian Conservation Foundation found nearly 26,000 hectares – an area more than 90 times the size of Sydney’s central business district – wasapproved for destruction last year. Under the existing laws, far more clearing than this happens without federal oversight.The challenge is not only to stop the loss of habitat but to restore the environment in places it has been lost in 250 years of European-driven clearing. Experts say that becomes particularly important in an age of climate crisis, when species adapted to living at particular temperatures and with particular levels of rain are being driven from their longtime habitats as the local conditions change. Connecting fragmented forests and other parcels of nature will become increasingly important.View image in fullscreenBogong moths once swarmed in such large numbers that meteorologists mistook them for rain clouds – but populations have collapsed since the turn of the century.Photograph: Lisa Favazzo/The GuardianLaying over the top of this is the impact of invasive species that kill and diminish native species but are now so pervasive that they have changed the landscape for ever. It means there is no going back to the environment of 1750. A question that the political debate over the environment has yet to fully grapple with is what success from here actually looks like.The environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, raised the idea this term by promising a “nature positive” future, adopting a term that overseas has been defined ashalting and reversing nature loss by 2030 measured against a 2020 baselineand achieving “full recovery” by 2050. It would require retaining existing natural ecosystems – both areas that are highly intact and remnant fragments – and starting immediate restoration work on damaged and lost nature areas.But achieving that will demand significant funding – whether from public or private sources – in addition to tightening laws to prevent further destruction. Labor passed legislation to encourage private investment but hasn’t explained how, or when, it will arrive in significant sums.Australians deserve answers on climate before they vote. Here are five things we still don’t know | Adam MortonRead moreIt is unclear if the “nature positive” tag will survive into the next term given that it has been rejected by WA industry, among others. Albanese has again promised to fix the lawsand introduce a different model of EPAto that promised this term, but he has given no details. Dutton says no one can say the existingenvironment protection system is inadequateand promises faster decisions to allow developments to go ahead.In her darker moments, Hughes wonders if anything can change but she says she remains an optimist. She sees signs of a resurgence in the idea that people need to connect with and value nature as important to the human race, and says it could make nature and species conversation become a higher priority. “Let’s hope that’s the case,” she says.Garrett says the path ahead for people who want change needs to be “building community and organisational strengths”, and supporting activists prepared to put themselves on the frontline using nonviolent direct action against fossil fuel exploitation and environment destruction.“It’s about a transformative ethic that lifts what we have and recognises what we have been able to secure jointly,” he says. “It gave us a great conservation estate – look at the world heritage areas, look at Kakadu – but those great gains are in danger.“Are we going to see unfettered housing developments and oil and gas exploration basically take over every square metre of the continent that’s left for them to do it? Or are we going to draw a line in the sand?

We would have been quite helpless without her.”The British intelligence agent Donald Darling had her down as an especially “cherished agent of [Charles] de Gaulle’s government”. Well aware of her importance, the UK foreign intelligence service MI6 called her “the pet lady agent” of the Free French.Before the second world war,Josephine Bakerhad been “the Black Venus”: the world’s first female superstar of colour, dancing the Charleston dressed in nothing but pearls and a banana skirt, parading her pet cheetah, scandalising and delightingle Tout-Paris.After the war, Baker became a prominent and outspoken US civil rights campaigner, famously speaking with Martin Luther King Jr at the 1963 March on Washington and adopting 12 children from eight countries to live with her in her chateau in the Dordogne.View image in fullscreenJosephine Baker takes part in the 1963 March on Washington, where she spoke at the side of Martin Luther King Jr.Photograph: Sipa/ShutterstockDuring it, she was a spy. Shrouded in the fog of war, then recounted afterwards – often unreliably – in the memoirs of people (including Baker herself) with a story to spin, the entertainer’s wartime exploits have long been a subject for speculation and mythmaking.But a new account, working from contemporary, often unused sources, has uncovered evidence that Baker was not only a highly effective agent but was also using the same celebrity that provided the perfect cover for her espionage as a powerful means to promote the cause of equal rights.“Looking at her life through the prism of the war really helps us understand who she was, and to make sense of what she did later on,” said Hanna Diamond, a professor of French history at Cardiff University and the author ofJosephine Baker’s Secret War, which is published on Tuesday.“The war was so important; it’s the missing piece of her puzzle. She [Baker] was amazingly well equipped to be a spy; a performer, through and through. Her motivation came from the huge debt she felt toFrance, which had made her a star – and it had its roots in the racism she grew up with.”View image in fullscreenJosephine Baker sings in the Municipal theatre in Oran, Algeria, north Africa.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyBorn in 1906 in St Louis, Missouri, Baker left school at 12 and in 1921 was cast in an early all-Black musical on Broadway. Four years later, she won a place in a Paris show, La Revue Nègre, and set sail for France. She swiftly became a huge star.By 1939, when she was recruited by Jacques Abtey, an initially sceptical French intelligence agent who would become her handler and on-off lover, Baker was Europe’s highest paid entertainer and one of its best-known female celebrities.Abtey taught her the tricks of the spy trade, such as using invisible ink, but it was Baker’s far-reaching fame – which meant everyone, everywhere wanted to meet her – and easy charm (which ensured they also talked freely) that were her real espionage assets.From early 1941, Baker, under the aegis of the French secret services, travelled from Marrakech, where she was based, to Lisbon, Madrid, Seville and Barcelona, and round north Africa, giving concerts, attending receptions – and gathering and passing top secret information to allied agents.View image in fullscreenJosephine Baker receives the Légion d’honneur and Croix de guerre in 1961.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesShe proved expert enough at it to be awarded, after the war, the resistance medal and, belatedly, the Légion d’honneur with the military Croix de guerre.Although precisely what was in the notes that she carried – often pinned to her bra – was, in many cases, officially unrecorded and remains unknown, Diamond’s research suggests that on several occasions it proved hugely valuable, and was sometimes critical.Previously unused sources show, for example, that after the allied landings in north Africa in 1942, Baker and the local leaders she had cultivated played a crucial role aiding US counter-intelligence in Morocco, identifying Nazi spies and allowing hundreds of arrests.“We now know she continued as a key intermediary between the French, Americans and Moroccans through 1943 and 1944,” Diamond said. “We’ve long known a little about her allied spying activities. But this role as a vital go-between is new.”View image in fullscreenJosephine Baker performed in north Africa for allied troops, including unsegregated US military personnel.Photograph: © Jean Tourtois/ECPAD/DefenseSimilarly, contemporary sources show Baker’s well-documented postwar anti-racism campaign was already under way in the early 1940s. Her tours of US army camps across north Africa brought her face to face with the racial segregation she had left behind in 1925.Press interviews from the time make her motivations for performing very clear: “I am doing all I can to help win the war effort,” she told the Chicago Defender in 1943, but also “to make people generally more appreciative and kinder to my race”.Gaining acceptance from the troops for whom she was singing and dancing was about promoting racial tolerance at home, Baker told the Palestine Post that same year: “Every success that I have counts for my coloured brothers in America.”In north Africa, Baker performed, unusually, for audiences of unsegregated US troops. Playing to British forces, she was also subject to ugly racist remarks, apparently from South African troops, UK armed forces entertainments officer Henry Hurford Janes recorded.The question was existential, Diamond said. “Discrimination was behind her decision to stay in France. In Paris, she had distanced herself from the other African-American exiles. She wanted to be French and when the war came, unlike others who left France, she stayed to support her compatriots.”View image in fullscreenJosephine Baker dances with her husband, Jean Lion, at the Porte de Versailles in Paris in 1937.Photograph: APBaker refused to perform in occupied Paris, however, moving to the Dordogne days before the Germans arrived and, later, on to Vichy-controlled Morocco. Her 1937 marriage to Jean Lion, which made her a French citizen, reinforced her views. Lion was Jewish and Baker helped his family escape the Germans. “She knew very well, at first-hand, what Nazi racism meant,” Diamond said.By contrast, her ardent Gaullism – she corresponded frequently with the general long after the end of the war, the book reveals – and idealisation of France meant she kept largely quiet when its north African colonies strived for independence.In 2021, Emmanuel Macron decidedBaker should become the first Black woman to enter the Panthéon in Paris, the mausoleum for France’s “great men”. The French president referenced her wartime activities – which were a revelation to many.“In France,” Diamond said, “she is mainly known as a music-hall star, and in the US as a civil rights activist.” A whole chapter – the spying missions, the concerts that raised large sums for the resistance, her subsequent uniformed service in the French air force – was far less familiar.View image in fullscreenDuring Josephine Baker’s induction into the Panthéon, Emmanuel Macron referenced her wartime activities.Photograph: Sarah Meyssonnier/ReutersHaving begun her research “somewhat sceptical”, Diamond said she finished it “convinced Baker actually was really very valuable. She may not always have known what she was transmitting, but she did what she was told, and she did her best.”The picture that emerges, Diamond said, is of “an incredibly able, shrewd, committed” Black woman who “saw very clearly that she could exploit her celebrity for a cause and, often with very great courage, then just went ahead and did so”.During the war, Baker mobilised her talent as a performer, on and off stage, for Free France. After it, she applied what she had learned, effectively harnessing her celebrity to protest against the racial segregation policies of her native country.“Knowing more about her wartime experiences helps us see how she herself came to understand what she could achieve,” Diamond said. “It was the war – the intelligence work and the performing – that made her aware of her power.”Josephine Baker’s Secret War: the African American Star Who Fought For France And Freedom is published by Yale University PressExplore more on these topicsJosephine BakerSecond world warCivil rights movementFranceEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

But what role does yoghurt actually play in longevity?Get our weekend culture and lifestyle emailBianca NogradySun 6 Apr 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 6 Apr 2025 17.24 EDTShareSupercentenarians – humans who live beyond 110 years of age – are objects of great fascination in our death-fearing culture. Interviews with them inevitably demand to know that one simple ingredient that is the secret to their extraordinary longevity; was it a shot of whisky before bedtime, maintaining good friendships, a happy marriage or always having a pet?In the case of Spain’sMaria Branyas Morera– who was the world’s oldest person until she died at the very ripe old age of 117 last year – one possible answer to that question was yoghurt.Thestudyattempting to get to the bottom of Branyas’s biological good fortune revealed that for the last couple of decades of her life, she ate three serves of yoghurt a day. Analysis of her gut microbiome showed unusually high numbers of a beneficial bacteria known as bifidobacterium, which can be boosted by yoghurt consumption, and a “microbiome that confers an increased likelihood for a healthy extended lifespan”, the researchers wrote.Why everything you think about living to 100 might be wrongRead moreBefore you rush out to your nearest supermarket and load a trolley with fermented dairy, there are a few things to know about Branyas and yoghurt.The first is she did a lot of things right, not just the yoghurt, says gastroenterologistProfessor Emad El-Omar, director of the University of New South Wales Microbiome Research Centre at St George hospital in Sydney.She ate aMediterranean diet, which is high in vegetables and fruit, wholegrains, legumes, nuts and seeds, and low in processed foods, red meat, added sugar and refined grains. This diet also provides exactly the right complex carbohydrates, dietary fibre and other nutrients for beneficial gut bacteria to thrive on.“The Mediterranean diet is probably the healthiest diet in terms of its composition and how it feeds the microbiome,” El-Omar says. “If you’re eating a healthy diet and living a healthy lifestyle, that is reflected in the composition and the function of your microbiome, which then works for you instead of against you.”Branyas didn’t smoke or drink alcohol, she exercised regularly, and spent lots of quality time with friends and family.And she had good genes. “She did the first thing right – she got the right parents,” says nutritionistProfessor Clare Collinsfrom the University of Newcastle. “She probably lived on a small island, no car, eating lots of seafood, walking up and down the hills, eating vegetables from the local market, and then adapting her dietary patterns as she went.”So what role, if any, might yoghurt have played in Branyas’s staying power?Yoghurt is interesting because it has live bacteria in it, and in particular a type called lactobacillus, saysAssociate Professor Claus Christophersen, a microbiologist at Edith Cowan University in Perth. This is one of the bacteria that turns milk into yoghurt, by feeding on the milk carbohydrates to produce lactic acid during the fermentation process, which then causes the milk proteins to coagulate.Lactobacillus are also important bacteria for good gut health, although we generally have low levels of them, he says.“If you have more of them, you tend to drop your pH in your gut, which is a good thing, so that actually keeps pathogens at bay a little bit easier, and it favours more of your beneficial bacteria if your pH is a little bit lower,” Christophersen explains.Lactobacillus also appear to have beneficial effects on the immune system.“When we talk about gut health, we often talk about the large intestine, where the bacteria grows,” Christophersen says. “But in the small intestine is where there’s lots of connection with the immune system.”The 10 best yoghurt recipesRead moreThere’s also evidence that beneficial gut bacteria produce their own antimicrobial substances that help suppress the growth of harmful bacteria, El-Omar says.“They’re essentially keeping away the nasty guys and allowing that coexistence and natural balance that protects you from infections,” he says.And increasingly, scientists are coming to understand the positive interactions between the gut microbiome and a range of other body systems, including the brain.Yoghurt is also a good source of these beneficial bacteria because the dairy fats help protect the bacteria from the highly acidic stomach environment, so they can pass through and into the small and large intestine.But not all yoghurt is created equal. “It’s yoghurt with live microbes in it, and it’s not squeezy-pouch yoghurt with acidity regulators and preservatives or colours and flavours,” Collin says.The dairy section of any supermarket is filled with a dazzling array of yoghurt choices, so Collins recommends choosing carefully. “You’ve got to go to the supermarket going, ‘I’m standing in the yoghurt aisle today, and I’m going to take my time’,” she says. That includes looking at labels and ruling out the products with lots of numbers – which represent the chemical additives – in the ingredients list.“Or you can just buy plain Greek yoghurt and just grin and bear it when you eat it and it’s really tart, or eat it with a bit of fruit added to it, or a bit of cinnamon on top, or something like that,” Collins says.Once you’ve got your good yoghurt, it also helps to eat it regularly, like Branyas did. “She was having it three times a day; she would have been getting her microbiome community topped up repeatedly all day,” Collins says.Explore more on these topicsHealth & wellbeingAgeingAustralian lifestyleFoodDiets and dietingNutritionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Or maybe toe wrestling is more your thing? These (real) sports are ripe with joyful eccentricity – but for contestants and supporters, it’s serious competitionSun 6 Apr 2025 09.00 EDTShareWorm charming‘The sheer madness of it is the appeal’Each year around May, people flock to the village of Blackawton in Devon. Divided into teams of three, they are given a plot of land measuring 3m x 3m. While their dignity is sometimes lost in the process, ferocious bangs to the ground, war cries, singing and silly costumes are most certainly invited. But why?Well, if they can coax enough worms to the surface, there are prizes at stake: this is the World Worm-Charming Championships after all.It’s a proverbially ancient art, with a questionable origin story. Chris Oughton, head of the worm-charming committee explains: “Back in 1980, two gentlemen were on the way out from the pub and needed to stop, for a certain emptying reason. While they were both stood watching the field opposite, they noticed seagulls doing a dance in order to get the worms out of the ground.”And so, each year, about 300 competitors (and similar numbers of spectators) arrive in the small village. “The sheer madness of it is the appeal,” smiles Oughton, the guy who “makes sure the competition happens.”Digging is strictly prohibited, instead the worms have to be “charmed” to the surface. In 2009, Sophie Smith broke the world record – held since 1980 – by charming 567 worms. Often competitors remain empty handed. The competition starts with prep time during which each team is given a numbered plot and are allowed to “prod and play”. But noxious liquids are banned. “You’re allowed to shower the ground with any liquid you are prepared to drink,” Oughton explains, although it sounds rather ominous – just how far are people willing to go?Teams are in threes due to the roles that need to be assigned: a charmer, a picker-upper and a worm-counter. The rules are simple: in 15 minutes you want to pick up as many worms as possible from the assigned plot. It’s an international affair, with people coming from Estonia, South Africa, Japan, Cyprus, France and Germany.“It all happens in secret fields. Nobody knows where it is until that day,” explains Oughton. “Before the competition, there’s an ode to the worm that we sing. We also do a little prayer to make sure that the sun comes up every day, and then we process to the secret field.” The entire competition is prepared and run by volunteers and there’s an entrance fee of £5, which is donated to charity.While there aren’t too many recurring champions (apart from a team called the Frogs who have won three times in a row), there are some signature moves to up your chances. “Liquid and vibration are the two winners really. You’ve got to replicate that sound or feeling of rain.” Winners received worm-themed trophies, handmade by local potter, Imogen Nobel.“The lengths people will go to are hilarious, we’ve had saxophone players, druids, people playing cellos and, of course, lots of dancing and stamping,” Oughton says, adding, there’s no occupational hazard to the worms: “We’re very strong in our worm welfare, and we’ve been building that over the years. Half worms will get you disqualified – no cruelty to the worms. And they are immediately counted and then put back in a pre-dug trench, so they can get straight back out there. We provide containers so that people don’t handle the worms too much at all.”Pudding throwing‘It was pretty serious stuff. People were chanting my name in the streets’View image in fullscreen‘It was like entering a football match’: Harry Hogden, 2024 pudding throwing champion.Photograph: Richard Ansett/The ObserverThere’s nothing better to accompany a Sunday roast than a crispy, battered boat ready to be filled with gravy – also known as a Yorkshire pudding. For one weekend a year in September, however, a pub in Ramsbottom, Greater Manchester, becomes the gathering place for those trying to destroy this well-loved roast accompaniment – by throwing a black pudding at it.The competition has been held here since the 1980s, in a lighthearted (if that’s possible) homage to the Wars of the Roses, fought by the House of Lancaster and the House of York in the 15th century. There are 12 Yorkshire puddings to start with. They sit on a 20ft-high scaffolding plinth, placed in four pudding towers that are each three puddings high. The aim of the game is to lob a black pudding, via underarm throw only, high enough that it knocks the Yorkshire puddings from their tower. Each competitor gets three goes and the person who can knock off the most wins. Competitors must also have one foot standing on a golden block to ensure they are not too close.In a moment of spontaneity in 2024, 17-year-old Harry Hogden decided to join his family and 50 fellow Swinton locals on a coach trip to Ramsbottom. Having never seen pudding-throwing in real life before, he figured it would be a quirky, fun day out.Although technically a junior, standing at 6ft 4in meant he had to compete in the adult division. “As soon as I got out of the coach, it was like entering a football match. One group of people was wearing a football kit with four stars on top of their badge, showcasing that they had won four times. It was pretty serious stuff,” he explains.In the end, Harry managed to knock six puddings off the plinth, making him the champion. “People were picking me up, throwing me up over their shoulders and chanting my name in the streets,” he beams. He was awarded £100, a trophy and a necklace of black puddings.“A week after, I went to a festival not far from where I live, called Manchester Rocks. A stranger came up to me and asked if I was the pudding-throwing champion!” Harry very much hopes to fight for his title in the next competition. Does he have any advice on technique? “Swing and pray,” he says.Maggot racing‘Some maggots don’t even start and some get halfway and then start going backwards’View image in fullscreen‘We make sure to give the maggots names so that spectators can cheer them on’: Barrie Butler, maggot-racing organiser.Photograph: Richard Ansett/The ObserverAround 30 years ago, 75-year-old Barrie Butler went abroad on holiday with his wife – today he doesn’t remember where they went, but what he does remember is being introduced to maggot racing by a man outside a local social club.After coming home to the UK, cab-driver Barrie decided to build a six-lane race track suitable for maggots. Like horse-racing, but with smaller subjects, bets are placed by spectators as to which maggot might win and six races are run over the course of the night. Maggots are kept in labelled lanes in order to tell them apart. The money from each betting programme sold goes to charity.Each winning maggot then gets entered into the final race. “Some maggots don’t even start and some get halfway then start going backwards,” says Butler. While he is based in Lincolnshire he’s adamant he will take bookings anywhere there is a demand. He currently hosts around two races per month with up to 120 people attending, details of which are uploaded on his website (maggotsontour.co.uk). Each race is shown on a 120in screen. “It’s not like fishing; you don’t have to warm the maggots up in your mouth or anything, but they are supplied by my local fishing shop,” he says. “I then place them in boxes that can be joined together so that all the maggots can be tipped on to the track at the same time when the race begins.”With each race lasting on average two and a half minutes, Butler likes to keep things interesting by sometimes adding matchsticks as hurdles. “We make sure to give the maggots names so that spectators can cheer them on: Sweet Caroline, Smiling Susie and Brian are the most popular ones.”For Butler, the night is all in the commentary and he refers to himself as “Big Bad Baz” during races. At the end of the race, the winning maggot is auctioned off to the highest bidder. The highest a single maggot has ever sold for was £530, which was donated to charity at the end of the night.Shin kicking‘The first time I competed there was a lot of bruising, but it got better each time’Dating back to 1612, shin kicking today makes up part of theCotswold Olympick Games, which takes place every May and includes more standard running races and tug o’ war. Shin kicking isn’t for the faint hearted, although steel toe caps were banned decades ago, it is still very much a contact sport. Competitors battle one on one, placing a hand on each other’s shoulders with arms straight while kicking each other in the shins, the aim is to unbalance the opponent and force them to the floor. The winner is whoever is able to achieve the most throwdowns within three rounds.Five-time champion Adam Miller hasn’t competed since his last win in 2020, but still watches each year. “You can use as much straw as you can for padding between your knee and ankle,” he explains. Miller grew up locally in Honeydale, Chipping Norton, and has been used to watching the match each year. He describes it as “a game that gets the community together”. He was first signed up in the pub in 2015, but never imagined winning: “I thought, what have I got myself into?“Everyone is provided with a lab coat-style jacket to give you something to hold on to, but also they protect people’s clothing from ripping,” he explains. But there’s no sure way to protect yourself from the inevitable pain of being kicked in the shins.Miller might have more advantage than others though. “I can take a good kicking,” he admits, adding that, as he’s a farmer, “I’ve been used to cracking my shins on equipment and having sheep kicking me and all sorts.”Which leg you use to kick the shin doesn’t matter, the goal is to unbalance someone enough to get them on the floor. Some even compare the moves of the sport to jiu jitsu. On average there are between six and 10 pairs competing each year, and are partnered up at random. “The first time I competed there was a lot of bruising, but it got better each time I entered,” says Miller. Every year the winner gets a medal and an engraved cup, which they have to return. “People watch this and think we are all stupid, but this is tradition, people think it’s brutal, but it’s the sport,” says Miller.While he encourages everyone who is thinking about applying to “give it a go”, if this one feels more of a spectator sport, then there are plenty of food and drink stalls to keep you occupied.Toe wrestling‘You should only enter if you’re prepared with the mindset that your toe might break’View image in fullscreen‘This sport has what it takes to be in the Olympics’: Ben Woodroffe, four-time world toe-wrestling champion.Photograph: Richard Ansett/The Observer“The aim is to interlock your big toe with your competitor’s and then get your opponent’s foot on to a horizontal board,” explains 36-year-old Ben Woodroffe, the four-time world toe-wrestling champion, under the moniker “Toe-tal Destruction”.The game begins on the right foot and continues until someone has pushed a foot on to the horizontal part of the board, also known as the “toedium”. Once a point is scored, competitors then switch feet and play again on their left. They do a final third round on their right.The sport celebrated its 50th birthday in 2024 and originated in Derbyshire at a pub called the Bentley Brooke, when a booze-fuelled brainstorm was held between a group of friends, who jokingly decided to create a sport they could be good at. (They were beaten by a Canadian in the second year of the championship.)Today around 200 spectators turn up in Ashbourne’s market square each year, with some competitors so loyal to the sport that they have entered yearly for the last 15-plus years. Alan “Nasty” Nash remains the longest-reigning champion, with 17 wins under his belt. He officially retired in 2024. A tattoo on his leg reads: “In a ring of toes where champions dwell, with nimble digits they cast their spell.”The sport was turned down by the Olympic committee in 1998, but with a recent rebrand it’s hoped they can push for the 2033 Olympics. Woodroffe started recruiting people in Paris last year. “This sport has what it takes,” he says.Woodroffe has been watching toe wrestling since he was 14 years old and always dreamed of winning the championship. He campaigns for people to take the sport more seriously, but is aware that many believe it’s all a joke.In 2024, 28 competitors entered the tournament, which lasted around three hours. A waiver must be signed by competitors before entering to acknowledge that they are “free from foot infections or conditions that could be contagious or harmful to other participants”. A referee also confirms foot hygiene after each competitor washes their feet in a bucket of soapy water.If the toes won’t grip, either because they’re too sweaty or different sizes, talcum powder can be used, and if that fails, they will be strapped together with gaffer tape and bandages. While being bandaged toe-to-toe with a total stranger might be too extreme for some, last year marked the first year when winners were handed a cash prize of £500 each alongside their medal and trophy.“You should only enter if you’re prepared with the mindset that your toe can break,” Woodroffe warns. “Mine broke at a 90-degree angle last year, but I kept going. Pain is temporary, being a champion is for a lifetime.”Explore more on these topicsSports gamesThe ObserverComedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Whatever their president does, plenty of Americans continue to believe in those tooSun 6 Apr 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 6 Apr 2025 13.31 EDTShareIt seems as inevitable as the economic chaos let loose by Donald Trump’s madavalanche of tariffs: a precipitous drop in the number of tourists visiting the US, which is now forecast to be even worse than initially feared. In February, overseas travel to the country was down by 5% compared with the previous year – and, now, reputable forecasters arepredicting a dropof nearly twice that size.We all know why. Trump’s hostile words about Canada and Mexico have hitthe US’s top two marketsfor tourism.Finnish, German and Danish transgender and non-binary peoplehave been advisedby their governments to contact a US diplomatic mission before travelling there. Note also a trickle of reports about outsiders falling foul of the cruel stringency apparently now gripping the American authorities: a 28-year-old woman from north Walesheld for 19 daysin a detention centre and escorted on to her plane home in chains; the French scientist who wassummarily denied entryinto the US after his phone was found to contain messages criticising the president. Those stories intensify the Trump administration’s general air of brutality and belligerence, which also brings familiar fears to the surface: of guns,politicised thuggeryand a country in a frighteningly volatile state. The result is the sudden understanding of the US as somewhere that may be best unvisited – which, for millions of people, brings on a very painful pang of loss.Many of us, after all, have always had our understanding of the world shaped by what some people call American soft power. My first sense of the US’s allure came when I was a four-year-old, watching the glorious educational TV showSesame Street, and being spellbound by its multiracial cast, and the way it offered a much more thrilling take on letters and numbers – and life – than the staid fare we got from the BBC and ITV. A little later on, I can recall a few lucky childhood friends returning from American holidays – in Florida, usually – coming home with comics and sweets that increased my sense of the States as a beguiling land of dreams. And then came the clincher: a great mountain of music, which still sits at the heart of my understanding of what the US is, and how it may survive its current crisis.The best American music is nothing if not honest: for me, it worked as a corrective to any rose-tinted ideas I had about the US, while somehow making me even more dazzled. That is definitely true of a run of records made between the late 1960s and mid-1970s, which I still return to again and again: the music of the consummate social commentatorCurtis Mayfield, or the mixture of small-P politics and joyous self-actualisation that runs through Stevie Wonder’s peak work, from Music of my Mind (1972) to 1976’s Songs in the Key of Life. By way of listening to something utterly different, when I first became immersed incountry music, I heard another kind of American truth: the sound of men finding space to be wounded, broken and vulnerable – in retrospect, the complete opposite of the brittle machismo Trump has made his own.View image in fullscreenJohn Harris outside Sun Studios, Memphis, Tennessee, 2001.And then I finally went there: first to the usual big cities, and then to parts of the country too often overlooked. Twenty or so years ago, I took repeated trips to the deep south – Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, Georgia – and found myself simultaneously holding two completely contradictory sets of thoughts. One was to do with the awful intersection of racism – institutional and everyday – and poverty, and the plain fact that the richest country in the world had left so many people to sink. The other, though, was a sense that at least some of these places were making fitful and hesitant progress towards something better. One of my guidebooks talked about a region going through something akin to the journey South Africa had taken after the end of apartheid: on a good day, it was just about possible to believe it.One of my most vivid memories is of a stiflingly hot weekday night in the Mississippi Delta town of Clarksdale, which is still a byword for cotton and slavery, and their long and awful legacy. In a bar owned by the actor Morgan Freeman, I watched a prodigiously talented teenager from the Middle East – her family were refugees – who, thanks to an educational programme run by the town’sblues museum, had learned to play spellbinding lead guitar in the style of such stars asBuddy GuyandAlbert King. She did her stuff watched by a mixed crowd, who were not just amazed, but seemed to share some idea that what we were watching was a small symbol of things improving.Not long after, the advent of Barack Obama’s presidency seemed to spectacularly crystallise some of the same sense of everyday hope, and that very American line, paraphrased from the preamble of the constitution, about progress towards a more perfect union. Whatever that means – and notwithstanding all the hatred, hypocrisy, slaughter and cruelty woven through the American story – I can still feel its force.Are Trump’s tariffs for real or an AI hallucination? I’m afraid the answer is both | Marina HydeRead moreBut Trump, clearly, wants to take his country in the opposite direction, partly by trying to reshape his country’s culture and the image it presents to the world. This is the meaning of – among scores of other actions – theremoval of black Americansfrom educational material produced by the Arlington national cemetery, his attacks on “improper, divisive or anti-American ideology” within the Smithsonian museum network, andhis self-installationas the chair of the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington DC. Such Republican lawmakers as the surreally stupid congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene even want todefund Sesame Street. In the midst of all those unhinged economic policies and assaults on science and academia, these moves are in danger of being overlooked. But they are just as important.My daughter is 15, and as interested in the US as I was at her age, something boosted by the fact that the country between 1789 and 1900 is part of her GCSE history syllabus. She wants to visit the Civil Rights Museum in Memphis, Tennessee, and Sun Studios, where rock’n’roll first took flight. When she finally gets to New York, her first stops will include the Museum of Modern Art and what remains of the old Greenwich Village. I now wonder: should we go? But I think we still will, for one very good reason: that in the end, everything those places and institutions represent will prove to be Trump’s undoing. Put another way, he is not America. And for those of us who remain fascinated by the US, the best response to his misrule is not to turn away, but to keep faith with the Americans who understand that – not as dazzled outsiders, but people whose future depends on something better.John Harris is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsUS newsOpinionDonald TrumpUnited States holidaysTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

But I’ll use it over my dead bodyPolly HudsonThe blue-and-purple hoop is supposedly there to answer questions that arise in chats, but it’s a slippery slope from providing bus times to annihilating the human raceSun 6 Apr 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 6 Apr 2025 14.45 EDTShareThere arefive stages of grief, but only two stages of discovering the little Meta AI circle on your WhatsApp screen. Fear, then fury.When I first saw the small blue-and-purple hoop last week, I was terrified that it meant I was now livestreaming my life to the entire metaverse, something I presumed I had agreed to when accepting but (of course) not reading the terms and conditions. As the saying goes, if you’re not paying for the product, youarethe product.The relief that I hadn’t broadcast my most horrified expression to the world was short-lived. At least it was possible to deletethat free U2 albumthat Apple foisted on its customers in 2014; there is no way to remove Meta AI from WhatsApp. I didn’t – don’t – want Meta AI. If I liked it, I would have put the ring on it. But I don’t, so I didn’t. I have not given consent. How dare they?It’s almost impressive that one small icon can be so infuriating. Also, this is how it ends, right? I wonder if Mark Zuckerberg can feel that little circle pulsing even when the app is closed, the smartphone equivalent of Edgar Allan Poe’stell-tale heartbeating away under the floorboards.Instead of asking it how to get rid of itself – which is unnecessarily rude and amounts to immediately surrendering – I Googled instead. Because there are no issues there, obviously.It transpires that I am far from alone in being frustrated by this uninvited arrival. Although the omnipotent shape hasn’t reached everyone’s phones yet, the internet is full of people ranting, mostly about their inability to deactivate it. Of course, there will be some who welcome theMetaAI button, who will use it constantly and eventually exist purely to serve it. The rest of us should be free to disable the feature, though, rather than forced to accept it – a menacing presence in the corner, always there, watching, waiting.The idea is that it can answer questions mid-chat: tell you what time the film you’re discussing going to see that night is showing; check how long you will have to wait for the bus to get to the cinema. But, like ChatGPT, Meta AI can also suck out your brain and become you. It’s a slippery slope: one minute, you’re asking it what was Christmas No 1 in 2003 to settle a bet; the next, you’re tired after a long day, so you let it reply to a friend’s message on your behalf. Come on, they’ll never know. What harm can it do?Unbeknown to you, your friend is simultaneously sliding down the same slope: their Meta AI is responding to your Meta AI’s reply. At first, you are just having a conversation that neither of you are really having, but how long before you’re having a friendship neither of you are really having?The next logical step? Meta AI avatars of you and your friend meet up for a virtual night out, while the real versions of you lie in the foetal position with headsets on, expressionless, slowly wasting away.I have no idea what Meta AI is capable of (apart from the annihilation of the human race), and I will never know, because I will not use it. I know I am probably making my life more difficult, but I don’t care. One woman’s luddism is another’s revolution. Apparently, we’re powerless to stop AI taking our jobs and our livelihoods. That is distressing enough, but now it’s after our relationships, too. This is the last straw. I am an extraordinarily dedicated grudge-holder and I will never break.There is an extremely convenient shop near my home that I haven’t patronised for eight years due to Yoghurtgate (don’t ask). I walk miles out of my way and the owner doesn’t notice or care, but I won’t relent. The smug circle of Meta AI has now been added to my grudge list. I am at war with it, for ever. If I am choking and it’s the single source of information on how to Heimlich yourself, I am petty enough to die on this hill.Polly Hudson is a freelance writerExplore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OpinionComputingMetaWhatsAppMobile phonescommentShareReuse this content"

Keir Starmer is on the Kool-AidStewart LeeInstead of standing up to Trump, the PM is encouraging people who want to destroy our values to come and do it in our country at reduced tax ratesSun 6 Apr 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 6 Apr 2025 06.13 EDTShareOn 1 April, the TV comedian John Richardsons, who you will have seen on many panel shows, announced he was becoming a teacher, having already completed the training in secret. I was humbled by Richardsons’s decision to do something genuinely worthwhile and by his foolhardy bravery. How would he control a class of teenagers pre-armed with clips of him clowning around with Russell Brand onThe Great Celebrity Bake Off?But it turned out Richardsons’s story was merely an April fool prank. D’oh! The fact that the inspiring tale wasn’t true left me deeply saddened, like the time I wept when my mum finally told me Father Christmas hadn’t been eating the mince pies I’d made for him. I was 28 years old.Of course a multimillionaire comedian wouldn’t quit comedy to become a teacher on a £31,650-a-year starting salary, you idiot! That would be ridiculous. Richardsons’s April fool was a publicity stunt to promote his casting as a teacher in the soap operaWaterloo Road, where actors are paid more than teachers to pretend to be teachers.But perhaps Richardsons should change career. And perhaps, despite being “the world’s greatest living standup” (theTimes), so should I. We should all do the right thing and comedians have crowd-management skills that transfer well to the classroom. “I remember when I had my first Prime energy drink, Jenkins! I’m here all week!! Try the fish!!!”Teachers inspire kids and thus change the world for the better. But nobody ever went on to change the world after watching8 Outof 10 Cats. And wouldn’t it have been great, for once, to see someone successful walk away from their wealth to help humanity? It shouldn’t always have to beMichael Sheenputting himself out, again and again and again, his beard all wet with Welsh rain.Like most north London champagne socialists, I am increasingly disappointed, for example, by the endless wrong choices ofKeir Starmer, who I voted for hoping he would allow me to pay lip service to progressive values while making minimal negative impact on my own standard of living and hoarded assets. That went well. Having been handed a blank cheque by a disillusioned electorate, Starmer has instead just drawn a fat ejaculating penis on it and left it on the worktop by the waste caddy to get smeared with old stinky food.Donald Trump says he is imposing tariffs because other nations have been“raping” the US for years, and it’s bold to use that verb as a metaphor for financial exploitation when you, and many of your houseguests and cheerleaders, have been accused of rape: Mike Tyson,Brand,Conor McGregorandAndrew Tate. It’s the worst series ofTaskmasterever.Is our economic future merely as an airstrip full of low-taxed American servers generating AI memes of Trump dressed as a golden Disney king?In return for our10% lower-than-averageTrump tariffs, Starmer offeredtax breaks to US tech companies. Presumably, these tech companies are the same sort of tech companies Starmer was complaining about last week because they didn’t regulate their hateful and false content? This false content includes Elon Musk-endorsed posts saying the “incel” dramaAdolescence,which Starmer is basing policy on, was originally a true story about a murderous black boy who was changed to a white boy because “blah, blah, wokeness, blah, blah, blah”. And, by the way, that bit in inverted commas was an actual quote from Kemi Badenoch.When the US national security adviser, Michael Waltz, invited a journalist on to an insecure group chat, we learned thatwanting to see Europe fail is essentially official American policy. Trump’s US is our enemy. And Jeff Bezos’sAmazon directly donates to Trump; former PayPal executives areembedded in Trump’s government; Uber’s chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, directly donates to Trump;Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta gave Trump $1m; a senior executive at Peter Thiel’s Palantir spyware company, into whose metaphorical Miami mansion Wes Streeting wants to move all our alluring NHS metadata, helped finance Trump’s campaign; and Musk’s Twitter, currently X, actively advances far-right talking points to destabilise European democracies and promote fascist candidates. They seem nice.Starmer is encouraging people who want to destroy our values to come and do it in our country at reduced tax rates, like a man putting on trousers made of meat and running towards a leopard. Even Ed Davey, the Evel Knievel of the centre left, says ourmoral responsibility is to join Canadaand the EU in opposing this new dark US. But, with our gross domestic product and European alliances decimated by Brexit, we can’t afford to take the moral high ground, which was of course the plan of its shadowy backers all along. Is our economic future merely as an airstrip full of low-taxed American servers generating AI memes of Trump dressed as a golden Disney king?People understand the peril we are in. I spent last weekend ecstatically inhabiting a small Welsh town at a multidisciplinary arts festival where punters and performers alike were preparing for possible US trips by deleting all their social media,fearing airport incarcerationfrom Trump’s thought police. But at least our Trump tariffs are 10% lower.What happened to youthful ideals? In March 2024, Starmer said he remembered being inspired by leaving his “village for the city of Leeds” and discovering “a whole new world of indie bands – like Orange Juice and the Wedding Present”. Did Malcolm Ross take his distinctive guitar work from Josef K to Orange Juice just so Starmer could sell us out to the new Nazis, like Neville Chamberlain waving a various-artists cassette thatcame free with a mid-80sNME?“I have in my hand a copy ofC86.”Perhaps, unlike the April fool John Richardsons, Starmer should become a teacher. We need more teachers. And if a big boy was bullying all the little kids and stealing their dinner money, Starmer’s already shown he knows how to look the other way.Stewart Lee vs the Man-Wulftours until spring 2026 with a Royal Festival Hall run in JulyDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But it turns out unions don’t always make for the best, or even adequate, employers themselves.In last week’s parliamentary debate on the use of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) by employers to cover up abuse and discrimination in the workplace, Labour MP Louise Haigh recounted how unions haveused confidentiality agreements to hush up appalling behaviour.One example is the Transport Salaried Staffs’ Association (TSSA), which has used NDAs totry to preventformer female employees from publicly making allegations of sexual harassment against Manuel Cortes, the general secretary at the time; a 2023 review by Helena Kennedy KC later found that there had been “appalling incidents” and “leadership and management failings” at the TSSA in relation to sexual harassment and that Cortes’s behaviour around women was suchan “open secret”that women joining the organisation were warned never to be alone with him. It is not just unions. Haigh has also used her parliamentary privilege to talk about the case ofan ITN employeewith functional neurological disorder who experiences seizures and blackouts. He experienced severe bullying and discrimination from his managers, including being forced to apologise to those who had witnessed a seizure, and being accused of lying about his disability. He took ITN to an employment tribunal; the company eventually settled but forced him to sign an NDA as part of the agreement.Layla Moran, another MP pushing for change,has raised the caseof a female ITN employee who was demoted after ending an abusive sexual relationship with an older male editor; after she complained, she was suspended without pay and told she could not talk to anyone but the police about it; in settling, ITN got her to sign an ultimately unenforceable NDA that gagged not just her but her partner, her friends and her parents, from talking about what had happened to her.The stories we are least likely to hear are of those in low-paid, insecure jobs who are unlikely to have access to legal adviceHaighalso last week raised the caseof the former employee of a mental health charity who believes it has discriminated against at least four workers on mental health grounds, including herself; three ended up signing an NDA.Because NDAs are so effective at gagging people from talking about abuse and discrimination – even when they would be unenforceable in court, they frighten workers into silence – we rarely hear about them apart from in the very high-profile cases where survivors, often women who have been sexually assaulted by powerful men, have been brave enough to break them via the press.Zelda Perkins, a former PA to the jailed film producer Harvey Weinstein, founded the Can’t Buy My Silence campaign after she broke her own NDAto speak outabout his criminal behaviour. She has long been campaigning for change because it is clear that NDAs are being used to undermine employment protections right across the labour market.The cases raised by MPs using parliamentary privilege show just how systemic the problem is. Trade unions that exist to protect workers from abuse; media organisations whose job it is to hold power to account; charities that pride themselves on advocating for those with mental health issues: if these organisations are using NDAs to gag people from talking about things that are in the public interest, you can bet it’s going on in most workplaces.The stories we are least likely to hear are of those working in low-paid, insecure jobs who are unlikely to have access to the legal advice needed to challenge them. And it is those most likely to experience discrimination – women, ethnic minority workers and disabled people – who will be most affected.There are legitimate uses of NDAs: to protect confidential business information or to protect workers from details of discrimination cases being discussed – at their request – for example. The problem is that a legal tool originally intended to protect trade secrets and the like has expanded into a boilerplate legal clause that a huge number of employers routinely slap into settlement agreements.This has huge implications not just for holding employers accountable for abuse and discrimination in the workplace, but for freedom of expression. Why should a nurse who accepts a settlement from an NHS trust have to sign an agreement that seeks to prevent them from criticising that trust in perpetuity, for example?Various spurious arguments are advanced against clamping down on the use of NDAs: chiefly, the idea that if you take away the power of employers to bully former employees into signing NDAs, there will be fewer settlements. But settlements will still be reached as a means of avoiding expensive court cases. In the US – hardly a bastion of employment rights – 27 states have introduced tougher restrictions on the use of NDAs, and an analysis of data from six suggests settlement ratesactually went upafter they were enacted.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That’s an important development, but there is absolutely no reason why employees and students of universities should be entitled to these protections, while those who work for outsourced cleaning companies contracted by universities should not be.Haigh and Moran are leading efforts to get the government to amend its employment rights bill to more tightly regulate the use of NDAs across the economy; they not only have the support of the Conservative and Liberal Democrat frontbenches, but from business and union leaders and experienced lawyers in the House of Lords.It would be remiss of the government to introduce further important employment rights – such as banning exploitative zero-hours contracts and fire-and-rehire policies – without also addressing a key reason it’s so difficult for workers to enforce their existing protections. It should not only restrict the use of NDAs in harassment, bullying and discrimination cases, but where there is a public interest in ex-employees speaking out about matters that involve their former employer.This is so often how it works: when employment rights become codified in law, the powerful find workarounds, like NDAs, to evade their legal responsibilities, even as they claim to support them. Ministers must finally close this longstanding and much-abused loophole.Sonia Sodha is an Observer columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

If Trump wantsCambodiato import more American goods: look, we are just a very small country!”Khun Tharo works to promote human rights in the Cambodian garment sector, which employs about 1 million people – many of them women.“I think they are very concerned about their jobs, and I think they are very concerned about their monthly pay cheque. And that has significant effects on the livelihoods of their dependent family,” says Tharo, programme manager at the Centre for Alliance of Labor and Human Rights (CENTRAL), a Cambodian workers’ rights organisation.One of the most wilfully destructive aspects ofDonald Trump’s shock and awe trade policyis the imposition of punitive tariffs on developing countries across Asia, including rates of49% for Cambodia, 37% for Bangladesh, 48% for Laos.For decades Washington had championed economic development through trade. Now, at the same time as slashing overseas aid budgets and retreating from its role in supporting developing nations, it is ripping up that idea entirely.In its place, Trump intends to impose his will on the US’s trading partners. Some are all but powerless to exact concessions, given their small size, and dependence on the mighty American market.Cambodia hastily offered to cut tariffs on US goods on Friday, in a bid to propitiate Washington.Contrary to Trump’s bombast about the US being “pillaged”, the tariffs are not in any sense “reciprocal”.Instead, they relate to the size of the US goods trade deficit with each country, and the value of its exports. (Side note: the 10% paid by the UK has nothing to do with Labour’s negotiating flair – it just came out of the fact that Britain buys about as much stuff from the US as it sells the other way).Ironically, many of the countries in the global south hit by Trump had benefited from preferential schemes offering low or zero tariffs, precisely because building up exporting capacity is an accepted path to development.Alice Oyaro, the chief executive at the charity Transform Trade, which works with producers in some of the worst-hit countries, says: “Our biggest concern is that the additional costs are pushed down to those in the supply chain who are least able to pay. Small farmers exporting everything from green beans to cocoa, and women workers in Bangladeshi factories are already finding it hard to make ends meet. They will see their incomes squeezed even more.”TinySri Lanka, which has an economy 0.3% of the size of the US’s, faces a 44% tariff despite being bailed out by the International Monetary Fund two years ago and continuing to negotiate debt restructuring deals with its creditors.“It’s a highly vulnerable situation,” says Ajith D Perera, the chair of theAsia PacificTrade Agreement (APTA) Chamber of Commerce and Industry. “Sri Lanka will lose export income and see a hit to GDP and employment – and that comes at a time when it is just coming out of bankruptcy.”He fears the scale of the tariffs could compromise Sri Lanka’s ability to meet the conditions of the IMF bailout deal. Trade is meant to be a key prop for growth, as it rebuilds its shattered economy.“I think the fundamentals have been challenged by the US decision,” he says. “25% of Sri Lanka’s exports go to the US and 70% of that is garments. I think the government needs to start discussions with the IMF immediately.”As his warning suggests, there is a risk that a grim side-effect of Trump’s trade war will be to exacerbate the debt crises already hittingheavily indebtedpoorer nations.Even countries that have escaped the most punitive tariff rates could still be hit hard if the prospect of a global downturn depresses the value of the commodity exports on which many rely.Keir Starmer and other leaders of the developed world have been preoccupied with their own domestic responses since Wednesday’s bombshell briefing in the White House Rose Garden.But the severity of the probable impact for the global south calls for a concerted approach, too – albeit one that will have to bypassWashington.Most of the hardest-hit countries can already trade tariff-free with major markets under projects such as the EU’s Everything But Arms programme and the UK’s Developing Countries Trading Scheme, which are designed to help the poorest nations to develop through trade.But if Trump’s tariffs stick, multinational brands focused on the US are likely to switch production rapidly to countries hit with lower rates. One garment buyer in India told me on Friday she was already hearing of factory owners in Bangladesh being told by US brands that they would now be manufacturing their sweaters in Peru, which has a rate of just 10%.The social dislocation in some of these hardest-hit economies could be profound, if such rapid shifts result in mass layoffs.And the case for debt write-offs, already clear, may become all the more pressing, if the resulting the looming global downturn sweeps vulnerable countries over the edge.The fact that the British government’s deep cuts to the aid budget now sit alongside a probable global economic downturn and heavy US penalties for exporters in developing countries makes that decision all the more shameful.Back in Cambodia, Tharo says: “The industry right now seems to be in a little bit of a hectic situation. The government is also extremely worried because they are not seeing any alternative markets at the moment. And we don’t have significant goods to be exported to any other country.“Trump doesn’t care,” he sighs.Explore more on these topicsTariffsEconomics viewpointDonald TrumpTrade and developmentTrump administrationCambodiaUS politicsAsia PacificcommentShareReuse this content"

Yes. It’s on my ‘do not play’ listOliver KeensI get why wedding DJs are increasingly discerning. Our  job is to spread joy on the dancefloor – not upset and divisionSun 6 Apr 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 6 Apr 2025 09.21 EDTShareIhave DJed at some impressively esoteric weddings in my time. I started playing clubs in 1999, but in the mid-2000s I started advertising myself as a wedding DJ on the era-defining digital noticeboard Gumtree. One heroic couple only wanted the music of abrasive Manchester geniuses the Fall for the entirety of their nuptials. Another sweet couple wanted to evoke the night they met at 5am at the London gay club Fire – so hired me to bang out punishing hard house from 5pm in a hotel function room.From experience, people who hire wedding DJs are usually fairly clear about what they like. They may provide a short list of songs they love, usually across a few genres, and trust a DJ to fill in the gaps. It’s rarer that people are clear what they explicitly don’t like.However, a story in the Times this week claimed that wedding DJs increasingly “cater for these sensitivities” by “drawing up ‘do not play’ lists, to ensure that a happy couple’s happiest day is not spoilt”. It cited Ben Boylan, founder of Non-Traditional Wedding DJs, who claimed that names such as R Kelly and P Diddy were frequently appearing on such lists. In another piece in the New York Times, a 39-year-old rabbi from Manhattan explained she hadrequested no Kanye West, given his current pro-Nazi stance. “If a song is controversial or offensive to any community member, that should really be thought about,” she said.The art of DJing is essentially just a series of choices. You are forced to make a brand new decision every three to four minutes and hope you get them all spot on until the lights come on at the end.So the idea of curbing a DJ’s ability to choose may seem like a dangerous route to go down; a curb on artistic and creative freedom. Yet this is not a new phenomenon. I am proud that over the past 10 years or so the UK’s dance music scene has fiercelyshunned artistswho, in the cases of techno producers Konstanin and Boddika, for example, have respectively talked down female DJs and used anti-immigrant language online, or Lithuanian Top 10-scoring producer Ten Walls, who hasespoused homophobia.View image in fullscreenKanye West performs at Rolling Loud 2024 in Inglewood, California, 14 March 2024.Photograph: Scott Dudelson/Getty ImagesWhereas other creative industries take decades to erase bigots in their midst, DJs en masserejected their music almost instantly. To be clear, this isn’t cancellation by some kind of sinister cabal or woke diktat: I have never encountered a single “do not play” list in any club ever, even ones with activism and political causes at their core. I think the fact that DJing is so rooted in fast choices is a blessing in this regard. Choosing “no” just isn’t a big deal. That said, if I’m honest, I wouldn’t be averse to more clubs having “do not play” lists. Sometimes, it would be nice to not have to make all the moral decisions by oneself.As the Timespiece made clear, the more vile things we learn about our favourite artists, the more they rightly trigger our sensibilities. Just as a good DJ knows how to read a room, a modern DJ should already be well versed in deciding which artists and songs may make a room of strangers feel upset.‘Do not play’ lists: why every party needs one – or you’re bound to upset the guestsRead moreMy own moral approach has always been to remember that a DJ’s job is to spread joy to every single person in that room. Morrissey has made too many statements seen as hateful for many people to enjoy, I can report. Yet the fact that several 1970s rock stars slept with underage girls doesn’t seem to be an issue for older people’s morality on the dancefloor. I paused playing Lizzo when her former tourdancers accused herof sexual harassment and body shaming, and stopped playing Diplo afterallegations of sexual misconductarose. Their innocence or guilt is oddly immaterial: I just don’t want to even risk that someone on my dancefloor might feel bad, period.Beyond the individual tracks that make up a set, that’s my ultimate choice as a DJ – to treat a dancefloor as a beautiful haven, not a “platform” like Speakers’ Corner.DJs respectfully disagree on artists all the time, too. I personally find Azealia Banks’s previousonline hatred abhorrent (it ended for me in 2016 when she used thesame racial slursabout Zayn Malik that I got called at school). But her 2012 hit 212 is a mainstay of modern queer clubs, and I enjoy an ongoing dialogue with fellow DJs about her place in the culture.And even though in the wake of the vile stories told inLeaving NeverlandI give a hard “no” to Michael Jackson tracks, I’m keen to stress that nobody ever notices the omissions. There really is so much amazing music out there that you can be a principled, moral DJ and still kill it every time. In short, do not fear a “do not play” list: nobody should feel excluded from enjoying themselves, and if a song threatens that, simply choose something else.Oliver Keens is a writer, author and columnist, as well as a DJDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Last month’sattack by the shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick, on guidelines recommending that individuals from ethnic and religious minorities, as well as women and young adults, should have pre-sentence reports written about them, typifies the corrosive cultural politics he specialises in.Mr Jenrick wants toundermine the independence of the judiciarybychanging the lawso that the secretary of state, and not the 14-member Sentencing Council for England and Wales, has the final say. The guidelines have now been paused, after the government introduced legislation that would make parts of them illegal.Mr Jenrick is playing with populist politics. In claiming that courts following the guidelines would be biased against Christians and “straight white men”, he was fomenting racial and religious divisions. Since there is nothing in the guidelines about sexual orientation, and “faith minority community” could include many Christians (such as Catholics or Quakers), his claims were not only damaging but false. Inflammatory claims about “two-tier justice” deliberately raised the temperature on what ought to be a calm, expert-led process. They also distract from important practical issues such as the high vacancy rate in the probation service. Without staff, the high-quality reports that courts need cannot be produced.Racial disparities in sentencing, as well as policing, are widely recognised, particularly in relation toblack men convicted of drugs offences. The most recent research finds that, while overall disparities are not as wide as was claimed in the landmarkLammy report, and class bias in sentencing can also be identified, black offenders in England and Wales are40% more likelyto be jailed than white people convicted of equivalent crimes.It should not be controversial to propose the more frequent use of reports, as one means of addressing this problem and others – including the harm caused to children when their mothers are jailed. But presumably out of fear that rightwing attempts to stoke up a sense of grievance – particularly among white voters – would strike a chord, the justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, took up the cause. Unless the government changes its mind, it willsoon be illegalto give advice on pre-sentence reports that differentiates between defendants on the basis of “personal characteristics” – although consideration ofcircumstanceswill still be allowed.Law and order has long been a favourite theme of authoritarian populists. A previous draft of the guidelines was rejected by Ms Mahmood’s Tory predecessor, Alex Chalk. She should have seen trouble coming and held her nerve when it did. Therelationshipbetween the Sentencing Council and her ministry, as well as with parliament, appears underdeveloped. The last time its chair gave evidence to the justice committee was in 2022.Ms Mahmood’s jobis far from easy. Prisons are chronically overcrowded and the public accounts committee warned recently that delivering 20,000 more placeswill cost £4.2bnmore than planned. Things were left in such bad shape by theToriesthat Ms Mahmood releasedthousandsof prisoners early last autumn. Ministers are waiting fora reportfrom the former Conservative justice secretary David Gauke before deciding what to do next.It is impossible to see a way out of this crisis that does not involve the increased use ofcommunity sentences, supported by technology and a strengthened probation service. Ms Mahmood urgently needs to reclaim the initiative. Cynical attempts to portray white Christian men as the victims of equality-mad judges should be dismissed out of hand.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Back then, 25,000 people were killed or injured each year by landmines; by 2013, that numberhad fallen to 3,300.Tens of millions of mines have been destroyed, and by last year, 164 countries had committed themselves to the agreement.Progress, however, has now gone into sharp reverse. In October 2024, the United Nationsreportedthat Ukraine had become the most mined country in the world after the invasion by Russia, which is not a party to the Ottawa treaty; both sides have used the devices. Deaths and injuries in 2023 rose to 5,700 globally, manyin Myanmar, another non-signatory, as well as in Ukraine.Human Rights Watchwarnedthat the use of mines by Myanmar’s junta and by Moscow was threatening the effectiveness of the agreement. It has, unfortunately, been proved right. This week, Finland announced thatit would leave the treaty– joining Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. All blame the military threat from Russia.Their thinking is understandable. Finland’s border with Russia is about 800 miles long. The Baltic states are small, and relatively isolated, geographically, from other Nato members. Moscow uses landmines with far less care and discrimination than these countries would be likely to, if required to defend themselves against it. Without a reliable US security guarantee, and given the time it will take for Europe to replace that US role, these states see themselves as having little choice. There can be no such justification for the UK to leave, as the former Conservative defence secretary Sir Ben Wallaceand othershave advocated.While modern landmines – such as those given by the US to Ukraine last year – can come with self-destruct mechanisms, campaigners say their efficacy cannot be guaranteed, and that they are more costly, so less used. Overall, it is clear that because mines are intended to be hidden, and to detonate automatically, they take a toll long after conflicts have ended. Four-fifths of landmine victims are civilians, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross; about half of those are children. Alarmingly, the threat of proliferation comes as mine-clearance projects globally have been halted due to the axing ofUS fundingby the Trump administration in January, though the state department says it has resumed some programmes.Norway, which also shares a border with Russia, is to be applauded forrestating its commitmentto the Ottawa treaty. As its foreign minister, Espen Barth Eide, warned, the danger is that the stigma of landmine use is being weakened, encouraging warring factions to resume it. As alarming as the current regression is, it must not be seen as evidence that the pact was an act of naive optimism to be jettisoned by countries now facing a harsh reality. Rather, with more than 100 million active landmines still buried worldwide, and more being added daily, it is evidence for the necessity of the agreement, and the importance of championing it.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Guardiola was asked about the chant.“[It was a] lack of class,” City’s ­manager said. “But it’s not United, it’s the people [supporters], you know? We are so exposed in ­football – managers, owners, and football players especially. Honestly, I don’t understand the mind of the ­people ­involving the mum of Phil, it’s a lack of integrity, class, and they should be ashamed.”Pep Guardiola left to rue dropped points as Manchester derby ends in a drawRead moreIt is understood that City were shocked and disgusted by the chants and the number of people involved. United’s stance is that they condemn all abusive chants aimed towards players.The draw leaves City in fifth place on 52 points, a point behind ­Chelsea in fourth, with seven games left. ­Concerning the challenge for a ­Champions League place, Guardiola said: “Seven games, Crystal Palace [next], go for it. I’d prefer to have 10 more points or 12 more points but it is what it is. It’s Old Trafford, it’s always difficult. We fought and we were there. The players gave everything. We should attack with more fluidity.“I’m not concerned about next season right now, I’m just concerned about recovery, Crystal Palace, Everton, Aston Villa and the FA Cup semi-finals [against Nottingham Forest].“It would have been better to win but Old Trafford is Old Trafford and United are a transition team. We wanted to make a good buildup and process and we defended really well. They are dangerous when we lose balls in the position like we are not good.”United remain 13th in the table, andRuben Amorimwas asked how difficult it will be to turn the club’s fortunes – and style of play – around. “I can say we want to be competitive in the short space of time but to be really dominant against that type of opponent is going to take a lot of time,” United’s head coach said. “We have to use different weapons. In that way of playing [ball domination] City is maybe the best team in the world. If you compare this game against Arsenal, we have some moments we did the better today was different.

Aspiring professionals spend most of their youth dreaming of making it, only to get there and then wonder if they truly belong. Even Roger Federer doubted himself for many years.It has takenJack Drapera long time to truly believe he deserves to be considered as one of the world’s best players. Tipped from a young age as a future star, he had obvious talent as a junior but, as with Andy Murray, his body has taken a while to catch up, with a number of injuries interrupting his momentum.Jack Draper dismantles Holger Rune to claim Indian Wells titleRead moreBut as the clay-court season begins this week in the iconic surroundings of the Monte-Carlo Country Club, Draper stands as the world No 7, having cracked the top 10 on the back of his first Masters 1000 triumph in Indian Wells last month. The 23-year-old is also No 3 in the current-year rankings and with very few ranking points to defend up to andincluding Wimbledon, the left-hander has a golden chance to rise further.His confidence has never been higher but he is always asking more of himself, never convinced that he has done enough. “Obviously, I have confidence in my tennis and confidence in myself,” Draper says, relaxing with the Mediterranean sea rippling in the background. “Especially when I go out and compete, I feel like I have a sort of personality on the match court, where I just compete for every ball, and I feel amazing, especially in that scenario. But it’s one of those things, when I first came on to the Tour – I was speaking to Jacob [Fearnley, his fellow British player] – about it last week, it’s kind of like you have that impostor syndrome, you know? You’re in the changing rooms with all these amazing players who play great tennis, and you’re thinking: ‘Do I belong here? Do I belong at this sort of venue?’“Even in the position I am in now, and I think for the rest of my career, especially in tennis where you can win a tournament and then go and lose first round [in the next one], I always feel like I need to prove something. Always feel like I need to show that I belong at the highest level, not only to everyone else, but myself as well. So some of that never will go away.”There is nothing like winning to dampen some of those doubts. The first major step came ongrass in Stuttgart last summer, when he won his first title, which gave him a “massive sense of calm”. He referenced the nature of top-level tennis, in which many top-ranked players can go their whole careers without ever winning a title.After securing his second title in Vienna at the end of last year, Draper picked up a hip injury before the Australian Open but showed his competitive strength and desire again by winning three back‑to‑back five‑set matches to make the last 16. After shoulder, abdominal and hip issues, he could be forgiven for thinking his body is a liability but the way he played in Indian Wells, where he beat Carlos Alcaraz in the semi-finals, showed him that he can compete at the very top.View image in fullscreenJack Draper in action against Holger Rune in the Indian Wells final.Photograph: Mark J Terrill/AP“[Winning Indian Wells] is big, big belief, big confidence,” he said. “It’s weird. I felt like I’d been building towards moments like that one for a while, especially at the end of last year. I was really building a level, and I was improving and getting better, then getting better and better each week and getting more confident. And then obviously had that injury at the back end last year, and went to Australia, and I was completelyout of sorts physicallywith my tennis.“But then that experience there, getting those matches in my body, and then going to Doha and getting some wins there, I was trying to just get back to where I was before and even better, so I think just certifies more belief in me that I belong at this highest level and that, you know, I really have earned the position I’m in. Now I’ve just got to keep on moving forwards, keep on improving, keep on doing all the things that have, you know, helped me get to this point so far.”Not only that, Draper’s dreams are growing, with an eye firmly on achieving the ultimate in tennis, winning one of the sport’s biggest titles, a grand slam crown. “Having that Stuttgart title really helped me to feel like, wow, I’ve got that now and then I can build on that,” he says. “Obviously from there on in, you know, semis US Open and winning Vienna, now winning Indian Wells, all these things, they’re helping me to sort of feel like, I’m really getting in the right direction. I’m going for things that I thought were never possible and to feel like I’ve done those things that I maybe thought weren’t possible now, to move forward and feel like the goals in front of me are realistic, you know, that’s important,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He won just four matches in six events on the surface last year, culminating in a first-round defeat at Roland Garros, even if three of them were tight three-set losses to good players. He plays either Denis Shapovalov of Canada or the American Marcos Giron in his first match here but though he admits clay is “not my first, first surface”, good sessions with Fearnley at the NationalTennisCentre have left him optimistic and curious to see how he goes. He also knows that putting the miles on clay can pay dividends later in the year.“I’m still yet to feel like I’ve won matches and be really confident on the surface, but I definitely feel like if I can have some really good success over the next month or so that will set me up even more for what’s to come for the rest of the season,” the Londoner says.“I’ve obviously got a lot to prove to myself and on the surface. I think that will come with time, more experience. I think my game, the way it’s improving all the time, and the way I’m being more tactically aware and physically stronger, all these things coming together, I’m interested to see over the next month and a half, how effective I can be on this surface.

Or is that not part of the story?At the end of a fun,boisterous 3‑2 victoryfor Marco Silva’s excellent, vigorous upper‑midtable team thetalk will of course be about Liverpool, and not necessarily in a very flattering way.Rodrigo Muniz bullies past Van Dijk as leaders Liverpool falter at FulhamRead moreSince the start of March Liverpool’s progress towards the league title has been expressed in a run of routine almost-there wins, a series of this-must-be-it moments, reminiscent of one of those lovelorn phone conversations where nobody wants to be the person to hang up. No, you say the title race is over. No you.A trip to Fulham in the gentle sun had looked like another edge along that route, another of these mini-climaxes. But defeat will at least give fuel to the energetically pursued discussion around Liverpool’s season, the debate about worthiness and deserved success.Never mind that Arne Slot’s team can afford to lose here and remain 11 points clear with seven to play. This game was also a no‑win situation, in a very modern, very online kind of way. Win at Craven Cottage and this would become yet another sign the league is a walkover, too easy, and that Liverpool are not great champions. Lose at Craven Cottage and this can now also become yet another sign the league is a walkover, too easy, and Liverpool are not great champions.Football: never knowingly done or decided, no matter what the numbers might say. This has always been part of its appeal, and part of its madness too.And this was in the end just a really good game.Craven Cottage on a sunny Sunday is like English football in an American movie: cobble-close and homespun but also clean and quaint. A place where everyone is Hugh Grant, Liz Hurley or their quirky and warm-hearted sidekick.Liverpool looked good early on. The opening goal was an easy, sunlit thing. Alexis Mac Allister bumping Sander Berge away, taking a touch and shooting hard and flat into the far corner.At which point, when the day might have started to fall apart, Liverpool encountered instead undeterred opponents, plus half an hour of Alex Iwobi in unstoppable form.View image in fullscreenRodrigo Muniz (centre) celebrates with teammates after scoring Fulham’s third goal.Photograph: Henry Nicholls/AFP/Getty ImagesThe equaliser came from a nice drive down the right, helped by Curtis Jones not being a career full-back, unable to stop himself deflecting the ball to Andreas Pereira. The second goal involved Andy Robertson giving the ball to Iwobi not once but twice, then running across to deflect his shot into the goal. The third Fulham goal had Rodrigo Muniz taking a wonderful touch away from Virgil van Dijk before finishing really nicely.What does it mean? We already know this because opinions are set. The main upshot will be an opportunity to pull apart Liverpool’s season a bit more, and indeed the Premier League itself, which is, we keep hearing, uniquely bad this time. At the weekend one pundit even suggested Slot doesn’t deserve to win manager of the year for that reason.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Perhaps from boredom, the need to fill the rolling news hours. Perhaps from years of stratification masked by title races where two teams peak at the same time, thereby retaining a sellable product, despite the fact the same two teams winning every week doesn’t actually suggest a strong competition.There are a lot of questions here. Why is three promoted teams with good players struggling to win a game taken as a sign of weakness, not strength? PerhapsNewcastle’s Carabao Cup gloryshould also be downgraded because the quality has never been so low. Dan Burn, throw your medals in the bin.In reality the league is notably strong this season, the mid-tier better than it has been for years, as it should be with vast broadcast income. Fulham, Bournemouth, Aston Villa, Brighton, Brentford: these are excellent teams. Five English clubs are still in Europe.There is a kind of boomerism nostalgia at work here, a sense of where-is-my-great-English-football-of-yesteryear. What we’re really talking about is an absence of major brands, no United, no Spurs, no City. Tell you what, music is rubbish now too. When was the last time the Eagles made an album? There was a band. Chelsea with John Terry. Proper football.Slot is the most wronged party in all this. Here he still looked waspish and well-groomed, like the energetic mayor of a small French town about to cut the ribbon on the regional harvest festival. And his impact so far is hugely impressive. Winning the league in your first season by improving players. No major signings. Doing it all with the eternally startled Darwin Núñez as your back-up striker.Liverpool will no doubt regroup from here. Perhaps they really will begin to lose games and limp over the line. If they do, the reason will be clear enough – strength, not weakness – as it was against an excellent Fulham team here.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolFulhamArne SlotanalysisShareReuse this content"

Southampton had justsuffered the earliest relegationin Premier League history, with seven games still remaining, but there was no bitterness. Juric, who seemed almost moved by their reaction, ensured his players applauded them.“For me, this is something completely new, a new experience,” Juric said. “I said to the players they have to be really thankful that they have fans like this.Southampton endure historic Premier League relegation after defeat at SpursRead more“It is something incredible the way they love their team even though we were relegated. They really deserve much more. It’s another type of culture [to Italy]. They show love in this moment; it is a great thing in English culture,Southamptonculture.”Juric seemingly wants to stay on and try to lead Southampton back into the Premier League next season. “If we take the long road to come back here, I am ready,” he said, speaking of the need to develop young players, such as Taylor Harwood-Bellis, Mateus Fernandes, Tyler Dibling and Kamaldeen Sulemana, so they can compete at Premier League level, rather than getting promoted then signing a new team.“We have lots of young players, talented players. They are good but lack experience. There is a completely different physicality between us and other teams in the Premier League. The same thing happened to Leicester and Ipswich. The gap is huge but from this moment the players can grow up and improve and be ready for the Premier League; this is my idea.”View image in fullscreenIvan Juric talked about staying on at Southampton after relegation was confirmed at Tottenham.Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PAThis season, all that remains is to try to surpass Derby’s record low tally of 11 points with a -69 goal difference. Derby, in the 2007-08 season, went down with six games left, as did Huddersfield in 2018-19 and Sheffield United in 2020-21. “I liked the second half today and the Crystal Palace game was good,” said Juric. “Our goal has to be to avoid being the worst in Premier League history, I want seven games like the second half today.”Responsibility, he insisted, is collective. In three full seasons under the ownership of Sport Republic, Southampton have been relegated, promoted and relegated again. “It’s clear that the last two years in the Premier League we haven’t competed,” Juric said.“We’ve been relegated too easily and that means huge problems in a lot of situations. Now it’s important to understand all the mistakes and try to create something good. You cannot see these fans in all places.”Tottenham’s manager Ange Postecoglou was understandably focused on Thursday’s Europa League quarter-final first leg against Eintracht Frankfurt. “In the first half we were really disciplined, well-organised and every time we went forward we looked dangerous,” he said.“The second half not so much. We became way too passive without the ball and let Southampton get a rhythm. But overall we got the win, everybody got through unscathed and now we’re ready for a big night on Thursday.”Explore more on these topicsSouthamptonTottenham HotspurnewsShareReuse this content"

Second in the 268.9-km race, which started in Markt in Bruges and concluded in Minderbroedersstraat in Oudenaarde, was the Dane, Mads Pedersen with Belgium-born Van der Poel coming third to complete the podium. Home heros Wout Van Aert and Jasper Stuyven rounded up the top five.Primoz Roglic wins Volta a Catalunya title as late charge denies Juan AyusoRead morePogacar came into the race as one of the favourites, having enjoyed a remarkable run by winning the men’s road race title at the world championships in September to add to his triumphs at the Giro d’Italia and Tour de France, and lived up to expectations.He delivered a devastating 19-km solo attack from the Oude Kwaremont climb, and there was no doubt about the outcome from then on as he crossed the finish line with his arms outstretched in celebration.With the triumph, Pogacar also avenged his Milan-San Remo loss to Van der Poel in March, which was the first Monument race of the season. Van der Poel had won the 2020, 2022, 2024 editions of the Tour of Flanders.Van der Poel was involved in a crash, which involved about 20 cyclists, but the 30-year-old Dutchman managed to get back up and return to the front with the help of his Alpecin-Deceuninck teammate Edward Planckaert of Belgium.“The goal was to win, but in the end, it is hard to realise it. We did it and I cannot be more proud of the team and how we raced today, even though we had some bad luck. In the end, all was good. I’m just so happy to win this race in this jersey,” Pogacar said.“The plan was to go from there [the Oude Kwaremont], we followed the plan even though we had some crashes with teammates. We made it, we stuck to the plan and finished it off.“There was a crash on the big road, we lost Jhony [Jhonatan Narváez] here, Tim [Wellens] and Florian [Vermeersch]. Florian somehow was chasing back all the race more or less, and made it just in time to lead out on the Kwaremont.Chapeauto him. We never gave up.”The remaining Monuments in the cycling calendar are Paris-Roubaix, Liège-Bastogne-Liège and Giro di Lombardia. Paris-Roubaix takes place next Sunday.“It [Paris-Roubaix] is a completely different race but I will accept the challenge and try to do my best. Flanders suits me a bit better, but you never know, Roubaix is also a very hard race and with this shape I have now, I should give it a try,” Pogacar added.After devastating BMX injury, Kai Sakakibara makes winning return as para cyclist | Kieran PenderRead moreIn the women’s race, Belgium’s Lotte Kopecky (SD Worx) delivered on her pre-race favourite tag to take the win and add to her titles in 2022 and 2023. Pauline Ferrand-Prévot (Visma-Lease a Bike) and Liane Lippert (Movistar) completed the podium. Kopecky pulled clear with a group of three other riders to put herself in a commanding position where she briefly bided her time before her victory sprint.Like the winner, the defending champion Elisa Longo Borghini (UAE Team ADQ) was in line for a record third win but in a chaotic start, she was one of many who crashed early on. Despite attempting to continue, she ultimately withdrew.“It was a crazy race with a lot of crashes in the beginning,” Kopecky said. “I was pretty nervous and I didn’t have the best legs in the beginning but I tried to stay calm. After a few climbs my legs felt better and better and [I knew] in the end I had a good chance.

As it was, the paratrooper in question was rescued by the fire brigade – and you suspect pre-match protocols may be changed in the future – before Toulouse dug in to beat a dogged Sale side, who return home with heads held high.The Sharks’ defeat, though, capped a miserable weekend for the Premiership clubs and for the first time since 2019 there will be just one representative – Northampton – in the last eight. As far as England’s British & Irish Lions hopefuls are concerned, it has not been a great weekend either and Andy Farrell will anxiously await news of Tom Curry’s wrist injury even if Sale’s director of rugby, Alex Sanderson, is hopeful the flanker has avoided a fracture.Leinster deliver Champions Cup statement with 10-try Harlequins thrashingRead moreThe incident with the paratrooper happened shortly before kick-off. Two paratroopers had already landed successfully on the pitch when a third, Captain Yannick Trouillet, approaching from the north-east corner of the stadium, was caught on the edge of the roof. He was supposed to be delivering the match ball but it soon became clear that he was stuck, dangling 30 metres above the ground.Supporters were evacuated from the area underneath before stewards began setting up a makeshift crash mat out of tackle bags. The Toulouse mascot, dressed as a lion, lent a hand, carrying post protectors for further ballast and a bouncy castle, complete with blow-up rugby posts, was hoisted on to the empty seats to further act as a landing spot.The arrival of a fire engine prompted huge cheers from the crowd and two firefighters made their way to the stricken paratrooper via the cherrypicker. Trouillet was lifted to safety and brought down to earth. He was said to be unharmed, barring an entirely understandable bit of shock, and the organisers have offered him tickets for a future match.Quick GuideMurphy praises Ulster players in defeat by BordeauxShowUlster head coach Richie Murphy was proud of his players as they slipped out of the Champions Cup, losing 43-31 at Bordeaux-Bègles in the last 16. The visitors scored five tries at Stade Chaban-Delmas but saw their opponents run in six to book a quarter-final with fly-half Joey Carbery's former team Munster.Murphy told Premier Sports: \"It was an incredible game, wasn't it, end-to-end. The ball was kept in play for long periods, players on both sides looked very tired at times.\"They probably did better in the transitionary moments, but I have to say I'm incredibly proud of our players and what they produced today. I think we played some of our best rugby at times and one or two scores more and it could have been a very tight ending.\"Ulster trailed 21-0 after just 21 minutes, but tries from forwards Tom O'Toole and Dave McCann dragged them back into it before the break and Nick Timoney and Zac Ward, twice, crossed in the second half to keep their side in it until the final whistle.Murphy said of his side: \"All I can say is their commitment all week to put the plan together,  nobody giving us a chance and what we've produced on the day – yes we're disappointed we didn't win, but we've got something to build on here.\"Bordeaux attack coach Noel McNamara saw Damian Penaud, Ben Tameifuna, Adam Coleman, Romain Buros, Maxime Lamothe and Rohan Janse van Rensburg touch down, but knows they will have to be better to get past Munster.McNamara said: \"The first thing you've got to do is give a lot of credit to Ulster. A lot of teams at 21-0 down might have struggled a little bit. They came back at us, they got a couple of tries at the end of that first half and again in the second half, they never went away.\"We spoke about it during the week, how much this competition means to Irish teams and how difficult they are to beat, so I think that was very much in evidence today.\"Obviously for us, the most important thing is getting through to the next round, and what a challenge that's going to be.\"We've got a short turnaround – it's only six days – and realistically speaking we probably know that that won't be good enough, but I felt that overall it's a positive and lots for us to work on.\"PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The chairman of European Professional Club Rugby, Dom McKay, who met Trouillet, said: “Following the incident at Le Stadium de Toulouse, we would like to extend our sincere thanks to all involved at the stadium, both clubs and the ­emergency services for safely ­returning the parachutist to the ground. The safety of the individual and of spectators in stadium is of the utmost priority. We will pick up with Stade Toulousain and the stadium in due course.”Asked about the disruption, Sanderson said: “Panic, lads just wanted to know what’s going on. As soon as the fire engine got him down we had 15 minutes and then we can plan. There’s no doubt there was a little bit of disruption.”View image in fullscreenAnge Capuozzo scores for Toulouse.Photograph: László Gecző/Inpho/ShutterstockBen Curry, the captain, said: “That was a bit mental wasn’t it? Hopefully he’s all right. I don’t think they’re going to be doing that again anytime soon. Al [Sanderson] is very good at managing situations and you’ve just got to get on with it. It’s very French, isn’t it? Coming here, we knew there would be a lot of challenges and that threw another one in there.”The match kicked off 39 minutes later than planned and Toulouse had the opening try after two more following a dash down the left from Blair Kinghorn. The ­hulking second-row Emmanuel Meafou was stopped short of the line but Jack ­Willis finished off from close range.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He was having a significant influence on the breakdown along with his brother Ben, who relished the contest with Willis. “He’s a good player, isn’t he?” said Ben Curry. “I probably would have penalised him a bit more if I were the referee, but I’ve got a lot of respect for Jack.”Sale regrouped to extend their advantage, however, with Jonny Hill fighting his way over through heavy traffic. A Thomas Ramos penalty pegged Sale’s lead back to five before François Cros bulldozed his way to the try-line. Toulouse were struggling to find their rhythm but the captain Julien Marchand squeezed the ball down to give them breathing space before Capuozzo’s dart to the line late on, sustaining a nasty ankle injury in the process. Guillaume Cramont bludgeoned over for the fifth try with Sale running on empty.Explore more on these topicsChampions CupToulouseSaleRugby unionmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Here were two sides synonymous with success in theChallenge Cuplooking to shrug off some early-season inconsistency and move within a game of Wembley.Games betweenWarringtonand St Helens are so often dramatic, but there is a familiar pattern emerging of late which continued again here. It was tense, but for the sixth consecutive game it was Sam Burgess’s Wolves who prevailed.Sexism and misogyny complaints add to turmoil at Rugby Football LeagueRead moreBig games are so often decided by big players and, while the Saints have their fair share, there are few who really step up when the stakes are quite at their highest like George Williams. With this enthralling quarter-final finely poised and Warrington ahead by just two points in the latter stages, the visitors looked set to break away and score the try that could have nudged them ahead.However, when the ball went to ground Williams gathered, crabbed along a tiringSt Helensdefensive line, spotted a gap and broke from deep to put the tie beyond doubt and set up a semi-final against Leigh Leopards next month. It was the England captain at his very best and underlined why many believe he is the Super League’s best player.There is a fair argument that, before Burgess’s arrival at Warrington, this would have been the kind of game they would have found a way to lose. But Burgess has instilled a grit and determination in this group and, with Williams at the heart of everything they do well in attack, they will fancy their chances of going all the way in the cup. They are now one win away from a return to Wembley, having just fallen shortin the final against Wiganlast year.Leigh, the 2023 winners, stand in their way, with Hull KR and Catalans in the other semi-final next month. “We’ve worked hard but we’ve still got a long way to go,” Burgess said post-match. “I can’t question their commitment to each other, we’ve really turned a corner with it.”After a sluggish start to 2025, including aheavy defeat by Wigan in Las Vegas, Warrington certainly appear to be improving. They were worthy winners in the end here, edging the tie’s decisive moments – including Williams’s late try.It was level at the break after Matt Dufty and Tristan Sailor exchanged tries, but St Helens’ issues soon caught up with them. That included losing several players to head injuries in the opening 40 minutes, prompting a major reshuffle of their backline. It stunted their attacking rhythm and left them unable to regain momentum. “There’s some lessons to be learned for us in terms of winning big games moving forwards,” their coach, Paul Wellens, said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the US,Disneyparaded an actual bunny in a brown knitted jumper down the red carpet at the film’s Hollywood premiere.But the film’s theme of being at one with nature seems not to have extended to the real-life environment, with company documents showing the making ofSnow Whitegenerated more greenhouse gas emissions in the UK than the latestFast& Furiousfilm, despite the latter’s reliance on an array of gas-guzzling cars.Analysis of more than 250 sets of filings from the Walt Disney Company reveals that the live action remakes ofSnow Whiteand another animated classic,The Little Mermaid, created more pollution than any of its other movies made in the UK since 2019, when the environmental reporting requirement was introduced.View image in fullscreenThe Little Mermaid generated higher emissions than the combined annual total for Blackpool Pleasure Beach and London’s O2 Arena.Photograph: Photo courtesy of Disney./APIt obliges companies to disclose the emissions generated in the UK, so the global total may be higher.The Little Mermaid, for example, was also filmed in Sardinia, while theFast and Furiousfilm-makers travelled to Italy and the US.The combined emissions forSnow WhiteandThe Little Mermaidare higher than the annual amount produced by Birmingham and Luton airports. Each movie generated higher emissions than the annual total for Blackpool Pleasure Beach and London’s O2 Arena, where theSnow Whiteinfluencer event took place.Snow Whiteis the latest live-action Disney film and starsWest Side Storyactor Rachel Zegler in the leading role andWonder Woman’s Gal Gadot as the evil queen. It has been far from a fairy­tale for the company, plagued by controversy about everything from the outspoken politics of the lead actor to the role of the seven dwarves. The film is reportedly on track to make a loss of about $115m (£89m), with total takings of just $145m against a cost of about $260m.Despite being made by an American studio, bothSnow WhiteandThe Little Mermaidwere filmed atPinewood Studios, just outside London. Studios filming in the UK get up to 25.5% of their spending reimbursed under government plans to incentivise the industry. As part of this process, accounts must be filed for the ­production company behind each movie, showing the cost of making the movie and the emissions generated in the UK.These accounts show that by the end of 2023, Disney had received £44.9m in return for makingSnow Whitein the UK and £49.7m forThe Little Mermaid.Emissions are measured in tonnes ofcarbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e)and are divided into three categories, known as scopes. The first one covers emissions from fuel directly used to produce the movie, for example by generators powering cameras and heaters. The second scope covers emissions generated by the creation of the electricity used during production. Scope three shows indirect emissions which are generated by suppliers of goods and services.Scope three emissions are largely outside the control of the companies being measured, so many, including airports, don’t list them on their accounts. Scope three for airports includes emissions from the planes that use them, so if this were included they would have a much higher total than films.View image in fullscreenGal Gadot as the Evil Queen in Snow White.Photograph: DisneyIn scope one and twoSnow Whitegenerated 3,153 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent.The Little Mermaidgenerated 5,127 tonnes, to give a combined total of 8,279.6 tonnes. This compares with 7,829 tonnes for Birmingham airport in 2023-24, 6,243 for Luton in 2023 and 3,351 for East Midlands in 2023-24, according to their latest data.Major productions are known in the movie industry as “tentpoles”. A source close to Disney said last year that a total of around 2,600 tCO2e “is right in line for what the emissions for a tentpole production should be”.The Little Mermaidis double that (taking into account all three scopes) andSnow Whiteis 62% higher.The latter was filmed extensively on location, which increases the need for portable generators. Fuel for these accounted for the majority of the energy usage during the making of both movies, though it could have been higher. This is because the movie-makers used battery-powered generators and hybrid ones partly powered by batteries.They also tapped into mains power when possible and the accounts add that the “electricity supply at Pinewood was switched to a renewable supply via a green tariff in 2020 (reductions from this switch are not included in these calculations)”.They also state that production staff rented electric cars and “charter flights were only used for full crew moves where they are less carbon intensive than booking hundreds of commercial flights”.Explore more on these topicsSnow WhiteThe ObserverFilm industryPollutionGal GadotGreenhouse gas emissionsFast and FuriousAir transportnewsShareReuse this content"

Justice Secretary Angela Constance will chair a meeting this evening.”By 10.20pm on Sunday, the Scottish fire and rescue service (SFRS) confirmed that fire crews had withdrawn from the area due to low light, but planned to resume operations at first light on Monday.Stewart Gibson, the team leader at Galloway mountain rescue, told BBC Scotland fire crews had employed four helicopters to drop water on the flames from above, with the fire front several miles wide at one stage.Rising temperatures across the UK earlier this week led to wildfire warnings being put in place, with the Scottish fire and rescue service saying there was a “very high to extreme risk” of fires spreading because of warm, dry conditions.The service has warned the public to avoid outdoor fires and barbecues, and to dispose of cigarettes and glass safely.Further north in the Highlands, crews were tackling another wildfire north of Ullapool on Sunday with roads closed and heavy smoke hampering visibility.Six crews were in attendance, with personnel travelling almost 70 miles to offer assistance and firefighters at the scene reporting a firewall stretching more than 3 miles and large plumes of smoke descending over the area.Meanwhile, in Northern Ireland, fire brigades were called to the scene of a blaze in County Antrim on Sunday afternoon. Six fire engines attended the incident near Conogher Road, Dervock, while 40 firefighters were involved in tackling the flames.Danny Ard, the group commander for the Northern Ireland fire and rescue service, said the firefighters had utilised “jets” and “specialist wildfire equipment to contain the fire”. It was extinguished at 8pm on Sunday.A significant wildfire that broke out on Saturday and triggered a major incident in Northern Ireland’s Mourne mountains district was extinguished on Sunday morning. One man was arrested by police.More than 100 firefighters and 15 fire appliances were deployed on Saturday to Sandbank Road, Hilltown, to tackle the blaze, which was believed to have been caused deliberately, fire chiefs said.Northern Ireland fire and rescue service said the fire had a front of approximately 2 miles “including a large area of forestry close to property”.Explore more on these topicsScotlandNorthern IrelandnewsShareReuse this content"

Outstanding penalties will be referred to debt collection and litigation where appropriate,” Madders said.Byrne said the low level of fines contributed to wider concerns raised by his committee about the progress of reforms to Companies House, including a 20% vacancy rate for digital jobs at the agency.“When up to 1m companies are built on lies, it’s time for Companies House to get tougher,” said Byrne.“It’s no longer just a register – it’s the frontline in the war on economic crime.“We won’t defeat fraud with warnings.

The Sunday Times reported that some of the devices had been located by the Royal Navy, while others washed ashore.Their discovery was deemed to be a national security threat, the newspaper reported, and it has not officially been confirmed by the British government.The sensors are part of Putin’s expansion of “greyzone” warfare – a campaign of surveillance and sabotage targeting key infrastructure.Ellwood, who stood down as a Conservative MP last year, said the use of sensors was “only half the story”, claiming that the Kremlin had established “remote seabed platforms” off the UK coast that act as recharging stations for dozens of mini-submarines “to map our undersea cable networks for potential sabotage”.He told the Guardian that government officials were aware of these deep-sea Russian bases and that efforts were being made to “realise that there is a delta between our resilience and the threat that we face”.“Ninety per cent of our data comes from the sea and 60% of gas comes from Norway by one line so you can see how vulnerable we are,” he said. “The scale of damage [they could do] is enormous and it’s deniable and it’s cheap to do. That’s the worrying dimension of all of this.”He welcomed the commission of the RFA Proteus, the UK’s flagship deep-sea surveillance vessel that was acquired by the Royal Navy in 2023, but said the UK was “behind the curve in our deterrence and our ability to respond”.The Proteus is “just one ship and given the threat from this greyzone capability we are going to need half a dozen of these vessels if not more”, he said, citing the potentially catastrophic impact of key energy and communication lines being sabotaged.Suspicious incidents in the Baltic have intensified concerns over Russia’s “shadow fleet” and its alleged sabotage activities.The Estlink 2 submarine cable between Finland and Estonia wasdisconnected from the gridlast Christmas Day, little more than a month after two telecommunicationscables were severedin Swedish territorial waters.Investigators said the Russian tanker, Eagle S – thought to be part of Putin’s so-called “shadow fleet” – had damaged the Estlink cable by dragging its anchor over it.The Sunday Times quoted a serving British military figure as saying: “There should be no doubt, there is a war raging in the Atlantic. This is a game of cat and mouse that has continued since the ending of the cold war and is now heating up again.”Another source said: “It’s a bit like the space race. This is a world clouded in secrecy and subterfuge … but there’s enough smoke to suggest something is on fire somewhere.”A Ministry of Defence spokesperson described the Sunday Times story as “speculation”, adding: “National security is the foundation of this government’s plan for change, which is why we are committed to enhancing the security of critical offshore infrastructure.“Our continuous-at-sea nuclear deterrent continues to patrol the world’s oceans undetected as it has done for 56 years. We are also stepping up our defence spending with an extra £5bn for the defence budget this year, and a commitment to raise our spending to 2.5% of GDP from April 2027 to keep us secure at home and strong abroad.”Luke Pollard, the armed forces minister, told MPs last month that the UK had been “more proactive” in its response to Russian aggression. But he added: “It’s not always an eye for an eye … In the event of any actions being taken against UK infrastructure, we would look at all the options available to us.”Explore more on these topicsDefence policyRussiaMilitaryVladimir PutinRoyal NavynewsShareReuse this content"

More quangos could be identified for abolition as early as this week.Under the Cabinet Office’s review, quangos with significant powers over policies that are of national importance will be brought back into departments, with expert staff retained to work in these areas, although wider civil service job cuts are expected.In cases where it is essential that quangos are independent from ministerial decision-making, for example those with a regulatory function or that scrutinise government or protect the rule of law, then these will remain unaffected.As well as his cuts to quangos, the prime minister is urging departments to make greater use of technology such as artificial intelligence tools to reduce spending and streamline decision-making.Branded merchandise and staff awaydays for civil servants are set to be curbed as part of the government’s crackdown on what it regards as wasteful spending in the civil service, which also included freezing thousands of procurement cards held by officials.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Specialist diving teams, ambulance crews and firefighters carried out a search for the teenager, stopping when Izaiah was found on Friday night, Scotland Yard said on Saturday.“A boy was recovered from the lake at around 10.42pm on Friday 4 April,” a Met spokesperson said.“He was taken to hospital where he was sadly pronounced dead. His death is being treated as unexpected but not believed to be suspicious.”Izaiah’s family have been made aware and are being supported, the force said.On Saturday, the SEDA Football Academy said the teenager was a much-loved under-16s player. In a tribute shared on Instagram, the club said it was “mourning the loss” of a kind and considerate young person.“Izaiah was such a bright light within our programme,” the post said. “Always present at training, he greeted everyone with the most adorable smile. His huge character and infectious energy will be deeply missed by us all.”In a statement, Lewisham council, which manages the park, said the space was re-opened on Saturday, though the lake would remain closed with security in place until further notice.“We are working closely with the police in order that their investigation establishes the full facts of what’s happened,” it added.Explore more on these topicsLondonEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Donaldson resigned later that year.However, Donaldson, 52, denies the FCA claim he knowingly published inaccurate financial information months earlier.“It is simply not correct, as the FCA alleges, that both the bank and I were aware at the time that the size of any adjustment would be substantial,” he said in his witness statement.He also said the allegations had ruined his career: “I … should be at the peak of my earning capacity, and my career trajectory should have seen me continuing in significant leadership roles. I have been unable to find a permanent role.” Instead, he had only managed to secure “interim, transient” jobs that offered a “fraction” of his previous earnings.“I have been informed on many occasions that the innuendo and the fear of the FCA’s likely approach to me holding a senior, authorised position has effectively made me untouchable for a permanent role in the market,” his statement said.“I have variously been advised by headhunters to move to Australia, or to try and get a job in a different industry beyond the regulated banking sector where the FCA’s influence will not directly or indirectly impact my prospects.”Donaldson said the ruling had also affected his personal finances.“There is also a wider impact that cannot have been intended by the FCA. Applying for simple things like home insurance, bank accounts and credit cards has been negatively impacted.“I have had difficulty opening bank accounts and buying financial products,” Donaldson said, adding that some firms that asked about the FCA ruling had “declined to offer cover”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Metro Bank was instead routed to a call centre.“The FCA said they were too busy and that they would continue to get our information from the PRA where necessary. We were the seventh-largest bank at the time,” Donaldson said.“In lieu of a supervision team, the Bank’s contact with the FCA was conducted via the FCA’s call centre.”The FCA and Donaldson’s legal team declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsMetro BankBankingFinancial Conduct AuthorityRegulatorsnewsShareReuse this content"

He said he had lost weight and received only one meal a day.The couple have been running projects in schools in Afghanistan for 18 years and decided to stay in the country after theTaliban seized power in 2021. The Reynolds weredetainedat the start of February when they travelled to their home in Bamiyan province in a small plane rented by their Chinese-American friend, Faye Hall.Hall was also detained, but she was released last weekend after the Trump administration lifted bounties worth $10m (£7.8m) from the heads of senior Taliban figures including Sirajuddin Haqqani, the interior minister.Peter Reynolds said that when he was detained, he was initially told the plane lacked proper landing permission and they would be released. Instead, their phones were confiscated and they were transferred to the interior ministry in Kabul, where the couple were separated then locked up in Pul-e-Charki prison.Reynolds said he was told by the Taliban that they had confiscated 59 books from their home that were “against Islam”. He was asked why they had them. “I asked: ‘Can you tell me any part of those books which is against Islam?’” he said. “No one has been able to, so I think it’s an outrage.“They have interrogated more than 30 people who worked with us in Yakawlang and Kabul, including our accountant and tax people, and we had to put our thumbprint on a nine-page-long CID [criminal investigation department] report and they said they could find no crime. That was three weeks ago but still they haven’t released us.“These things are an utter disgrace and shame. The Taliban have made a mistake and need to face up to it.”Explore more on these topicsAfghanistanTalibannewsShareReuse this content"

In his time there the station gained more than 2 million listeners.Marshall was born in Coventry, the son of Freddie Stewart, a soldier, and his wife, Gwen (nee Bryant). Marshall was four when, during the night of 14 November 1940, a German bomb hit the family home, killing his grandmother and aunt, but sparing Marshall, his mother, and his elder sister, Kathleen.From an early age Marshall wanted to be a journalist, and left Churchfield high school at 16 to take up a five-year apprenticeship with the weekly Coventry Standard. As a junior reporter he covered all aspects of city life, including writing a sports column which gave him the chance to follow the fortunes of his beloved Coventry City FC. Later, in 1968, he published Miracle in Sky Blue, an account of the club’s resurgence to the First Division.Marshall’s time at the Standard was interrupted by national service with the RAF (1957-59) where he filled the non-demanding role of typist to the commanding officer, enabling him to carry on filing his football reports. After completing his apprenticeship, he worked for various Midlands newspapers, before joining the BBC in London as a radio news subeditor, later becoming a features producer, then senior editorial assistant and, in 1969, the editor of South East News, before joining Today.Having putLBCon the path to success, Marshall spent 1977 undertaking a survey of community broadcasting for the Independent Broadcasting Authority. That was the year in which he and I married, having met in 1969 on a press trip. Our first home was in Forest Gate, east London, from where he commuted to central London when he returned to the BBC in 1978 as head of information.In 1982, Marshall became director of public affairs at Central Television, based in Birmingham, playing a major part in its 1991 licence application. The following year he left to found Harthill Communications and Earlybird Media Analysis with his close friendPeter Rosier. In 2014 he reluctantly wound up Harthill when the effects of the rare disease amyloidosis, with which he was diagnosed in 2008, became debilitating. Marshall occupied himself instead with researching and writing Meltdown, a novella based on climate change but with an intriguing criminal plot, which I hope to be able to publish.Marshall is survived by me.Explore more on these topicsRadio 4Other livesRadioTelevisionBBCLBCobituariesShareReuse this content"

They said some perpetrators drove their victims to suicide, and there was a “significant risk” that coercion could play a part in some cases of assisted dying.But Lesley Storey, the chief executive of My Sister’s Place, a charity that supports victims of domestic abuse, said the bill provided “rigorous safeguards where currently there are none”.In another open letter, co-signed by more than 40 women, Storey said the “risk of coercion for terminally ill women in abusive relationships is real … It thrives in the absence of oversight, where there are no safeguards, checks, or balances”.The safeguards in the bill included comprehensive assessments by professionals, mandatory coercion training, and new criminal offences around coercion. The bill sought “to put in place robust protections to help ensure that potential coercion is exposed and prevented at every point,” Storey said.‘It became very fraught’: how assisted dying bill has changed on its way back to CommonsRead moreThe signatories of the female faith leaders’ letter include Sarah Mullally, the bishop of London and the third most senior figure in the Church of England, as well as four other C of E bishops, alongside Zara Mohammed, the former secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain, and Sam Clifford, the chief executive of Jewish Women’s Aid.They write: “Domestic abuse victims who are also women of faith can face a particular form of abuse at the hands of their perpetrators, who may weaponise theologies and culture to harm and control their victims.”The bill “fails to take account of how faith and its role at the end of life, as well as its use by both perpetrators and the women they abuse, create complex dynamics that can lead to vulnerable women, who may also hold strong religious beliefs, seeing no way out but death”, they continue.The letter adds: “Much of the debate inside and outside parliament has been conducted by those empowered to speak of the importance of personal choice, without consideration of those who struggle to be heard in the public square.“It is the voices of the unheard, ignored, and marginalised that we are compelled by our faith traditions and scriptures to listen and draw attention to, in the pursuit of good law-making for the common good – legislation that considers and protects the most vulnerable, not just those who speak loudest.”Women with abusive partners “may seek assisted deaths to end their suffering at the hands of an abuser”, the letter says, adding that the bill lacks safeguards and has “too much potential to hurt vulnerable people”.Chine McDonald, the director of Theos and the letter’s lead signatory, said: “The number and diversity of women of faith from across religious traditions, ages, and geographical locations who wanted to sign this letter shows the depth of concern about the effects of this bill on women and those in vulnerable situations. It’s for them that, compelled by our faith and scriptures, we cannot and will not be silent.”Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP who proposed the bill, said: “Following changes in committee, the bill now contains even stronger provisions to guard against coercion and pressure on people in end-of-life care.“What this bill does is give women autonomy over their bodies as they reach the end, just as I believe they should have autonomy throughout their lives.”The assisted dying bill has completed its committee stage and is due to return to the House of Commons on 25 April.In the UK, call thenational domestic abuse helplineon 0808 2000 247, or visitWomen’s Aid.

For everyone else, she wants tough justice, tolerance zero, jail for the first offence. For her, it’s too tough.”Manuel Bompard of the radical leftFranceUnbowed (LFI) told the rally the RN’s mask had slipped after years of trying to clean up its image and pose as a future party of government. “It’s dangerous for democracy, dangerous for the rule of law,” he said.Police said 7,000 people were at the RN rally and 5,000 at the leftwing rival.The three-time presidential candidate and frontrunner to succeed Emmanuel Macron was found guilty on Monday of embezzling more than €4m (£3.4m) of European parliament funds to pay RN party workers in France through a vast fake jobs scam.Le Pen was sentenced to four years in prison, of which two were suspended and two may be served with an electronic bracelet, fined €100,000 and – under a law she had backed – barred from running for public office for five years with immediate effect.The Paris appeals court has said it will deliver a verdict on her case by next summer, potentially allowing her to contest the 2027 presidential race if her conviction is overturned, which is seen as unlikely, or the ban on running for public office lifted.The ruling, which followed a 10-year investigation and a nine-week trial, has dramatically shaken up the political landscape and been fiercely attacked by far-right politicians in France and beyond as politically motivated and anti-democratic.Jordan Bardella, the RN’s 29-year-old president and Le Pen’s likely replacement if she remains ineligible, told cheering RN voters that it was “not just Marine Le Pen who has been unjustly condemned, but French democracy that has been put to death”.The court decision would go down as “a dark day in our nation’s history”, he said, a “direct attack on our democracy, a wound for millions of patriots” and an attempt to “deprive us of free choice, to wipe from the scene an entire part of France”.Speaking before her rally, Le Pen – whose vote share in the presidential first round was put at 36% by one poll on Sunday, far ahead of all rivals – said the RN would “follow the example of Martin Luther King’s struggle, who defended civil rights”.Wearing a “Marine présidente” T-shirt and a “Save democracy” sticker, Patrick, 57, who had come from Normandy, said Le Pen’s sentence was “an outrage. Do they really think they can just get rid of an election favourite like that? It’s a banana republic.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

No one’s been defrauded. It’s all a complete fiction to stop Marine.”On the Place de la République, several thousand protesters waved placards reading “No Trumpism in France” and “Nobody is above the law”. Vincent Lemaitre, 44, a primary school teacher, said the court’s ruling showed French democracy worked.The judges, he said, “simply applied the law, which was passed by parliament, including many deputies who represent the RN. Le Pen and her colleagues broke that law. Popularity should not give politicians immunity. Quite the opposite, in fact.”Anaïs Desmets, 31, said the argument that politicians should only be judged at the ballot box was “absurd. If someone harms children, they are kept away from kids.

Tornadoes are possible in Alabama, Georgia and Florida, forecasters said.The 18 reported deaths since the start of the storms on Wednesday included 10 in Tennessee. A nine-year-old boy in Kentucky was caught up in floodwaters while walking to catch his school bus. A five-year-old boy in Arkansas died after a tree fell on his family’s home and trapped him, police said. A 16-year-old volunteer firefighter in Missouridiedin a crash while seeking to rescue people caught in the storm.Torrential rain and flash flooding follow deadly tornadoes as storms rage in central USRead moreThe National Weather Service (NWS) said on Sunday dozens of locations in multiple states were expected to reach a “major flood stage”, with extensive flooding of structures, roads, bridges and other critical infrastructure possible.There were 521 domestic and international flights cancelled within the US, and more than 6,400 were delayed on Saturday, according to FlightAware.com. The website reported 74 cancellations and 478 delays of US flights early on Sunday.The storms come afterDonald Trump’sadministrationhascut jobs at NWS forecast offices, leaving half of them with vacancy rates of about 20%, or double the level of a decade ago.Officials warned of flash flooding and tornadoes on Saturday across Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee and Kentucky. All of eastern Kentucky was under a flood watch through Sunday morning.In north-central Kentucky, emergency officials ordered a mandatory evacuation for Falmouth and Butler, towns near the bend of the rising Licking river. Thirty years ago, the river reached a record 50ft (15 meters), resulting in five deaths and 1,000 homes destroyed.The NWS said 5.06in (nearly 13 cm) of rain fell on Saturday in Jonesboro, Arkansas – making it the wettest day ever recorded in April in the city, dating back to 1893.As of early Sunday, Memphis had received 14in (35cm) of rain since Wednesday, the NWS said. West Memphis, Arkansas, received 10in (25cm).Forecasters attributed the violent weather to warm temperatures, an unstable atmosphere, strong winds and abundant moisture streaming from the Gulf.In Dyersburg, Tennessee, dozens of people arrived on Saturday at a storm shelter near a public school in the rain, clutching blankets, pillows and other necessities.Among them was George Manns, 77, who said he was in his apartment when he heard a tornado warning and decided to head to the shelter. Just days earlier the city was hit by a tornado that caused millions of dollars in damage.“I grabbed all my stuff and came here,” said Mann, who brought a folding chair, two bags of toiletries, laptops, iPads and medications. “I don’t leave them in my apartment in case my apartment is destroyed.

She told Fox News Sunday that in her opinion the president was a “very smart man, and we, I wish we could have him for 20 years as our president”.She then added: “But I think he’s going to be finished, probably, after this term. We’d have to look at the constitution, and it would be a heavy lift.”The two-term limit was set into stone in 1951 with the ratification by the states of the22nd amendment. It says that “no person shall be elected to the office of the president more than twice”.The restriction was introduced in the wake of Franklin Roosevelt’s unprecedented record of serving three full presidential terms during the second world war. He won a fourth term but died in 1945 just one year into it.Bondi’s comment that it would be a “heavy lift” for Trump to overcome the two-term rule was a reference to what it would take to change the US constitution and revoke the 22nd amendment. Any reform to the text of the constitution requires a two-thirds vote from both chambers of Congress, combined with ratification by three-quarters of the 50 states.In today’s highly polarized political world, such a scenario is beyond imagination.Constitutional change aside, Trump’s cryptic remarks about other “methods” haveprompted speculationabout his intentions. One tactic that has attracted some attention would be for the vice-president, JD Vance, to run as Republican presidential candidate in 2028, with Trump as his running mate.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There is a major snag, however.The12th amendment, which lays out procedures for electing both the president and vice-president, states that “no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States”. The clear implication is that Trump, debarred from running for a third term as president, would equally be debarred from running for vice-president – rendering the ruse null and void.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationPam BondiDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

There is widespread speculation thatIsrael, possibly with US help, might launch a military strike on Iranian facilities if no agreement is reached.Al Hadath, a Saudi television channel, reported on Saturday that the US transferred a second THAAD battery and two Patriot batteries to Israel amid rising tensions. Flight tracking websites showed that a C-5M Super Galaxy, a large US air force transport plane, landed at an airbase in southern Israel on Saturday for about eight hours, the Times of Israel reported.The Biden administration sent one THAAD battery, an advanced anti-missile system, to Israel in the immediate aftermath of the Hamas attack in October 2023. It has been used since to intercept missile attacks from Iran and the Tehran-allied Houthi group in Yemen.The US president said on Thursday that he expected a visit soon from Netanyahu – “maybe even next week” – though the Axios website said the timing caught Israeli officials and even some in the Trump administration by surprise.Monday’s meeting will make Netanyahu the first foreign leader to travel to Washington in an attempt to negotiate a better deal with Trump after his administration’s decision last week to impose sweeping global tariffs that have shaken stock markets, wiping out $5tn (£3.87tn) in value from S&P 500 index companies by Friday’s close in a record two-day decline.Israel had attempted to duck the shock 17% tariff on Israeli imports by moving preemptively on Tuesday – a day before the tariffs were announced – to drop all remaining duties on the 1% of American goods still affected by them. But Trump moved ahead with the tariffs, saying the US had a significant trade deficit with its Middle East ally and leading beneficiary of military aid.The US is Israel’s closest ally and largest single trading partner. The two countries signed a free trade agreement 40 years ago and about 98% of goods from the US are tax-free.An Israeli finance ministry official said on Thursday that Trump’s latest tariff announcement could affect Israel’s exports of machinery and medical equipment.Netanyahu will travel to the US on Sunday from Hungary, after a four-day official visit in which the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, had made clear he would defy the ICC arrest warrant for the Israeli leader. During the trip, Orbán announced that Hungary would withdraw from the court, which he said had become too “political”.Other thorny issues in the meeting on Monday include Israel-Turkey relations and “the fight against the international criminal court”, which has accused the Israeli leader of war crimes, Netanyahu’s office said in a statement on Saturday night.Trump and Netanyahu had spoken by phone on Thursday about Hungary’s decision to withdraw from the ICC, of which the US is not a member. The possibility of the Washington visit apparently arose at that time.Agencies contributed to this reportTrump tariffs come into effect in ‘seismic’ shift to global tradeRead moreExplore more on these topicsIsraelDonald TrumpBenjamin NetanyahuTrump tariffsUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

A TPS designation means individuals cannot be removed from the US and are granted the right to work and the ability to travel.The designation was extended by the Biden administration last September but is set to expire next month. The Department of Homeland Security said 133 people from South Sudan were on the TPS programme last year.Trump has been pushing to end TPS designations for a handful of countries including Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela, potentially affecting half a million people. A judge last month paused plans to end the legal protections for Venezuelans.What was a simmering conflict in South Sudan has threatened to intensify in recent weeks, with forces loyal to President Salva Kiir clashing with backers of his rival, vice-president Riek Machar, in the eastern city of Nasir.Conflict between Kiir and Machar, who come from the country’s largest ethnic groups, the Dinka and Nuer, cost 400,000 lives during a five-year civil war. Uganda and Sudan mediated a ceasefire in 2018 with cabinet and state positions distributed between their factions.“South Sudan has been in a state of civil conflict since its creation and the only difference is whether the conflict has been open or smouldering beneath the surface,” said Mukesh Kapila, an academic who was the UN head in Sudan in 2004. He added that the underlying issues between the two leaders were never properly resolved.The agreement faced a major stress test when the civil war in Sudan halted South Sudan’s oil exports, which account for about 70% of its budget. More than 600,000 people from Sudan have also sought refuge in South Sudan further straining the country’s limited resources.The country’s financial challenges, which meant many in the public sector were not paid for close to a year, have been compounded by renewed hostilities between the supporters of Kiir and Machar.Machar wasplaced under house arrestlast month along with his wife, Angelina Teny, who is the interior minister. Officials from his party said this effectively ended the 2018 peace agreement. In the weeks leading up to Machar’s arrest several of his associates were removed from office.The African Union dispatched a team of mediators last week to South Sudan’s capital, Juba, including Burundi’s former president, Domitien Ndayizeye, and the former Kenyan prime minister, Raila Odinga, to mediate between the feuding leaders.Kapila warned it was a dangerous situation but “with the other problems in the world, I’m not sure anyone is currently bothered to stop the momentum toward conflict”.Explore more on these topicsUS newsSouth SudanAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Let’s instead make it an opportunity to grow together, to cultivate hope,” he added.In the traditional Sunday blessing, pope offered prayers for doctors, nurses and health care workers who were “not always helped to work in inadequate conditions, at times the victims of aggression.

On Sunday, a spokesperson for the UMC Health System in Lubbock, Texas, said that the child had been hospitalized before dying and was “receiving treatment for complications of measles” – which is easily preventable through vaccination.The family of the child in question had chosen to not get the minor vaccinated against the illness.Michael Board, a news reporter at Texas’s WOAI radio station,wroteon Sunday that official word from the state’s health and human services department was that the child died from “measles pulmonary failure” while having had no underlying conditions.Citing records it had obtained, the New York Timesdescribedthe child as an eight-year-old girl.Texas reports large leap in measles cases bringing total to 481 across 19 countiesRead moreThat marked the second time a child with measles had died since 26 February. The first was a six-year-old girl – also hospitalized in Lubbock – whose parents had not had her vaccinated.TheTrump administration’s health secretary,Robert F Kennedy Jr, on Sunday identified the two children to have died with measles as Kayley Fehr and Daisy Hildebrand. Daisy was the one who died more recently, and Kennedy said in a statement that he traveled to her funeral on Sunday to be with her family as well as the community in its “moment of grief”.Kennedy for years has baselessly sowed doubt about vaccine safety and efficacy. He sparked alarm in March among those concerned by the US’s measles outbreak when hebacked vitaminsto treat the illness and stopped short of endorsing protective vaccines, which he minimized as merely a “personal choice” rather than a safety measure that long ago was proven effective.In his statement on Sunday, Kennedy said: “The most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine,” which also provides protection against mumps and rubella. He also said he would send a team to support Texas’s local- and state-level responses to the ongoing measles outbreak.A third US person to have died after contracting measles was an unvaccinated person in Lea county, New Mexico, officials in that stateannouncedin early March.Dr Peter Marks, who recently resigned as the Food and Drug Administration’s vaccine while attributing that decision to Kennedy’s “misinformation and lies”, blamed the US health secretary and his staff for the death of the child being buried on Sunday.“This is the epitome of an absolute needless death,”Markssaid Sunday during an interview with the Associated Press. “These kids should get vaccinated – that’s how you prevent people from dying of measles.”Marks also told the AP that he had warned US senators that the country would endure more measles-related deaths if theTrump administrationdid not more aggressively respond to the outbreak. The Senate health committee has called Kennedy to testify before the group on Thursday.One of that committee’s members is the Louisiana Republican and medical doctor Bill Cassidy, who frequently speaks about the importance of getting vaccinates against diseases but joined his Senate colleagues in voting to confirm Kennedy as the US health secretary.Cassidy on Sunday published a statement saying: “Everyone should be vaccinated.”There is “no benefit to getting measles”, Cassidy’s statement added. “Top health officials should say so unequivocally [before] another child dies.”Measles, which is caused by a highly contagious, airborne virus that spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs, had been declared eliminated from the US in 2000. But the virus has recently been spreading in undervaccinated communities, with Texas and New Mexico standing among five states with active outbreaks – which is defined as three or more cases.Nearly 500 confirmed cases of measles across 19 US states, says CDCRead moreThe other states are Kansas, Ohio and Oklahoma. Collectively, as of Friday, the US had surpassed 600 measles cases so far this year – more than double the number it recorded in all of 2024.Healthofficials and experts have said that they expect the measles outbreak to go on for several more months at least – if not for about a year.Texas alone was reporting 481 cases across 19 counties as of Friday, most of them in the western region of the state. It registered 59 previously unreported cases between Tuesday and Friday. There were also 14 new hospitalizations, for a total of 56 throughout the outbreak.More than 65% of Texas’s measles cases are in Gaines county, which has a population of just under 23,000, and was where the virus started spreading in a tightly knit, undervaccinated Mennonite community.Gaines has logged 315 cases – in just over 1% of the county’s residents – since late January.The Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsTexasUS healthcareMMRUS politicsRobert F Kennedy JrTrump administrationHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

While expensive and challenged by an ageing population, social security remainsoverwhelminglypopularwith Americans. But the agency has been dubbed a “Ponzi scheme” byElon Musk, the billionaire whose so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) is currently slashing its staff and budgets.Musk echoes rightwing conspiracy theories to defend social security cutsRead more“They have these ‘concepts of plans’ that they’re hoping are sticking but in reality, are really hurting American people,” said a longtime SSA employee and military veteran who requested to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation. “No one knows what’s going on. They’re just coming up with ideas at the top of their head.”The SSA website hascrashedseveral times this month. WiredreportedDoge staff want to migrate all social security data and rewrite code in months, which could cause system collapse and further outages.The agency plans to eliminate the jobs of 7,000 workers at the agency through voluntary buyouts, resignations or firings, though the union representing SSA employees anticipate even more firings beyond cutting staff to 50,000 workers.Acting commissioner Leland Dudek hasacknowledgedto staff that Doge are making the decisions at the agency. Musk,Donald Trumpand others have claimed action is being taken to tackle widespread fraud at the agency.Dudek was appointed acting commissioner after hereportedly secretly sharedinformation with Doge staff. He hasthreatenedto shut down the agency in response to a court order barring Doge from accessing the data.“It’s just been a lot of craziness, a lot of foolishness. Until they get rid of Doge and the person in office right now, and the Republicans actually get a backbone and stand up for something for once in their lives, things are just going to be complete chaos. That’s really the best word to describe SSA right now, just complete, utter chaos,” the worker added. “They couldn’t understand the coding, so everything they said SSA was doing illegally, they weren’t. Common sense is something they lack. They don’t know what they’re doing.”Rich Couture, a spokesperson for the American Federation of Government Employees’ Social Security Administration general committee, the union representing roughly 42,000 social security workers, said Doge’s public targets for cuts make no sense.Why are they cutting 7,000 jobs, asked Couture. “It has never been explained with any degree of clarity how they came up with that figure. What’s being served by that by a loss of 7,000 jobs? How does any of that supposedly makes this operation more efficient? How does it improve service? How does it improve productivity? Our position is that losing 7,000 people doesn’t do any of those things,” he said.“I don’t think they’re going to stop at 7,000 people lost. If they lose 10,000 or 12,000, they’re running up their high score. They’re able to brag about it.”Departments at the agency have been closed and reorganized, with workers forced to take reassignments or risk firings, and all workers have been ordered to return to the office five days a week.Couture noted the return to office order occurred a day before a buyout offer was set to expire, in violation of union contract agreements, and the offices were not prepared or equipped to handle it, as many workers had no desks or equipment to work.Phone services for the public have also beencut, and field and regional offices areslated for closurearound the US.“There is no safe office in this country,” added Couture. “It’s a concerted attack on the legitimacy of social security itself. The promise that this country has made to the public with respect to income security is being broken.”The cuts come as staffing is already at a 50-year low despite the agency serving arecord number of recipientsas the US population above the age of 65 isgrowing.The office of the inspector general at SSAreportedin August 2024 that a record backlog of payment actions impacting social security beneficiaries was due to lack of staffing, increased workloads, and decreased funding for the agency, driving improper payments because staff weren’t available to update records.Couture noted theoperating overheadof the agency, as a share of benefits paid out, has shrunk by 20% over the last 10 years and is now less than 1%. He disputed any claims of inefficiency or waste at the agency, claiming the agency is already a model of efficiency and as effective as possible under its fiscal and staffing constraints.He said he was concerned the situation was creating a “negative feedback loop” where, as more employees leave, more work is put on those remaining, depressing morale and inducing more to leave “until the agency ends up in a death spiral with staffing, inducing office closures”.“You’re going to see a wholesale collapse in the agency’s service structure. Call wait times will skyrocket, wait times for appointments, processing times, all of it going to skyrocket because there won’t be enough people to do the jobs, which opens the door to privatization.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Those people aren’t collecting benefits, but the numbers are still technically active, because you can’t just erase social security numbers,” he said, noting that the numbers began being issued in the 1930s and are not deleted or reused, so they still remain in the system. “President Trump,Elon Muskand whoever the next commissioner is going to be, I really think their ultimate goal is just to destroy social security.”A spokesperson for the SSA deferred topress releaseson the cuts and reorganization of the agency.Judge blocks Elon Musk’s Doge from accessing social security recordsRead more“We have listened to our customers, Congress, advocates and others, and we are updating our policy to provide better customer service to the country’s most vulnerable populations,” said Dudek, the SSA’s acting commissioner. “In addition to extending the policy’s effective date by two weeks to ensure our employees have the training they need to help customers, Medicare, Disability and SSI applications will be exempt from in-person identity proofing because multiple opportunities exist during the decision process to verify a person’s identity.”They said in regard to office closures, that “to use our space more efficiently, we provided [the General Services Administration] alist of leasesfor termination,” and claimed that the return-to-office mandate was ordered to ensure “maximum staffing is available to support the stronger in-person identity proofing requirement”.On claims of waste, fraud and abuse, a spokesperson said in an email: “The agency will continue to monitor and, if necessary, make adjustments to ensure it pays the right person the right amount at the right time while safeguarding the benefits and programs it administers.”Explore more on these topicsUS social securityUS politicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpElon MusknewsShareReuse this content"

Eight years later he and Shirley set up theTricycle theatrein north-west London to provide a permanent base for the company’s productions.Working with a small team of actors, Ken was the theatre’s artistic director for four years from its foundation, until he and Shirley returned to their native Canada. Over that period, and before that with the travelling company, he was a notable champion of new plays by writers such asSam Shepard,John Antrobus andOlwen Wymark.The theatre still exists in the same place, although it is now known as the Kiln.View image in fullscreenKen Chubb and Shirley Barrie in 1980.Photograph: Chris PearceKen was born in Hamilton, Ontario, the son of a Baptist minister, Laurence, and his wife, Gladys (nee Penny). He went to Annandale school in Tillsonburg before studying at Waterloo Lutheran University (now Martin Luther University College), where he gained a degree in English, and then Carleton University, where he completed an MA in the same subject.After teaching English at a secondary school he returned to Carleton University as a lecturer in 1969 until, in 1971, he and Shirley, whom he had married in 1967, came to England, intending to stay for just a year.Not long after their arrival Ken went to a pub, the Pindar of Wakefield (now the Water Rats) in Gray’s Inn Road, centralLondon, to see a lunchtime theatre show. When it turned out to have been cancelled, he got talking to the landlord, who agreed that Ken could put on his own productions in the pub’s back room, using friends who were actors or teachers.He started off by producing and directing a six-month run of Shepard plays, and when they proved popular he was able to apply for Arts Council grants that allowed him to establish the touring Wakefield Tricycle Company.Eventually he and Shirley were able to give the company a permanent home by creating what was initially the Wakefield Tricycle theatre in Kilburn. With Ken as the theatre’s artistic director they put on more than 40 productions from 1980 to 1984.In 1985 he and Shirley went back toCanada, where Ken became a story and script editor for film and television, including for CTV. In 1989 he began a series of workshops across Canada for CBC to find and train minority ethnic writers for television.After Shirley died in 2018 Ken slowed down, but he continued to work on scripts, including for Shelley Niro’s film Café Daughter in 2023. He also arranged a reading of Shirley’s play The Revelationat his retirement home in 2024.He is survived by his children, Alexis and Robin, and grandson, Tristan.Explore more on these topicsTheatreOther livesKiln theatreLondonCanadaobituariesShareReuse this content"

It is the No 1 show across 74 countries and the ninth most-watched Netflix show of all time, with 96.7m views so far.Jack Thorne, its writer, has questioned whether the programme could have been made in the same way by the BBC because of the financial pressures it is under after cuts to the licence fee, the arrival ofstreaming services and the fragmentation of audiences.Emily Feller, the chief creative officer of Sheffield-based Warp Films, who was an executive producer on Adolescence, said the financial hardship hitting the public sector broadcasters (PSBs) – BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and 5 – had made them risk-averse about the kinds of shows they pursued.She said the next Adolescence or Baby Reindeer, a dark British comedy about a stalker that was also on Netflix, could be made by the PSBs if they were prepared to take a chance on difficult projects.“Hopefully Adolescence is allowing people to feel the risk-taking again, because there is an issue with money right now,” she said. “I think that it’s hard, and people are risk-averse. Hopefully, people will just take a moment and think this story has sold well. And obviously it comes down to money.“I really hope that this is going to allow the public service broadcasters to be able to look for those authored pieces. If you look at a BBC or ITV show, you’re talking about an 11-, 12-, 13-day shoot for an hour [of television]. And this was a 15-day shoot for an hour. So there is an expense in how we shot it. But I’m talking about the risk of storytelling, not just the production side.”Her intervention came afterElisabeth Murdoch, co-founder of the production company Sister, told the Guardian that a “perfect storm” hitting the UK’s television industry risked leading to British stories disappearing from the small screen.Warp Films, which co-produced Adolescence, has made its name by making challenging productions set in Britain, from This is England to Four Lions. Mark Herbert, its chief executive and another executive producer on Adolescence, said the show proved stories set in Britain could be successful internationally.“A British story set in this country can travel and you don’t need loads of effects, you don’t need crazy budgets,” he said. “Certain shows need that, and they’ve got their place, but I hope this shows you can hit a massive global audience without any of those. Just great acting, great storytellers.”However, he called for the government to intervene to help the UK’sstruggling TV industry. A post-Covid contraction, price inflation and the financial pressures placed on the main domestic broadcasters have resulted in thousands of the industry’s workers losing their jobs – and talk of a crisis in production.“I certainly think the whole tax credit thing needs looking at,” Herbert said. “If you look at what kind of stuff we’ve made historically, it’s £2-3m an episode. The international market is really struggling at the moment. People are not coming up with the ways to top up that finance – the costs to make those shows can’t go down any more. So we are in this weird chicken and egg situation where we do need some help.“I’ve seen what having proper dramas and films shot in the regions does, not just for the local economy directly, but also for confidence.”Warp’s next production, the revenge thriller Reunion, which begins on Monday, is set in and around Sheffield. It is billed as a bilingual series featuring both British Sign Language and spoken English. Warp also revealed that it has acquired the option to develop Threads, the critically acclaimed 1984 film depicting Sheffield during a nuclear war. Feller said it was another example of featuring ordinary British people against the backdrop of a provocative topic.“The way the original film was written and made, it absolutely had that voice with Sheffield,” she said. “That’s the kind of place, again, where you find that very rounded heart to the storytelling.”Explore more on these topicsTelevisionAdolescencenewsShareReuse this content"

On 9 April, then, come along to the Bindery in Hatton Garden, London, where a panel will discuss graphic novels in general and our prize in particular – tickets are still available. On stage will be last year’s brilliant judges, Luke Healy and Posy Simmonds, as well as Lesley Imgart, who won the 2024 prize for her charming, funny comicWitch Way?.The event will be chaired by me, and I hope to see you there.But back to the details of 2025. As ever, the winner of the prize will receive a cheque for £1,000 and his or her work will appear in theNew Reviewin print and online (the award for the runner-up is £250, and their story will also be published online). Perhaps the bigger thing, however, is that both will know that their work was admired by our two guest judges: Aimée de Jongh, whosegraphic adaptation of William Golding’s classicLord of the Flieswas published to such acclaim last year; and Jonathan Coe, whose wonderful novels includeWhata Carve Up!,The Rotters’ ClubandThe Proof of My Innocence. This is the 18th year of the prize, and we’re so happy to have them.Winning is often the beginning of something. For some, it has meant a book deal. Among past winners and runners-up are Isabel Greenberg, whose graphic novels includeGlass Town, the best book about the lives of the young Brontës you’ll ever read; Matthew Dooley, the Bollinger Everyman Wodehouse prize-winning author ofFlake(I hear he has a new book on the way);and Joff Winterhart, whose graphic novelDays of the Bagnold Summerbegan its life as his entry in the 2009 competition, and later became a film starring Monica Dolan. To enter, you must simply create a four-page comic designed to run over a double-page spread in theObserver New Review– a story that will ideally have a beginning, a middle and an end, and deploy original illustrations in its telling. After this, we do the hard work. So, to your drawing boards.

That sentiment, that each generation of black Britons believes themselves to be bold pioneers working in a vacuum, has persisted since the beginning of mass migration to this country.But what if the contributions of black Britons were not carelessly neglected, but rather, asLanre Bakareidentifies in his estimable first book,WeWere There,a history that has been more purposely obscured?The roots of the current Black Lives Matter-fuelled renaissance of black artistic practice in Britain were established decades ago in the relatively under-reported past. Bakare focuses on the Thatcher era of the late 1970s and 80s, “the most restive period in postwar history”, when, he argues, modern black Britishness was forged. The Bradford-born author complicates and deepens this story by shifting attention away from London, writing with quiet enthusiasm and sharp intelligence about black communities, including those in Bradford, Wolverhampton, Manchester, Liverpool, Cardiff and Edinburgh.Bakare ably demonstrates the key disadvantage faced by black people – a lack of information about their predecessorsHe unearths forgotten stories of black participation in cultural movements such as northern soul, whose popularity coincided with the emergence of reggae sound systems in the 1970s. One such story is that of Steve Caesar, a Leeds-based teenage migrant from St Kitts and winner of the inaugural northern soul dance competition at Wigan Casino in 1974. “Northern soul helped me find a sort of way of belonging,” says Caesar, and yet his story was excluded from the narratives of a movement historically cast as a white working-class phenomenon by music journalists.Building on the work of cultural historians such asStuart Hall, Bakare champions advances made by social activists. These include grassroots campaigners who in 1979 overturned the miscarriage of justice suffered by Bakare’s fellow Bradfordian George Lindo, imprisoned after he was framed by racist police for a robbery he did not commit.View image in fullscreenRevellers at a sound system, Notting Hill carnival, London, 1983.Photograph: UniversalImagesGroup/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesThe toppling of the statue of the transatlantic enslaverEdward Colston in Bristol in 2020was a very public reckoning with the city’s toxic past. Bakare shows that this direct action had been rehearsed in Liverpool three decades earlier. In 1982, protesters tied a rope to the statue of the former Liverpool MP William Huskisson, who hadlinks to the Atlantic slave trade, and dragged it to the ground. Bakare puts that toppling into the context of theriots in Liverpool 8 (Toxteth) the previous year.The violence was sparked by police brutality, neglect and the kind of prejudicial thinking expressed by Margaret Thatcher in the aftermath of the riots, which she characterised as the unlawfulness of young men “whose high animal spirits” had “wreak[ed] havoc” on the city.Bakare ably demonstrates the key disadvantage faced by black people – a lack of information about their predecessors. In my experience, the interventions and successes of our forebears have been cynically obscured, creating the impression that nothing had come before. This discontinuation has often followed short-term initiatives by white cultural gatekeepers who pat themselves on the back for their enlightenment, which only lasts until the novelty wears off and the next worthy group emerges to attract their attention.We Were Thereacknowledges the true tapestry of British culture by shining a light on committed activists/artists, such as the documentarian Bea Freeman, the producer ofThey Haven’t Done Nothing, a film about the aftermath of the 1981 riots.But the publication of books about the forgotten cultural history of black Britons can only come about if commissioning editors recognise previous blind spots.We Were Therebridges the gaps to missing links and admirably achieves what it sets out to provide: further evidence of “Black people’s influence on the UK”. If these stories are only shown in isolation, “they can be dismissed as curiosities”, writes Bakare, “that don’t alter our sense of what constitutes British culture”.We Were There: How Black Culture, Resistance and Community Shaped Modern Britainby Lanre Bakare is published by Bodley Head (£22).

He was arrested and given a prison sentence for his role in the riots there 30 years earlier.Photograph: Teri PengilleyAlex WheatleObituaryAlex Wheatle obituaryAuthor of the Crongton novels whose stories of inner-city life give a realistic portrait of growing up in contemporary BritainJulia EccleshareSun 6 Apr 2025 07.40 EDTLast modified on Sun 6 Apr 2025 08.41 EDTShareBest known as the author of the Crongton series of young adult novels,Alex Wheatle, who has died aged 62 of prostate cancer, was a writer, speaker and activist whose well-observed stories based on his own life gave a painful and vivid picture of his tough early years and adolescence in south London.His experiences, of growing up in an abusive care system, police brutality and a spell in prison, shaped Alex’s worldview and he wanted others to know about them; his passion and anger were tempered but never dulled by his subsequent success as a writer. Known as the Brixton Bard, he wrote fiercely but with understanding, energy and humour in a series of adult novels, starting with Brixton Rock (1999), before switching to young adult (YA) fiction.In 2020 Alex’s early life was the focus of Steve McQueen’s film Small Axe: Alex Wheatle, the fourth drama in hisBBC television anthology serieshighlighting institutional racism and the black British experience from the late 1960s to the early 80s.Alex was placed in care as a toddler and grew up in Shirley Oaks, a children’s home in Croydon where, it was later revealed,physical, mental and sexual abusehad beenwidespread over decades; he wrote of the violence inflicted on him inSufferah: Memoir of a Brixton Reggae Head(2023). He was born in Brixton, the son of Almira Gunter, who was married with four children when she arrived in the UK in 1961, where she met Alfred Wheatle, also from Jamaica, who worked as a carpenter. Soon after Alex’s birth, his mother returned home, leaving her baby son with his father, who struggled to cope.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Arcadia BooksAt 15, Alex was moved from Shirley Oaks to a social services hostel in Brixton. Here, he had his first experience of the West Indian community and was quick to embrace his black identity with clothes, hair, language and particularly reggae music, appearing as DJ Yardman Irie at 16 and becoming a founder member and the lyricist of the Crucial Rocker sound system group. He was also active in the struggle against police racism and brutality, and was arrested and given a prison sentence for his involvement in theBrixtonuprising of 1981.Alex’s cell mate during his four months in Wormwood Scrubs was Simeon, a Rastafarian who recognised the younger man’s deep feelings of isolation.“He understood too well that I was disconnected from my roots, culture and people from the moment I was taken into care at two and a half,”Alex wrote later. “He took it upon himself to reconnect me. He pushedCLR James’sThe Black Jacobinsinto my eager hands. ‘This will tell you ah liccle something about where you come from and where you stand in the struggle,’ he said.”He introduced Alex to other black authors including Chester Himes, who Alex later cited as the inspiration for his own writing, along with Maya Angelou, Charles Dickens, Linton Kwesi Johnson and John Steinbeck.But when Alex began to write, it was his life not books that inspired his debut novel, Brixton Rock; set in 80s south London, its central character, 16-year-old Brenton Brown, carries the same story of neglect and subsequent rebellion against authority. It was praised by critics and won the London Arts Board new writers award in 1999.This was followed in 2001 with East of Acre Lane, “a similarly hard-hitting slice of social commentary”, said one critic, set against the backdrop of the 1981 riots; and several other books includingThe Dirty South(2008) andBrenton Brown(2011), a sequel to Brixton Rock.He also drew on his own story for Uprising, a one-man play he wrote and first performed in 2011, in London and on tour, before touring it again in 2012 as part of the 50th anniversary celebrations of Jamaican independence.View image in fullscreenThe Small Axe episode about Alex Wheatle, played by Sheyi Cole.Photograph: Will Robson-Scott/BBC/McQueen LimitedDespite his success, and being made MBE for services to literature in 2008, Alex became disillusioned with adult publishing –“I felt like I was this token black writer who writes about ghetto stuff”– and turned instead to fiction for young adults, telling similar stories but in a lighter style and with more imaginative licence. Instead of recreating Brixton, Alex created Crongton, his own fictional world, with a multicultural cast of pumped up, slang-speaking teenagers navigating life on an inner-city estate.Character-led and told mostly through raucous dialogue, the Crongton stories gave a realistic picture of growing up in contemporary Britain. The switch to YA brought Alex immediate success. Liccle Bit (2015) was longlisted for the Carnegie medal in 2016 and Crongton Knights (2016)won the Guardian children’s fiction prize.“There was a real sense of excitement, both in the room and among readers, when Alex was announced as the 50th winner of the Guardian children’s fiction prize,” remembers Claire Armitstead, then books editor at the Guardian.“Here were sexting and gang violence and early-morning bailiffs’ visits to tower block flats: the stuff of grim news headlines freshly minted in a glorious invented slang that gave his characters ownership of their stories with not a whiff of condescension. As the author and prize judge David Almond said, the novel ‘hummed with the beat of real life’.”More Crongton books followed, includingStraight Outta Crongton(2017) andKerb Stain Boys(2018), as well as YA novels exploring aspects of black history includingCane Warriors(2020), on a slave rebellion in Jamaica in 1760, and Kemosha of the Caribbean (2022), about an escaped slave girl’s adventures as a pirate. A 10-partBBC comedy drama series, Crongton, based on the books, launched in March.View image in fullscreenWheatle doing a book signing at Hay festival in 2022.Photograph: Robert Melen/Rex/ShutterstockI first met Alex when he won the Guardian children’s fiction prize. I was inspired by his passionate belief that, by telling the stories of his life and the lives of other children like him, he could make a difference to young readers who had largely been excluded from representation in books. He later summed up what the recognition brought by the award meant to him: “I still see myself sometimes as ‘little Alex’ who never thought he would achieve anything. You grow up with this low self-esteem that is hard to fight against.”He spoke in schools and at festivals, encouraging young people to write their own stories. Aine Venables, the education manager of Hay festival who took him on a week’s tour speaking to children across Wales, said: “Alex’s life experience and his warmth grounded his writing, and his storytelling brilliance captivated thousands of young people.”Last year, as a“Thinker in Residence”at Hay, speaking to audiences of all ages, Alex advocated for greater interventions by government and those involved in the book world to do more to help even the very youngest children to enjoy reading so that their lives, like his, could be changed. He also campaigned for Prostate Cancer UK, having been diagnosed with the disease in 2023, speaking honestly to men, particularly black men, to debunk fears about the necessary check up.He is survived by his wife, Beverley (nee Robinson), whom he married in 1999, and their three children, Marvin, Tyrone and Serena.Alex Alphonse Wheatle, writer, born 3 January 1963; died 16 March 2025Explore more on these topicsAlex WheatleFictionRaceYoung adultTeen booksobituariesShareReuse this content"

The news item happened to pop up on the feed of Michael Grandage, the theatre director who worked with McGregor in the mid-2000s on two productions,Guys and DollsandOthello, both under the Donmar Warehouse umbrella. “I thought, ‘Oh God, how brilliant is that!’” exclaims Grandage, who is 62 and since 2012 has been the artistic director of theMichael Grandage Company. “We hadn’t been in touch for a long time and I just thought that I’d send him a text, because it’s a big well done. It’s not something that a lot of people get, actually. I was looking up whohasn’tgot one…”Grandage and McGregor, who are sitting side by side in a rehearsal space in central London, steal a glance at each other and erupt, simultaneously, in loud howls.McGregor was in Los Angeles, where he has mainly lived since 2008, when he received the text. But he had spent part of the summer in Scotland, where he has a home in Perthshire, and for the flight back he had grabbed a play from his bookshelf, a gift from his wife, the actor Mary Elizabeth Winstead. “I thought, ‘I haven’t read a play in years,’” he recalls. “And it was Ibsen’sThe Master Builder. I’d never read Ibsen, and God, I loved it. So when I got my congratulations for the star from Michael, I replied saying, ‘Oh, that’s very kind. Thank you very much. I’ve just readThe Master Builderfor fun. I must be wanting to go back on stage…’”Grandage insists, with a smirk, that he wasn’t fishing. “I’d watch that amazingHalstonseries and think, ‘Oh, he’s doing that massive bloody Netflix series now… then he’s doingObi-Wan Kenobi[on Disney+].’ I’m not going to disturb him. He’ll come back when he’s ready.” But, serendipitously, Grandage had a play on his desk:My Master Builder, a new work by US playwright Lila Raicek, which is described as being a “conversation” with the 1892 Henrik Ibsen play. Did McGregor want to look at it? Yes, he very much did.And so here we are, cramped in an L-shaped room that normally does service as a makeup space. McGregor, in earthy colours and natural fibres, is getting stuck into an instant coffee and a KitKat; Grandage, all in blue, wears a corduroy blazer and has gravity-defying hair.My Master Builderopens at London’s Wyndham’s theatre this month and runs until mid-summer. “Normally these things take years, or a year at least,” says Grandage. “This whole turnaround was just weeks, which is extraordinary.”View image in fullscreenMcGregor with Jenna Russell in Guys and Dolls at the Piccadilly theatre in 2005.Photograph: Donald Cooper/AlamyAt a time when you can hardly step foot in the West End without tripping over a Tom Hiddleston or a Brie Larson, the return of McGregor to the stage is still an event that would jump to the top of your news feed. He has been an indelible presence in British culture for more than 30 years, ever since makingShallow Grave(1994) andTrainspotting(1996) with director Danny Boyle. He went global in the late-1990s with a run of three Star Wars prequels and Baz Luhrmann’sMoulin Rouge!with Nicole Kidman in 2001. And the output has never slowed or dropped off:Halston, the biopic of the US fashion designer, won him an Emmy in 2021; the miniseriesObi-Wan Kenobibroke Disney+ viewing records in 2022.You’re not a film actor, and you’re not a television actor, and you’re not a theatre actor. You’re just an actorEwan McGregorThere is also scarcity at work here. McGregor has not appeared in a UK theatre since 2008, a gap of 17 years; he did perform the Tom Stoppard playThe Real Thingon Broadway in 2014, opposite Maggie Gyllenhaal, but that was more than a decade ago. Still, McGregor very much does not accept the line that he is the latest Hollywood star slumming it on the London stage for a few months. He started out working at the Perth Repertory theatre when he was 16; he then studied drama at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London. “You’re not a film actor, and you’re not a television actor, and you’re not a theatre actor,” he says. “You’re just an actor.”McGregor continues: “To me, coming back to the theatre isn’t like, ‘Oh, here’s this movie actor on stage…’ I’ve always found that a little bit offensive. And I’ve always found the first few minutes on stage in London, I can feel that in the room. After a few minutes, you can feel the audience go, ‘Oh, OK,’ then you can get on with it. And that’s partly why I wanted to work in New York, because I thought they might be different there. And I did achieve that.”McGregor cracks that boyish grin, his blue eyes alert and twinkling. “Because half the audience were asleep half the time. So it wasn’t quite as scary somehow.”Grandage, who has directed innumerable high-profile productions, featuring the likes of Kidman, Jude Law and Daniel Radcliffe, nods his head in agreement. “Well, it’s not a film star coming back in your case, because you kept at it,” he says. “You’ve done it over the years and you trained, that’s the other thing. There’s only ever a dialogue about it when somebody doesn’t work; when, universally, the critics and audiences go, ‘This person, something’s not right here.’ And quite frequently it is the people who are trying to do a play when they haven’t done a play before.“What usually happens then is a debate starts, articles get written and it goes away as soon as somebody who does it frequently comes back and shows you can be a film actor, a television actor and a stage actor. Because, as Ewan says, you’re an actor.”When we meet, Grandage and McGregor are in the second week of a five-week rehearsal block. Such extensive preparations are pretty much unheard of in the world of film. ForShallow GraveandTrainspotting, Boyle insisted on a week, which was unusually long. “We lived together forShallow Graveand we’d all go to see films at night,” says McGregor. “Then withTrainspottingit was the same. And I don’t know that I’ve ever experienced that since.”A big pull for returning to theatre then was what McGregor is doing today: breaking down scenes with actors (inMy Master Builder, his co-stars includeElizabeth Debicki, fromThe CrownandThe Night Manager) and the chance to deeply interrogate a text. “On film, it’s very often the case that you’re learning the lines in the car on the way in,” he says. “Then you get on set, everyone’s got coffee, and you just sort of put it together, and before you know it: ‘Action!’ On the whole, 99% of the directors you’re working for now are just happy to see that it works. And that’s it.”View image in fullscreenMcGregor playing Iago to Chiwetel Ejiofor’s Othello at the Donmar in 2007.Photograph: Donald Cooper/AlamyMcGregor recalls his early days at the Perth theatre with clear fondness. He struggled at school, which was awkward because both his parents were teachers (his father at the independent Morrison’s Academy, which he attended, and where his older brother, who went on to become a fighter pilot in the RAF, had been head boy). “All I wanted to do was music and art, and they said I had to choose one, so I sat in a physics class pretending I was taking notes,” he says. “I got more and more depressed and more and more in trouble. And it was probably embarrassing for my dad.”Then, one night, on a rainy drive into Crieff, McGregor’s mum said he could leave school if he wanted. “And I went, ‘What? Fuck, that’s it,’” he says, eyes wide. “So I didn’t go back, and I started phoning the theatre, where I’d been trying to get a job since I was 14.” His first gig was as an extra in the courtroom scene in the Santha Rama Rau playA Passage to India, but he hung around, made himself useful. “I’d take the sets down, I’d help to put the sets up. And occasionally they gave me a few lines. That’s where I started.”There’s also obvious affection when McGregor talks about his previous collaborations with Grandage. The director cast him first as Sky Masterston in a 2005 revival ofGuys and Dolls, and then in 2007 as Iago inOthello. “I’ve had some of the best experiences of my working life with Michael,” says McGregor. “Two completely different – couldn’t think of two more different – plays. But I got to play Iago and that was extraordinary.”“It’s one of the biggest parts in Shakespeare,” Grandage notes.“Fucking hell, quite a biggie,” says McGregor. “Terrifying, but I loved it. And I remember when it finished, I felt like I took a huge, huge weight off my shoulders that I’d been carrying for a long time. Just the pressure of it was massive. Even though I loved it, it was a great relief to stop.”It’s a recurring theme in McGregor’s career, his apparent suspicion of a comfort zone. Perhaps the most obvious examples are his global motorbike odysseys with his friend Charley Boorman. It started in 2004 withLong Way Round, a 19,000-mile journey from London to New York, via Russia and Mongolia. Next month, a fourth edition calledLong Way Home, a two-month trip from Scotland through Europe to the Arctic Circle and then back to London, airs on Apple TV+.The takeaway from these adventures invariably is how unspoilt and gung-ho McGregor remains. I tell him that, 20 years on, I still remember him eating testicle soup in Mongolia. “Did he do that?” asks Grandage, shocked.“I did do that,” McGregor replies. “I ate mine. Charley didn’t get his down, Charley’s came flying straight back out again. But I got mine down, it was all right.”This memory segues into McGregor reminiscing about being in “the middle of fucking nowhere” in far-eastern Russia on the same trip, travelling for days with the landscape barely changing, not seeing a soul. “Then there was a bus stop that was a toilet,” he says. “We opened the door, and there was a wooden toilet, but there was a pyramid of poo coming out of it. It filled up, and they didn’t stop pooing on it. But I was thinking: ‘How did they get up the top?’ You’d have to be standing up like…”McGregor, who has previous in his film career with horrible toilets, clambers up on to a kitchen counter and puts his hand above his head: at least three metres high. Grandage is bent double, laughing. “Anyway, we were just all taking pictures of each other next to it,” he says, miming a thumbs-up. “That was not a comfortable toilet.”The Master Builderis a late-period Ibsen play that is commonly accepted to be at least partially autobiographical. It concerns Halvard Solness, a middle-aged man who runs an architecture practice – he’s a builder, not an architect though, because he’s not fully qualified – in a small town in Norway. Solness is much in demand, but also tetchy, vain and fearful of being usurped by the dreaded “younger generation”. His inevitable unravelling comes with the surprise arrival of a 23-year-old woman called Hilda, whom he met briefly a decade before.My Master Builder, the new play, is set in the Hamptons in the present day on 4 July and centres on an architect, Henry Solness (McGregor). There’s a big party to celebrate his latest project, which is crashed by Mathilde (Debicki), a former student and fling of Henry’s. “I’ve done a few Ibsens before,” says Grandage. “And it’s not a version of, and it’s not a translation of, and it’s not a … what’s the other one? Adaptation! Weirdly, it’s its own thing, it’s its own new play.”View image in fullscreenMcGregor as Renton in Danny Boyle’s Trainspotting (1996).Photograph: Channel Four Films/Allstar“When I read Lila’s play, I realised she’s just brought it into 2025,” says McGregor. “The sexual politics of Ibsen’s play are not turned on their head, but fleshed out into our reality. So it’s not just a poor old master builder who’s moaning about … ” He smiles: “I shouldn’t paraphrase the themes of Ibsen’s plays! But it’s fleshed out for a modern audience, and the sexual politics are much more in your face, I suppose.”Nobody retires in our industry. We don’t retire. The word doesn’t exist!Michael GrandageFor both McGregor and Grandage, the fact thatMy Master Builderis a new play was a key part of the appeal. “This may be a little romantic, but everything was a new play once,” says Grandage. “The best thing about a new play is that there’s an audience at some point who don’t know what happens next. And you can never, ever get that back once it’s happened.”“When you open a script up, it lists who the original cast were,” adds McGregor. “And I always thought: ‘God, that would be amazing to be the first ever person to play a role.’ Then this happened, just by chance and by luck and by hook and crook.”As men at the top of their respective fields, do McGregor and Grandage understand Solness nervously looking over his shoulder at the next generation? “One of the great challenges of ageing, I suppose, is how you deal with it,” says Grandage. “There’s something very interesting happening at the moment for me. It’s a bit of a shock, actually. But our lighting designer, Paule Constable, who is one of the great lighting designers, and who Ewan and I worked with onOthello, she has decided to retire. Well, nobody retires in our industry. We don’t retire. The word doesn’t exist! I know Daniel Day-Lewis retired officially, but he’s the only one I can think of.”McGregor has five children and thinks that demystifies the fear of being usurped by young upstarts. “No, I always feel like I’m totally current to them and then I’m reminded by them that I’m not,” he says. “But because I’ve got kids in several of the generations – my eldest, Clara, is almost 30 years old and my youngest is three, and I’ve got many in between – I don’t feel that.”Grandage can’t resist a playful dig. “Of course, they are reminding you you’ve been around a bit when they give you things like a Hollywood star of fame,” he says.“Or the lifetime achievement award…” McGregor groans.“Theawfullifetime achievement award,” Grandage agrees. “It’s like, ‘Christ, is that it?’”For now though, both men seem determined to keep testing their limits.“I don’t look out of my eyes as somebody in their mid-fifties,” says McGregor, readying himself to return to the rehearsal room. “I don’t feel that way inside.”My Master Builderruns atWyndham’s theatrein London from 17 April to 12 July.Long Way Homeis on Apple TV+ from 9 MayExplore more on these topicsTheatreThe ObserverEwan McGregorMichael GrandageHenrik IbsenElizabeth DebickiinterviewsShareReuse this content"

All of these have sold out online.Designers know very well that the TV show – which boasted a new high of4.8 million viewers in the US for its seventh episode– can work as a platform to market their clothing. Simon Porte Jacquemus contacted costume designerAlex Bovairdon Instagram with a request to collaborate before the latest series began filming – a reversal of the typical process, where a costume designer will contact a brand to borrow clothes.View image in fullscreenSam Nivola, who plays Lochlan Ratliff in The White Lotus.Photograph: Stefano Delia/HBOThe result is two custom looks for Chloe, including a pink swimsuit and cover-up with brimmed hat for her to welcome guests on her partner’s superyacht in episode four. Bovaird says this is the first time that a designer as renowned as Jacquemus has contacted her. “White Lotusfills this specific niche of being quite cool,” says Bovaird. “People want to be involved with it.”Bovaird has been the costume designer since the series began. She requests items to borrow from brands but also finds them in “a mix of flea markets, showrooms, charity shops, [and] we make some stuff. The unitard that Nadya [the partner of Aleksi] wears in the latest episode came from a market in Essex. There are bags from Hermès – and other things that cost £5.99, like that unitard.”Part of the fashion appeal, she says, comes from the characters always being on holiday. “When you’re going on holiday, you’re dressing up, you’re not wearing your everyday clothes. With other contemporary shows, you’re nailing actuality. I get a chance to play dress up.”Bovaird also collaborated onThe White Lotus H&Mcollection, around half of which has already sold out at the high-street chain. “The idea was that not everyone can afford luxury hotel resorts but everyone can afford to be glamorous and have a bit ofWhite Lotusin their wardrobe,” she says.TV has a long history of boosting the sales of fashion brands.Sexand the Cityin the 90s made Manolo Blahnik and Jimmy Choo household names – aNewsweekarticlefrom 2000 quotes a buyer for department store Neiman Marcus saying Blahnik’s sales tripled because of the show – andMad Mencharacters such as Joan Holloway and Don Draper inspired countless designers during its seven seasons.The White Lotusis not the first TV series to partner with a brand, either. In 2009, New York designerAnna Sui created a collection for Targetthat was inspired by the clothes ofGossip Girl, andBanana Republic worked withMad Menin 2011(and has also worked withThe White Lotusthis season).More recent TV shows with fashion kudos includeEuphoria, which influences twentysomethings with its eclectic thrifted style,Emily in Paris, with its ultra-fashion look, andSuccession, which arguably contributed to the rise of the quiet luxury aestheticand “finance bro” gilets. Apple TV’s office-basedSeverance, meanwhile, is a reference for the current return of workwear in fashion.View image in fullscreenAimee Lou Wood, who plays Chelsea in The White Lotus, in a T-shirt by New York–based artist Scooter LaForge.Photograph: Fabio Lovino/HBO“We’ve seen TV and fashion intersecting for quite a while but in this current era of prestige TV, it’s dialled up to 11 in terms of the impact,” says Beth Bentley, the founder of brand strategy consultancy Tomorrowism. “Successionbrought heat around brands that people maybe hadn’t encountered before – like Loro Piana and Brunello Cucinelli. It made people curious about those brands.”Paul Flynn, who writes about TV forGrazia, says: “There’s an argument to be made somewhere that [Succession’s] Kendall Roy is the most influential menswear figure of the last decade.”The love of these shows – and the discourse around them online – means fans will pore over the outfits, thinking of them as what’s known as “Easter eggs”, or clues to the plot. Bovaird says she does use outfits to plant clues – in an interview withDazed, she revealed that a mannequin wore one character’s dress in series two that foreshadowed that character’s death at the end. “I know people have delved into the outfits and their meanings,” she says. “Some of it is true, definitely, I just couldn’t say what.”Flynn praises the costume design in everything fromEastEndersto Ryan Murphy’sMonsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story, but he says the attention to what characters wear is also a sign of how TV is changing. “Wardrobe is one of the things that has started to make terrestrial TV look so 20th century, as opposed to the streamers,” he says. Bentley adds: “It’s a badge of honour within the industry to be able to say they got on [a show] before everyone else.”View image in fullscreenLily Collins and Ashley Park in Emily in Paris.Photograph: APThe White Lotushas been on fashion’s radar since series one, where Sydney Sweeney’s sardonic teen character, Olivia, became a favourite. Haley Lu Richardson’s Portia in season two became the poster girl ofgen Z “schlumpy” style.While independent brands often don’t have the resources to lobby for their designs to be featured in these shows, they notice the impact when they are. Scooter LaForge created the T-shirts that Chloe and Chelsea wear for the full-moon party in the current series ofThe White Lotus.He says the response has been “overwhelmingly” positive. “My Instagram following has skyrocketed throughout season three.”While LaForge hand-paints his T-shirts, meaning fans cannot buy the exact ones featured in the show, he sold similar designs at the Patricia Field ARTFashion Gallery in New York. “Sales have been strong,” he says. “I’ve been very busy, [even if] there’s no mass production or printing involved.”Often, designers won’t know that their products have made it on the show before it’s aired – as was the case with the green Hunza G bikini worn by Chloe. “When I watched the episode, I saw [the bikini] at the same time as everybody else,” says the brand’s founder, Georgiana Huddart. “My phone went crazy.” The bikini sold out within a week.View image in fullscreenSex and the City turned exclusive shoe designers Manolo Blahnik and Jimmy Choo into household names.Photograph: Startraks Photo/REX/ShutterstockHuddart says Hunza G has appeared in other TV shows, includingBad Sisters, butThe White Lotushas a special status. “It [reaches] such a wide demographic of people.”Bentley agrees the series has a unique place in culture, partly due to the fact that episodes are only released once a week. “There’s shared anticipation,” she says. “I was in a hairdresser in Somerset, and people were talking about it. It’s not just in media hotspots, or in city locations, or among gen Z – it’s everybody and their mum.”If watching these shows is a relatively universal experience, the worlds and people they often depict are anything but. “If you look atSuccessionorThe White Lotuscharacters, the writers of the shows are skewering the rich and poking fun at them – and yet, at the same time, we want to dress like them. There’s a crazy irony there.”Despite this, Bentley believes the connection between TV and fashion brands isn’t going away. In fact, she predicts they will fuse even more. “[There will be] collabs and capsule collections, and also maybe brands digging in financially and funding original content to create moments that have more intention and more control, from the brand’s point of view,” she says.As for costume designers’ work continuing to make a mark on consumers’ wardrobes, Bovaird – who is, admittedly, somewhat biased – argues that it’s a good thing.“Peopleshouldbe influenced by experts in how they dress,” she says. “I’m not saying a TikTok influencer can’t influence, but we really are the experts. We think about clothes all the time.”Explore more on these topicsThe White LotusThe ObserverTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

My work has unalterably changed the way I see the human world in general, and myself in particular. It has helped me understand everything from political hatred and religions to cults to the nature of identity and suicidal thought. It has even made sense of my own lifelong struggle with making friends.Our evolution intoHomonarrans, the storytelling animal, is the secret of our success. Like other animals, humans exist in a realm of survival in which we seek sustenance, safety and procreation. But, uniquely, we also live in a second realm, a story world that’s made out of the collective imagination. The human brain has evolved to remix reality and turn it into a narrative. We are made to feel like the underdog heroes of our own lives, surrounded by allies and enemies, pursuing meaningful goals and striving towards imagined happy endings. We have a voice in our head that authors a constantly unfolding autobiography of who we are and what we’re doing. We experience, and remember, the events of our lives in three-act episodes of crisis, struggle, resolution. We think in stories, we talk in stories, we believe in stories, wearestories.This story world is where we spend most of our psychological time. The self as it exists in this imaginary realm is not made of flesh and blood, but a collection of ideas about who we are. We call this collection of ideas our “identity”. Our identity is the character we play in the story of our lives and it is of immeasurable importance to us. Indeed, our devotion to it can be more important than life itself. From the Christian martyrs to the 9/11 terrorists to the countless millions throughout human history who have willingly given their lives in defence of their nation or revolution or some idea of what is right, it’s ordinary for human beings to choose identity over their actual survival.‘We have a voice in our head that authors a constantly unfolding autobiography of who we are and what we’re doing’Just like heroes in fiction, we measure the health of our identity in two ways: by how much connection we experience to other humans and how much status they afford us. All humans yearn to be loved and respected, and dread the loss of these essential social resources. It’s no coincidence that survival, connection and status are the subjects of virtually all archetypal stories. Films such asAlienandThe Revenantare about survival;Brokeback MountainandStand By Meare about connection;WhiplashandBarbieare about status. The stories that feel exceptionally rich and complex, and that can be enjoyed over and over again –Star Wars,Romeo and Juliet,The Godfather– are about all three.This understanding of myself as a made-up character in a made-up story world who is restlessly seeking connection and status has helped me understand what’s going wrong when life becomes painful. In a period of anxiety or depression, it gives me a model to analyse what’s actually happening. Is it a survival issue? Am I physically unwell? Or is it connection? Am I feeling distant from my wife, or somehow rejected by someone else who I care about? Is it status? Is it an anxiety about how work is going, or some stupidity on social media, or something in the news cycle about how my political ‘team’ is doing versus its rivals? Without exception, I find the answer in one of these buckets. Periods of more significant sadness are usually defined by issues with both connection and status.I have come to think of connection and status problems as “identity stress”. This is a concept that has helped me in my work as a listening volunteer for the Samaritans: a great many use the service while suffering personal crises related to connection or status. Those thinking about ending their lives, meanwhile, are often experiencing the hell of identity failure. In my experience as a volunteer, callers tend to struggle with suicidal thoughts for one of three reasons: chronic pain, recent bereavement or identity failure – the final category being by far the largest. It’s both remarkable and heartbreaking to hear the impact that a few honestly felt supportive words can have, during these conversations, about how interesting or brave or clever or insightful they seem.Identity stress is what we do to each other. The pain is by design. One of the core roles of story is to tell us who we should be, to show us how a hero looks, acts, speaks and believes and to try to press us into its shape, in order that we be a more successful co-operative member of our tribe. That pressure comes from other people, who punish us when we err by withdrawing the hero’s rewards of connection and status. Anyone who struggles socially will be overwhelmingly familiar with these punishments. Ever since school, I’ve struggled to make friends. I have a bad personality. I’m not going to go on about it, it’s just a fact. Awakening myself to the reality of story world has helped me see past my unlikeability. I know, now, that the experience of self-hatred that can be triggered by identity stress is just the merciless machinery of the story world, trying to punish me into fitting in. I console myself that, in reality, there are more ways of serving the human family than merely being pleasant company.Perhaps most urgently, in this era of intense political division, my research has helped me understand the apparent madness of our ever-warring tribes and the divisions which humans seem to make between each other helplessly and continuously and with often horrendous effect. Story’s original purpose was to enable us to work together in the form of highly co-operative groups. Humans are a species of ape that has learned to solve the problems of existence in a way that’s more similar to ants. Tribes, religions, cults, societies, economies, corporations, science labs, football teams – they’re all ant-like superorganisms in which individuals collaborate to pursue the aims of their group, with each person playing their part. Story’s role is to fuse all those individual human minds together and to get them thinking as one.The human brain isn’t especially interested in truth. It’s not a fact-finder, but a story processorWe experience its power whenever we go to the cinema and allow ourselves to become transported into a film. Sitting in the auditorium, a crowd of disparate people are merged into one, as they put aside their own existence and replace it with the characters on the screen, following their trials and feeling their defeats and their victories almost as if they are happening to them. This quasi-magical effect can linger even after the credits have rolled. How many of us have experienced that weird dissociative drunkenness as we stagger out of the cinema somehow feeling, for a strange minute, that wearethe hero – that we have come to be possessed by the film’s protagonist? This is story working as it’s designed to. Its job is to get inside our head and alter our perceptions.This is why even the smartest among us can seem so irrational. The human brain isn’t especially interested in truth. It’s not a fact-finder, but a story processor. It’s designed to absorb the story world of the groups we identify with – their narrative of right and wrong, their tale of what we need to do together to make the future, their heroic model of the ideal self – and reorganise our perceptions around it. Which is not to say anything so silly as there’s no such thing as “truth”, of course, or that we’re completely immune to arguments based on data. It’s just that, for even the most brilliant humans, “truth” and “data” so often become subservient to story. Most of all, the human brain wants to make us believe the narrative that binds our group together and disbelieve that of its rivals. It has a raft of techniques for doing this: we find mean-spirited and lawyerly ways of dismissing their strongest arguments; we seek to undermine their reputation and therefore silence them; we use the most egregious actions of their worst members to define them all; we assign them the worst possible motives; we simply forget the most persuasive things they have to say. This is story making. It is dividing the human world into heroes and villains, and casting ourselves in the winning role.I’ve learned the uncomfortable truth that those people who seem so cartoonishly villainous are usually just honest actors who are living in a different narrative universe to mine. No matter how clearly and obviously deranged their perception seems, I know that, to them, it feels inarguably real. As hard as it can be to accept emotionally, they’re not the evil, calculating baddies they appear to be. They’re a made-up character in a made-up story world, as am I.A Story is a Deal by Will Storr is published by Little, Brown at £20, or £18 atguardianbookshop.com.If you have been affected by any of these issues, contactSamaritanson freephone 116 123Explore more on these topicsLife and styleSelf and wellbeingHealth & wellbeingPsychologyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

People ask: did your life flash before your eyes? It didn’t. The only thing I remember thinking was: “Oh well”. In an instant all those things I’d been worrying about until that point didn’t matter, because I was about to die. Oh well!There was nothing I could do. I was on my motorbike on a dark and rainy night in rush hour traffic when a car pulled across into my lane without looking. I couldn’t avoid hitting it, I couldn’t brake, I was going to hit the car and I was going to die.Kindness of strangers: my husband was stung by a stingray, then the whole beach stepped upRead moreThe next thing I knew, I was lying on the road. When I came to, I became aware of people starting to crowd around me. There were all these faceless feet milling all around, asking me my name and telling me I was alright. But no one wanted to move me or take my motorcycle helmet off in case I had some sort of spinal damage.I’m not sure when Sophia came into the picture, but I do remember she laid down next to me on the road so I could see her face. She was the first person to do that. She asked me if I needed her to call somebody and I asked her to ring my husband. She did, then she came back to hold my hand and chat with me to try to keep me conscious until the ambulance arrived, which took about half an hour.There was a humanness to her connection – she seemed to understand that I needed the safety of someone being right there at eye level.Sophia came to visit me at the hospital later that night to see how I was. Miraculously, nothing was broken: I had a lot of protective gear on, which had saved me. I just had a lot of bruises and strains. Sophia had been to the supermarket and bought me some snacks and magazines, rightly suspecting I’d be in there for a while and would need entertainment.She hadn’t only thought about me – she’s come to see my husband, too. She had got him a hot chook, coleslaw and salad and said: I know it will be really late by the time you get home tonight and if you’re anything like my husband, you won’t have thought about yourself. She stayed with us for about half an hour.She was a FIFO worker, so she was doing all of this while sacrificing a precious night at home with her family. I couldn’t believe somebody so thoughtful could exist – I mean, what an angel.I think about the selflessness of the hours she so willingly gave up to help someone she’d never met before. Now, in many different situations, I think, what would Sophia do? She wasn’t the medical responder. And yet what she offered was of such huge value. I never saw Sophia again, but I still can’t imagine anybody kinder than this woman.What is the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?Share your experienceWhat's the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?From making your day to changing your life, we want to hear about  chance encounters that have stuck with you.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

So much so that some days I struggle to look in the mirror. I’ve recently had a baby and assumed that my long history of feeling ugly, lesser and fundamentally inadequate would be surpassed by being a mother and having an external concern other than myself but, if anything, it’s worse.It has become so bad I have convinced myself that my partner will find someone else despite him being lovely, reassuring and committed. I know this cognitively, but emotionally I feel deeply flawed as a woman and ugly in the world. I judge myself constantly when I’m around other women.I had an eating disorder for 15 years in which I could hideand shrink myself and I feel I’ve fully recovered from this.But nowit is a deeper feeling of housing an altogether more monstrous self,constantly fearing others will see me as I do: repulsive to look at.Writing this makes me realise how self-absorbed I sound, but I’ve spent years carrying this shame around, shame in my body,in my lack of feminine sex appeal,in my inherent inadequacy. I don’t want to drive my partner away, I don’t want to pass this on to my daughter and I don’t want to waste my life hiding. I’ve spent years in therapy where I asked the therapist to not look at me (we faced opposite walls), so I could talk openly, without having to feel visibly exposed as well as emotionally.How can I overcome this venom I seem to have for my appearance and myself in this world?Philippa’s answerFirst, I want to acknowledge how hard this must be for you. You are carrying such a heavy burden of self-criticism and it makes sense that you feel constricted and sad. But let me assure you, there is nothing inherently wrong with you. You are not broken and you are not a “monstrous self”. What you have is a particularly vicious inner critic and that is what we need to work with. This inner critic isn’t you, it’s just a voice, one that has been given far too much authority over your experience. So, here’s what I suggest: give it a silly name. Really. Make it ridiculous. Call it something like “Madam Misery” or “Naggy Noreen”. Sketch it out if you like, what does it look like? A tiny, shrivelled gremlin? A pompous, over-dramatic theatre villain? However you picture it, externalise it.Start to observe it, rather than embodying it. When it speaks up, imagine it sitting on a chair opposite you. Say to it, “Ah, there you are again. I hear you, but I’m not taking you seriously today.” You don’t have to battle it or silence it, just distance yourself from it, don’t engage. If it interrupts your thoughts, acknowledge it with a casual, “Not now” and turn your attention elsewhere. This is something to practise daily. What you need to do is have a ready list of other things on which you can concentrate. For example, what sounds can you hear in the room? Outside the room? Notice what your feet feel like on the ground, notice how you are breathing. What I found helpful when dealing with an intrusive thought is whipping out a sketch pad and really concentrating on what an object looked like and trying to draw it as accurately as possible, not to produce a good drawing, but to get lost in the looking.This inner critic convinces you that you are uniquely inadequate, but you are experiencing a typical human struggle. When we judge ourselves harshly, we isolate ourselves, believing we are alone in our suffering. Every woman, every person, has moments or periods of insecurity, self-doubt and shame. Instead of seeing yourself as separate, try to remind yourself that your struggles connect you to the wider human experience. When you feel that inner critic rising, take a breath and say to yourself, “This is hard, but I am not alone in this.” Bringing in warmth rather than punishment is a radical act of self-care and one that will slowly start to loosen the grip of shame. Deep-seated shame, which is a tricky, sticky thing thrives in secrecy and isolation, so talking about it, like you are now, is a powerful antidote. Talk to people you trust. You’ve already taken an important step by writing this email. Work on becoming aware of what feeds your shame, notice what shrinks it. Look at Dr Kristin Neff’s website,self-compassion.org.Every time you treat yourself with a little more kindness, you’re showing your daughter what self-compassion looks like. She doesn’t need a “perfect” mother, she needs one who is learning to befriend herself. Be patient with yourself. This isn’t about flipping a switch and suddenly feeling radiant and self-assured. It’s about chipping away at old beliefs, noticing the critic without becoming it, and learning, slowly and gently, to see yourself with softer eyes.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleAsk PhilippaSelf EsteemPsychologyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The sort of weather that can wreak havoc with dinner plans. Twice this week I have had to make last-minute changes when the temperature dropped.What started out as a light supper of stuffed aubergine ended up being rethought as a more substantial offering, the aubergines layered with haricot beans and chilli-spiked tomatoes under a thyme and breadcrumb crust.Later in the week, my plan for a feta and orange salad – a bit of rather wishful thinking to be honest – had to be quickly reworked into a dish of baked cheese on a bed of sliced blood oranges and bitter salad leaves. Both dishes using the same ingredients but tweaked to suit the changing weather. The cheese was the simplest. A couple of blocks of feta brushed with honey and thyme were baked in foil, so the fragrance wafted up when the parcels were opened. The salty, herb-freckled cooking juices mixed with the sweet juice of the blood oranges. We sponged them up with lumps of sesame bread.The baked aubergine was more suited to a cold day and we dug down through the layers of crisp crumbs and soft, quite-spicy filling for a warming supper. I used gochujang paste for its deep aromatic warmth, but also because that was what was to hand: you could use almost any chilli paste, including harissa or even Sriracha chilli sauce.Every dinner I make right now seems to have a Plan B. Dishes that will work for a blazing afternoon, but can be quickly nudged toward something for a cold night should the need arise. Think light spring soups that will turn into earthy stews with the addition of a can of haricot or butter beans. Grilled sausages that could go into a hotpot with a few sweet onions and some wedges of potato, or roast vegetables that can be rethought as a gratin, its creamy edges bubbling as it is brought from oven to table.Baked feta with blood orangesSalty, chalk-white cheese, honey and sweet oranges. Should you prefer, you could always grill the feta – place the cheese, thyme and honey on a piece of foil and cook under a preheated overhead grill until the surface starts to brown.Serves 2-3.

Place the feta on a sheet of tinfoil large enough to wrap loosely around the cheese. Brush the honey over the surface, then scatter with the thyme. Grind over a little black pepper, then bring the edges of the foil together and scrunch loosely together to form a parcel. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, until soft.Squeeze one of the oranges into a mixing bowl and stir in the vinegar, mustard, a little salt and some more coarsely ground black pepper. With a small whisk or fork, beat in the olive oil. I sometimes make this in a jam jar, shaking the ingredients until they lightly emulsify.Using a very sharp knife, peel the other 2 oranges, making sure to remove all of the white pith. Cut each orange into about 6 thin slices and add to the dressing.Separate the heads of treviso into individual leaves and wash thoroughly. Shake dry, then toss with the oranges, lightly coating them in the dressing.Transfer the leaves and oranges to a serving plate. Lift the cheese from its foil with a fish slice or palette knife, pouring over any honey or juices and place among the leaves and oranges.Aubergine and haricot beans with thyme crumbsView image in fullscreenBean feast: aubergine and haricot beans with thyme crumbs.Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin/The ObserverThe amount of chilli paste you use is up to you – I suggest you taste as you go. I start with 1 level tbsp, then increase it by just a little until the heat level seems right. Much will depend on your taste, but it is wise to assume that the darker red the paste, the hotter it will be. At least, that is my experience. The sugar I include is really just a pinch, but it seems to calm the more aggressive notes of the paste, but leave it out if you wish.Serves 4-6.

Remove the stems from the aubergines. Slice each aubergine in half lengthways, then into 1cm thick slices. Heat an overhead grill.Place the aubergines on a grill pan, in a single layer, then brush generously with oil. Grill them until soft, about 7 or 8 minutes, then turn with kitchen tongs or a palette knife, brush with a little more oil if necessary, and continue grilling until soft.Peel, halve and roughly chop the onions. Warm the oil in a deep, heavy-based casserole, add the onions and let them cook over a low to moderate heat for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until soft and pale gold. Peel, thinly slice and stir in the garlic.Stir in the gochujang and cook briefly, then add the tomatoes and the haricot beans with their canning liquor. Stir in the thyme, a little salt, a good pinch of sugar and the aubergines. Simmer for 10 minutes, then transfer to your baking dish.Set the oven at 200C/gas mark 6.For the crust, process the bread to coarse crumbs in the food processor (or by hand with a coarse-toothed grater). Mix with the thyme leaves and lemon zest. Pour over the olive oil and toss to coat. Scatter over the surface of the beans and tomatoes then bake for 25-30 minutes until the crumb crust is crisp and the filling is bubbling around the edges.Explore more on these topicsFoodNigel Slater recipesrecipesShareReuse this content"

Attacks are ongoing’: how Putin’s envoy played US over UkrainePeter BeaumontWhite House welcome for key member of Russian president’s inner circle raises fears over America’s commitment to peaceSun 6 Apr 2025 02.00 EDTShareKirill Dmitriev’smeetingswith US officials in the White House last week went largely below the radar. And deliberately so.The dapper investment envoy to Russian presidentVladimir Putin, who also serves as a key negotiator for Moscow on Ukraine, posted an image of his flight plan on social media to make the point that a senior sanctioned Russian official was being welcomed by the Trump administration. Otherwise, details of what was discussed remain opaque.The most senior Russian official to visit the US since Moscow’s invasion ofUkrainein 2022, Dmitriev – a member of Putin’s closest inner circle – is well cast to appeal to Trump and an administration whose world view is crudely transactional.The head of Russia’s $10bn sovereign wealth fund, Dmitriev was born in Kyiv during the Soviet era and US-educated, including spending time at Stanford and Harvard Business School.Crucially, it is Dmitriev who has been tasked by Putin with keeping Donald Trump onside amid the US president’s self-describedanger with Russiaover the status of a US mediated “ceasefire” that exists largely in name only amid continuing attacks.All of which, said Dmitriev last week – conforming to a familiar Kremlin playbook – was the fault of everyone but Russia .“Today,” Dmitriev wrote on Telegram on Thursday, “numerous forces interested in maintaining tension stand in the way of restoring constructive cooperation.“These forces are deliberately distorting Russia’s position, trying to disrupt any steps towards dialogue, sparing neither money nor resources for this.”There was little mystery over who he meant by those “forces”: Ukraine and its European allies, some of whose frustration with Russiaspilled over into the openon Friday.View image in fullscreenRussia’s Vladimir Putin, left, with Kirill Dmitriev, head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund.Photograph: Alexei Nikolsky/AP“Our judgment is that Putin continues to obfuscate, continues to drag his feet,” the British foreign secretary, David Lammy, told reporters at Nato headquarters, describing the “ceasefire” and continuing negotiations. He added that while Putin should be accepting a genuine ceasefire, “he continues to bombardUkraine. Its civilian population. Its energy supplies. We see you, Vladimir Putin. We know what you are doing.”Lammy’s comments reflect a widening consensus that the Trump mediated “ceasefire” announced last month – a very partial arrangement at best – has rapidly deflated as it has encountered the reality of a Kremlin that seems determined to continue fighting.What limited optimism existed in some quarters in Ukraine that talks might lead to a meaningful track to peace have long since evaporated to be replaced by fears that Russia might bepreparing a major new offensivefor the spring and summer months.Envisioned as a short-term arrangement covering only a small part of the conflict, it encouraged both sides to refrain from strikes on energy and other civil infrastructure, and in theBlack Sea maritime theatre, leaving the war to rage on unchecked along the vast, snaking main line of contact in eastern Ukraine.And of those two issues, strikes on energy infrastructure have been the most significant, with both sides accusing the other of breaches of the agreement over energy sites.As experts have noted, the commitments in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, were not only vague but lacked a mechanism to verify and enforce a truce.“There’s no ceasefire,” observes Phillips O’Brien, a professor of strategic studies at the university of St Andrews.“Attacks are ongoing on energy sites, and the Black Sea part of the deal is small beer. A real ceasefire would mean there was no fighting along the line of the contact.”Instead, O’Brien interprets the positive tenor of statements that emerged from Jeddah and subsequently as being as much about Kyiv and Moscow protecting their positions with Trump than marking any real progress towards peace.“Russia didn’t want to go against Trump openly. Diplomatically it would be foolish to say they don’t want a ceasefire, so they go along with the pretence, not least the Kremlin, which still believes there are gains to be made on the battlefield,” O’Brien said.Orysia Lutsevych, the head of the Ukraine Forum at the Chatham House thinktank, is equally forthright: “We have no ceasefire. Period. And we have no commitment from Russia as they put conditions on even the partial ceasefire in the western part of the Black Sea, conditioning it on sanctions relief, including from EU banking sanctions.“The Russian offer to America is ‘stop wasting money on a war Ukraine can’t win so let’s make money together’. And as part of that push they will try to put the blame on Ukraine for being obstructive.“The Americans have not approached these talks from the point of view of [them being verifiable] and implementable, or in the knowledge of Russia’s history of violations. What is striking is how they have already brought Putin in from the cold without Russia making any gesture of goodwill.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Regime change, by any other name.And Dmitriev’s role as one of Putin’s key spoilers has not gone unnoticed, as he secured an invite from Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, who appears to have been wrong footed by Putin and his inner circle at every turn.Earlier this week the Institute for the Study of War noted Dmitriev’s comments to the BBC’s Russian Serviceon 30 March suggesting an impossible sequencing going forward: that “US-Russian economic cooperation should be a primary focus if the United States wants to end the war in Ukraine, but that such cooperation would only begin after the conclusion of peace negotiations”.To that end Russian officials have been dangling the carrot of potentialUS-Russian rare earth mining projectsto undermine Trump’s rare earths deal he has beentrying to impose on Ukraine.If Russia’s tactics seem familiar – using the auspices of a ceasefire to advance its interest militarily and diplomatically – it is, analysts point out, because they are similar to the negotiations in Minsk a decade ago and during Syria’s civil war.And while Trump himself acknowledged on 25 March that Russia may be “dragging their feet” in peace talks to allow Russian forces to capture more territory, it appears to many observers that Trump remains more interested in courting Russia than pursuing an equitable and lasting peace.The most important stumbling block, however, may be the one described by Richard Haass, a former US diplomat and past president of the US Council on Foreign Relations.“The biggest question remains US policy,” wrote Haass recently. “The Trump administration has used a combination of pressure and incentives to persuade the two sides to stop fighting. But its approach has been skewed toward offering benefits to Russia while bringing heavy pressure to bear on Ukraine.”And while some – including Zelenskyy – have suggested that Trump could bring Putin to heel within weeks if he wants to, so far there has been little evidence to suggest either urgency or a desire to act.So the war goes on.Explore more on these topicsUkraineThe ObserverVladimir PutinRussiaDonald TrumpUS foreign policyEuropeanalysisShareReuse this content"

But the fallout from the US president’s recent actions threatens to wreak havoc on the flagbearer of the UK’s automotive industry.Last week, Donald Trump announced new import taxes of 25% on cars and car parts coming into the US in a move the president said would drive growth and spur on investment. The Institute for Public Policy Research warns this could be costly, with25,000 UK jobsat risk.Yesterday,Jaguar Land Rover(JLR) announced it would “pause” shipments to the US as it worked to “address the new trading terms”. JLR sold about 100,000 cars in the US last year, a critical market for the company. The Solihull plant that makes the Range Rover employs more than 9,000. The new Jaguar Type 00, which was launched in Miami in December, will be made in the West Midlands from 2026.In Solihull, everyone knows somebody at JLR. As news filtered through to the high street aboutChina’s retaliatory tariffson Friday, a local man, Wayne Kelly, said he felt it was too early for judgments on the potential impact. “I think JLR might lay a few people off. But I believe that if you’re going to buy a Range Rover and you’re American, you’ll pay the extra money anyway, because you’ve got enough to afford it. I don’t think it will affect it, maybe a little bit, but not so great as if it [were] mid-range or low-range vehicles.”View image in fullscreenThe Stamping Operations area of The Jaguar and Land Rover plant in Solihull in the West Midlands of England.Photograph: Richard Saker/The ObserverProf David Bailey at the nearby Birmingham Business school describes the trade war as “nothing short of a perfect storm” for the European and UK auto industry, whichwas already being squeezed by falling sales in China, stagnant demand in Europe, and slow electrical vehicle (EV) (EV) take-up.“Much of UK auto is already operating well below capacity and the tariffs will be a further hit for a struggling industry,” Bailey said. “Production cuts and job losses are likely. The UK government has yet to unveil its industrial strategy – this is urgently needed to help shore up the industry.”Bailey believes JLR may struggle without the option of US-based assembly operations – in contrast to German brands such as Mercedes, BMW and Audi, who are looking to build on their manufacturing presence in the States, which, he says, is what Trump hopes for.He also feels estimates of jobs at risk in UK auto due to the new Trump’s tariffs are underestimated. “It doesn’t account for tipping points as plants slip below viability levels, hence may be shut completely, not just downsized. Plus the supply chain may be fatally hit if the knock-on effect is that foreign-owned suppliers pull out of the UK as assembly volumes shrink.”In 2024, the UK exported £8.3bn of cars to the US, with figures from 2023the previous year showing the West Midlands wasresponsible for 51%of all auto exports to America. According torecent analy­sisby the City-Region Economic Development Institute (City-REDI) the tariffs are estimated to cost the UK £9.8bn in GDP between 2025 and 2030, putting 137,000 jobs at risk. The data also shows that the West Midlands will be hit hardest, losing £6.2bn in GDP, 62% of the total impact on the UK.On Friday, JLR seemed defiant. A spokesperson said: “Our luxury brands have global appeal and our business is resilient, accustomed to changing market conditions. Our priorities now are delivering for our clients around the world and addressing these new US trading terms.”An updated statement on Saturday yesterday explained: “As we work to address the new trading terms with our business partners, we are taking some short-term actions including a shipment pause in April, as we develop our mid- to longer-term plans.”Des Quinn, the Unite union national officer for the automotive sector, told theObserverthat transformative change is necessary to help insulate the industry and its workers.View image in fullscreenCraig Donaldson at his Flowers of Solihull market stall.Photograph: Richard Saker/The Observer“Urgent action is required following the previous government’s lack of industrial strategy and planning for a transition to EVs that reverses the decline in the automotive sector. The likes of Tesla cannot be allowed to benefit from tariffs in their home market while enjoying subsidies through selling EV credits in the UK.“The automotive sector is the jewel in the crown of UK manufacturing and exports. A level playing field must be created in the absence of a free trade agreement to protect the industry and jobs.”Florist and owner of Flowers of Solihull, Craig Donaldson, said it would be a shame if the cuts were to result in lay-offs. He has two close friends who are employed at the plant. “They’re in their 50s and have worked there since leaving school. So it would be sad news.”Donaldson’s family business has been running for 40 years and he joined full-time after leaving the local Alderbrook school at 16. He has weathered the impact of Brexit and Defra inspection costs on flowers he buys from Holland. “We’re very lucky – Solihull is quite an affluent area. It’s a nice town for shopping,” he says.He hopes the JLR plant does not take a major hit.“JLR is important to Solihull because it employs a lot of people that live here, as well as on the outskirts. It would affect the area massively.”Explore more on these topicsWest MidlandsThe ObserverDonald TrumpAutomotive industryEconomicsJaguar Land RoverfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now, he fears Trump-backed deportationMaanvi SinghSun 6 Apr 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 6 Apr 2025 12.50 EDTShareIt finally happened while he was waiting to get his hair cut.Alberto Lovo Rojas, an asylum seeker fromNicaragua, had been feeling uneasy for weeks, worried thatimmigrationofficials would arrest him any moment. But he had pushed the worry aside as irrational – after all, he had a permit to legally work in the US, and he had been using an app to check in monthly with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice).Still, something felt off. TheTrump administrationhad promised mass deportations, and in the weeks sinceDonald Trump’s inauguration, Ice had asked him to do extra check-ins each weekend. “I even messaged the Ice office through my app, to ask if something was wrong,” Rojas said.His last check-in with Ice was on 5 February – all normal. On 8 February, they came for him.As deportations ramp up, immigrants increasingly fear Ice check-ins: ‘All bets are off’Read moreHe was outside Great Clips in the Lincoln Heights neighborhood of Spokane, Washington. The barbershop had been crowded, so he put his name down for a cut and decided to wait in his car.Hours later, he was moved into the north-west detention center in Tacoma, awaiting deportation to Nicaragua – which he fled in 2018 amid a violent crackdown against nationwide anti-governmentprotests. Rojas fears he’ll be targeted again.“I’m afraid to go back, I’m afraid for my life,” he told the Guardian. “I’m afraid I will never see my children again.”Rojas, 42, is one of potentially hundreds of people who have been detained in recent weeks despite complying with Ice requirements to regularly check-in. Ice does not appear to keep count of how many people it has arrested at check-ins. But the Guardian has estimated, based on arrest data from the first four weeks of theTrump administration, that about 1,400 arrests – 8% of the nearly 16,500 arrests in the administration’s first month – have occurred during or right after people checked in with the agency.View image in fullscreenAlberto Lovo Rojas.Photograph: Courtesy of  Dora MoralesLawyers and immigration advocates told the Guardian they believe that in order to oblige the president’s demand for mass arrests and deportation, immigration officials are reaching for the “low-hanging fruit” – people that Ice had previously released from custody while they pursued asylum or other immigration cases in a backlogged immigration court system.Most of these people do not have criminal histories and have dutifully been complying with the government’s orders to routinely report to immigration officials. Some have pending asylum cases, or are appealing their deportation orders. Others, like Rojas, had been denied their claims to stay in the US, but were released on supervision.In Rojas’s case, he was allowed to stay in Spokane with his wife and children – who had pending asylum cases – and apply yearly for a permit to legally work.“I just don’t understand,” Rojas’s wife, Dora Morales said. “Why would they want to arrest him now?Rojas had leftNicaraguawith his uncle in September 2018.Venezuelans with legal status are being illegally detained in the US, lawyers sayRead moreBoth men had participated in Nicaragua’s April rebellion of 2018, a movement that started among university students. The movement was incited by unpopularchanges to the social security system, but quickly grew into a massive movement calling for democratic reforms.Government forces immediately responded with crushing brutality, shooting at young protesters. “I felt a lot of pain, sadness to see mothers crying for their children,” Rojas said. He felt called to join the cause.Send us a tipIf you are connected to someone who has been deported or is in fear of deportation and have information you’d like to share securely with the Guardian, please use a non-work device to call or text immigration reporter Maanvi Singh via theSignal messaging appat 929-418-7275.Rojas was well-known in his neighborhood, and he started to help organize protests and arrange transportation for those interested in attending.But as the demonstrations grew, so did the backlash. Police and pro-government paramilitary groups killed hundreds of students, human rights activists and journalists. His uncle was beaten and shot twice by Nicaraguan paramilitary officers.They had to leave, Rojas said. They went into hiding and eventually made their way out of the country, through Honduras and Guatemala before arriving at the US-Mexico border.“I never broke an immigration law,” Rojas said. He did exactly as he was directed – waiting a week in a notorioushielera– a frigid Customs and Border Protection holding cell where newly arrived immigrants slept on concrete floors. Then he was transferred to Phoenix, Arizona; flown to a detention center in Memphis, Tennessee; then Mississippi, where officials interviewed him to assess his eligibility for asylum in the US; and finally sent to Louisiana while his case was assessed.In July of 2019, a judge denied his asylum application, and he remained in detention while his lawyers appealed. And then – finally – in May 2020, as Covid-19 rapidly spread through the facility where he was held, Rojas’s fate changed. Following a class-action lawsuit, a federal judge ruled that Ice must consider the release of all detainees whose age or health conditions put them at elevated risk of Covid infection.Rojas is missing a kidney – a complication from a car accident when he was a child – and was especially at risk of complications from a coronavirus infection. So they let him go. “It was such a miracle,” he said.View image in fullscreenAlberto Lovo Rojas and Dora Morales.Photograph: Courtesy of  Dora MoralesWhile Rojas was in detention, Morales and the couple’s two young sons, Alberto Jr and Matteo, had managed to escape Nicaragua as well. The family reunited in Spokane. He found work in construction, then on a ranch – and eventually, he was able to get a job as a mechanic at the Corwin Ford dealership in Spokane.“It was almost like some stereotypical, all-American dream. I mean, he was literally working for Ford!” said his friend Lizzy Myers. “He had just gotten this new lease on life, and he was really doing well.”Rojas and Morales had met – years ago – at church. He fell in love with her singing voice, and she managed to chat him up by asking for his help with English. In Spokane, the couple were once again able to attend mass together.Rojas began playing pick-up soccer with a local league. He’s been coaching his eldest in the sport as well. “And they are both improving so much – they are really getting quite good,” Rojas said. Last year, the family welcomed their newest member – baby Santiago – whom they baptized in Spokane’s St Peter church.Rojas’ lawyers reassured him that so long as he complied with Ice’s orders to routinely check in, and applied to renew his work permit each year, he’d be fine.“When the president won the election, he said he would arrest the criminals,” Rojas said. “I was worried. But also, I am not a criminal.”But then, Trump took office and rolled back a Biden-era memo prioritizing the deportation of people with criminal records or who posed threats to public safety. Now, all immigrants in the US without a legal status are subject to arrest, including those who have been checking in and cooperating with Ice. To meet the president’s goal for “mass deportations”, immigration officials have become more indiscriminate in their enforcement, a Guardiananalysislast month found.The US arrested more immigrants in February 2025 than any month in the last seven years. Still, no one in his community believed that Rojas would be one of them.“We were all just shocked,” said Susy Glamuzina, his close friend and co-worker. Glamuzina had rushed to Morales’s side as soon as Rojas was arrested and had been driving the family over to Tacoma to visit Alberto in detention. “I just thought, you know, he had a baby who was born here,” she said.View image in fullscreenAlberto Lovo Rojas and his soccer team.Photograph: Courtesy of  Dora MoralesTheir boss reassured Alberto he’d hold Rojas’s job until he returned, and offered to pitch in for his legal fees. Marcus Riccelli, a Democratic state senator representing Spokane, who played soccer in the same league as Rojas, heard about the case, offered to help find Rojas legal representation and called in a favor to help his family file paperwork to delay his deportation. Meanwhile, friends have jumped in to help Morales with childcare and connect their children – who had been struggling since Rojas’s arrest – with counselors to help them process the trauma.Glamuzina and his friends have already planned a party for when he returns home. “Alberto is really missed. We want him back. And I’ll tell you – if they need any personal testimonies for his case, I can have 20 people in Tacoma in a heartbeat.”AGoFundMe pagefor his legal fees started by Myers has so far raised nearly $17,000.The family has been using the funds to pay for legal fees, and their lawyers have filed a motion to reopen Rojas’ asylum case. They’re also hoping Rojas will be released soon.He worries about health complications due to his missing kidney if he were to contract any infections while in detention.Morales has chided Rojas for not eating enough. Mealtimes in the detention centre have been irregular, and Rojas has not been in the mood to eat.I was a British tourist trying to leave America. Then I was detained, shackled and sent to an immigration detention centreRead more“I see my husband is getting thinner in detention,” she said. “And I told him, I don’t want to see you thinner, because it would make me sadder than I already am!”It has been difficult, for both of them, not to think about what will happen if he is deported.Morales said news that Rojas has been detained in the US has already spread through their town in Nicaragua, and she worries that government-appointed neighborhood committees will be waiting, ready to alert authorities of Rojas’s arrival. If he isn’t imprisoned or worse, Morales said she worries he could end up exiled – the Nicaraguan government stripped citizenship from hundreds of opponents.“I am preparing for the worst,” Rojas said. “I am praying and I am preparing myself spiritually for what is to come.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsTrump administrationMigrationNicaraguaWest CoastWashington stateDonald TrumpfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And, ultimately, a trio who flew too close to the sun, only to crash back down to Earth.The downfallof the Alexander twins, Alon and Oren, and their elder sibling Tal, is reflected in their current residence, a federal jail in New York ahead of their trial next year. They face charges including rape, sexual assault and the sexual trafficking of dozens of victims.Jail is a world away, in every respect, from their affluent playboy lifestyle in south Florida’s glitziest city, where many of their alleged crimes took place and where prosecutors say they began their almost quarter-century reign of depravity.It started with parties while the trio attended Miami’s Michael M Krop senior high school, when, according to a lengthyVanity Fair accountof the brothers’ activities published this month, teenage girls were plied with drugs and alcohol and would wake up with unclear recollections of being raped by multiple people.These gatherings, the report said, often took place in waterfrontMiamiBeach mansions owned by the Alexander family or their wealthy friends, where teenage attendees would arrive in convoys of luxury vehicles, such as BMWs and Cadillacs, and with porn playing on back-seat DVD systems.After university, according to aneight-page justice department indictmentfiled in the southern district of New York, the brothers perfected their technique. They split their time between Miami, New York and other upscale locations such as the Hamptons and Martha’s Vineyard.Using their money and influence once again, prosecutors said, they built their own sex-trafficking network at a time when Tal, 38, and Oren, 37, were forging successful careers in real estate. The men were first representatives for the high-end firm Douglas Elliman, then moved on with their own, now defunct brokerage, Official, that sold condos for tens of millions of dollars apiece.Afawning New York Times profilein 2022 portrayed a lifestyle of members’ clubs, expensive restaurants and penthouse living. Celebrity clientswere reportedto include Ye, Jared and Ivanka Trump, the rapper and producer Timbaland, the supermodel Adriana Lima and the fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger.Back in Miami, the hedonism and revelry continued unchecked. The brothers were spotted regularly on private jets and super yachts, in supercharged sports cars and “bringing the party and eye candy wherever they went”, according to Vanity Fair. It noted that Alon, who was not part of his siblings’ real estate business, was “frequently along for the ride”.All the while, according toa press releaseaccompanying the justice department indictment, the three “worked together and with others to engage in sex trafficking, including by repeatedly drugging, sexually assaulting, and raping dozens of female victims.“[They] used deception, fraud, and coercion to cause victims to travel with them or meet them in private locations for various trips and events. The Alexander brothers used the promise of luxury experiences, travel, and accommodations to lure and entice women to these events, and then, on multiple occasions, forcibly raped and sexually assaulted women who attended.“At times, multiple men, including one or more of the brothers, participated in these assaults. In some instances, the defendants physically restrained and held down their victims during the rapes and sexual assaults and ignored screams and explicit requests to stop.”Some of the women, prosecutors said, were recruited out of state, or abroad, and flew to Florida andNew York, thus introducing sexual trafficking to the list of charges.One specific allegation, part of a succession of civil lawsuits by accusers filed last year that set the FBI and other federal investigators on a path to criminal charges in December, is from an unnamed woman. She said she met Alon Alexander on a dating app and traveled to Florida with two friends to celebrate New Year in December 2016.She accepted an invitation from him to attend a barbecue and pool party at his “luxury condo” in Miami Beach,her lawsuit says, but was greeted by Alon and Oren Alexander, and a man they introduced as a cousin, locked in a bedroom and raped by the brothers as the cousin held her down.The experience, the court document says, showed their “complete and utter disregard for the lifetime of trauma, shame, emotional turmoil they imposed” and left her “forever changed and fearful of the demonic defendants”.Evidence recovered during FBI searches of Alexander properties immediately before their December 2024 arrests included videotapes the brothers allegedly recorded of some of their encounters, which theykept as “trophies”.Prosecutors say they have spoken with more than 60 women who allege they were assaulted by one or more of the brothers, or their friends and acquaintances, and hope publicity might encourage more to step forward.All three brothers, through lawyers, have consistently denied all of the allegations against them, and say any sexual encounters were fully consensual. If convicted, they face sentences ranging from 15 years to life.To observers, the Alexanders’ story has parallels in other well-publicized cases in which accused sexual predators have used wealth, power and influence to cover up crimes and aggressively pursue their accusers. Among those cited areHarvey WeinsteinandSean “Diddy” Combs, who is incarcerated at thesame Brooklyn detention centeras the Alexanders and Luigi Mangione, the alleged murderer of the UnitedHealthcare chief executive, Brian Thompson.“They were raised as very wealthy, entitled kids, and no one ever really said no to them. From a young age they were able to have whatever they wanted, which eventually started moving into sexual things,” saidLeslie Dobson, a clinical and forensic psychologist who has followed the Alexanders’ case closely.“What makes things even more twisted is accusations the twins were having sex together with women. It shows the severity of their entitlement, how much money they had, how many people were stroking their egos, how narcissistic and psychopathic they are, and that it morphed into sadism and this complete disregard for human emotion.“Yet they could easily compartmentalize it and go back to their wives.”Dobson said that the brothers’ wealth, with parents who are alsofacing a lawsuitfrom five women who allege they enabled their sons to “abuse, assault, batter, drug, and rape”, gave them a sense of invincibility.“They were going about it in a way that they didn’t think they were going to get caught, because they were spending money on these parties and events, and on these individuals, and also on protection and bodyguards and safety,” she said.“Other people, once you need that level of stimulation, you’re going to get arrested, you’re going to get caught, because the things you are going to do are going to be really blatantly illegal. But if you can just order someone, like Uber Eats and it gets delivered to you in a limousine, it’s a completely different picture.”Although much of what the Alexanders are accused of took place in Miami, they may never face justice there. They were extradited to New York in January with federal charges taking precedence over state, and it is uncertain when or if Florida authorities will move to return them.The Miami-Dade state attorney’s office did not return a request for comment.For observers such as Dobson, who has more than 20 years of experience looking into the minds of rich and powerful criminal defendants, the sordid tale of the Alexanders and its glitzy Miami backdrop is ultimately just another one at the intersection of celebrity, dollars and depravity.“The [civil] allegations can be paid off very easily, and people can be manipulated, as we’re seeing in the Sean Combs case, people are taking their claims away,” she said.“So there probably is some hope that money, their money, can free you over time.”The criminal charges, she said, are a different story: “Money buys you love, until it buys you prison.”Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organizations. In the US, Rainn offers support on 800-656-4673. In the UK, Rape Crisis offers support on 0808 500 2222. In Australia, support is available at 1800Respect (1800 737 732).

The Wallis Annenberg wildlife crossing is the largestwildlifebridge in the world at 210ft long and 174ft wide, and this week it’s had help taking shape: soil.“This is the soul of the project,” says Beth Pratt, the regional executive director, California, at the NationalWildlifeFederation, who has worked on making the crossing become a reality over the last 13 years. She says she’s seen many milestones, like the 26m pounds of concrete poured to create the structure, but this one is special.Fleeing mountain lions and scorched earth: can wildlife survive California’s wildfires?Read more“To be able to put my hand in that soil and toss it on and know that we’ll be putting milkweedplantsthat will flourish for monarch butterflies, or picturing the first mountain lion paw print on that soil,” she says, fills her with hope. “It is wonderful to watch this habitat take shape.”The plot is a native wildlife habitat that connects two parts of the Santa Monica mountain range, with the hopes of saving creatures – from the famous local mountain lions, down to frogs and insects – from being crushed by cars on one of the nation’s busiest roadways.With nearly an acre of local plants on either side and thick vegetated sound walls 12ft high to dampen light and noise for nocturnal animals as they slip across, it’s an unprecedented feat of engineering. Imagination, too.The project began in 2022 through a public-private partnership that brought together many organizations to cover the $92m in costs, according to Caltrans, the state transportation department. Research shows that wildlife crossings save money because it limits animal interactions with vehicles.View image in fullscreenBeth Pratt shows soil to be used on the wildlife crossing, on 31 March.Photograph: Tommaso Boddi/Getty Images for #SaveLACougars Campaign and the National Wildlife Federation“As soil gets placed over the bridge, we’re one step closer to reconnecting wildlife with habitat that’s been divided for generations,” said California’s governor, Gavin Newsom,in a statement. “We’re not only making habitats whole again, we’re making our roads safer.”Most wildlife bridges and underpasses around the world are made of cement and steel. But this one is designed to seamlessly glide into the environment on both sides – as well as send a message to the humans who pass under it each day. After all, it was humans who sliced the habitat into pieces, segmenting wildlife into small islands with lines of concrete and asphalt. Now, humans can be part of the solution.The detail in the project reflects years of expert consultants in research and design. The soil itself is engineered – a combination of light rocks, horticultural subsoil and topsoil, enriched with compost. Then it gets some additions to match the biology of local soils, so the bridge can match the environment around it. That means cultivating mycorrhizal fungi, bacteria and other microorganisms, and then reintroducing those to the soil profile into the plants.Doing so creates a “living and breathing portion of the soil layer that supports the plant material”, says Robert Rock, a landscape architect with Living Futures in Chicago who led the design.Covering the entire surface of the crossing will require approximately 6,000 cubic yards of soil and will take several weeks to complete. After the soil is in place, workers will plant 5,000 native plants, including sages, buckwheat, milkweed, sunflowers, deerweed, penstemon, toyon and laurel sumac. As long as the weather cooperates, officials say that they can begin planting in May.The project has its own native plant nursery, funded by the National Wildlife Federation, which has shepherded the hand collection of more than 1.1m seeds of 30 different hyper-local species from the five miles around the site, growing plants in 1-gallon pots. Rock says there are thousands of different plants in the nursery – but the next phase will include 10 times that many.View image in fullscreenA rendering of what the wildlife crossing will look like when completed.Illustration: Rock Design Associates and National Wildlife FederationWhen it comes to pressures from fires or rain events, Rock says that leaning into nature is the best way to handle a changing climate. By using native plants – and keeping out invasives such as mustard – the area will be more resilient to any climate onslaughts. When the project is completed, stormwater from the structure will be piped back into the landscape.The project aims to complete its work by the end of 2026.The crossing is not just a structure – it is also a symbol of the connection between humans and their wildlife, even in one of the most urban areas in the country. “It’s not just a bridge that cars drive over,” says Pratt. “This is a real extension of the Santa Monica mountains ecosystem. And to me, that’s hopeful – even a freeway is redeemable.”Explore more on these topicsLos AngelesWildlifeInfrastructurePlantsAnimalsWest CoastfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But then came cancer and a double mastectomy – and she realised she was losing something she lovedSun 6 Apr 2025 02.00 EDTShareLet me tell you about my breasts, of blessed memory. That’s not something I would have said while I still had them. I was quite prim, you see, and maybe I still am, but a double mastectomy gives you license to say “‘breast” over and over again, without the usual consequences. My breasts were real, and they were spectacular.That’s aSeinfeldreference, if you’re not familiar.Seinfeldwas one of the shows that I watched often in my adolescent years when my breasts first asserted themselves. It was among our key texts. We were in late-20th-century America, my breasts and I. It was a time and place that taught me that women’s bodies – breasts, specifically – were objects of desire, and jokes, and danger.Friends,Baywatch,Melrose Place.Clueless,Scream. Britney, Beyoncé. Monica Lewinsky.My husband says I’ve looked 35 my whole life, and reviewing my high-school photo albums you can see where he’s coming from. I understood that my young breasts could be problematic, so I practised self-defence by staying buttoned-up. I was more likely to be mistaken for a substitute teacher by a younger student (this happened) than nominated to be the prom queen (this, obviously, didn’t). The vibe in my state school was quite conservative. There was a significant contingent of evangelical Christians, as well as a cohort of kids with laser focus on the Ivy League. “Going to Harvard” was our hyper-local slang for sexual intercourse. Two premier teen achievements.I did not go to Harvard. I was not that kind of girl. For university, my breasts and I crossed the border to Canada, where the drinking age was 18, not 21. We wore sweatshirts that referenced the Harvard of Canada, and there was a strip club called Le Super Sexe a few hundred metres from the library. In Montreal I began to explore the possibilities that my breasts had to offer. Which is to say, I started wearing what was known as a “skank tank” out to nightclubs with my similarly bosomed friends, where older men would buy us, or our breasts, dollar shots topped with whipped cream. They were called “blowjobs”. You drank them with your hands behind your back.View image in fullscreen‘For all the trouble my breasts had caused me, I still wanted to hang on to them.’Photograph: Rebecca Miller/The ObserverMy undergraduate boyfriend, who I dated for a couple of years, told me my breasts were perfect, unlike my face, which he said he’d had to get used to. It was true that my breasts were a source of great, albeit private, pleasure. Back home for the summer, I considered filling out a job application at Hooters (I’d heard the tips were good), but opted for Starbucks instead.I moved to London as a postgraduate. Here, my breasts got me jobs working behind bars when my pint-pulling experience (nil) would have disqualified me. While I tried to make my mark in journalism that paid in exposure, I made my rent slinging booze in tight, uniform baby tees. When a punter in one particularly low establishment grabbed my breasts, I pushed him away, but didn’t complain. I needed the work more than I needed the trouble.Sometimes, my breasts got me positive attention, too. Having parted with the boyfriend with whom I’d moved to London, I longed to fall in love again. This wasn’t easy. On nights out, when I chose to wear a top my friends referred to as “man-catching”, it was easy enough to make eye contact with the chap of my choice and reel him in. It was harder, though, to meet someone who wanted to stick around, who wanted to get to know me well after he’d gotten to know my breasts.My career progressed in fits and starts. Once, twice, three times distinguished male editors offered to help me with my career, but then asked to discuss that career in pubs or private members clubs over glasses of wine. I went for the meetings and then I didn’t follow up because I couldn’t handle the subtext. Maybe some women were able to handle it, I thought, and that made me envy and hate them. Sometimes I tried to talk with people close to me about these distressing encounters. Quite often, “What were you wearing?” was the response. I knew this didn’t mean that I had displayed a risky amount of ankle.I gave up on my dream of making a living with writing alone and I got a job in advertising. Not an industry known for its progressive attitude towards women, but at 30, I thought I was too old for my breasts to be of such compelling interest. Alas, come the office Christmas party, I found myself on the dancefloor with a colleague all of a sudden twisting my nipples through the fabric of my dress. “This is an issue of consent versus non-consent,” the big boss told me when I made a formal complaint. I struggled to envision the breasts that would agree to it, the person attached to them. Some months later, I quit and moved abroad. My breasts and I were sick of England.Breastfeeding, I thought, would be the resolution. Why had we shared all of those years of struggle, my breasts and I, if not to nourish my children? I was 37 when I had my first baby, with the Tinder date of my dreams. On our first date, in Brooklyn, I apologised for talking too much. “I could listen to you forever,” he said. OK! We got married within a year. I was pregnant a year after that. In the final weeks I marvelled after a shower at just how large my breasts had become, unfathomably large with nipples like saucers. Sandwich plates? They – we – were ready.Of course, it didn’t go well. My impression is that this is the case for most new mothers; that it goes badly for so many of us at first, but somehow I only heard from the ones who found it wonderful and natural and easy. Maybe they’re the only ones I paid attention to? Perhaps the reason for breastfeeding attrition is that it’s often horrible.At my son’s one-month appointment the doctor declared him perilously thin. I could not understand it: I was feeding him constantly, in debilitating pain. The night before his father had brought him to me for yet another feed and I recoiled. “See a lactation consultant,” the doctor said, and that was it. No other advice. Not, for example, a recommendation for formula. It was the lowest moment of my life. My breasts had betrayed us both.The lactation consultant diagnosed me with a serious nipple infection and a circulation problem, and put me on a gruelling boot camp-style routine of feeding and pumping and feeding and pumping. Six days later the baby and I turned it around. Easy. It had only mentally and physically destroyed me. In time, I became the kind of mother who could sit in a café and whip out a tit to feed my baby without fear or shame. When a man changed his seat to avoid the scene, I thought:Serves you right. He wasn’t a specific problem, but he symbolised one.Returning to work at six months postpartum (a generous leave for America), I hooked myself up to the office pump and placed my little bags of milk in the fridge, neatly labelled with my baby’s name. It felt bad, but I did it until my boy passed his first birthday. I did it again, for my second child. She didn’t share her brother’s initial feeding difficulties, but at nine months she started refusing the milk I pumped. Insulting. I stopped pumping, but continued to nurse her at home. She bit and pinched me. She didn’t want it any more. A week before her first birthday, I went on a business trip and stopped cold turkey. The last of my breast milk washed down the drain in a shower at a chic hotel in Santa Monica. I was happy to see it go.“It’s like havinga mole removed” is one thing my breast surgeon said to me that I’ll never forget, one remark among many that I heard and noted during what some might call “my breast cancer journey”. I’d rather not. That’s just my feeling. I understood what the surgeon meant, from a physiological perspective – compared to a surgery involving sawing of bone and severing of viscera, it would be a surface wound. And yet.For all the trouble that my breasts had caused me over the years, I wanted to hang on to them. We were one and the same. But here was the biggest problem of all: cancer. I was 41 and it was caught early. I’d started mammograms young, a gift of my genetics, which were programmed for me to have cancer at some point, in some bodily location. I knew it was coming, but I wasn’t ready for that time and that place. The cancer was just a twinkle on the image when it showed up. Good cancer to get, if you are going to get cancer. (Ideally, you would not get cancer). Mine was the earliest kind of cancer, but widespread, which is why I did not need chemotherapy or radiation, but ended up in line for a double mastectomy.I lived in America now, with fancy health insurance, which meant it all happened fast. I had six weeks to decide what my new “breasts” would look like. Now, I could choose. I could have perfect breasts! And, of course, in that moment I knew that the only breasts that I wanted were the ones I already had, enormous and sagging after all of that breastfeeding, floppy and pendulous, 32G, and mine. All of a sudden, I realised how much I loved them, how much we’d been through, how much I’d envisioned us growing old together. Now, I’d be leaving them behind, replacing them with a senseless simulacrum.In the days leading up to the surgery I attempted to preempt our physical detachment with an emotional one. It felt like the end of university, when my flatmates and I became short with each other, unkind, as if that would protect us from the awful loss of moving out and onwards with our lives. What were my breasts good for, anyway? I strapped them into an uncomfortable sports bra and went to the gym, observed how they felt when I jumped rope. Hugged my children. Wondered how my new hug would feel.On the day before the operation, I went to a clinic to have radioactive dye injected into my armpit, to trace any sign that the cancer had travelled into the lymph nodes (it hadn’t, thank heavens). Lying on the table, I was instructed to rub the area with a circular motion for 10 minutes. This is so tedious, I thought to myself, but then I felt so tender: this was the last full day we’d have together, my breasts and me. In the changing room I took a photo. I – we – looked beautiful, and whole. The next day, we parted.I still look like I have breasts. In clothes, at least. When you have breast cancer, and people know you’ve had breast cancer, they look at your breasts. They can’t help themselves. A quick glance down, and then up again. Sheepish. I don’t mind too much. It harkens back to our heyday, my late breasts and me. What’s in my chest now are silicone implants, filled with saline. I can feel my whole rib cage beneath them. If I jump, I can sometimes hear them slosh. Sometimes I forget they’re there. Sometimes I go outside on a cold day and wait for my nipples to harden, but they don’t, because I don’t have nipples.My new breasts are much smaller than my natural ones. That’s what I asked for. They’re fine; that’s what I say if anyone wonders how I feel. They’re fine, I say. They’re fake and they’re unremarkable. They’re not my breasts. I miss them.Breasts: A Relatively Brief Relationship by Jean Hannah Edelsteinis published by Phoenix at £12.

Mistakes can be made… But you are really not prepared to say that any mistake [was made] here, are you?”Michael Mansfield QC put this question toCressida Dick– then deputy assistant commissioner at the Metropolitan police – at the inquest into the death ofJean Charles de Menezes, a young man who, 20 years ago this summer, was shot dead at Stockwell station in south London by Met firearms officers. The inquest took place in 2008, three years after his shooting on the morning of 22 July 2005, which was 15 days after the 7/7 bombings in London and one day after copycat bombers had tried and failed to detonate more explosives on the transport system and then fled. De Menezes was a 27-year-old Brazilian man living in London, an electrician on his way to work, with a travel card in his pocket and a copy of the free newspaperMetro,which he’d just picked up, tucked under his arm. A man completely unconnected to terrorism, terrorists, bombs, extremism or fundamentalism. A man not carrying a bag or rucksack. A man wearing jeans and a thin denim jacket.It’s worth noting that the question was being asked after two inquiries by the IPCC (Independent Police Complaints Commission) into the shooting had identified numerous changes it felt needed to be made to police procedures in the wake of the tragedy. And after the Met had been found guilty and fined £175,000 under the Health and Safety at Work Act, for “failing to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of Jean Charles de Menezes”.Representing the family at the inquest, Mansfield asked Dick the question because she had been in charge of the surveillance operation that had been tracking De Menezes that morning, after he’d emerged from a block of flats in south London. Twenty one Scotia Road was an address connected to one of the fugitive terrorists. De Menezes lived at No 17.View image in fullscreenCressida Dick, who was in charge of the operation that ended in the death of De Menezes, in 2008.Photograph: Stephen Hird/PADick, who was later made commissioner of theMetropolitan police, the most senior police officer in the country, and then in 2019 a Dame Commander, pushed back in the courtroom, strongly denying that any mistakes had been made during the operation. Her only concession was to say: “…in any operation some things that in an ideal world would happen, don’t happen.”The inquest showed that the surveillance operation had been confused and rushed from the start – with officers in the wrong place at the wrong time. Mansfield asked her why the firearms officers who were needed to stop and challenge the “suspect” (De Menezes, mistakenly identified as a missing terrorist) were “playing catch up” all that morning? They were still being briefed at a police station as late as 9am, he pointed out, and were then still travelling to a holding location near De Menezes’s flat even as he left it at 9.33.He suggested her orders to officers on the ground were always one step behind events; when she had said De Menezes should not be allowed to enter Stockwell station, he already had. When she had said he must not be allowed to get on a train, too late – he already had. At every juncture on his route from home to tube train that morning, the firearms officers were not in position to intercept or challenge him.With flashing blue lights they finally managed to arrive at Stockwell station a minute or so after De Menezes. Mansfield asked Dick why these armed officers hadn’t been in position earlier, and why they weren’t waiting for such a dangerous “suspect” when he left his flat.But she was having none of it: “I think you could turn that on its head and say they did incredibly well to get [to the station] in that time, given what was going on,” she replied.View image in fullscreenCCTV footage showing armed police officers bursting through Stockwell tube ticket barriers.Photograph: CPS/PA“So what did go wrong?” Nicholas Hilliard QC, counsel for the inquest, then asked her.Dick: “If you ask me whether I think anybody did anything wrong or unreasonable on the operation, I don’t think they did.”The story of how De Menezes came to be shot seven times in the head in a tube carriage full of members of the public begins two weeks and one day earlier, on 7 July, 2005. SirIan Blair, Met commissioner at the time, rightly called the 7/7 bomb attacks on tube trains and a bus that morning, in which 52 innocent people lost their lives, the most significant attack on the capital since the second world war.In the immediate aftermath the police and MI5 didn’t know if the bombs were remotely detonated, were on timers, or were suicide attacks. An enormous manhunt got under way, one which ultimately skilfully and efficiently identified the four Islamist terrorists responsible, who were, indeed, suicide bombers.Like most people, I remember exactly where I was and what I was doing when I first heard about the bombings – I was at my eldest son’s primary school, helping out that morning with a project. I imagine the impact was something like what my parents felt when they heard of the assassination of President Kennedy.ProfileJeff PopeShowJeff Pope is an award-winning British producer and screenwriter.

But as I read the two Stockwell inquiry reports and court transcripts and spoke to key witnesses, I realised there was much, much more to it. I had completely forgotten, for instance, that there was a second cell of suicide bombers who attempted to explode four more devices on three tube trains and a bus exactly two weeks after that first attack. A second tragedy was avoided purely because these bombers failed to assemble their devices correctly and only the detonators in their backpacks exploded, not the main charges.View image in fullscreenThe shrine to Jean Charles de Menezes outside Stockwell tube station, south London, where the shooting took place in 2005.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianWhile an enormous amount of work was still under way on the 7/7 investigation, here was a new and perhaps even more terrifying situation. Not only had there been a second attack, but the bombers responsible had all escaped the scenes of their attempted detonations. There were now four terrorists at large (in fact there were five, because a fifth bomber lost his nerve and left his bomb in a park in west London, though this wasn’t immediately discovered). The fear was, having failed once, would they try to strike again?And were there as-yet undiscovered cells? Other outrages planned? Fear and paranoia gripped London. The police and security services were under the most intense pressure.Because the 21/7 bombs had not properly exploded, personal items left in the backpacks were quickly retrieved, and one of these was a gym card belonging toHussain Osman, with a blurry photo of him on the front. From the card his address was established as 21 Scotia Road in Tulse Hill, south London. (In fact the address was that of a friend of Osman’s, unconnected to terrorism, that he had used to obtain the gym membership). The police had a lead, and a good one.Surveillance was arranged in the early hours of 22 July to keep watch on the block of flats containing No 21. An unmarked van was parked in a bay overlooking the communal entrance but contained, surprising me when I discovered this fact, only one officer.Thus, the ghastly pieces were all in place for the tragedy that would follow at precisely 10.06 that morning, when De Menezes lay dead in a tube carriage.Up until this point the police could hardly be blamed for any of what had happened. But as I and the team researching the drama began to really dig into the events of 22 July, two things emerged that made us angry, and inspired me to writeSuspect, a four-part drama based on the shooting of De Menezes.View image in fullscreenMetropolitan police Commissioner Ian Blair making a statement after the force was found guilty of health and safety charges in its shooting of De Menezes in 2007.Photograph: Andy Rain/EPAFirst, though there was much superb police work taking place in the investigations into the 7 and 21 July bomb attacks, the operation led by Dick to track the “suspect” at Scotia Road was, in my opinion, flawed. Dick, as you will see from those court exchanges, refused to accept this. I’ve always believed that if you don’t come clean about things, if you don’t hold your hands up, you can never really move on from something – and that, I would suggest, is precisely what has happened in the 20 years since De Menezes’s death. Most importantly, this intransigence has prevented De Menezes’s family from finding any proper closure.And second, the Met did what it often seems to do in situations like this. After the shooting it buried any culpability on its part under a dense blanket of obfuscation and denial. It made it very clear, to De Menezes’s family, to the British public, to the world, that it didn’t believe it had really done anything wrongThe language used at the time by Dick and Ian Blair is, to me, extraordinary. There was much repetition, for instance, of the word “regret”. Blair gave an interview on camera where he said: “…the most important thing I can do is offer our regrets. But then we have to move on.” I don’t remember much official use of the word “sympathy”.De Menezes’s family say his shooting was as a result of “police incompetence”.The Met argued, and argues, that the bombings made for a pivotal moment in our history and that it was facing unique challenges, simultaneously trying to identify and track down two terrorist cells.But the truth, as far as the shooting of De Menezes is concerned, is that “incompetence” is the right word. The huge operation, commanded by Dick to prevent what the police thought was a suicide bomber from entering the public transport system, was poorly planned and poorly executed.That morning Dick, the designated senior officer for the operation, arrived late to a briefing of senior officers at New Scotland Yard. She says it was not her fault and that she was given the wrong office to go to, but it meant Commander John McDowall had to do the briefing again just for her, with the other officers no longer present.Her firearms team, CO19, were given two briefings that morning about what to expect and what was required of them. They were warned that a special protocol never used before, called Kratos, might be employed, giving them the authority to shoot to kill, to take a “critical shot”, defined as shooting a suspect in the base of the skull without warning, should they believe this person was about to detonate a bomb and kill innocent members of the public. They were duly issued with hollow point or “dumdum” ammunition, outlawed on the battlefield under the terms of the Geneva conventions, but authorised here because the ammunition explodes inside the body and is therefore less likely to pass through and injure a bystander.But after two briefings in two different locations that morning, the CO19 officers were still in transit to a holding location near Scotia Road when De Menezes left his apartment at 9.33. Given that they were tracking a terrorist, why on earth were they not briefed and already in position many, many hours earlier?The firearms officers said that they believed a positive ID had been made, though there is no evidence of this in the logsThe lone surveillance officer in the van was urinating into a bottle as De Menezes left his apartment block and, distracted, didn’t get a clear look at him or manage to video him. Not his fault, but – admittedly with the benefit of hindsight – why only one officer in the unmarked van? Why not two, to cover just such an eventuality?The bus stop De Menezes used in Tulse Hill is not surrounded by houses. He could have been relatively safely stopped and challenged there. But Dick decided not to suspend bus services that morning because – even though having to wait for a bus is hardly unusual in London – she didn’t want to possibly alert a terrorist cell that the police were on to them. And so, moments after he reached the stop, the bus arrived and De Menezes boarded.He got off the bus at Brixton, intending to go into the tube station there, but the station happened to be shut that morning, so he got back on the same bus. This was interpreted as an “anti-surveillance” tactic on his part, but why did none of the officers tailing him that morning also spot that the station was shut?De Menezes got off again at Stockwell station.In the 33 minutes since he’d left his apartment, none of the surveillance officers tailing him (SO12 officers) definitively identified De Menezes as Osman. A poor quality photocopy of the photo on the gym card was all they had to go on. Why? Why was his driving licence photo not obtained? Why was the clear wedding photo of Osman and his wife, found ripped up in his backpack next to the gym card, not put together and issued?The police would later try to show, using a split-screen image, how De Menezes could have been mistaken for Osman, an African man of Ethiopian descent. But even then the images had been manipulated to make the features align, and Osman’s skin tone seemed bleached to make him appear lighter.Desperately seeking confirmation of a positive ID, Dick asked the SO12 officers to give her a percentage, or a score out of 10, for how likely they thought the man they were tailing was Osman. The officers couldn’t give her a number (some we spoke to thought this was a silly question), but the key point is that nobody ever said that morning: “Yes, this is definitely our man.”The firearms officers said in their statements that they believed a positive ID had been made, though there is no evidence of this in the logs and transcripts from the operation’s control centre for that morning, Room 1600 at New Scotland Yard.At this stage, however, the firearms men were still playing catch up.As De Menezes entered Stockwell station the surveillance officers at the scene asked control if they wanted “the suspect” stopped. Dick wanted specialist armed officers from CO19 to do the stop, but they still weren’t there. As this was playing out in Room 1600, De Menezes descended the escalator, got on to a train and waited patiently for it to depart.View image in fullscreenEmily Mortimer as Cressida Dick in Suspect.Photograph: Des Willie/Disney+A minute later the firearms team finally caught up with him. It was just before 10.06am and this was the first time that morning they were able to properly take part in the operation. This was, surely, unforgivably late to deploy officers so crucial to the operation into the field?Wearing civilian clothing but with bulletproof vests under their jackets, the CO19 officers ran through the concourse, vaulted the ticket barriers and sprinted down on to the platform. Some eyewitnesses who saw them mistook them for De Menezes, later saying that they saw a man wearing “bulky clothing” run through the concourse in a panic and vault the barriers. Then two of these officers, codenamed Charlie 2 and Charlie 12, went on to the train and shot De Menezes in the head a total of seven times.In the aftermath, Dick said that, even though hollow-point ammunition was being used, and she had repeatedly ordered over the comms system that the “suspect” must not be allowed to enter the tube system, she never gave the authority for a “critical shot” to be taken, meaning Charlies 2 and 12 were not authorised by her to shoot De Menezes without warning.These two officers later gave statements in which they said they had entered the tube train and shouted a warning of “armed police!” to De Menezes. They said he had been wearing “bulky clothing” and had risen from his seat and advanced towards them. Interpreting this as threatening behaviour, they had then shot him.A couple of questions here. If the suspect’s clothing was “bulky” then, yes, it could theoretically be hiding a bomb. But how does a denim jacket qualify as “bulky clothing”?And if, as the CO19 officers said, they believed De Menezes was a suicide bomber and were in fear for their lives, why shout a warning? If he was a bomber, wouldn’t the warning have just been a trigger for him to detonate?Right from the start the Met issued disinformation, putting out statements for several days afterwards that picked up on erroneous eyewitness accountsCrucially, there were 17 members of the public in De Menezes’s carriage that morning, and all 17 said they did not hear the firearms officers shout any warning before they shot him.The family of De Menezes are dignified people from a rural town called Gonzaga in the south of Brazil. I have spoken to his mother Maria, father Matosinhos and brother Giovani several times, and together with De Menezes’s cousins, two of whom he lived with in Scotia Road, they say that their pain is not over yet. More than anything, they want the truth about what happened to fully emerge.Brian Paddick, a former deputy assistant commissioner of the Met, also wanted the truth to emerge 20 years ago. Instinctively, he felt this was a watershed moment for the force, a huge operation involving dozens of officers, ending with the brutal death at police hands of an innocent man.But what actually happened in the days, weeks and months after De Menezes’s death was, in his opinion, depressingly predictable.Right from the start the Met issued disinformation, putting out statements for several days afterwards that picked up on those erroneous eyewitness accounts that De Menezes was wearing bulky clothing, had behaved suspiciously and had vaulted the barriers at Stockwell tube station.In the months that followed, negative stories ran in the national press about him, including an allegation that he was a rapist. A DNA test proved definitively that he was not, but why was this – and other stuff – leaked into the public domain when it had no relevance to his shooting?View image in fullscreenRussell Tovey as Brian Paddick in Suspect, Jeff Pope’s forthcoming Disney+ series about the case.Photograph: Des WillieThe disparity between the statements being issued by the Met, and the information circulating internally between the Met and the IPCC, which was looking into the shooting of De Menezes, eventually proved too much forLana Vandenberghe, a secretary working at the IPCC.Through a mutual friend she released to a journalist at ITN what she had learned, how the Met was suggesting that De Menezes was connected to its ongoing terrorist operation, and how he had behaved in a “suspicious manner” that morning and was wearing “bulky clothing” when it knew this was not the case. The story became a huge, exclusive lead item onNews at Ten, and the whole sorry saga of the Met’s attempts to downplay its culpability came crashing down to earth.Vandenberghe, a courageous single mother, was summarily sacked by the IPCC and charged, at one point, with the theft of sheets of paper and ink after she had printed off emails and images and handed them to the ITN journalist.Paddick also lost his career, feeling forced to resign after Blair effectively demoted him when Paddick challenged him about when he knew that De Menezes was innocent and not connected to terrorism in any way. Paddick said he was told on the afternoon of the 22 July by a senior member of Blair’s team, directly outside his office, that the Met had shot “a Brazilian tourist”. Blair insisted he hadn’t known this until 10am the following day. While the IPCC ultimately accepted his version of events, it’s significant because that afternoon, while Paddick says senior advisers were openly discussing the fact that the wrong man had been shot, Blair was saying at a press conference that the shooting “was directly linked to the ongoing and expanding anti-terrorist operation”, and that “the man” (De Menezes) was “challenged and refused to obey”. As late as the evening of the 23 July the Met was still issuing press releases stating his “clothing and behaviour added to their suspicions”.View image in fullscreenMaria Otone de Menezes, the mother of Jean Charles, in central London in 2008.Photograph: Lewis Whyld/APBlair said he suspected Paddick had been leaking stories to the press, which Paddick strenuously denied and was later cleared of, and that he had “lost confidence” in him.The Met’s attempts to stay on the right side of the story led,astonishingly, to an undercover officer being sent to a public meeting of the Justice for Jeancampaign, which had been set up by his family, friends and supporters to try to force the Met to be open about what had happened. A simple question. Why? What perceived threat to public safety was anticipated from this meeting? What threat was so sinister that it needed a specially trained undercover officer to pose as some kind of supporter and infiltrate those who attended? Or was it just that the Met wanted to know what everybody was saying about them?The point of this drama is to tell the truth. To dispel the myths about what happened that day, and afterwards.Beyond that it is an opportunity to shout out that the Met should have been open and honest from the start. Mansfield put to Dick in court that “mistakes can be made”, and that “it’s pleasant when people own up to what they have done”.It wouldn’t have brought De Menezes back, or prevented the agony that his family went through. But it would have been compassionate and respectful, and it wouldn’t have made a tragic, a terrible situation, worse.Instead, the Met reverted to type, as it has done in the past and, I fear, still does. It wriggled and evaded, dead-batted, tried to get us to look the other way, and allowed De Menezes’s reputation to be blackened because it made them look better.The Met regretted. But no more.Suspect: The Shooting ofJean Charles de Menezes is available on Disney+ from 30 AprilExplore more on these topicsDramaThe ObserverJean Charles de Menezes7 July London attacksPoliceCressida DickIan BlairBrian PaddickfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The wide street, bathed in slanted afternoon sun, is filled with traffic. We are in the back seat of a taxi, paused at the mercy of the traffic controller atop his tiered stand, like a figurine on a wedding cake. The edges of the road are clogged with cyclists rushing towards and away from us, but mostly what we see is cars, cars and more cars, including the interior of our own.The four-wheeled automobileis the subject and the vehicle, so to speak, of American photographer Clark Winter’sHere to There: Photographs from the Road Ahead, which chronicles three decades of road life across the US and beyond. As a youth, Winter was offered a rare place to study at the prestigious Rhode Island School of Design under American photography luminaries such as Aaron Siskind and Harry Callahan. Realising he wanted to know more about the world before fixing it with his lens, he instead took an entry-level job at JP Morgan, who funded a year of education in finance and then sent him across the world to learn about global markets. He took his Leica with him.In black-and-white and colour, he takes us from the landscapes of Ohio, West Virginia and Indiana to the streets of Madrid, Rome, Pisa, Palermo, Paris, Mexico City and Beijing. Rather than seeking out particular images or motifs, Winter prefers an open curiosity – to look carefully and see what catches his attention. “You don’t know whether it’s your intuition or something beneath the level of your conscious perception, but a tiny bell goes off in your head and you listen to it,” he once toldLifemagazine.InTraffic Control, Beijing, China, as in many of his photographs, the windows, doors, angles and purviews of the taxi act as frames within a frame, directing our vision this way and that, like the traffic warden beyond who orchestrates the road.

A TPS designation means individuals cannot be removed from the US and are granted the right to work and the ability to travel.The designation was extended by the Biden administration last September but is set to expire next month. The Department of Homeland Security said 133 people from South Sudan were on the TPS programme last year.Trump has been pushing to end TPS designations for a handful of countries including Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela, potentially affecting half a million people. A judge last month paused plans to end the legal protections for Venezuelans.What was a simmering conflict in South Sudan has threatened to intensify in recent weeks, with forces loyal to President Salva Kiir clashing with backers of his rival, vice-president Riek Machar, in the eastern city of Nasir.Conflict between Kiir and Machar, who come from the country’s largest ethnic groups, the Dinka and Nuer, cost 400,000 lives during a five-year civil war. Uganda and Sudan mediated a ceasefire in 2018 with cabinet and state positions distributed between their factions.“South Sudan has been in a state of civil conflict since its creation and the only difference is whether the conflict has been open or smouldering beneath the surface,” said Mukesh Kapila, an academic who was the UN head in Sudan in 2004. He added that the underlying issues between the two leaders were never properly resolved.The agreement faced a major stress test when the civil war in Sudan halted South Sudan’s oil exports, which account for about 70% of its budget. More than 600,000 people from Sudan have also sought refuge in South Sudan further straining the country’s limited resources.The country’s financial challenges, which meant many in the public sector were not paid for close to a year, have been compounded by renewed hostilities between the supporters of Kiir and Machar.Machar wasplaced under house arrestlast month along with his wife, Angelina Teny, who is the interior minister. Officials from his party said this effectively ended the 2018 peace agreement. In the weeks leading up to Machar’s arrest several of his associates were removed from office.The African Union dispatched a team of mediators last week to South Sudan’s capital, Juba, including Burundi’s former president, Domitien Ndayizeye, and the former Kenyan prime minister, Raila Odinga, to mediate between the feuding leaders.Kapila warned it was a dangerous situation but “with the other problems in the world, I’m not sure anyone is currently bothered to stop the momentum toward conflict”.Explore more on these topicsUS newsSouth SudanAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

He acknowledged what he called an “absence of evidence” justifying Abrego Garcia’s detention and deportation.Of Reuveni, Bondi told Fox News Sunday: “It’s a pending matter right now. He was put on administrative leave by [deputy US attorney general] Todd Blanche on Saturday.“You have to vigorously argue on behalf of your client.”Reuveni’s supervisor, August Flentje, was also placed on leave, ABC Newsreported.The justice department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report.Reuveni and Flentje, who according to his LinkedIn page is the deputy director of the justice department’s office of immigration litigation, civil division, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Trump’s administration asserted in previous court filings that it had erroneously deported Abrego Garcia to his home country despite a previous court order prohibiting his removal.The White House and administration officials have accused Abrego Garcia of being a criminal gang member, but there are no pending charges. His lawyers have denied the allegation.Xinis, in a written order on Sunday explaining her Friday ruling, said “there were no legal grounds for his arrest, detention or removal” or evidence that Abrego Garcia was wanted for crimes inEl Salvador.“Rather, his detention appears wholly lawless,” she wrote in the filing.Abrego Garcia had complied fully with all directives from immigration officials, including annual check-ins, and had never been charged with or convicted of any crime, the judge wrote.Abrego Garcia was stopped and detained by immigration agents on 12 March and questioned about his alleged affiliation with the MS-13 gang, which he has denied.Trump administration apologizes for telling Ukrainian refugees to leave USRead moreAbrego Garcia has been detained inEl Salvador’s terror confinement center, colloquially known as Cecot, which the judge called “one of the most dangerous prisons in the western hemisphere”.The Trump administration has faced criticism in the US courts and elsewhere of its stepped-up enforcement against immigration rights. Ajudge in Washington DCis separately weighing whether the Trump administrationviolated a court ordernot to deport alleged Venezuelan gang members amid ongoing legal proceedings.Some of those deported have active asylum cases, and civil rights groups have argued the administration has failed to provide due process under the law.Bondi on Sunday vowed to continue the administration’s deportations, maintaining: “The best thing to do is to get these people out of our country.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationLaw (US)US immigrationMarylandUS politicsEl SalvadorDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

While its numbers couldn’t knock the rainbow lorikeet off its top perch, theunfaithful black-and-white swooperwas spotted by more bird count participants than any other species.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterSean Dooley, BirdLife Australia’s senior public affairs advisor and self-avowed “chief bird nerd”, described the magpie, which won Australia’s inauguralbird of the yearpoll in 2017, as our “most familiar bird”.“One in two people who did the Aussie Bird Count recorded seeing a magpie,” he said. “The reason they’re not the number one bird is because when you see magpies, they’re usually in pairs or small family groups, whereas when you encounter rainbow lorikeets they’re in flocks up to hundreds.”No states or territories shared the same top three birds, a result BirdLife Australia described as “a reminder of how integral birds are to the unique character and identity of each state”.Nationally, the 10 most common birds were:Rainbow lorikeetNoisy minerAustralian magpieSulphur-crested cockatooWelcome swallowGalahSilver gullAustralian white ibisHouse sparrowLittle corellaThe house sparrow was the only bird on the list that was introduced to Australia. The little corella rounded out the top 10, besting the red wattlebird which had ranked 10th in the 2023 count.“Interestingly, if we had done the Aussie bird count 50 years ago there would have been more introduced species in the top 10. You would have had things like the common myna which started in the top 10 in the first five counts,” Dooley said.“The fascinating thing about this count is that you can infer and decipher what’s going on with the landscape by what types of birds are around,” he added. “Birds really track what’s happening in the environment, even the urban environment we think of as pretty hostile to nature.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For everyone else, she wants tough justice, tolerance zero, jail for the first offence. For her, it’s too tough.”Manuel Bompard of the radical leftFranceUnbowed (LFI) told the rally the RN’s mask had slipped after years of trying to clean up its image and pose as a future party of government. “It’s dangerous for democracy, dangerous for the rule of law,” he said.Police said 7,000 people were at the RN rally and 5,000 at the leftwing rival.The three-time presidential candidate and frontrunner to succeed Emmanuel Macron was found guilty on Monday of embezzling more than €4m (£3.4m) of European parliament funds to pay RN party workers in France through a vast fake jobs scam.Le Pen was sentenced to four years in prison, of which two were suspended and two may be served with an electronic bracelet, fined €100,000 and – under a law she had backed – barred from running for public office for five years with immediate effect.The Paris appeals court has said it will deliver a verdict on her case by next summer, potentially allowing her to contest the 2027 presidential race if her conviction is overturned, which is seen as unlikely, or the ban on running for public office lifted.The ruling, which followed a 10-year investigation and a nine-week trial, has dramatically shaken up the political landscape and been fiercely attacked by far-right politicians in France and beyond as politically motivated and anti-democratic.Jordan Bardella, the RN’s 29-year-old president and Le Pen’s likely replacement if she remains ineligible, told cheering RN voters that it was “not just Marine Le Pen who has been unjustly condemned, but French democracy that has been put to death”.The court decision would go down as “a dark day in our nation’s history”, he said, a “direct attack on our democracy, a wound for millions of patriots” and an attempt to “deprive us of free choice, to wipe from the scene an entire part of France”.Speaking before her rally, Le Pen – whose vote share in the presidential first round was put at 36% by one poll on Sunday, far ahead of all rivals – said the RN would “follow the example of Martin Luther King’s struggle, who defended civil rights”.Wearing a “Marine présidente” T-shirt and a “Save democracy” sticker, Patrick, 57, who had come from Normandy, said Le Pen’s sentence was “an outrage.

No one’s been defrauded. It’s all a complete fiction to stop Marine.”On the Place de la République, several thousand protesters waved placards reading “No Trumpism in France” and “Nobody is above the law”. Vincent Lemaitre, 44, a primary school teacher, said the court’s ruling showed French democracy worked.The judges, he said, “simply applied the law, which was passed by parliament, including many deputies who represent the RN. Le Pen and her colleagues broke that law. Popularity should not give politicians immunity. Quite the opposite, in fact.”Anaïs Desmets, 31, said the argument that politicians should only be judged at the ballot box was “absurd. If someone harms children, they are kept away from kids. If someone steals public money, they shouldn’t be allowed to manage it.”View image in fullscreenThe former prime minister Gabriel Attal speaks to the crowd in Paris suburb Saint-Denis.Photograph: Thomas Samson/AFP/Getty ImagesIn the working-class northern Paris suburb of Saint-Denis, Macron’s Renaissance party and its allies warned of “an existential threat” to the rule of law. “If you steal, you pay,” the former prime minister Gabriel Attal said. “Especially if you are a politician.”Attal, addressing an audience that included the present prime minister, François Bayrou, also denounced “unprecedented interference” in France’s affairs including from Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Hungary’s Viktor Orbàn and Italy’s Matteo Salvini.He said every effort should be made not to politicise the court’s decision. “It’s not up to us, or to anyone else, to say whether the court’s judgement was good or bad,” Attal said. “It is our responsibility to always stick to the facts.”Explore more on these topicsMarine Le PenFranceNational RallyThe far rightEuropeEuropean UnionnewsShareReuse this content"

Seized by Russia in spring 2022 and shut down for safety reasons a few months later, it remains on the frontline of the conflict, close to the Dnipro River.Map showing the location of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plantRussia has said it intends to retain the site and switch it back on, without being specific as to when. Alexey Likhachev, head of Russian nuclear operator Rosatom, said in February it would be restarted when “military and political conditions allow”.Meanwhile, Donald Trump has expressed an interest in taking control of it,though this possibility is considered very remote.Kotin said Energoatom was prepared to restart the plant but it would require Russian forces to be removed and the site to be de-mined and demilitarised.He said such a restart by Ukraine would take anywhere “from two months to two years” in an environment “without any threats from militaries”, while a Russian restart during wartime “would be impossible, even for one unit [reactor]”.Kotin said the six reactors could only be brought online after the completion of 27 safety programmes agreed with Ukraine’s nuclear regulator, including testing the nuclear fuel in the reactor cores because it had exceeded a six-year “design term”.That raises questions about whether Russia could restart the plant after a ceasefire without incurring significant risk. The plant was already unsafe, Kotin said, given that it was being used as “a military base with military vehicles present” and there were “probably some weapons and blasting materials” present as well.Russiahas acknowledgedthat it has placed mines between the inner and outer perimeters of the plant “to deter potential Ukrainian saboteurs” while inspectors from the IAEA nuclear watchdoghave reportedthat armed troops and military personnel are present at the site.Last month,the US Department of Energy saidthe Zaporizhzhia plant was being operated by an “inadequate and insufficently trained cadre of workers”, with staffing levels at less than a third of prewar levels.The US briefing said Ukrainian reactors, though originally of the Soviet VVER design, had “evolved differently” from their Russian counterparts and “particularly the safety systems”. Russian-trained specialists acting as replacements for Ukrainian staff were “inexperienced” in operating the Ukrainian variants, it said.Kotin said an attempt to restart the plant by Russia would almost certainly not be accepted or supported by Ukraine. It would require the reconnection of three additional 750kV high-voltage lines to come into the plant, he said.A nuclear reactor requires a significant amount of power for day-to-day operation, and three of the four high-voltage lines came from territories now under Russian occupation. “They themselves destroyed the lines,” Kotin said, only for Russia to discover engineers could not rebuild them as the war continued, he added.Only two lines remain to maintain the site in cold shutdown, a 750kV line coming from Ukraine, and a further 330kV line – though on eight separate occasions shelling disrupted their supply of energy, forcing the plant to rely on backup generators.Experts say a pumping station has to be constructed at the site, because there is insufficient cooling water available. The June 2023 destruction by Russian soldiers of the Nova Kakhova dam downstream eliminated the easy supply of necessary water from the Dnipro river.Two civilians were reportedly killed by Russian missile attacks on Sunday, including one in a ballistic missile strike in an eastern district of Kyiv; while Russia said it captured a border village near Sumy in north-east Ukraine.Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia had launched more than 1,460 guided aerial bombs, nearly 670 attack drones, and more than 30 missiles over the past week. The Ukrainian president said: “The number of air attacks is increasing.”US-brokered ceasefire talks have only achieved limited results thus far. Both sides agreed to stop attacking energy targets, though each accuses the other of violations; while a maritime ceasefire agreed to by Ukraine has not been accepted by Russia.A Russian official involved in the negotiations said on Sunday that diplomatic contacts between Russia and the US could come again as early as next week.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaNuclear powerEnergyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Let’s instead make it an opportunity to grow together, to cultivate hope,” he added.In the traditional Sunday blessing, pope offered prayers for doctors, nurses and health care workers who were “not always helped to work in inadequate conditions, at times the victims of aggression.

Attacks are ongoing’: how Putin’s envoy played US over UkrainePeter BeaumontWhite House welcome for key member of Russian president’s inner circle raises fears over America’s commitment to peaceSun 6 Apr 2025 02.00 EDTShareKirill Dmitriev’smeetingswith US officials in the White House last week went largely below the radar. And deliberately so.The dapper investment envoy to Russian presidentVladimir Putin, who also serves as a key negotiator for Moscow on Ukraine, posted an image of his flight plan on social media to make the point that a senior sanctioned Russian official was being welcomed by the Trump administration. Otherwise, details of what was discussed remain opaque.The most senior Russian official to visit the US since Moscow’s invasion ofUkrainein 2022, Dmitriev – a member of Putin’s closest inner circle – is well cast to appeal to Trump and an administration whose world view is crudely transactional.The head of Russia’s $10bn sovereign wealth fund, Dmitriev was born in Kyiv during the Soviet era and US-educated, including spending time at Stanford and Harvard Business School.Crucially, it is Dmitriev who has been tasked by Putin with keeping Donald Trump onside amid the US president’s self-describedanger with Russiaover the status of a US mediated “ceasefire” that exists largely in name only amid continuing attacks.All of which, said Dmitriev last week – conforming to a familiar Kremlin playbook – was the fault of everyone but Russia .“Today,” Dmitriev wrote on Telegram on Thursday, “numerous forces interested in maintaining tension stand in the way of restoring constructive cooperation.“These forces are deliberately distorting Russia’s position, trying to disrupt any steps towards dialogue, sparing neither money nor resources for this.”There was little mystery over who he meant by those “forces”: Ukraine and its European allies, some of whose frustration with Russiaspilled over into the openon Friday.View image in fullscreenRussia’s Vladimir Putin, left, with Kirill Dmitriev, head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund.Photograph: Alexei Nikolsky/AP“Our judgment is that Putin continues to obfuscate, continues to drag his feet,” the British foreign secretary, David Lammy, told reporters at Nato headquarters, describing the “ceasefire” and continuing negotiations. He added that while Putin should be accepting a genuine ceasefire, “he continues to bombardUkraine. Its civilian population. Its energy supplies. We see you, Vladimir Putin. We know what you are doing.”Lammy’s comments reflect a widening consensus that the Trump mediated “ceasefire” announced last month – a very partial arrangement at best – has rapidly deflated as it has encountered the reality of a Kremlin that seems determined to continue fighting.What limited optimism existed in some quarters in Ukraine that talks might lead to a meaningful track to peace have long since evaporated to be replaced by fears that Russia might bepreparing a major new offensivefor the spring and summer months.Envisioned as a short-term arrangement covering only a small part of the conflict, it encouraged both sides to refrain from strikes on energy and other civil infrastructure, and in theBlack Sea maritime theatre, leaving the war to rage on unchecked along the vast, snaking main line of contact in eastern Ukraine.And of those two issues, strikes on energy infrastructure have been the most significant, with both sides accusing the other of breaches of the agreement over energy sites.As experts have noted, the commitments in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, were not only vague but lacked a mechanism to verify and enforce a truce.“There’s no ceasefire,” observes Phillips O’Brien, a professor of strategic studies at the university of St Andrews.“Attacks are ongoing on energy sites, and the Black Sea part of the deal is small beer. A real ceasefire would mean there was no fighting along the line of the contact.”Instead, O’Brien interprets the positive tenor of statements that emerged from Jeddah and subsequently as being as much about Kyiv and Moscow protecting their positions with Trump than marking any real progress towards peace.“Russia didn’t want to go against Trump openly. Diplomatically it would be foolish to say they don’t want a ceasefire, so they go along with the pretence, not least the Kremlin, which still believes there are gains to be made on the battlefield,” O’Brien said.Orysia Lutsevych, the head of the Ukraine Forum at the Chatham House thinktank, is equally forthright: “We have no ceasefire. Period. And we have no commitment from Russia as they put conditions on even the partial ceasefire in the western part of the Black Sea, conditioning it on sanctions relief, including from EU banking sanctions.“The Russian offer to America is ‘stop wasting money on a war Ukraine can’t win so let’s make money together’. And as part of that push they will try to put the blame on Ukraine for being obstructive.“The Americans have not approached these talks from the point of view of [them being verifiable] and implementable, or in the knowledge of Russia’s history of violations. What is striking is how they have already brought Putin in from the cold without Russia making any gesture of goodwill.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Regime change, by any other name.And Dmitriev’s role as one of Putin’s key spoilers has not gone unnoticed, as he secured an invite from Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, who appears to have been wrong footed by Putin and his inner circle at every turn.Earlier this week the Institute for the Study of War noted Dmitriev’s comments to the BBC’s Russian Serviceon 30 March suggesting an impossible sequencing going forward: that “US-Russian economic cooperation should be a primary focus if the United States wants to end the war in Ukraine, but that such cooperation would only begin after the conclusion of peace negotiations”.To that end Russian officials have been dangling the carrot of potentialUS-Russian rare earth mining projectsto undermine Trump’s rare earths deal he has beentrying to impose on Ukraine.If Russia’s tactics seem familiar – using the auspices of a ceasefire to advance its interest militarily and diplomatically – it is, analysts point out, because they are similar to the negotiations in Minsk a decade ago and during Syria’s civil war.And while Trump himself acknowledged on 25 March that Russia may be “dragging their feet” in peace talks to allow Russian forces to capture more territory, it appears to many observers that Trump remains more interested in courting Russia than pursuing an equitable and lasting peace.The most important stumbling block, however, may be the one described by Richard Haass, a former US diplomat and past president of the US Council on Foreign Relations.“The biggest question remains US policy,” wrote Haass recently. “The Trump administration has used a combination of pressure and incentives to persuade the two sides to stop fighting. But its approach has been skewed toward offering benefits to Russia while bringing heavy pressure to bear on Ukraine.”And while some – including Zelenskyy – have suggested that Trump could bring Putin to heel within weeks if he wants to, so far there has been little evidence to suggest either urgency or a desire to act.So the war goes on.Explore more on these topicsUkraineThe ObserverVladimir PutinRussiaDonald TrumpUS foreign policyEuropeanalysisShareReuse this content"

An Israeli military official, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with regulations late on Saturday, said that account was “mistaken”.The Gaza paramedic killings: a visual timelineRead moreThe almost seven-minute video, which the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said on Saturday was recovered from the phone of Rifat Radwan, one of the men killed, appears to have been filmed from inside a moving vehicle. It shows a red fire engine and clearly marked ambulances driving at night, using headlights and flashing emergency lights.The vehicle stops beside another that has driven off the road. Two men get out to examine the stopped vehicle, then gunfire erupts before the screen goes black.Fifteen Palestinian paramedics and rescue workers, including at least one UN employee, were killed in the incident in Rafah on 23 March, in which theUN said Israeli forces shot the men “one by one”and then buried them in a mass grave.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the incident was still under investigation. It added: “All claims, including the documentation circulated about the incident, will be thoroughly and deeply examined to understand the sequence of events and the handling of the situation.”The official said the initial report received from the field did not describe lights but that investigators were looking at “operational information” and were trying to understand whether this was due to an error by the person making the initial report.“What we understand currently is the person who gives the initial account is mistaken. We’re trying to understand why,” the official added.According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha), the PRCS and civil defence workers were on a mission to rescue colleagues who had been shot at earlier in the day, when their clearly marked vehicles came under heavy Israeli fire in the Tel al-Sultan area of Rafah. A Red Crescent official inGazasaid there was evidence of at least one person being detained and killed, as the body of one of the dead had been found with his hands tied.The shootings happened one day into the renewed Israeli offensive in the area close to the Egyptian border after the breakdown of a two-month ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.Israeli strikes onGazaon Sunday killed at least 44 people, rescuers said. “The death toll as a result of Israeli air strikes since dawn today is at least 44, including 21 in Khan Younis,” civil defence agency spokesperson Mahmud Bassal told AFP.One such strike killed six people on Al-Nakheel Street in the Al-Tuffah neighbourhood of Gaza City, where a group had gathered near a bakery, Bassal said. Among the dead were three children, he confirmed.On Sunday evening, Hamas said it had fired a barrage of rockets at cities in Israel’s south on Sunday in response to Israeli “massacres” of civilians in Gaza.The IDF said about 10 projectiles were fired, but most were successfully intercepted. Israel’s Channel 12 reported a direct hit in the southern city of Ashkelon.Israeli emergency services said they were treating one person for shrapnel injuries and teams were en route to locations of fallen rockets. Smashed car windows and debris lay strewn on a city street, videos disseminated by Israeli emergency services showed.The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, had ordered a strong response to the rocket attack, his office said.Another Red Crescent worker on the mission last month, Assad al-Nassasra, is still reported missing and the organisation has asked the Israeli military for information on his whereabouts.A survivor of the incident, the Palestinian Red Crescent paramedic Munther Abed, has said he saw Nassasra being led away blindfolded by Israeli troops.The 27-year-old volunteer was in the back of the first ambulance to arrive on the scene of an airstrike in the Hashashin area of Rafah before dawn on 23 March when the vehicle came under intense Israeli fire.His two Red Crescent colleagues sitting in the front were killed but he survived by throwing himself to the floor of the vehicle. “The door opened, and there they were – Israeli special forces in military uniforms, armed with rifles, green lasers and night-vision goggles,” Abed told the Guardian. “They dragged me out of the ambulance, keeping me face down to avoid seeing what had happened to my colleagues.”Adeb was detained for several hours before being released.‘I heard them take their last breath’: survivor recounts Gaza paramedic killingsRead moreThe UN and Palestinian Red Crescent have demanded an independent inquiry into the killing of the paramedics.Israeli media briefed by the military have reported that troops had identified at least six of the 15 dead as members of militant groups and killed a Hamas figure named Mohammed Amin Shobaki.None of the 15 killed has that name and no other bodies are known to have been found at the site. The official declined to provide any evidence or detail of how the identifications were made, saying he did not want to share classified information.“According to our information, there were terrorists there but this investigation is not over,” he told reporters.Abed – a volunteer for 10 years – was adamant there were no militants travelling with the ambulances.Jonathan Whittall, the interim head of Ocha in the occupied Palestinian territory, dismissed allegations that the people who died were Hamas militants, saying staff had worked with the same medics previously in evacuating patients from hospitals and other tasks.“These are paramedic crews that I personally have met before,” he said. “They were buried in their uniforms with their gloves on. They were ready to save lives.”The Israeli military official said the troops had informed the UN of the incident on the same day and initially covered the bodies with camouflage netting until they could be recovered, later burying them when the UN did not immediately collect the bodies.The UN confirmed last week it had been informed of the location of the bodies but that access to the area was denied by Israel for several days. It said the bodies had been buried alongside their crushed vehicles – clearly marked ambulances, a fire truck and a UN car.Explore more on these topicsIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaIsrael-Gaza warGazaUnited NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

They said they were part of an MPs’ delegation coming to visit humanitarian aid projects and communities in the West Bank with UK charity partners. The pair were on their way back to the UK on Sunday, according to the chief secretary to the Treasury, Darren Jones.The foreign secretary,David Lammy, said in a statement on Saturday: “It is unacceptable, counterproductive, and deeply concerning that two British MPs on a parliamentary delegation to Israel have been detained and refused entry by the Israeli authorities.“I have made clear to my counterparts in the Israeli government that this is no way to treat British parliamentarians, and we have been in contact with both MPs tonight to offer our support.“The UK government’s focus remains securing a return to the ceasefire and negotiations to stop the bloodshed, free the hostages and end the conflict in Gaza.”In a joint statement posted on X, the two MPs said they were “astounded” at being denied entry, and that it was vital for parliamentarians to be able to witness the situation on the ground in Palestine.Dame Emily Thornberry, the chair of the House of Commons foreign affairs committee, said thatIsraelwould “rue the day that they did this to British parliamentarians”.Yang and Mohamed said: “We’re astounded at the unprecedented step taken by the Israeli authorities to refuse British MPs entry on our trip to visit the occupied West Bank. It is vital that parliamentarians are able to witness first-hand the situation in the occupied Palestinian territory.”They added: “We are two, out of scores of MPs, who have spoken out in parliament in recent months on the Israel-Palestine conflict and the importance of complying with international humanitarian law. Parliamentarians should feel free to speak truthfully in the House of Commons without fear of being targeted.”Their deportation comes amid the resumption, after a short truce, of Israel’s offensive in Gaza, in which it has killed 1,249 people since last month, according to the strip’s health ministry. It puts the overall death toll since the war began at 50,609, mostly civilians. The military campaign began after the7 October 2023 attackon southern Israel by Hamas that resulted in 1,218 deaths, mostly civilians, and in which 250 people were taken hostage according to Israel.While the world’s focus has been on Gaza, thePalestinian-Israeli rights group B’tselem has documented64 airstrikes that killed 261 Palestinians – including militant and civilian casualties, and at least 41 minors – in the West Bank since the 7 October attacks. Additionally, military operations in three West Bank refugee camps in Januaryforced 40,000 people from their homes.Describing the two deported MPs as “potential leaders”, Thornberry told the BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme: “They are highly respected parliamentarians, and Israel is badly advised to try to alienate them, to humiliate them, and to treat them in this way because people listen to what these two young women say, and they will do for decades to come.“In my view, Israel really needs to start making friends as opposed to alienating people in this way. I think that it’s an insult to Britain and an insult to parliament.”She added: “I think that they will rue the day that they did this to British parliamentarians. This is the first time that they’ve ever refused MPs access to the country.”The Council for Arab-British Understanding (Caabu) and Medical Aid for Palestinians (Map) said they had organised the delegation to Israel that included Yang and Mohamed and that they had run such trips to the occupied West Bank for more than a decade.Amid the fury at Israel over the MPs’ treatment, the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, also faced criticism after she told Sky News’s Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips programme: “I think that every country should be able to control its borders, and that’s what Israel is doing, as far as I understand.”She said she understood they “were coming in to do something that they were not allowed to do, and so I respect that decision”.In response, Lammy wrote on X: “It’s disgraceful you are cheerleading another country for detaining and deporting two British MPs. Do you say the same about Tory MPs banned from China?”Explore more on these topicsIsraelLabourMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Justice Secretary Angela Constance will chair a meeting this evening.”By 10.20pm on Sunday, the Scottish fire and rescue service (SFRS) confirmed that fire crews had withdrawn from the area due to low light, but planned to resume operations at first light on Monday.Stewart Gibson, the team leader at Galloway mountain rescue, told BBC Scotland fire crews had employed four helicopters to drop water on the flames from above, with the fire front several miles wide at one stage.Rising temperatures across the UK earlier this week led to wildfire warnings being put in place, with the Scottish fire and rescue service saying there was a “very high to extreme risk” of fires spreading because of warm, dry conditions.The service has warned the public to avoid outdoor fires and barbecues, and to dispose of cigarettes and glass safely.Further north in the Highlands, crews were tackling another wildfire north of Ullapool on Sunday with roads closed and heavy smoke hampering visibility.Six crews were in attendance, with personnel travelling almost 70 miles to offer assistance and firefighters at the scene reporting a firewall stretching more than 3 miles and large plumes of smoke descending over the area.Meanwhile, in Northern Ireland, fire brigades were called to the scene of a blaze in County Antrim on Sunday afternoon. Six fire engines attended the incident near Conogher Road, Dervock, while 40 firefighters were involved in tackling the flames.Danny Ard, the group commander for the Northern Ireland fire and rescue service, said the firefighters had utilised “jets” and “specialist wildfire equipment to contain the fire”. It was extinguished at 8pm on Sunday.A significant wildfire that broke out on Saturday and triggered a major incident in Northern Ireland’s Mourne mountains district was extinguished on Sunday morning. One man was arrested by police.More than 100 firefighters and 15 fire appliances were deployed on Saturday to Sandbank Road, Hilltown, to tackle the blaze, which was believed to have been caused deliberately, fire chiefs said.Northern Ireland fire and rescue service said the fire had a front of approximately 2 miles “including a large area of forestry close to property”.Explore more on these topicsScotlandNorthern IrelandnewsShareReuse this content"

They said the study’s findings highlighted the need for “careful monitoring”.Prof Samuele Cortese, the senior lead author of the study, from the University of Southampton, said the risks and benefits of taking any medication had to be assessed together, but for ADHD drugs the risk-benefit ratio was “reassuring”.“We found an overall small increase in blood pressure and pulse for the majority of children taking ADHD medications,” he said. “Other studies show clear benefits in terms of reductions in mortality risk and improvement in academic functions, as well as a small increased risk of hypertension, but not other cardiovascular diseases. Overall, the risk-benefit ratio is reassuring for people taking ADHD medications.”About 3 to 4% of adults and 5% of children in the UK are believed to have ADHD, a neurodevelopmental disorder with symptoms including impulsiveness, disorganisation and difficulty focusing, according to the National Institute forHealthand Care Excellence (Nice).Doctors can prescribe stimulants, such as methylphenidate, of which the best-known brand is Ritalin. Other stimulant medications used to treat ADHD include lisdexamfetamine and dexamfetamine. Non-stimulant drugs include atomoxetine, an sNRI (selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor), and guanfacine.The study of children, adolescents and adults states: “There is uncertainty regarding whether medications that are used for the treatment of ADHD may lead to cardiovascular diseases, and concerns remain around their cardiovascular safety.” It found allADHD medicationswere associated with small increases of blood pressure and heart rate, except guanfacine, which led to decreased blood pressure and heart rate.There were no significant differences regarding the impact on blood pressure and heart rate between stimulants (including methylphenidate and amphetamine) and non-stimulants (atomoxetine and viloxazine). The researchers advised people with existing heart conditions to discuss the side effects of ADHD medications with a specialist cardiologist before starting treatment.Dr Ulrich Müller-Sedgwick, a consultant psychiatrist and expert on ADHD, said most clinicians prescribing ADHD medication understood the cardiovascular risks and followed Nice guidelines for monitoring blood pressure, pulse and weight. “We need more detailed guidelines for scenarios when ADHD medication needs to be adjusted or stopped,” he said.Last year, a thinktank warned that theNHSwas experiencing an“avalanche of need”over autism and ADHD, and said the system in place to cope with surging demand for assessments and treatments was “obsolete”. The number of prescriptions issued in England for ADHD medicationhas risen by 18% year on yearsince the pandemic, with the biggest rise in London.Dr Tony Lord, a former chief executive of the ADHD Foundation, said the long-term benefits of ADHD medication were well established, and included a reduced risk of anxiety and depression, eating disorders, harm from smoking, improved educational outcomes and economic independence.“Sadly ignorance about ADHD medications persists – a throwback to the 80s and 90s when ADHD medications were mistakenly viewed as a morality pill that made naughty, fidgety disruptive children behave – which of course it is not,” he said.“It is simply a cognitive enhancer that improves information processing, inhibits distractions, improves focus, planning and prioritising, self monitoring and reduces impulsivity of thought and action.”Explore more on these topicsAttention deficit hyperactivity disorderChildrenDrugsMedical researchUniversity of SouthamptonHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Ministers will announce measures designed to stimulate growth, such as cutting red tape and removing more planning restrictions.“Global trade is being transformed so we must go further and faster in reshaping our economy and our country through our plan for change,” Starmer will say in a speech in the West Midlands on Monday. “I am determined to back British brilliance. Now more than ever UK businesses and working people need a government that steps up, not stands aside. That means action, not words.”Almost $5tn (£3.9tn) waswiped off the value of global stock marketsafter Trump launched his tariff offensive last Wednesday on the rest of the world, including the10% base dutyon imports into the US from the UK and 20% on goods from the EU, Britain’s largest trading partner.View image in fullscreenJaguar Land Rover is pausing shipments to the US for a month while it considers the impact of the new 25% tariff.Photograph: Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg/Getty ImagesStarmer spent the weekend at Chequers making calls to other world leaders including the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, the incoming German chancellor. Friedrich Merz, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, during which the prime minister reiterated his disappointment at the tariffs.A No 10 spokesperson said: “He updated on his plans to go further and faster to strengthen the UK’s economy and ensure it is as resilient as possible and can withstand these kinds of global shocks. He added that it would be important for the UK to strengthen its trading relationships with others across the globe at the same time.”Ministers hope that talks will restart between US and UK officials on a trade deal, which could result in a lowering of tariffs, although senior MPs have cautioned the government not to give too much ground to Washington.The government is also pressing on with talks for trade deals with other countries including India and China.In the meantime, ministers hope to give British automotive brands such as Rolls-Royce, Vauxhall and Land Rover a degree of stability amid turbulent times. The zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate will be changed to make it easier for industry to upgrade to make electric vehicles.It comes after Jaguar Land Rover’sannouncement that it is pausing shipmentsof its UK-made cars to the US for a month as it considers how to mitigate the cost of Trump’s tariffs. The 25% tariff imposed by the US on imported cars and light trucks took effect on 3 April.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We knew that already on security and defence. It’s now true on global trade, and that’s why we have to go further and faster in investing in the economy and supporting businesses.”He told Sky News that the lower 10% rate facing the UK was a “Brexit dividend”, when the EU had been hit with a 20% tariff, adding: “I’ve struggled to find one in the past but there is one we’ve ended up with.”Amid concerns that online safety laws could be watered down as part of a trade deal with the US, Jones said the “basic protections” of the plans were “not up for negotiation”, adding that the government would not “be walking away from” the idea that digital platforms needed to protect children from harm.Explore more on these topicsAutomotive industryTrump tariffsTrade policyInternational tradeManufacturing sectorElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

When political problems arose, Watson and fellow Labour party organisers would be guided through to comfy sofas in the family sitting room.He said the group, nearly all middle-aged men, would “start babbling” about the latest ructions and discuss how to negotiate multilayeredWest Midlandspolitics involving factions and complex community alliances.Inevitably, Ahmed would turn towards his daughter, who had appeared with a fresh pot of tea. The group soon learned to listen carefully to her suggestions, Watson said.“Shabana would let them know exactly what to do, and when to do it. She would give them the line, clearly and concisely. She could see a problem and cut through it at a young age,” the peer said.Lawyers attack ‘dangerous’ decision to halt Sentencing Council guidelinesRead moreMore than 25 years later, her allies say the same political nous was on display last week when, as lord chancellor, Mahmood forced the Sentencing Council toreverse plansto issue new advice to judges that would have made the ethnicity or faith of an offender a prominent factor when deciding whether to jail them.In a move that instantly undercut the shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick, who had claimed the advice was proof of “two tier” policing, the former barrister told MPs she might “legislate if necessary” to curb the powers of the independent body.She said: “As someone who is from an ethnic minority background myself, I do not stand for any differential treatment before the law.”Criticisms have been led by senior black lawyers and judicial campaigners, some of whom believe she has failed to back the independence of the judiciary and deliberately misinterpreted theSentencingCouncil’s advice to score political points.One barrister said his colleagues are furious at what they see as an effort to pander to Reform voters. “She is taking her lead from the Suella Braverman handbook,” he said, in reference to the hard-right former Tory home secretary.Such digs are unlikely to unsettle Mahmood, who last year fought a bruising general election campaign that resulted in threats and heightened security.Mahmood was born in September 1980 in Birmingham, one of four siblings at the centre of a large Kashmiri community. Her father, originally from Mirpur, worked as a civil engineer while her mother, Zubaida, ran a corner shop, with both taking a close interest in their children’s education.Watson said: “Her dad would get home from work and would gather the children around him, cross-legged. They would each be asked to read for five minutes from The Times.” If they did not understand or mispronounced a word, they were told to look it up.Mahmood went to state schools and read law at Lincoln College, Oxford. She qualified as a barrister, entering parliament in 2010 after becoming theLabourcandidate for Birmingham Ladywood after Clare Short’s resignation.She refused to serve in Jeremy Corbyn’s shadow cabinet and emerged as a reformer and leading supporter of Labour Together after the 2019 general election defeat to Boris Johnson.As a result of the escalating conflict in the Middle East, and criticisms over Starmer’s policies towards Israel-Palestine,Mahmood and her family faced intimidation, harassment and threatsduring the 2024 general election campaign.She returns to Birmingham most weekends where she shares a house with her sister and lives next door to her parents.However, it would be a mistake to believe that she fulfils the stereotype of a demure Asian daughter, according to her friend Lucy Powell, the leader of the House of Commons. “Shabana really enjoys a laugh. She has a wicked sense of humour and would probably swear more than other people in the room,” she said.Since becoming the first Muslim woman and the first Kashmiri to become lord chancellor and justice secretary nine months ago, Mahmood has also led Starmer’s policy to convince the public that more criminals should spend less time in prison and instead be rehabilitated in the community.Less than a week into the job, Mahmood announced the early release of thousands of criminals amid a deepening overcrowding crisis across jails inEnglandand Wales.Her allies are acutely aware that such policies carry daily jeopardies and possible demands for her resignation if a released prisoner commits a serious crime or a jail riot escalates.Powell said: “Shabana came in with probably the most tricky sets of issues from day one of anybody around the cabinet table. She’s had to make some very, very big judgment calls from the off.”If the cabinet could be compared to a football team, Powell, a Manchester City fan, said Mahmood’s role overseeing the criminal justice system would be a central part of the defence. “You don’t really get the glory very often. But if you make a mistake, it’s all on you,” she said. “LikeRúben Dias.”This article was corrected on Saturday 5 April. A previous version stated incorrectly that Shabana Mahmood’s father was a local Labour councillor.Explore more on these topicsShabana MahmoodLabourSentencingUK criminal justicePrisons and probationEnglandBirminghamprofilesShareReuse this content"

Giant ran last year at the Royal Court in London and will transfer to theWest Endlater this month, with Lithgow and Levey resuming their roles.Lithgow thanked the audience for “welcoming me to England” and said “it’s not always easy when you welcome an American into your midst”, highlighting that this moment was “more complicated than usual” for relations between the US and the UK.He remembered seeing Laurence Olivier’s “astounding performance” at the Old Vic in the playDanceof Death in the late 1960s. “I have thought about him and stolen from him in just about every performance I have ever played on stage,” he added.View image in fullscreenCo-presenters Beverley Knight and Billy Porter at the Olivier awards.Photograph: Neil Mockford/WireImageGiant’s tally of three Olivier awards on Sunday night was matched by two musicals:The Curious Case of Benjamin ButtonandFiddler on the Roof.The former, based on the short story by F Scott Fitzgerald and with music and lyrics by Jethro Compton and Darren Clark, won best new musical, outstanding musical contribution (for Clark and Mark Aspinall’s orchestrations and arrangements) and best actor in a musical (John Dagleish as the hero who is born old and grows younger each day). Dagleish, who won an Olivier award in 2015 for portraying Ray Davies in the Kinks musical Sunny Afternoon, said that his late mother had been his “plus one” on that occasion. He dedicated the award to her and said that “she would have loved” The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.Previously stagedat the fringe venue Southwark Playhouse in 2019, it is now running in the West End’s Ambassadors theatre which recently opened its own on-site custom-built pub, the Pickled Crab, named after a Cornish watering hole in the musical.Fiddler on the Roof, which received afive-star Guardian reviewat Regent’s Park Open Air theatre and is transferring to the Barbican next month, had received a total of13 Olivier nominations, equalling arecord set by the musical Hamilton in 2018.The classic musical – composed by Jerry Bock, with lyrics by Sheldon Harnick and book by Joseph Stein – won nine Tony awards in 1965 for its original Broadway production. Director Jordan Fein’s new production won Oliviers for best musical revival, best set design (Tom Scutt) and best sound design (Nick Lidster).The ceremony, which celebrates the cream of London theatre, was hosted by the actorsBeverley Knight, a winner at the 2023 awards, and Billy Porter, who is starring as the Emcee in Cabaret. It opened with Knight and Porter performing Luck Be a Lady from the musical Guys and Dolls.Romola Garai achieved the unusual feat of beating herself to win the award for best actress in a supporting role. She had been nominated twice in that category, recognising her performances in Giant andThe Years.The latter brought her victory. Based on Nobel prize-winner Annie Ernaux’s memoir, The Years (at the Almeida theatre) also received the best director prize, with Norwegian theatre-makerEline Arbobecoming the sixth woman to win that award at the Oliviers.Garai said The Years had been the “greatest privilege of my life” and thanked “my family of Annies” [all the cast share the main role of Annie as well as playing supporting characters]. She called Arbo a “genius” who “put all women’s life on stage”. Garai also thanked her husband for his support while she took on the two productions.View image in fullscreenRomola Garai, winner of the best actress in a supporting role award for The Years.Photograph: Dave Benett/Max Cisotti/Getty ImagesArbo previously directed The Years forInternationaal Theater Amsterdam, the world-renowned company which also staged Robert Icke’s modern-day version of Sophocles’s Oedipusseveral years ago.Oedipus, which Icke directed with a newWest Endcast, won best revival and best actress for Lesley Manville as Jocasta.Icke praised his “24-carat team” including the producer Sonia Friedman, who he said the industry was “lucky to have”. (Garai, too, thanked Friedman, who produced The Years.) The experience of making Oedipus had been joyous for the ensemble, added Icke, who jokingly observed “incest really brings people together”. Manville noted Icke’s “care and precision” as a director in her speech.The award for best actress in a musical went to Imelda Staunton for her roof-raising turn inHello, Dolly!at the Palladium. It was Staunton’s 14th nomination and fifth win at the Oliviers. The most-lauded individual in Olivier awards history is lighting designer Paule Constable, who has received 17 nominations, and won her sixth award for Oliver! (shared with Ben Jacobs). Constable announced her retirement from theatre earlier this year.The prize for best theatre choreographer went toChristopher Wheeldonfor the Michael Jackson bio-drama MJ the Musical, best costume design went to Gabriella Slade for the colourful rollerskating trains inStarlight Express, andMaimuna Memontook the award for best actress in a supporting role in a musical forNatasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812.Lesley Manville calls for better funding for UK regional theatreRead moreLayton Williams, meanwhile, became the first Olivier winner in history to be recognised for portraying an iceberg (he took best supporting actor in a musical for the zanyTitanique). Mark-Anthony Turnage’s Festen at the Royal Opera House won two prizes: best new opera production and outstanding achievement in opera (fortenor Allan Clayton).The National Theatre, the Old Vic and the Coliseum were among the major venues whose shows’ nominations did not result in a win, althoughRufus Norrisreceived a special award for his 10-year tenure as director of the National.Established in 1976, the Olivier awards are overseen by theSociety of London Theatre.

Early in her career, she performed with the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford-upon-Avon and, in 2016, she appeared at Bristol Old Vic with Jeremy Irons in Long Day’s Journey into Night.“Repertory theatres are not funded properly any more,” she said. “There still is a bit of a north-south divide. I’d love to see regional theatres given more funding. When I was starting out, it was amazing. You could go anywhere. It was a real training ground.”Stars come out for theatre’s Olivier awards 2025 – in picturesRead moreOedipus was also named best revival at the awards, and Manville praised adapter and director Robert Icke for his version of Sophocles’ tragedy, about what she called “a complex relationship … to say the least”.Manville added that she was saddened that “some young actors are not encouraged to go and do plays anywhere. Just do it!”Theatre, she said, was a vital training ground and offered opportunities unmatched by screen work. “You will learn more by stepping foot on stage, where you can’t be edited,” she said. “Nobody’s going to hold your hand, you’re on your own, and you’ve got to make it work.”Earlier this year, the charity Theatres Trust published its annualregister of buildings“at risk”, with 43 facing threats including closure and severe decay, but which have the potential to be revived for their communities.In December,analysis by the Campaign for the Arts alliancerevealed that local government culture spending per person in England had been cut by more than 50% since 2009-10.In February, thegovernment announceda £270m Arts Everywhere Fund for arts venues, with more than 85% dedicated to urgent building works and infrastructure upgrades.Explore more on these topicsTheatreArts fundingLesley ManvilleOlivier awardsnewsShareReuse this content"

She told Fox News Sunday that in her opinion the president was a “very smart man, and we, I wish we could have him for 20 years as our president”.She then added: “But I think he’s going to be finished, probably, after this term. We’d have to look at the constitution, and it would be a heavy lift.”The two-term limit was set into stone in 1951 with the ratification by the states of the22nd amendment. It says that “no person shall be elected to the office of the president more than twice”.The restriction was introduced in the wake of Franklin Roosevelt’s unprecedented record of serving three full presidential terms during the second world war. He won a fourth term but died in 1945 just one year into it.Bondi’s comment that it would be a “heavy lift” for Trump to overcome the two-term rule was a reference to what it would take to change the US constitution and revoke the 22nd amendment. Any reform to the text of the constitution requires a two-thirds vote from both chambers of Congress, combined with ratification by three-quarters of the 50 states.In today’s highly polarized political world, such a scenario is beyond imagination.Constitutional change aside, Trump’s cryptic remarks about other “methods” haveprompted speculationabout his intentions. One tactic that has attracted some attention would be for the vice-president, JD Vance, to run as Republican presidential candidate in 2028, with Trump as his running mate.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There is a major snag, however.The12th amendment, which lays out procedures for electing both the president and vice-president, states that “no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States”. The clear implication is that Trump, debarred from running for a third term as president, would equally be debarred from running for vice-president – rendering the ruse null and void.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationPam BondiDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

She was later sent to the Yuma station in Arizona where she stayed until her death on 29 March.The Tucson Sentinelfirst reportedthe woman’s death, saying that border patrol officials did not follow internal policies about publicly acknowledging the death of someone in custody – and then only provided a statement after the Sentinel made inquiries.Yuma sector border patrol reported in asocial media postthat two people – a 38-year-old man and the woman, both Chinese nationals – had been arrested on 26 March during a vehicle stop near Needles, California. The agents seized more than $220,000 wrapped in aluminum foil in two duffel bags which officials say was the proceeds from unspecified illegal activity.Jayapal said “initial reports” suggest border patrol agents failed to perform required welfare checks prior to the woman’s death.“When Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents take a person into custody, they are responsible for their well-being, full stop,” Jayapal’s statement read. “This detainee died by suicide, and initial reports have indicated that certain CBP procedures to ensure the safety and welfare of individuals in custody were not conducted.”Jayapal, a ranking member of the House subcommittee overseeingimmigration, said that while welfare checks were logged, officials investigating the death could not verify whether the checks had actually happened.According to Jayapal’s statement, surveillance footage showed the woman create a noose and tie it around her neck – but no medical response occurred for nearly two hours.“As the CBP’s Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) investigates this death, they must provide answers on why these welfare checks were not conducted and falsely recorded, and why this woman was able to die by suicide without any guard intervention,” Jayapal said.She further expressed concern for the conditions at detainment facilities amid an immigration crackdown that the secondTrump administrationhas carried out during its first three months in office.The congresswoman said reports have consistently shown that the US falls short of its obligations to “treat all detained people with dignity and fairness”.A border patrol spokesperson told the Tucson Sentinel that the woman was found “unresponsive in a cell” at the Yuma border patrol station on 29 March. Border patrol staff provided medical assistance to the woman before emergency medical services transported her to the hospital where she was pronounced dead, the spokesperson told the Sentinel.“All in-custody deaths are tragic, taken seriously, and are thoroughly investigated by CBP,” the spokesperson said.In the US, you can call or text theNational Suicide Prevention Lifelineat 988, chat on988lifeline.org, ortext HOMEto 741741 to connect with a crisis counselor.

Tornadoes are possible in Alabama, Georgia and Florida, forecasters said.The 18 reported deaths since the start of the storms on Wednesday included 10 in Tennessee. A nine-year-old boy in Kentucky was caught up in floodwaters while walking to catch his school bus. A five-year-old boy in Arkansas died after a tree fell on his family’s home and trapped him, police said. A 16-year-old volunteer firefighter in Missouridiedin a crash while seeking to rescue people caught in the storm.Torrential rain and flash flooding follow deadly tornadoes as storms rage in central USRead moreThe National Weather Service (NWS) said on Sunday dozens of locations in multiple states were expected to reach a “major flood stage”, with extensive flooding of structures, roads, bridges and other critical infrastructure possible.There were 521 domestic and international flights cancelled within the US, and more than 6,400 were delayed on Saturday, according to FlightAware.com. The website reported 74 cancellations and 478 delays of US flights early on Sunday.The storms come afterDonald Trump’sadministrationhascut jobs at NWS forecast offices, leaving half of them with vacancy rates of about 20%, or double the level of a decade ago.Officials warned of flash flooding and tornadoes on Saturday across Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee and Kentucky. All of eastern Kentucky was under a flood watch through Sunday morning.In north-central Kentucky, emergency officials ordered a mandatory evacuation for Falmouth and Butler, towns near the bend of the rising Licking river. Thirty years ago, the river reached a record 50ft (15 meters), resulting in five deaths and 1,000 homes destroyed.The NWS said 5.06in (nearly 13 cm) of rain fell on Saturday in Jonesboro, Arkansas – making it the wettest day ever recorded in April in the city, dating back to 1893.As of early Sunday, Memphis had received 14in (35cm) of rain since Wednesday, the NWS said. West Memphis, Arkansas, received 10in (25cm).Forecasters attributed the violent weather to warm temperatures, an unstable atmosphere, strong winds and abundant moisture streaming from the Gulf.In Dyersburg, Tennessee, dozens of people arrived on Saturday at a storm shelter near a public school in the rain, clutching blankets, pillows and other necessities.Among them was George Manns, 77, who said he was in his apartment when he heard a tornado warning and decided to head to the shelter. Just days earlier the city was hit by a tornado that caused millions of dollars in damage.“I grabbed all my stuff and came here,” said Mann, who brought a folding chair, two bags of toiletries, laptops, iPads and medications. “I don’t leave them in my apartment in case my apartment is destroyed.

If the intention was to calm nerves with a clear statement of intent, then it backfired as top officials gave starkly contrasting signals.Howard Lutnick, the billionaire commerce secretary, struck an aggressive note on CBS News’s Face the Nation in which he portrayed the tariffs as here to stay. Asked whether there was a chance that tariffs would be postponed to allow countries to negotiate a deal with Washington, he replied: “There is no postponing – they are definitely going to stay in place for days and weeks, that is sort of obvious.”Markets brace for volatile week as leaders weigh up retaliation to Trump’s tariffsRead moreLutnick added that Trump intended to “reset global trade”.“The president has made it crystal, crystal clear,” he said.However, two other cabinet members gave the opposite take, suggesting that negotiations with individual countries were very much on the cards.Scott Bessent, the treasury secretary, told Meet the Press on NBC News that Trump had “created maximum leverage for himself, and more than 50 countries have approached the administration about lowering their non-tariff trade barriers, lowering their tariffs, stopping currency manipulation”.The agriculture secretary, Brooke Rollins, echoed Bessent by flagging up possible talks. “We’ve got 50 countries that are burning the phone lines into the White House,” she told CNN’s State of the Union.The scale of Trump’s tariffs have sent shockwaves around the world, catching US investors as well as top Republican politicians by surprise. In just two days last week, more than $6tn was wiped offWall Street’smarket value.Trump told US consumers in a post on his Truth Social network to “hang tough, it won’t be easy, but the end result will be historic”. Yet as he spent the weekend golfing at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, his unprecedented tax increase goaded seniorRepublicansto speak out, in a vanishingly rare display of criticism of their leader.Trump’s former vice-president,Mike Pence, denounced the tariffs as the “largest peacetime tax hike in US history”. Thom Tillis, the Republican senator from North Carolina, said: “Anyone who says there may be a little bit of pain before we get things right needs to talk to farmers who are one crop away from bankruptcy.”Ted Cruz, a senator from Texas, warned of a“bloodbath” for Republicansin the 2026 midterm elections should the tariffs force the US into recession.Democrats are detecting opportunity in such unusual challenges to Trump from within his own party. Adam Schiff, the Democratic senator from California, floated on Meet the Press what sounded like a draft campaign strategy for the midterms.“If we head into a recession, it will be the Trump recession,” he said. Of Trump, Schiff also said: “He’s wrecking our economy.”Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota who ran as the Democrats’ vice-presidential candidate in last November’s defeat to Trump, called the tariffs “really, really terrifying” on State of the Union. He warned that if you punish dependable trading partners like Mexico and Canada, “they don’t come back overnight.”As the tariffs kick in, analysts are increasingly pointing to the chances of a recession, which is normally assessed as being two consecutive quarters of falling GDP. The head of economic research at JP Morgan, Bruce Kasman, has raised the probability of global recession to 60%, a figure that he includedin a memotitled There Will Be Blood.Larry Summers, the US treasury secretary during Bill Clinton’s presidency, called the tariffs the “biggest self-inflicted wound we’ve put on our economy in history”. Speaking on ABC News’s This Week, he gave his own estimate of the total loss to US consumers at $30tn – equivalent to doubling petrol prices at the pump.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Rollins said the markets weren’t crashing – they were “adjusting”.Asked what he would say to Americans close to retirement who had just watched their lifetime savings drop significantly in recent days, Bessent called that a “false narrative”.“Americans who want to retire right now, they don’t look at the day-to-day fluctuations of what’s happening,” Bessent said.Americans braced for era of uncertainty as Trump doubles down on tariffsRead moreBessent’s answer was coloured, perhaps, by his own net worth, which has been put at more than $521m.There were moments of the surreal in the exchanges between Trump’s top officials and the political show hosts. Asked by CNN’s Jake Tapper why 10% tariffs had been placed onHeard Island and McDonald Islands, which are populated by penguins near Antarctica but no humans, Rollins said: “I mean, come on, whatever. Listen, the people that are leading this are serious, intentional, patriotic – the smartest people I’ve ever worked with.”Tapper then pushed back on the agriculture secretary’s justification for the 20% “reciprocal” tariffs that have been imposed on EU goods sold to the US. Rollins said that Honduras bought more pork from the US than the entire European Union.Tapper pointed out that the EU had tight restrictions on hormone use in livestock production. The EU banned use of synthetic hormones in 1981, and blocked imports of animals that had been treated in that way.Rollins then accused the EU of using “fake science” to prohibit US products. “That’s just absolute bull,” she said. “We produce the safest, the most secure, the best food in the world.”Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsDonald TrumpTrump administrationRepublicansDemocratsMike PenceUS economynewsShareReuse this content"

Now the likes of Musk and Bezos are in controlSun 6 Apr 2025 13.00 EDTShareJust days beforeDonald Trump’s inauguration in January, Blue Origin, the space company owned by billionaireJeff Bezos, launched its New Glenn rocket, named for John Glenn, the Mercury astronaut who was the first American to orbit the Earth. Around 2am on 16 January, the 30-story rocket powered by seven engines blasted off into the Florida night from Cape Canaveral’s historic launch complex 36, which first served as a Nasa launch site in 1962.The flight’s end was marred by a failure to bring the booster rocket back for further use, but the successful launch and orbit still marked a watershed moment forBlue Originin its bid to compete with SpaceX, the company owned by Elon Musk, for dominance over American spy satellite operations. During the Trump administration, it is likely that both companies will play significant roles in placing spy satellites into Earth orbit, which could mean that the United States intelligence community will be beholden to both Bezos and Musk to handle the single most complex and expensive endeavor in modern espionage.In fact, Musk and Bezos are in a position during the Trump administration to personally exert significant influence over the direction of the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency and the rest of theUS national securityapparatus. The two pro-Trump billionaires have already been awarded massive contracts with the US intelligence community, including some that predate Trump’s first term in office.The emergence of Musk, Bezos and a handful of other pro-Trump billionaires as key players in US intelligence marks a radical change in US spy operations, which have traditionally been controlled by career government officials working closely with a few longstanding defense and intelligence contractors, giant corporations such as Lockheed Martin, RTX and Northrop Grumman that are adept at lobbying both Democrats and Republicans in Washington. But with Musk, Bezos and other pro-Trump Silicon Valley figures gaining an edge through their personal ties to Trump, civil servants in the intelligence community may be reluctant to deny them ever-larger contracts, especially since Trump has already fired several inspectors general who investigated Musk’s businesses in other areas of the government.Anticipating big rewards, Musk is reportedly joining forces with other pro-Trump billionaires to try to carve up the defense and intelligence business. SpaceX is working with Palantir, a hi-tech data analytics intelligence contractor co-founded by Peter Thiel, one of the most prominent rightwing figures in Silicon Valley; Anduril, a new defense contractor founded by 32-year-old pro-Trump tech bro Palmer Luckey; and several other Silicon Valley firms toform a consortiumgeared towards loosening the grip of the defense industry’s traditional players.Tech leaders eager to get into intelligence contracting have long complained that the business has become so consolidated around a few big players that it is nearly impossible for outsiders to compete, leading to a lack of innovation. “Consolidation bred conformity,” argued Shyam Sankar, the chief technology officer of Palantir, in a widely read public memo,The Defense Reformation.Swapping one oligarchy for anotherIt is hard to separate Silicon Valley’s calls for breaking up the oligarchy now controlling the defense and intelligence business from the eagerness of pro-Trump tech bros to grab as much power and cash as possible while creating a new oligarchy of their own.“The idea of overturning the contracting process did intrigue me, but now, under Trump, I think it is just about greed,” observed Greg Treverton, a former director of the National Intelligence Council, the intelligence community’s top analytical arm. “Now, with Trump, it is mostly about money and connections.”In the eyes of their critics, tech entrepreneurs offer a simplistic, black-and-white picture of the defense and intelligence business in which Silicon Valley conveniently has all the answers.“Beware the instant expert,” said Peter Singer, a defense analyst at the New America Foundation. “It’s like they are saying ‘I watched a YouTube video and now I know everything.’ They have this narrative that only Silicon Valley can drive innovation.”Elon Musk, satellite spymasterAs he eagerly slashes and burns through the ranks of federal employees with his Doge apparatus, Musk has emerged as the most powerful and polarizing figure in the Trump administration. But what is less well known is that Musk has also gained an influential role in the US intelligence community despite never having served inside the spy world.Musk’sSpaceXhas already become one of the main rocket contractors launching American spy satellites and is seeking to overcome the edge held by United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin, the traditional giant in the niche. In addition, Starlink, Musk’s commercial satellite communication network, is playing a critical role in US foreign policy, providing internet service in remote regions of the world including in Ukraine, where it operates a communications network for the Ukrainian army. Starlink’s role in the Ukraine war has placed Musk squarely in the middle of the dispute between Trump and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Meanwhile, questions about whether Musk is assuming a dual role as both a player in Trump’s national security policymaking and a major contractor grew after he received a private briefing at the Pentagon on 21 March and visited the CIA headquarters 10 days later.SpaceX has a head start over Blue Origin in the spy satellite business, and Musk has a big lead over Bezos in Trump world. But Blue Origin and Bezos are working hard to catch up in both.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Since the 2024 election, though, Bezos has turned himself into a Trump booster, lavishing praise and large donations on the president while also working to transform the Washington Post’s opinion page, which he says should focus on “personal liberties and free markets”.Bezos’s move into an alliance with Trump has put him in a position to expand his reach into the spy satellite business while also protecting the large stake he already holds in other aspects of intelligence. The billionaire, the second-richest person in the world after Musk, has been involved in the spy world for more than a decade through Amazon Web Services, a cloud computing subsidiary of Amazon, which Bezos founded and where he remains executive chair. Amazon Web Services has managed the CIA’s classified cloud since it won a $600m contract with the spy agency in 2013, and dramatically expanded its intelligence role when it was awarded a $10bn contract to manage the NSA’s classified cloud in 2022 through a program code-named “Wild and Stormy”.Palmer Luckey and Silicon Valley’s clique of young defense contractorsPlenty of other Silicon Valley billionaires are also seeking to crowd into Washington alongside Musk and Bezos. Palantir’s Thiel is a mentor of the vice-president, JD Vance, and his firm has a longstanding relationship with the intelligence community that is likely to expand under Trump. The CIA’s investment firm, In-Q-Tel, was one of the early backers of Palantir after its 2003 founding, and the company has had a major role in the development of data integration and data analytics systems for the intelligence community. Palantir is nowseeking a broader rolein developing AI for both the Pentagon and the intelligence community.Luckey, who made his name as a virtual reality entrepreneur by founding Oculus, has become a prominent new face at the intersection of Trump world and national security. Luckey’s Anduril now has a contract with the US army to develop battlefield virtual reality headsets, which would allow data to be sent directly to soldiers while also allowing them to control unmanned drones and other weapons. In addition, Anduril won a $642m contract with the Marine Corps to develop countermeasures against small drones in March. Luckey first supported Trump in 2016, when that was an unpopular position in Silicon Valley, but now that Trump is back, he has said that he’s on an “I told you so tour”, trumpeting his America-first political views.Luckey said in a recentinterview: “I don’t think the United States needs to be the world police. It needs to be the world’s gun store.”Google once committed to not building artificial intelligence for weapons or surveillance in a watershed moment of divorcing tech from the defense and intelligence industry. Earlier this year, though,the company scrapped that pledge. The campaign by the tech bros to win bigger roles for themselves in defense and intelligence represents a return to Silicon Valley’s roots. Hi-tech originally grew in northern California because of its early connections to the military and defense industrial base in the region, observed Margaret O’Mara, a tech industry historian at the University of Washington.“Silicon Valley has always been in the business of war,” O’Mara said.Explore more on these topicsUS national securityElon MuskJeff BezosSpaceXBlue OriginDonald TrumpEspionageanalysisShareReuse this content"

If the intention was to calm nerves with a clear statement of intent, then it backfired as top officials gave starkly contrasting signals.Howard Lutnick, the billionaire commerce secretary, struck an aggressive note on CBS News’s Face the Nation in which he portrayed the tariffs as here to stay. Asked whether there was a chance that tariffs would be postponed to allow countries to negotiate a deal with Washington, he replied: “There is no postponing – they are definitely going to stay in place for days and weeks, that is sort of obvious.”Markets brace for volatile week as leaders weigh up retaliation to Trump’s tariffsRead moreLutnick added that Trump intended to “reset global trade”.“The president has made it crystal, crystal clear,” he said.However, two other cabinet members gave the opposite take, suggesting that negotiations with individual countries were very much on the cards.Scott Bessent, the treasury secretary, told Meet the Press on NBC News that Trump had “created maximum leverage for himself, and more than 50 countries have approached the administration about lowering their non-tariff trade barriers, lowering their tariffs, stopping currency manipulation”.The agriculture secretary, Brooke Rollins, echoed Bessent by flagging up possible talks. “We’ve got 50 countries that are burning the phone lines into the White House,” she told CNN’s State of the Union.The scale of Trump’s tariffs have sent shockwaves around the world, catching US investors as well as top Republican politicians by surprise. In just two days last week, more than $6tn was wiped offWall Street’smarket value.Trump told US consumers in a post on his Truth Social network to “hang tough, it won’t be easy, but the end result will be historic”. Yet as he spent the weekend golfing at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, his unprecedented tax increase goaded seniorRepublicansto speak out, in a vanishingly rare display of criticism of their leader.Trump’s former vice-president,Mike Pence, denounced the tariffs as the “largest peacetime tax hike in US history”. Thom Tillis, the Republican senator from North Carolina, said: “Anyone who says there may be a little bit of pain before we get things right needs to talk to farmers who are one crop away from bankruptcy.”Ted Cruz, a senator from Texas, warned of a“bloodbath” for Republicansin the 2026 midterm elections should the tariffs force the US into recession.Democrats are detecting opportunity in such unusual challenges to Trump from within his own party. Adam Schiff, the Democratic senator from California, floated on Meet the Press what sounded like a draft campaign strategy for the midterms.“If we head into a recession, it will be the Trump recession,” he said. Of Trump, Schiff also said: “He’s wrecking our economy.”Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota who ran as the Democrats’ vice-presidential candidate in last November’s defeat to Trump, called the tariffs “really, really terrifying” on State of the Union. He warned that if you punish dependable trading partners like Mexico and Canada, “they don’t come back overnight.”As the tariffs kick in, analysts are increasingly pointing to the chances of a recession, which is normally assessed as being two consecutive quarters of falling GDP. The head of economic research at JP Morgan, Bruce Kasman, has raised the probability of global recession to 60%, a figure that he includedin a memotitled There Will Be Blood.Larry Summers, the US treasury secretary during Bill Clinton’s presidency, called the tariffs the “biggest self-inflicted wound we’ve put on our economy in history”. Speaking on ABC News’s This Week, he gave his own estimate of the total loss to US consumers at $30tn – equivalent to doubling petrol prices at the pump.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Rollins said the markets weren’t crashing – they were “adjusting”.Asked what he would say to Americans close to retirement who had just watched their lifetime savings drop significantly in recent days, Bessent called that a “false narrative”.“Americans who want to retire right now, they don’t look at the day-to-day fluctuations of what’s happening,” Bessent said.Americans braced for era of uncertainty as Trump doubles down on tariffsRead moreBessent’s answer was coloured, perhaps, by his own net worth, which has been put at more than $521m.There were moments of the surreal in the exchanges between Trump’s top officials and the political show hosts. Asked by CNN’s Jake Tapper why 10% tariffs had been placed onHeard Island and McDonald Islands, which are populated by penguins near Antarctica but no humans, Rollins said: “I mean, come on, whatever. Listen, the people that are leading this are serious, intentional, patriotic – the smartest people I’ve ever worked with.”Tapper then pushed back on the agriculture secretary’s justification for the 20% “reciprocal” tariffs that have been imposed on EU goods sold to the US. Rollins said that Honduras bought more pork from the US than the entire European Union.Tapper pointed out that the EU had tight restrictions on hormone use in livestock production. The EU banned use of synthetic hormones in 1981, and blocked imports of animals that had been treated in that way.Rollins then accused the EU of using “fake science” to prohibit US products. “That’s just absolute bull,” she said. “We produce the safest, the most secure, the best food in the world.”Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsDonald TrumpTrump administrationRepublicansDemocratsMike PenceUS economynewsShareReuse this content"

All three of them complement each other so well. They all have such unique skill sets.”Bueckers capped her stellar career with the Huskies’ first championship since 2016, ending a nine-year title drought for the team. That was longest barren stretch for Auriemma and his Huskies since the team won their first championship in 1995 led by Rebecca Lobo.NCAA Tournament: Houston’s epic comeback beats Duke to set up Florida finalRead moreSince then the Huskies have had dominant championship runs, including in the early 2000s led by Sue Bird and Diana Taurasi, 2009-10 with Maya Moore and finally the four straight from 2013-16 with Breanna Stewart. All were in attendance in Florida on Sunday to see the Huskies’ latest title.“These players make me want to hang in there every day ... It’s been a long time since I’ve been this emotional [after a game],” said Auriemma.Finally healthy, Bueckers – the expected No 1 overall pick in this year’s WNBA draft – delivered for the Huskies throughout their championship season.It was the only thing missing from her incredible UConn career that was slowed by injuries. She was the first freshman to win AP Player of the Year before missing much of her sophomore season with a tibial plateau fracture and meniscus tear. She then tore an ACL before the next season.Auriemma and Bueckers hugged as the Huskies sealed their victory. Asked what he had said to his star player, Auriemma replied: “I love you, that’s all I could say.”UConn closed the first half of Sunday’s game up 10 points and then put the game away in the third quarter behind Fudd, Strong and Bueckers. The trio combined for 23 of the team’s 26 points in the quarter. UConn were up 50-39 with 3:21 left in the period before closing with a 12-3 run to put the game away.Fudd and Strong got it started with back-to-back threes, and the rout was on. Auriemma subbed Bueckers, Fudd and Strong out with 1:32 left. Bueckers and Auriemma had a long hug on the sideline, having finally gotten the championship that he so wanted for her.Dawn Staley’s team were trying for a third title in four years and fourth overall. It would have tied her with Kim Mulkey for third most behind Auriemma and former Tennessee Hall of Fame coach Pat Summitt, who had eight.The Huskies’ last title game appearance came in 2022 when Staley’s team beat UConn to start the Gamecocks’ current run of success, a game that ended Auriemma’s perfect record in title games.Explore more on these topicsNCAA TournamentCollege basketballCollege sportsBasketballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

He was talking about Alex Ovechkin, who the team picked first overall that night. “How good will he be?” Mahoney asked. “Time will tell.” Now, nearly 21 years later, time has had its say. On Sunday afternoon in a game against the New York Islanders,Ovechkin scored his 895th goal, passing Wayne Gretzky’s all-time NHL scoring record, a tally that had stood since 29 March 1999 and that few believed would ever be broken.Alex Ovechkin breaks Wayne Gretzky’s all-time NHL scoring record with 895th goalRead moreHad things been slightly different in 2004, we might have been having this conversation a year ago. TheNHLseason after Ovechkin’s draft – the 2004-05 campaign – never happened, replaced instead by a long dispute between the league and the players’ union. Ovechkin bided his time in Russia, where he played 37 games with Dynamo Moscow. Finally, in autumn of 2005, he stepped on to NHL ice for Washington and, as Mahoney – and everyone else – expected by that time, he proved immediately to be a very good player. Ovechkin scored two goals in his first game, the first of an eventual 52 on the season (alongside 54 assists).Two charts, A line chart on top of a bar chart. In the line chart a gray line trend above a red line before meeting at the same level on the y-axis. The bar chart shows red bars of similar height, while the gray bars start high and then fall off.That rookie year tally included what is still regarded as one of the most impressive, and improbable, goals of all time. During a game against the Phoenix Coyotes, Ovechkin somehow scored while sliding along the ice on his back, facing away from the Coyotes net. “It was unbelievable,” Auston Matthews, who was eight at the time and at the game that night,later recalled. “Nobody really cheered, they really couldn’t get their heads wrapped around what just happened. It was pretty crazy.” Also not cheering was the coach standing behind the Coyotes’ bench that night: Wayne Gretzky.When Ovechkin helped bring the Stanley Cup to Washington in 2018, the first in the team’s history, he fulfilled the expectations that had followed him for his 12 NHL seasons to that point. And it certainly seemed like he knew it. Nobody celebrated with the Cupquite like Ovi did– nor, frankly, has anyone done it with the same reckless abandon since. The Cup also meant that Ovechkin solidified himself among the greats – as a man capable of scoring, but also winning. On that count, until Ovi began to close in on Gretzky’s goal record, he was most closely compared to Sidney Crosby, who entered the NHL a season after Ovechkin. The two have never been exactly stylistically identical, yet their points totals have tracked alongeerily similar trajectoriesfor the entirety of their careers. But until the Caps’ Cup, Crosby – with three championships – was usually regarded as the more accomplished player overall. While Ovechkin’s goal record may not fully balance things out, it seems fitting that, with it, the two players will likely be regarded in the long run as equals – the best examples of what the NHL has to offer.Et tu, Wayne: Gretzky’s legacy in Canada takes hit over 4 Nations snubRead moreOn the ice, anyway. Elsewhere, Ovechkin’s astonishing playing career may always be accompanied by an asterisk: a note about his unsavory, full-throated support for Vladimir Putin. In 2017, Ovechkinlaunched Putin Team, a social movement that, as he wrote in an Instagram post at the time, “unites people who are proud of their country and want to make Russia stronger.” It went on to say that Putin Team was for people who valued Putin’s “trust in and respect for his people, his fairness [and] righteousness, and the fact that he really cares.” Ovechkin recruited other Russian athletes to the cause, including Crosby’s longtime Pittsburgh Penguins teammate, Evgeny Malkin. In a separate post at the time, Ovechkin wrote that “I never hid my relationship with [Putin], always openly supported him.” Indeed, Ovechkin stood alongside Putin in his Instagram profile photo.In 2022, after Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine, Ovechkin was less open about the closeness of that relationship, but fell well short of criticizing the Russian leader. Unlike fellow Russian NHLer Artemi Panarin –who said, among other things, that Putin “no longer understands what’s right and what’s wrong” – Ovechkin only said that he didn’t want to see anyone get hurt or killed in the conflict and that he hoped “it was going to be over and we are going to be living in a good world.” As for whether he still supported Putin,Ovechkin said, “Well, he’s my president, but [like] I said, I’m not in politics, I’m an athlete.”Obviously, that’s never really been true for Ovechkin, but it also feels increasingly that it can’t be true for anyone. When Ovi started out, perhaps athletes could more easily separate their sport persona with the world beyond the game. But over the course of the two decades of Ovechkin’s career, the political and cultural environment has changed significantly, as has the broad perspective of past actions. Now, nobody is free from scrutiny, and whatever dotted line that some athletes once tried to draw between politics from sports in the past, is now gone. Even Gretzky isn’t immune. Where for decades Gretzky was considered untouchable, his own recent close association with a controversial politician, Donald Trump,has undermined his greatnessin the eyes of many of his fellow Canadians. The Great One is now, as they say, The Great Once.Ovechkin is still great, as far as the hockey goes. That’s undeniable. But just as on his draft day only time could tell how great a player he’d be, history will now dictate how great he is ultimately considered to have been. When he talked to reporters after the game in Phoenix in 2006 where Ovechkin scored his greatest goal, Gretzkysaidit was “pretty nice.” “He’s a phenomenal player ... He deserves all the accolades he’s getting.” That’s still true. But by the same token, he will deserve everything else, too.Explore more on these topicsNHLWashington CapitalsIce hockeyUS sportsCanadafeaturesShareReuse this content"

He had qualified in eighth and, despite attempting an alternative strategy using the hard tyre to open, made up only one place, albeit with one of the few on-track overtaking moves, to pass Isack Hadjar in the Alpine.Max Verstappen defies McLaren duo to win fourth straight Japanese F1 GPRead moreHamilton struggled at the first round in Australia andwas disqualified from the last race in Chinafor excessive wear to the skid block on his car. He did takevictory in the sprint race in Shanghaibut certainly Ferrari are far from where they want to be, with expectations that they could be in title contention this season given their strong end to 2024.Hamilton believes his teammate Charles Leclerc’s side of the garage is better adapting to the car. “I’m really hoping in the next race we’ll see hopefully some positive changes,” he said. “Through the first three races there’s been a bit of a deficit between both sides of the garage on some elements of the car. On my side, underperforming. With what I had, that is the best result I could get.”He is still acclimatising to his new team and has repeatedly said that it would be a gradual process but, three races in, he clearly feelsFerrarishould be making greater steps, even by the race next weekend in Bahrain. “My pace was maximum today. I didn’t have anything else in the car,” he said. “Underperformance happening at the rear of the car this weekend and obviously qualifying position is key. I’m hoping the next race we will be closer. It will definitely be interesting for sure.“I just hope we’re a little bit closer but I think we are probably the fourth fastest at the moment and I think we are a little bit off the other guys in terms of performance, downforce-level wise. So we’ve got some work to do to close the gap.”The Ferrari team principal, Frédéric Vasseur, said his team were two to three-tenths down in qualifying and the same margin back in race pace but believed they could bridge that gap. “Last year we were able to come back. The first couple of races, we were six-tenths off on average and we were able to come back during the season,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The much‑promised collapse. The improbable, but somehow also deserved andcollectively willeddisintegration of these champions by default. Something like that anyway. Tell you what though.Fulhamare good aren’t they? And particularly so, it should be said, for a team that started the day 10th in an apparently mediocre league. Or is that not part of the story?At the end of a fun,boisterous 3‑2 victoryfor Marco Silva’s excellent, vigorous upper‑midtable team thetalk will of course be about Liverpool, and not necessarily in a very flattering way.Rodrigo Muniz bullies past Van Dijk as leaders Liverpool falter at FulhamRead moreSince the start of March Liverpool’s progress towards the league title has been expressed in a run of routine almost-there wins, a series of this-must-be-it moments, reminiscent of one of those lovelorn phone conversations where nobody wants to be the person to hang up. No, you say the title race is over. No you.A trip to Fulham in the gentle sun had looked like another edge along that route, another of these mini-climaxes. But defeat will at least give fuel to the energetically pursued discussion around Liverpool’s season, the debate about worthiness and deserved success.Never mind that Arne Slot’s team can afford to lose here and remain 11 points clear with seven to play. This game was also a no‑win situation, in a very modern, very online kind of way. Win at Craven Cottage and this would become yet another sign the league is a walkover, too easy, and that Liverpool are not great champions. Lose at Craven Cottage and this can now also become yet another sign the league is a walkover, too easy, and Liverpool are not great champions.Football: never knowingly done or decided, no matter what the numbers might say. This has always been part of its appeal, and part of its madness too.And this was in the end just a really good game.Craven Cottage on a sunny Sunday is like English football in an American movie: cobble-close and homespun but also clean and quaint. A place where everyone is Hugh Grant, Liz Hurley or their quirky and warm-hearted sidekick.Liverpool looked good early on. The opening goal was an easy, sunlit thing. Alexis Mac Allister bumping Sander Berge away, taking a touch and shooting hard and flat into the far corner.At which point, when the day might have started to fall apart, Liverpool encountered instead undeterred opponents, plus half an hour of Alex Iwobi in unstoppable form.View image in fullscreenRodrigo Muniz (centre) celebrates with teammates after scoring Fulham’s third goal.Photograph: Henry Nicholls/AFP/Getty ImagesThe equaliser came from a nice drive down the right, helped by Curtis Jones not being a career full-back, unable to stop himself deflecting the ball to Andreas Pereira. The second goal involved Andy Robertson giving the ball to Iwobi not once but twice, then running across to deflect his shot into the goal. The third Fulham goal had Rodrigo Muniz taking a wonderful touch away from Virgil van Dijk before finishing really nicely.What does it mean? We already know this because opinions are set. The main upshot will be an opportunity to pull apart Liverpool’s season a bit more, and indeed the Premier League itself, which is, we keep hearing, uniquely bad this time. At the weekend one pundit even suggested Slot doesn’t deserve to win manager of the year for that reason.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Perhaps from boredom, the need to fill the rolling news hours. Perhaps from years of stratification masked by title races where two teams peak at the same time, thereby retaining a sellable product, despite the fact the same two teams winning every week doesn’t actually suggest a strong competition.There are a lot of questions here. Why is three promoted teams with good players struggling to win a game taken as a sign of weakness, not strength? PerhapsNewcastle’s Carabao Cup gloryshould also be downgraded because the quality has never been so low. Dan Burn, throw your medals in the bin.In reality the league is notably strong this season, the mid-tier better than it has been for years, as it should be with vast broadcast income. Fulham, Bournemouth, Aston Villa, Brighton, Brentford: these are excellent teams. Five English clubs are still in Europe.There is a kind of boomerism nostalgia at work here, a sense of where-is-my-great-English-football-of-yesteryear. What we’re really talking about is an absence of major brands, no United, no Spurs, no City. Tell you what, music is rubbish now too. When was the last time the Eagles made an album? There was a band. Chelsea with John Terry. Proper football.Slot is the most wronged party in all this. Here he still looked waspish and well-groomed, like the energetic mayor of a small French town about to cut the ribbon on the regional harvest festival. And his impact so far is hugely impressive. Winning the league in your first season by improving players. No major signings. Doing it all with the eternally startled Darwin Núñez as your back-up striker.Liverpool will no doubt regroup from here. Perhaps they really will begin to lose games and limp over the line. If they do, the reason will be clear enough – strength, not weakness – as it was against an excellent Fulham team here.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolFulhamArne SlotanalysisShareReuse this content"

The second-to-last attempt was a step-back jumper in the lane by Flagg that J’Wan Roberts disrupted. The last was a desperation heave by Tyrese Proctor that caught nothing at the buzzer.It was Roberts’ two free throws with 19.6 seconds left that gave the Cougars their first lead since the score was 6-5 early in the first half. LJ Cryer, who led Houston with 26 points, made two more to push the lead to three. It was Houston’s biggest lead of the night.“No one ever loses at anything as long as you don’t quit,” coach Kelvin Sampson said. “If you quit, you’ve lost.”The Cougars, who have never won a national title, not even in the days of Phi Slama Jama, will play Florida on Monday night for the championship.Houston closed the game on an 11-1 run, and though Flagg finished with 27 points on 8-for-19 shooting and his three at the 3:02 mark put the Blue Devils up by nine. The game looked over at that point – ESPN’s Gamecastgave Duke a 92.3% chance of winningwith 42 seconds left – but Houston were just getting started.A Houston team that prides itself on getting three stops in a row – calling the third one the “kill stop” – allowed a measly three free throws down the stretch.“It’s hard to process … I thought we had good looks but didn’t finish,” said Duke coach Jon Scheyer. “You gotta handle the wins and you gotta handle the losses. The best team tonight was Houston.”In Saturday’s other semi-final, Walter Clayton Jr scored 34 points and Florida beat Southeastern Conference rival Auburn 79-73, sending the Gators to the national championship game for the first time since their titles in 2006 and 2007.“Clayton was the difference. He was just flat out the difference,” Auburn coach Bruce Pearl said. “We couldn’t contain him down that end.”The All-America guard for the Gators (35-4) had a driving layup with 2:24 left, on the possession right after Australian big man Alex Condon drew a charge against Johni Broome The Gators will have the chance Monday night to win the SEC’s first title since Kentucky in 2012, the only one since they won in back-to-back seasons. Florida take an 11-game winning streak into the title championship game in the Alamodome.Explore more on these topicsCollege basketballCollege sportsNCAA TournamentUS sportsBasketballnewsShareReuse this content"

Aspiring professionals spend most of their youth dreaming of making it, only to get there and then wonder if they truly belong. Even Roger Federer doubted himself for many years.It has takenJack Drapera long time to truly believe he deserves to be considered as one of the world’s best players. Tipped from a young age as a future star, he had obvious talent as a junior but, as with Andy Murray, his body has taken a while to catch up, with a number of injuries interrupting his momentum.Jack Draper dismantles Holger Rune to claim Indian Wells titleRead moreBut as the clay-court season begins this week in the iconic surroundings of the Monte-Carlo Country Club, Draper stands as the world No 7, having cracked the top 10 on the back of his first Masters 1000 triumph in Indian Wells last month. The 23-year-old is also No 3 in the current-year rankings and with very few ranking points to defend up to andincluding Wimbledon, the left-hander has a golden chance to rise further.His confidence has never been higher but he is always asking more of himself, never convinced that he has done enough. “Obviously, I have confidence in my tennis and confidence in myself,” Draper says, relaxing with the Mediterranean sea rippling in the background. “Especially when I go out and compete, I feel like I have a sort of personality on the match court, where I just compete for every ball, and I feel amazing, especially in that scenario. But it’s one of those things, when I first came on to the Tour – I was speaking to Jacob [Fearnley, his fellow British player] – about it last week, it’s kind of like you have that impostor syndrome, you know? You’re in the changing rooms with all these amazing players who play great tennis, and you’re thinking: ‘Do I belong here? Do I belong at this sort of venue?’“Even in the position I am in now, and I think for the rest of my career, especially in tennis where you can win a tournament and then go and lose first round [in the next one], I always feel like I need to prove something. Always feel like I need to show that I belong at the highest level, not only to everyone else, but myself as well. So some of that never will go away.”There is nothing like winning to dampen some of those doubts. The first major step came ongrass in Stuttgart last summer, when he won his first title, which gave him a “massive sense of calm”. He referenced the nature of top-level tennis, in which many top-ranked players can go their whole careers without ever winning a title.After securing his second title in Vienna at the end of last year, Draper picked up a hip injury before the Australian Open but showed his competitive strength and desire again by winning three back‑to‑back five‑set matches to make the last 16. After shoulder, abdominal and hip issues, he could be forgiven for thinking his body is a liability but the way he played in Indian Wells, where he beat Carlos Alcaraz in the semi-finals, showed him that he can compete at the very top.View image in fullscreenJack Draper in action against Holger Rune in the Indian Wells final.Photograph: Mark J Terrill/AP“[Winning Indian Wells] is big, big belief, big confidence,” he said. “It’s weird. I felt like I’d been building towards moments like that one for a while, especially at the end of last year. I was really building a level, and I was improving and getting better, then getting better and better each week and getting more confident. And then obviously had that injury at the back end last year, and went to Australia, and I was completelyout of sorts physicallywith my tennis.“But then that experience there, getting those matches in my body, and then going to Doha and getting some wins there, I was trying to just get back to where I was before and even better, so I think just certifies more belief in me that I belong at this highest level and that, you know, I really have earned the position I’m in. Now I’ve just got to keep on moving forwards, keep on improving, keep on doing all the things that have, you know, helped me get to this point so far.”Not only that, Draper’s dreams are growing, with an eye firmly on achieving the ultimate in tennis, winning one of the sport’s biggest titles, a grand slam crown. “Having that Stuttgart title really helped me to feel like, wow, I’ve got that now and then I can build on that,” he says. “Obviously from there on in, you know, semis US Open and winning Vienna, now winning Indian Wells, all these things, they’re helping me to sort of feel like, I’m really getting in the right direction. I’m going for things that I thought were never possible and to feel like I’ve done those things that I maybe thought weren’t possible now, to move forward and feel like the goals in front of me are realistic, you know, that’s important,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He won just four matches in six events on the surface last year, culminating in a first-round defeat at Roland Garros, even if three of them were tight three-set losses to good players. He plays either Denis Shapovalov of Canada or the American Marcos Giron in his first match here but though he admits clay is “not my first, first surface”, good sessions with Fearnley at the NationalTennisCentre have left him optimistic and curious to see how he goes. He also knows that putting the miles on clay can pay dividends later in the year.“I’m still yet to feel like I’ve won matches and be really confident on the surface, but I definitely feel like if I can have some really good success over the next month or so that will set me up even more for what’s to come for the rest of the season,” the Londoner says.“I’ve obviously got a lot to prove to myself and on the surface. I think that will come with time, more experience. I think my game, the way it’s improving all the time, and the way I’m being more tactically aware and physically stronger, all these things coming together, I’m interested to see over the next month and a half, how effective I can be on this surface. But I really do believe I can be really effective, that’s for sure.”Explore more on these topicsJack DraperTennisinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Towards the close, Joshua Zirkzee had the contest’s clearest opening: the No 11 swung a boot at Patrick Dorgu’s cross and connected cleanly but ­Ederson saved, cat-like, and ­Manchester City escaped; as they did, also, when a later penalty shout for Mateo ­Kovacic’s challenge on Casemiro was correctly waved away.So this finished as a non-event in the sun, with scant incident and only marginally more goalmouth action.‘Lack of class’: Guardiola hits out at United fans’ chant about Foden’s motherRead morePep Guardiola rued dropping two points in the chase for a Champions League berth – City remain fifth, while next for Ruben Amorim is United’s Europa League quarter-final first leg at Lyon on Thursday. Claim the competition and the Portuguese’s team will be in the blue riband continental club tournament next season, but the prospect is far away.In the four minutes of added time, United rallied and were more potent but both teams lacked imagination and ruthlessness before goal. As United’s players wandered off at the final whistle, City went to thank their travelling fans, who applauded Kevin De Bruyne following his final match representing Guardiola’s side at their arch-rival’s home before departing in the summer.At the same juncture, the sit-in organised byThe 1958 Groupto ­protest against the Glazer family’s ownership began around the stadium: for those taking part, gazing out on to an empty pitch was only slightly less ­invigorating than what had just been witnessed.Eric Cantona was here, too, and the former United ­favourite saw a ­blistering move go close to undoing City inside 30 seconds.The No 9, Rasmus Højlund, dropped back, tipped the ball to ­Alejandro Garnacho and his pace caused Rúben Dias to chop the left winger down. United wanted a ­penalty but John Brooks ruled it was outside the area, the VAR did not disagree, and the referee booked the centre-back.View image in fullscreenManchester United’s Patrick Dorgu has a shot on goal.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PABruno Fernandes smacked the free-kick into the wall and the ­resulting corner was uneventful, an augury of the afternoon fare.Guardiola handed Nico O’Reilly a first derby start and a curving pass from the young left-back found Omar ­Marmoush, whose shot was blocked by Harry Maguire. Result: City’s first corner, which De Bruyne delivered, O’Reilly tried to backheel, and United scrambled clear.Garnacho provides an interesting study as he is for sale despite a buc­caneering style that is the epitome of the United way. There are flashes, too, of an improving ­technique and ­football brain, as when killing a ­towering ball dead then, later, ­gazing up and dropping a chip on to Diogo Dalot’s toes. But when Dalot crossed from the right, Garnacho’s stooping header missed: an ­illustration of why he is not yet the complete package. When a switch to the right missed Højlund and arrived – eventually – to Dorgu, his right – and weaker – foot let him down via a clumsy touch.Garnacho shredded City at will. Each time he danced ­forward ­Guardiola went to a crouch. The No 17’s pace was a knife the ­champions could not blunt. Twice more he ­rocketed through but the threat faded because of poor ­decisions – as when underhitting a pass to Fernandes.City, configured in a lesser seen 4‑1‑2‑2‑1, lacked width as O’Reilly pushed in from the left and Bernardo Silva and Phil Foden the right. Guardiola bewailed the narrow channels his men squeezed the ball about in which intrigued as he was responsible for the shape.By half-time their fans had been treated to spe­culative Foden and Ilkay ­Gündogan efforts, the odd corner and not much else. Missing the injured Erling ­Haaland, they were toothless.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Fernandes was the schemer-in-chief, his cuteness shielding the ball for a Casemiro attempt, or game-sense ­taking him marauding along the right.Amorim’s vision collides head-first with cold business certainties of United Ltd | Jonathan LiewRead moreThe last act was at the start of the second half and De Bruyne caught the mood. A burst down the right allowed him to fire the ball over to where ­Haaland usually lurks but his stand-in, Marmoush, occupied the wrong zone.Next, the Belgian popped up outside United’s area and scuffed the ball. United’s riposte was to have Højlund, then Leny Yoro threaten to hit headers goalwards but both were thwarted.Victor Lindelöf, for Maguire, and Jérémy Doku, for Foden (who suffered abuseGuardiola later said “lacked class”), were changes, on 57 minutes, for each side. The Swede soon conceded a free-kick when Marmoush rolled him. Lindelöf complained, then was happy to see the Egyptian power the set piece into the underworked André Onana’s clutches.Could De Bruyne conjure something to break the stalemate? He tried, arrowing in a corner from the right, the ball bounced up to Marmoush and Onana beat out his scything volley.Afterwards, Fernandes offered succinct analysis: “We were a little bit more dangerous, we needed the killer instinct. City want to have the ball, and you have to be patient. We did that well and we were very well organised.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueManchester UnitedManchester Citymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Second in the 268.9-km race, which started in Markt in Bruges and concluded in Minderbroedersstraat in Oudenaarde, was the Dane, Mads Pedersen with Belgium-born Van der Poel coming third to complete the podium. Home heros Wout Van Aert and Jasper Stuyven rounded up the top five.Primoz Roglic wins Volta a Catalunya title as late charge denies Juan AyusoRead morePogacar came into the race as one of the favourites, having enjoyed a remarkable run by winning the men’s road race title at the world championships in September to add to his triumphs at the Giro d’Italia and Tour de France, and lived up to expectations.He delivered a devastating 19-km solo attack from the Oude Kwaremont climb, and there was no doubt about the outcome from then on as he crossed the finish line with his arms outstretched in celebration.With the triumph, Pogacar also avenged his Milan-San Remo loss to Van der Poel in March, which was the first Monument race of the season. Van der Poel had won the 2020, 2022, 2024 editions of the Tour of Flanders.Van der Poel was involved in a crash, which involved about 20 cyclists, but the 30-year-old Dutchman managed to get back up and return to the front with the help of his Alpecin-Deceuninck teammate Edward Planckaert of Belgium.“The goal was to win, but in the end, it is hard to realise it. We did it and I cannot be more proud of the team and how we raced today, even though we had some bad luck. In the end, all was good. I’m just so happy to win this race in this jersey,” Pogacar said.“The plan was to go from there [the Oude Kwaremont], we followed the plan even though we had some crashes with teammates. We made it, we stuck to the plan and finished it off.“There was a crash on the big road, we lost Jhony [Jhonatan Narváez] here, Tim [Wellens] and Florian [Vermeersch]. Florian somehow was chasing back all the race more or less, and made it just in time to lead out on the Kwaremont.Chapeauto him. We never gave up.”The remaining Monuments in the cycling calendar are Paris-Roubaix, Liège-Bastogne-Liège and Giro di Lombardia. Paris-Roubaix takes place next Sunday.“It [Paris-Roubaix] is a completely different race but I will accept the challenge and try to do my best. Flanders suits me a bit better, but you never know, Roubaix is also a very hard race and with this shape I have now, I should give it a try,” Pogacar added.After devastating BMX injury, Kai Sakakibara makes winning return as para cyclist | Kieran PenderRead moreIn the women’s race, Belgium’s Lotte Kopecky (SD Worx) delivered on her pre-race favourite tag to take the win and add to her titles in 2022 and 2023. Pauline Ferrand-Prévot (Visma-Lease a Bike) and Liane Lippert (Movistar) completed the podium. Kopecky pulled clear with a group of three other riders to put herself in a commanding position where she briefly bided her time before her victory sprint.Like the winner, the defending champion Elisa Longo Borghini (UAE Team ADQ) was in line for a record third win but in a chaotic start, she was one of many who crashed early on. Despite attempting to continue, she ultimately withdrew.“It was a crazy race with a lot of crashes in the beginning,” Kopecky said. “I was pretty nervous and I didn’t have the best legs in the beginning but I tried to stay calm. After a few climbs my legs felt better and better and [I knew] in the end I had a good chance. Once it was just the four of us, I was pretty confident, actually.”Explore more on these topicsCyclingTadej PogačarnewsShareReuse this content"

Guardiola was asked about the chant.“[It was a] lack of class,” City’s ­manager said. “But it’s not United, it’s the people [supporters], you know? We are so exposed in ­football – managers, owners, and football players especially. Honestly, I don’t understand the mind of the ­people ­involving the mum of Phil, it’s a lack of integrity, class, and they should be ashamed.”Pep Guardiola left to rue dropped points as Manchester derby ends in a drawRead moreIt is understood that City were shocked and disgusted by the chants and the number of people involved. United’s stance is that they condemn all abusive chants aimed towards players.The draw leaves City in fifth place on 52 points, a point behind ­Chelsea in fourth, with seven games left. ­Concerning the challenge for a ­Champions League place, Guardiola said: “Seven games, Crystal Palace [next], go for it. I’d prefer to have 10 more points or 12 more points but it is what it is. It’s Old Trafford, it’s always difficult. We fought and we were there. The players gave everything. We should attack with more fluidity.“I’m not concerned about next season right now, I’m just concerned about recovery, Crystal Palace, Everton, Aston Villa and the FA Cup semi-finals [against Nottingham Forest].“It would have been better to win but Old Trafford is Old Trafford and United are a transition team. We wanted to make a good buildup and process and we defended really well. They are dangerous when we lose balls in the position like we are not good.”United remain 13th in the table, andRuben Amorimwas asked how difficult it will be to turn the club’s fortunes – and style of play – around. “I can say we want to be competitive in the short space of time but to be really dominant against that type of opponent is going to take a lot of time,” United’s head coach said. “We have to use different weapons. In that way of playing [ball domination] City is maybe the best team in the world. If you compare this game against Arsenal, we have some moments we did the better today was different. We are improving. To play in this way they play for a long time.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Southampton had justsuffered the earliest relegationin Premier League history, with seven games still remaining, but there was no bitterness. Juric, who seemed almost moved by their reaction, ensured his players applauded them.“For me, this is something completely new, a new experience,” Juric said. “I said to the players they have to be really thankful that they have fans like this.Southampton endure historic Premier League relegation after defeat at SpursRead more“It is something incredible the way they love their team even though we were relegated. They really deserve much more. It’s another type of culture [to Italy]. They show love in this moment; it is a great thing in English culture,Southamptonculture.”Juric seemingly wants to stay on and try to lead Southampton back into the Premier League next season. “If we take the long road to come back here, I am ready,” he said, speaking of the need to develop young players, such as Taylor Harwood-Bellis, Mateus Fernandes, Tyler Dibling and Kamaldeen Sulemana, so they can compete at Premier League level, rather than getting promoted then signing a new team.“We have lots of young players, talented players. They are good but lack experience. There is a completely different physicality between us and other teams in the Premier League. The same thing happened to Leicester and Ipswich. The gap is huge but from this moment the players can grow up and improve and be ready for the Premier League; this is my idea.”View image in fullscreenIvan Juric talked about staying on at Southampton after relegation was confirmed at Tottenham.Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PAThis season, all that remains is to try to surpass Derby’s record low tally of 11 points with a -69 goal difference. Derby, in the 2007-08 season, went down with six games left, as did Huddersfield in 2018-19 and Sheffield United in 2020-21. “I liked the second half today and the Crystal Palace game was good,” said Juric. “Our goal has to be to avoid being the worst in Premier League history, I want seven games like the second half today.”Responsibility, he insisted, is collective. In three full seasons under the ownership of Sport Republic, Southampton have been relegated, promoted and relegated again. “It’s clear that the last two years in the Premier League we haven’t competed,” Juric said.“We’ve been relegated too easily and that means huge problems in a lot of situations. Now it’s important to understand all the mistakes and try to create something good. You cannot see these fans in all places.”Tottenham’s manager Ange Postecoglou was understandably focused on Thursday’s Europa League quarter-final first leg against Eintracht Frankfurt. “In the first half we were really disciplined, well-organised and every time we went forward we looked dangerous,” he said.“The second half not so much. We became way too passive without the ball and let Southampton get a rhythm. But overall we got the win, everybody got through unscathed and now we’re ready for a big night on Thursday.”Explore more on these topicsSouthamptonTottenham HotspurnewsShareReuse this content"

He started theCarabao Cup final victory over Liverpooland as he heads back to the East Midlands, Howe faces a difficult choice between him and the England international.Liverpool’s title stumble shows strength of Premier League, not its weakness | Barney RonayRead moreAsked what the forward has to do to establish himself as a regular, Howe said: “I think it’s continue to take your chance. I always say that to every player. The training ground is match day for the lads that aren’t playing, so they need to see training as that important. They need to impress me. They need to show that they’re better than the player in their position and that’s a really healthy squad dynamic to have, so for anyone not playing, that’s how they need to view it.”Barnes’s misfortune was to arrive at St James’ Park and find Gordon in blistering form, and Howe’s efforts to shoehorn both men into his starting lineup earlier in the season resulted in only limited success. In the main, he has had to bide his time and try to make an impact from the bench, but his performances in Gordon’s absence have given his manager food for thought.Howe said: “We’ve really tried to focus on Harvey’s game and his training and try to see it as an opportunity to improve him while he’s out of the team, while recognising his qualities and knowing that we want him in the team. That’s a very difficult thing because we probably didn’t have the balance of the side right early season. We were trying players in different positions to try and find a way to make that work. We didn’t probably have the right outcome then.”Now Barnes will hope for a chance to show what he can do in familiar surroundings to remind Howe of why he wanted to sign him in the first place as the race for Champions League qualification gathers pace. Howe said: “I’m sure the game will mean a lot to Harvey. It was a very successful period for him at Leicester.

It was a momentous win for Saints.The magnitude of the home side’s task was underlined by the fact that they hadlost 6-0 at home against Celticin September and4-0 at Parkheadin December. Three of the four stands were full of expectant Hoops fans for the midday kick-off and they were shocked when Saints raced ahead, after the Celtic midfielder Arne Engels had tested Fisher with a drive.Balodis headed just over the crossbar from a Makenzie Kirk cross in St Johnstone’s first attack but Saints’ Latvian defender was more accurate from Graham Carey’s free-kick, glancing a header past the Celtic goalkeeper Viljami Sinisalo.In the 13th minute, after Fisher parried a drive from Daizen Maeda, Stephen Duke-McKenna’s last-gasp tackle prevented Nicolas Kühn tapping into an empty net from a yard out before he drew a fine save from Sinisalo with a drive on the turn. Saints were coping well with Celtic’s pressure.View image in fullscreenGoalkeeper Andy Fisher made vital saves to maintain St Johnstone’s lead over Celtic.Photograph: Stuart Wallace/ShutterstockHowever, a slack back pass from the defender Sam Curtis was intercepted by Maeda but Fisher made the save, as he did moments later from a Jota drive. Five minutes from the break VAR checked a possible penalty for St Johnstone for a Reo Hatate handball but play moved on and Sinisalo saved Adama Sidibeh’s header from a Carey corner.Yang Hyun-jun and Greg Taylor replaced Kühn and Jeffrey Schlupp for the start of the second half but there was no instant improvement. Sidibeh did well to escape the attention of the Celtic defender Cameron Carter-Vickers only to drag his shot wide.Celtic continued to dominate the ball and in the 55th minute from an Engels corner, Hatate crashed a shot against a post while at the other end Duke-McKenna’s effort from distance flew just wide. After Hatate drove high over the bar from 12 yards after being set up by Jota, Adam Idah replaced Maeda.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The hosts, who had lost their last three games, saw bitter rival Paris Saint-Germain clinch a record-extending 13th title on Saturday with six matches remaining. But a much-needed win put Marseille two points ahead of Monaco in third place and three points in front of Strasbourg in fourth in the race for a Champions League spot next season.The Marseille head coachRoberto De Zerbi had grown increasingly frustratedwith his side’s inconsistency and there were tensions leading up to this game. “The coach was angry and he tried to remotivate us, that’s normal, that’s his role,” Rabiot told DAZN. “No one abandoned ship. On the contrary, we trained with even more enthusiasm, and tonight we gave the right answer.”Marseille’s season is collapsing and Roberto De Zerbi is not helpingRead moreMidway through the first half, Rabiot broke down the left and sent a cross to the back post, where Gabriel Suazo miskicked the ball for a clumsy own-goal.Marseilleconceded a soft goal shortly after, with the ball hitting the Toulouse striker Frank Magri’s shoulder as he attempted a header, the ball sailing over goalkeeper Gerónimo Rulli.Mason Greenwood put the home side back in front with a dipping shot from the right edge of the penalty area in the 57th minute for his 16th league goal of the season. Rabiot swivelled neatly to make it 3-1 in the 64th, but poor defending gaveToulousehope when the captain Vincent Sierro turned in a cross from the right. The hosts managed to hold on and there was relief after the final whistle as De Zerbi was hugged by his staff.Pablo Barrios scored deep in added time to giveAtlético Madrida much-needed 2-1 La Liga win atSevillathat ended their month-long six-game winless run in all competitions.Eliminated from the Champions Leaguein the last 16 on penalties by old rivals Real Madrid andknocked out of the Copa del Reyin the semi-finals by Barcelona, Atlético kept their slim hopes of claiming the league title alive after the leaders, Barça, and Realboth dropped pointson Saturday.Norwegian club Brann win court ruling over fans’ right to sing ‘Uefa mafia’Read moreDiego Simeone’s Atlético moved on to 60 points, three behind Real who slumped to a 2-1 home defeat by Valencia while Barça were held 1-1 by Real Betis and are comfortable at the top on 67 points with eight games left.Sevillaare 11th on 36 points.The match had a promising start with the visiting striker Julián Alvarez’s spot kick in the 25th minute cancelling out Lucien Agoumé’s opener, but it petered out into a dour clash until Barrios made a great run through the middle and unleashed a bullet from the edge of the box into the bottom corner.Tiago Pereira Cardoso’s dream start to life in the Bundesliga hit a snag as the teenage goalkeeper conceded his first goal inBorussia Mönchengladbach’s 1-1 draw withStPauli.Injuries and other issues affecting the regular goalkeepers Moritz Nicolas and Jonas Omlin have given the Luxembourg keeper a surprise starting spot for Champions League-chasing Gladbach over the last month.One day before his 19th birthday, Cardoso was on course for his fourth game without conceding – and his fourth win with Gladbach – until Dapo Afolayan hit a fierce shot from long range in the 85th minute. Cardoso leaped at full stretch but could not get a hand to it. Gladbach had been leading through a header from the defender Ko Itakura.The draw is a setback for Gladbach, who stay sixth in the Bundesliga. They are two points off Mainz in fourth, the last of the Champions League qualification spots. St Pauli are 15th in the 18-team league.Atalanta’s could be at risk of dropping out of the top four of Serie A after their 1-0 loss at home toLaziofor their third straight league defeat. The result means Gian Piero Gasperini’s team fall 10 points behind the league leaders Inter and are left looking nervously over their shoulder.Lazio, who came into the match without a victory inSerie Ain more than a month, moved to within three points of Atalanta. The visitors appeared reinvigorated after the break and had two quick chances, with the Lazio goalkeeper Christos Mandas making an extraordinary save to deny the league’s top scorer Mateo Retegui at point-blank range. However, Lazio broke the deadlock nine minutes into the second half, through the half-time substitute Gustav Isaksen. Fisayo Dele-Bashiru nodded a long ball over the top down to Isaksen, who scuffed a shot past Marco Carnesecchi.Roma’s streak of seven straight league wins – with only one goal conceded – was ended byJuventus, in Igor Tudor’s second match in charge of theBianconeri, in a 1-1 draw.Juventustook the lead shortly before half-time. Khéphren Thuram’s cross was cleared by Zeki Celik but only to the edge of the area where Manuel Locatelli volleyed it into the ground to bounce into the bottom left corner. It was the first goal Roma had conceded in Serie A since 2 March.Claudio Ranieri’s half-time substitution had an immediate impact as Eldor Shomurodov levelled three minutes after coming on, heading in the rebound from three yards after Michele Di Gregorio had parried Evan N’Dicka’s attempt.Explore more on these topicsEuropean club footballLigue 1La LigaBundesligaSerie AMarseilleToulousenewsShareReuse this content"

There were some good saves from Robert Sánchez and Maresca probably would have faced a tougher inquest had Sepp van den Berg not missed a gimme of a header during the dying stages.Southampton endure historic Premier League relegation after defeat at SpursRead moreChelsea could not point to many clearcut openings in response. Maresca, who argued that it was unfair that his side did not have more restafter beating Tottenhamon Thursday, was pushing it when he said they deserved more. Brentford’s manager, Thomas Frank, said: “I guess we are all slightly biased as coaches. We all look on our side of the elephant. It is hard to see the other side of the elephant unless you are on top of it.”There was a pointed pause from Frank when he was asked if he sympathised with Chelsea’s complaints given that they were able to make use of their deep squad. It was hard for Maresca to dodge the scrutiny over his lineup, especially as Chelsea do not have a particularly daunting ­midweek assignment. They visit Legia Warsaw for the first leg of their Uefa Conference League ­quarter-final on Thursday.The task is to regain a place among Europe’s elite. Yet Chelsea have not won on the road since December and their remaining fixtures are awkward. One slip at home could be decisive. The sense of a missed opportunity lingered. “We played a good game,” Maresca said. “The pitch was dry. They tried to kill the tempo. But I think we did enough.”The quick turnaround after ­beating Spurs forced Maresca to give more consideration to load management than he would have liked. The changes, though, did not have a positive impact on Chelsea’s energy ­levels. Their passing was too ­deliberate in a tepid opening period and they did not have a shot on target until Noni Madueke fired straight at Mark Flekken in the 34th minute.Brentford were stronger and more adventurous. They were direct when they won possession and their strategy of pinging long balls down Chelsea’s right was effective. Kevin Schade kept spinning beyond Malo Gusto, who was booked for fouling the winger, and chances followed. Yoane Wissa and Bryan Mbeumo shot wide, Mikkel Damsgaard sent a free‑kick over, Sánchez pushed away a header from Keane Lewis-Potter.Chelsea were disjointed. Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall worked hard on his second league start since joining from Leicester but Jadon Sancho was poor on the left and Enzo Fernández was petulant in midfield. Christopher Nkunku, meanwhile, looked unenthused after coming off for Jackson. Chelsea might have as well have been playing with 10 men before the forward’s half-time substitution.They should have been behind by then. Sánchez was nervy when he had to use his feet. The goalkeeper’s distribution remains a weakness and he almost cost Chelsea when his stray pass went to Christian Nørgaard. Played in by Wissa, Damsgaard’s heavy touch let Sánchez off the hook.View image in fullscreenYoane Wissa misses a good chance to give Brentford the lead.Photograph: Andrew Kearns/CameraSport/Getty ImagesThe final part was the problem for Brentford and they were under more pressure after Jackson replaced Nkunku. Van den Berg and Nathan Collins had more to think about once Chelsea had a mobile striker ­leading the line.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Jackson sent an angled shot wide and Van den Berg almost scored an own-goal. Sensing a shift in the momentum, Maresca went even stronger for the final 30 minutes. Palmer replaced Dewsbury-Hall and Madueke made way for Neto, who soon tested Flekken from 20 yards.Brentford had to dig deep, Flekken made another fine save when Reece James headed goalwards. Yet they relished the fight and their resilience subdued Chelsea. Frank was satisfied with his side’s efforts. Brentford ­finished strongly and created chances.

Worryingly, no one has the slightest idea if any little thing is going to be all right.It is approaching two years since Dai was last spotted at the Select Car Leasing Stadium. The club has been available to buy for most of that time. Actually buying it is a different matter. Many have tried, some coming closer than others, but none have succeeded.So, after financial-related points deductions in three successive seasons, transfer embargos, threats of a winding-up order, numerous late payment of wages, the contemptuous defunding of the women’s team – forcing themfrom the Championship to the part-time fifth tier– and attemptsto flog the training ground to Wycombe, Reading remain in the unwanted hands of Dai.As burgers sizzled and pre-match pints were pulled, the desire of the season’s largest attendance – 15,228 – was simply to forget for a few hours. Only a few days earlier, they did not know whether the match would go ahead.View image in fullscreenReading’s Bearwood Park training ground, which Dai Yongge sought to sell.Photograph: Geoffrey Swaine/ShutterstockBelatedly disqualified by the English Football League after failing to pay debts in China – and thus unable to fulfil the much-maligned owners’ and directors’ test he somehow passed back in 2017 – Dai had been given a deadline of Friday night to sell the club,before a last-minute extensionuntil 22 April.With the club on the market for more than 500 days, many fear the extra couple of weeks will provide little more than a prolonged stay of execution. It has, at the very least, guaranteed a few more games before the very real threat of suspension from the EFL; blissful moments of relief from the perpetual anxiety.“Football is meant to be an escape, but at the moment it’s the cause of our stress rather than our escape from it,” said Greg Double, part of the campaign group Sell Before We Dai, which has organised numerous protests in recent years. “I have a strict rule where I don’t talk about the ownership stuff on a Saturday because you have to preserve the 90 minutes where you just focus on the team. Just one normal day would be nice.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Dai’s clubs in China (Beijing Chengfeng) and Belgium (KSV Roeselare) fell into liquidation under his watch, before he broke all financial rules in trying to reach the Premier League, at one point spending 234% of the club’s revenue on player wages. Then he lost interest.“They say if you shoot for the moon, you end up at the stars,” said Double. “Occasionally you end up at the bottom of the ocean as well. That’s what’s happened to us and it’s a cautionary tale.”Apotential dealwith the American investor Robert Platek is complicated by the former Wycombe owner Rob Couhig retaining securities over the club’s assets after coming close to buying Reading last year.Couhig is suingDai over that failed purchase. All the while, despite the repeated off-loading of their best players, the club somehow occupy a playoff spot, ignoring off-field concerns and riding Wycombe’s sustained pressure to triumph on Saturday thanks to a Harvey Knibbs penalty.View image in fullscreenDai Yongge in July 2017, after Jaap Stam signed a contract to 2019.

I just tell them to stay away from it. It can be off-putting, but we have our blinkers on.”Yet only five senior players are contracted beyond the end of the season and huge uncertainty remains. “We’re chasing the playoffs, but we might not even be allowed to take part in it,” said the third-generationReadingfan Ben Langham, who watched the game with his father and grandfather. “We’re all trying to stay positive but it’s worrying.”Does Dai care?

Uefa argued that the incidents were a breach of its regulations, which make clubs responsible for “offensive statements of a provocative nature” from the stands.Dear Uefa, why have we been fined €5,000 for ‘Uefa mafia’ chants?Read moreBrann took the first two cases to Uefa’s appeals committee. The first one was rejected so in the autumn of 2024 Brann took the case to Cas, which on 31 March ruled in favour of the Norwegian club. Its written reasons will be released this week.“We are very pleased with the ruling from Cas,” the president of Brann, Aslak Sverdrup, said. “It’s not every day a club from Norway moves all of football Europe, but today we actually do. In a world where freedom of speech is under attack, this is an important and correct ruling.“SK Brann wish to thank those who have contributed to this case, especially Jan Magne Isaksen and Erlend Aarlien, our two lawyers, who have been solid throughout the entire process. We also wish to thank the supporter leader Erlend Vågane for the good co-operation, and our own football president Lise Klaveness for facilitating the meeting in Nyon and for being a clear voice in the debate. We also thank Uefa’s administration for good dialogue in Nyon and London prior to the case.”Uefa acknowledged receipt of the CAS award in which a fine “imposed on the Norwegian Club Brann SK (Women) for misbehaviour of a group of ‘supporters’ has been set aside”. It added: “In reality, the fine imposed on the Norwegian club has been set aside only because of the truly extraordinary circumstances of the case and the thin evidentiary basis available. In the present case, in no way has CAS affirmed that freedom of speech could justify that so-called ‘fans’ make offensive statements.”Brann have argued that the message “Uefa Mafia” is a humorous and power-critical statement that is well within the limits of freedom of expression. Brann also believe that meeting criticism or satire of powerful organisations such as Uefa with sanctions is fundamentally problematic.Uefa’s view has been that the freedom of expression under the European Convention on Human Rights does not count in this case and that “Uefa Mafia” must be interpreted as factual allegations that the organisation and its management and employees are part of an organised criminal organisation. This is offensive and provocative, according to Uefa.Cas, however, said the question of whether a statement is offensive or provocative must be interpreted in light of the actual context. Cas also agreed with Brann that Uefa’s disciplinary regulations must be interpreted in light of fundamental human rights such as freedom of expression. Brann have therefore been acquitted of paying the fines to Uefa.Cas added that the use of “Uefa Mafia” would not be acceptable in all cases but that it must be interpreted in the context of that statement being made and that Uefa must prove that any use of the slogan is offensive and provocative in the context.Explore more on these topicsBrann womenUefaFootball politicsEuropean club footballWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

I at least asked the question. I think that was a fair response.”Ultimately, McLaren really paid the price for one of Verstappen’s most masterful qualifying performances, as his fantastic track-record lap to pinch pole against all the odds had the British leaders in the constructors’ race on the back foot from the start on Sunday.McLaren principal Andrea Stella insisted afterwards that team interests were still at the forefront of their thoughts, and added he didn’t think it was obvious that Piastri was quicker than Norris, who had been managing his tyres.“We are here first of all to beat the other teams and put McLaren in a very strong position,” Stella said. “When McLaren is in a strong position, then that’s the best position for the two drivers to pursue their aspirations.

The gap between them and Arsenal stayed at 11 points, meaning Liverpool still need another 11 to prevail after a defeat, just their second of the campaign, that owed much to some poor defending in the first half at Craven Cottage. “This can happen against a good team like Fulham,” Slot said. “If you make mistakes they have the quality to punish them.”Rodrigo Muniz bullies past Van Dijk as leaders Liverpool falter at FulhamRead moreFulham’s goals from Ryan Sessegnon, the outstanding Alex Iwobi and Rodrigo Muniz all came within a first 45 minutes where Curtis Jones was playing as an emergency right-back. Each of his more experienced defensive colleagues were just as culpable, including Virgil van Dijk.“It wasn’t 45 minutes of disaster but the errors we made, I think is something we’re not used to,” Slot said. “One of the reasons why we are in the position we are in is we don’t make a lot of mistakes. And if we do, players try to make up for them.”Slot deniedArsenal’s draw with Evertonon Saturday had led to any stepping off the gas. “There is no reason for us to be complacent,” he said. “We’re not number one because we win games by three or four goals.“I think everyone has seen that to win our games it takes us so much effort, so much hard work, combined with quality of course. We are fully aware we have to compete for seven more games. Today was a close call, and many times we’ve been on the right side. Today we were on the wrong side.”He refused to be drawn on either Van Dijk’s troubles or those of Mohamed Salah, who put in an anonymous performance to continue his recent slump. “I still see a lot of things that Virgil does really well, but if you play 50-60 games a season there will be moments, even for him, where you could have done better.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ovechkin then hugged the Capitals staff members and coaches on the bench and went through a handshake line with the Islanders as crew members set up for the celebration ceremony.“Wayne, you’ll always be the ‘Great One’ and you had a record that nobody ever thought would be broken,”NHLcommissioner Gary Bettman said to open the festivities. “But Alex, you did it. You’ve been amazing.”Gretzky congratulated Ovechkin and his family for the accomplishment, adding, “They say records are made to be broken, but I’m not sure who’s going to get more goals than that.”With Gretzky, wife Janet, Bettman and Ovechkin’s wife, mother and two sons standing nearby, Ovechkin addressed the crowd and said: “I’ve always said, all the time, it’s a team sport ... Fellas, thank you very much. I love you so much.”Gretzky’s total of 894 goals had long seemed unapproachable. Ovechkin passed it even after missing 16 games in November and December because of a broken leg, a testament to his durability and a knack for putting the puck in the net consistently for two decades. He surpassed 40 goals this season for a 14th time – two more than Gretzky and also the most in league history.Even before this, Ovechkin owned the NHL records for power-play goals, shots on goal and the most goalies scored against, now adding Sorokin to that list. Only Gretzky has more multi-goal games, and Ovechkin earlier this season became just the sixth player with 700 goals and 700 assists, joining Gretzky, Gordie Howe, Jaromir Jagr, Marcel Dionne and Phil Esposito.The chase by the Great 8, a nickname honoring his jersey number, captured attention from North America to Ovechkin’s nativeRussia, where billboards and goal-counters cheered on and tracked his effort. It helped Ovechkin that his team is one of the best in the NHL this season, defying expectations.Gretzky broke Howe’s record a little over 31 years ago, when he scored 802 on 23 March 1994. He added 92 more before retiring in 1999 after a total of 1,487 games over 20 seasons.Even with this record falling to Ovechkin – which the Canadian has said he is excited about – Gretzky holds 55 NHL records, and two seem truly untouchable: 2,857 total points and 1,963 assists, the latter of which is more than anyone else has in goals and assists combined.For NHL playoff goals, which do not count toward the record, Gretzky has the most (122). Ovechkin has 72. Gretzky also had another 56 in the World Hockey Association regular season and playoffs, while Ovechkin has 57 from his time in the KHL, Russia’s top league.Returning to Russia to play in front of family and friends is an option at some point for Ovechkin, who has one season left after this one on the five-year, $47.5m contract he signed in 2021, which took him through age 40 to give him enough time to chase Gretzky’s record. Instead, he got it done earlier than just about anyone could have realistically expected.Explore more on these topicsWashington CapitalsNHLIce hockeyUS sportsRussianewsShareReuse this content"

After loss of form and a wrist injury, can he bounce back?Sun 6 Apr 2025 03.00 EDTShareModern golf has been defined by streaks and Scottie Scheffler is in an especially hot one, with eyes focused on whether that cancontinue at Augusta Nationalover the coming days.Brooks Koepka had one. Cameron Smith had one. Rory McIlroy had one in majors, with his competitive longevity outside the big four tournaments setting him apart from his peers. There are countless other runs, varying in length and trophy haul since Tiger Woods stopped decimating all before him. Each emphasises how extraordinary was Woods’s time at the top.A decade ago, it felt as if we were living in the era of Jordan Spieth. The Texanclaimed the Masters by four shots. Spieth capitalised on Dustin Johnson’s misfortune to addthe US Open two months later. He was therunner-up to Jason Day in the US PGA Championship. By the timeSpieth lifted the Claret Jug at Royal Birkdalein 2017, he had already won 11 times in a four-year stretch. Even a collapse overthe back nine at Augusta National in 2016barely seemed to matter: this was a player primed to dominate.View image in fullscreenJordan Spieth dons his champion’s Green Jacket at the 2015 Masters.Photograph: Jim Young/ReutersSpieth was box office. The 20-minute period preceding his third shot to the 13th on that final round at Birkdale – Spieth eventually took a penalty drop on the practice range – was an illustration of that. He finished that Open landing blow after blow on poor Matt Kuchar, who had earlier edged into the lead.There were shades of Seve Ballesteros in Spieth’s wondrous short game and ability to make hay from seemingly impossible situations. With McIlroy in fine fettle after two major wins in 2014, there was even the sense he, Spieth and Rickie Fowler would dominate in a post-Tiger world. Whatever happened to the likely lads?Whether Spieth’s greatness has been paused or ended remains to be seen. His loss of form after the 2017 Open was curious. Recent struggles are far easier to assess: the 31-year-old had surgery last year on a wrist problem that had been plaguing him since the spring of 2023. Spieth began last week ranked 66th in the world. Given the heights he once scaled, the mitigating circumstance of injury is unlikely to placate him.“It is a delicate balance of using what I need to use from the past,” he says. “I have been at the top of the game in a lot of different elements. I haven’t been No 1 in driving but I have been in so many categories. So, mechanically, there is stuff to map out that I know works.View image in fullscreenJordan Spieth shows the Claret Jug to fans at Royal Birkdale in 2017.Photograph: Chris Condon/R&A/Getty Images“The balance comes with not trying to chase who you were. Try to take the good mechanical pieces and use some of the stuff from bad times when you knew how to play smarter. I think my hands got better over time because I needed to use them more than I did early on. Once I really get everything sound, I should be more consistent than I have been for a long time. It’s just not quite there yet. It is close.”Spieth’s Masters competitors have been warned. His record at Augusta National was freakish from the start: second, first, second, 11th and third. In more recent times the first major of the year has bitten Spieth – he missed the cut last year – but he still threw in a third in 2021 and fourth in 2023.Conversely, Spieth has by his own admission a grim record at the Players Championship. On the 16th hole of round three this year, his fairway wood went flying from his hand. Spieth insisted he did not mean to throw the club – and as a devout Catholic, surely one must take him at his word – but his angst at the time was obvious. A game that once came so easy has bitten back.“I meant to hold on to it,” Spieth says. “I realised I was swinging it too hard and didn’t want to hold on to it, it might hurt, so I let go. It was just a perfect series of events that frustrates you so much, you make the one mistake you can’t and end up with a seven.“It was easier to be ‘big picture’ in the first few weeks back [from surgery]. It is getting harder and harder. A few swings where I just needed to take a chill pill and didn’t.“You play well and your expectations grow a little bit. Face to path is just not quite where I want it to be yet.” And “yet” feels the operative term.Spieth always retained his charisma. Even during the toughest of sporting times, he was candid. Nobody has ever been heard to revel in his downturn. “In 2018, I was really not playing well at all,” he says of his Masters buildup. “I shot six under and eight under and was third. I just had to piece together the two middle rounds.View image in fullscreenJordan Spieth with his Masters rival Rory McIlroy. ‘Augusta is just blown up more than it probably should be – in that sense it gets blown up towards Rory.’Photograph: Tony Dejak/AP“The fact I have been there when I have been playing poorly, played well and had a chance to win … Now I’m like: ‘Well I don’t really care how I am playing, it doesn’t matter.’ That’s a nice place to be. Whereas I come to Sawgrass and think I have to be striping it to make the cut. Visually, Sawgrass messes with me. It is the total opposite of Augusta.”Spieth is not on the pre-Masters interview schedule, a further nod towards being out of sight. It feels unfortunate that his grand slam quest has almost been forgotten: he requires the US PGA to complete his set. The same cannot be said for McIlroy, who will be front and centre once more. With that, McIlroy would beat Spieth to the grand slam.“Augusta is just blown up more than it probably should be,” Spieth says. “In that sense it gets blown up towards Rory. Augusta is, if you look at the field, technically, the ‘easiest’ to win. The more someone focuses on that, the better. Rory could have three or four majors that are harder ones to win, too.I have contended at Augusta when I have had next to nothing. Driving accuracy is less of a problem than at other majors“It’s hard for me to speak on his behalf, Augusta gets blown up more than it should relative to the others. If you can shun that off, it is the biggest tournament in the world, it has the most eyeballs for golf. So, no matter the story, I think everything gets a little blown out of proportion.“I would have thought the US Open would be the hardest for me to win, then the PGA. I always just feel more comfortable at the Open and the Masters. I have contended at Augusta when I have had next to nothing. Your driving accuracy there is less of a problem than it is at the other majors. Other than that, it is because the field wasn’t the same as some of the other harder events.” A smile follows. “That wasn’t a hot take.”As Spieth discusses his journey – typically, at length – his wife, Annie, sits patiently on the clubhouse lawn. I apologise for keeping her husband back. “It’s absolutely fine,” she says. “It is a nice day.”There should be nothing wrong in wishing for good things to happen to good people.Explore more on these topicsJordan SpiethThe ObserverThe MastersGolfPGA TourUS sportsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Rodman had been sidelined by back problems for eight months and hadn’t played for the US since the Olympic final.Phallon Tullis-Joyce made six saves while keeping a clean sheet on her USWNT debut.Played before a lively crowd of 32,303, this game was billed as the first professional women’s sporting event at SoFi Stadium, the nearly five-year-old home of the NFL’s Los Angeles Rams and Chargers. The teams meet again Tuesday night in San Jose, California.In their most recent outing in late February, the US women took their first defeat of coach Emma Hayes’ tenure,falling 2-1 to Japan in San Diegoin the final of the SheBelieves Cup. The Americans had been 15-0-2 since Hayes took over in June 2024.Back at it in SoFi, the Americans struck early – and with style.Studio City native Thompson got a midfield touch and made an impressive run through Brazil, sending one defender to the grass in confusion before pushing a perfect pass to Rodman for her cool finish into the corner.“Delighted for her,” Hayes said after the game. “That goal meant a lot.

We are very poor,” says a boy, staring down the lens.They appear to be in a mud-brick hut in Afghanistan, living in extreme poverty. But their live stream is reaching viewers in the UK and worldwide – viaTikTokLive.For hours, they beg for virtual “gifts” that can later be exchanged for money. When they get one, they clap politely. On another live stream, a girl jumps up and shouts: “Thank you, we love you!” after receiving a digital rose from a woman in the US, who bought it from TikTok for about 1p. By the time it’s cashed out it could be worth less than a third of a penny.TikTok says it bans child begging and other forms of begging it considers exploitative, and says it has strict policies on users who go live.But anObserverinvestigation has found the practice widespread. Begging live streams are actively promoted by the algorithm and TikTok profits from the content, taking fees and commission of up to 70%.Olivier de Schutter, the UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, called the trend a “shocking development” and accused TikTok and middlemen of “profiting from people’s misery”. “Taking a cut of people’s suffering is nothing short of digital predation. I urge TikTok to take immediate action and enforce its own policies on exploitative begging and seriously question the ‘commission’ it is taking from the world’s most vulnerable people,” he said.Jeffrey DeMarco, digital harm expert at Save the Children, said: “The documented practices represent significant abuses and immediate action must be taken to ensure platforms no longer allow, or benefit directly or indirectly, from content such as this.”Analysis conducted between January and April 2025 found evidence of live-begging and related behaviour in countries including Indonesia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Syria, Egypt and Kenya.Many of the live streams showed families begging in domestic settings. But some streams appeared to bear the hallmarks of organised begging.One account, which broadcasts almost every day, regularly features different children. During a broadcast in February, it showed seven young boys begging for digital gifts. The next day, different boys appeared in the same spot, sitting alongside the same two adults. After being alerted to the account by theObserver,TikTok suspended it within two hours. A previous report through the in-app reporting tool had not resulted in any action.Another account with 5,300 followers featured an elderly man in a wheelchair. The account appears to be run by a third party but there is no information about their identity. The account description says “poor people” followed by crying face emojis.Beyond begging, live streams have featured people doing degrading and sometimes dangerous stunts in exchange for virtual gifts, such as hitting themselves, staying awake for long periods, covering themselves in mud, or sleeping on camera. One Indonesian live stream showed two young girls lying on a tiled floor in a small, windowless, white-walled studio. On Friday, the same account was broadcasting a live stream of a man asleep on the same tiled floor.Another broadcast from Pakistan showed three men sitting in the dark with plastic buckets and party hats on their heads. They appeared to fall asleep on camera, only waking when they received a gift to perform a dance.Launched in August 2020, TikTok Live is a section of the app where creators can broadcast to viewers in real time. According to TikTok, 100 million people went live in 2024, reaching “billions of users”, who can engage with the creator in real time by sending comments or gifts. Streams are promoted to TikTok users through a dedicated live feed and can reach millions of people.Novita Anggraeni, an Indonesia-based social inclusion expert at the charity Care International, said many creators used TikTok Live to “show their talent” or “connect with people”. It is commonly used by people who film themselves singing, dancing, playing video games, painting or cooking. But, she said, it was increasingly being misused by those who saw it as a “shortcut to making money”, and that “harmful” videos showing begging and related behaviour had “very rapidly grown”. “It’s a whole new form of exploitation,” she added.She said the streams were driven by poverty and poor digital literacy and that it was not always easy to identify whether people were being coerced. She said apparent victims often denied they were being exploited and said it was “a collaboration to earn money”. But she said there was a “high risk” of abuse by organised begging networks which control access to earnings and organise filming of multiple families.0:30Livestreams show children begging on TikTok – videoMarwa Fatafta, from the digital rights organisation Access Now, said the way TikTok Live was designed incentivised begging and risky behaviour because engagement boosts rewards. “At the same time, TikTok is not making enough effort to ensure that this unintended outcome is being addressed,” Fatafta said.She warned against a blanket approach to moderating begging content, which could penalise people needing humanitarian support in “crisis or conflict-stricken areas”, and is concerned that in some regions, online begging has led to a repressive response from governments.But she said more needed to be done to “tackle organised begging and exploitation”, and urged TikTok to “hire investigative teams”. “At this point, exploitation for organised begging is not only a foreseeable risk, it’s an existing one. So the platform needs to take care of it,” she said.This weekend, TikTok said it had taken firm action, including removing accounts flagged by theObserver.It said its policies banned exploitative begging during live streams, including begging that “exploits children or vulnerable people”. “Any live content which features children begging for gifts is not allowed on TikTok,” a spokesperson said.In cases where it had evidence of exploitative begging or child exploitation, it said it took “firm action”, including closing live streams and issuing permanent bans. It said that through “proactive detection by dedicated teams and technology” it stopped more than 4m live streams each month “to keep our platform safe”. People hosting live streams must have 1,000 followers and be over 18, though children can appear if accompanied by an adult.It said the amount of commission and fees it took varied. Live streamers do not receive the total value of the gift but are awarded “diamonds” based on gifts and the popularity and duration of their stream. After commission and fees, they are typically left with about half the original gift value, but sometimes as little as 30%. TikTok did not deny the figures but said about 30% of gifts revenue went on “app store fees and payment provider costs”. It offers more than 100 digital gifts that viewers can buy, ranging from a rose costing one coin (about 1p) to a TikTok universe (44,999 coins, or about £450).The company has previously faced criticism for profiting from exploitative content on TikTok Live, includinglivestreamed sexual abuse. In 2022, the BBC found families in Syrian refugee camps begging for money. TikTok said it was “deeply concerned” by the findings and was strengthening its global policies.In 2023, Al Jazeera reported that orphanages in Indonesia were soliciting donations via live streams showing children sleeping in the background. TikTok said it banned begging in demeaning contexts but that the orphanage live stream did not violate its guidelines.Despite the risks associated with begging on TikTok, charities say there are also potential positive uses. Begging on TikTok has helped those affected by war, poverty and illness to get help from strangers. In one case, a family in the Philippines successfully crowdsourced money for an operation to separate their conjoined twins. In 2023, a man went viral in Indonesia for performing a chicken-pecking dance on TikTok Live. He told local media that he had now recruited others in his village to take part, who are reported to receive a portion of any money generated, which has helped them buy food when rice supplies are low.But in many cases, it is not clear who stands to profit. Catherine Turner, advocacy director at Anti-Slavery International, said that while some children and adults begged to survive, others were threatened with “physical or psychological coercion” by third parties, who controlled access to their earnings.TikTok requires government-issued ID from live streamers wanting to earn money from rewards, but for viewers, it is often impossible to know whether those appearing in the content benefit from it themselves. Accounts hosting live streams are often anonymous. While rights groups warn against real-name policies on social media, they say stricter age-assurance processes and moderation systems are needed.Maya Lahav, researcher in the Centre for Criminology at Oxford, who previously advised tech companies on detecting exploitative cyber-begging, said moderating live streams was resource-heavy and a “huge challenge”. There were ethical issues around whether to remove content or not. “It’s not like other types of influencers aren’t using their children for profit all the time,” she said.But she said there were serious concerns about human rights abuses, particularly where third parties were involved or those featured were too young, or ill, to consent. “The crux of it is, when does it become exploitation? That’s the balance they need to tread.”Explore more on these topicsTikTokThe ObserverOnline abuseSocial mediaDigital mediaPovertynewsShareReuse this content"

The methods are scientific and the debates are fieryElias VisontaySun 6 Apr 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 6 Apr 2025 20.18 EDTShareAs someone brushing up on 6’3”, height is one physical insecurity I’ve never agonised over. Instead, it’s a source of frustration as I crunch my legs into airplane seats and wait for them to go numb.Only after discovering Celebheights.com did I truly understand the depth of feeling – both excitement and rage – that height can inspire.It was 2019 and I was a cadet journalist reporting from the hustings, and had been barred from a brewery tour after someone nabbed the only other size 13 protective boots required for entry. So I sat alone in the break room, cursing my oversized hooves, and developed a theory that a certain wannabe prime minister had nabbed the final size 13s. I turned to the internet, where I stumbled on Celebheights.com. A whole new world opened.Its rigorous mission statement impressed me. “Heights are bare feet estimates,” it promised, derived from quotations, resumes, picture comparisons and in-person encounters.View image in fullscreenA grid of the most popular pages on Celebheights.com – ‘a thriving community of stature-obsessed keyboard warriors’.Photograph: Celebheights.comMore than a crowd-sourced database of A, B, C and D-grade celebrities’ heights, Celebheights.com is a thriving community of stature-obsessed keyboard warriors.At its heart is founder and moderator, “Admin Rob”: a self-appointed judge who hears pleas from opposing sides about why one star should be robbed of a quarter inch (Heath Ledger) or why another should be awarded an extra eighth to compensate for hunching (Roger Federer).Launched in 2004 (and retaining that era’s web design), it gained fame in 2015 when it was featured on the(criminally short-lived) Mystery Show podcast. One episode sees host Starlee Kine sift through Jake Gyllenhaal’s listing to hunt down his true height. Every commenter sounds like a madman: “I should see him shaven!” one enthusiast quips.But Gyllenhaal’s page is just the tip of the iceberg. Mariah Carey’s entry has amassed 1360 comments since 2004. Carey has repeatedly said she’s 5’9”, but her listing was adjusted down after a torrent of vitriol from commenters proclaiming she was anywhere from 5’8½” down to 5’2”.Complicating calculations is Carey’s penchant for high heels. Trigonometric arguments about a specific shoe’s heel height – and how much it would add to her standing – are routine.Debate intensified in 2005, when user Patricia Carey wrote: “My daughter is 5’9” I should know I’m her mother!” This was quickly discounted as a fake.View image in fullscreenFurious debate rages over Mariah Carey’s height.Photograph: Celebheights.comConjecture continues to this day. Rob has shot down requests to close comments: “The only time an argument should end is when they get measured … Until then I think every celebrity’s height can still be discussed until the end of time.”View image in fullscreenOften, the site’s moderator conducts field research – in the form of celebrity meet-and-greets.Photograph: Celebheights.comWhen he’s not moderating swears and death threats, he’s conducting field research.Rob has made it his life mission to meet-and-greet as many celebrities as possible, ideally back-to-back. Comparing them to his own height – 5’8” – is his only acceptable test.His success rate in convincing celebrities to remove their shoes for barefoot measurement is unclear. When they refuse,such as with Sam Neill,Rob provides separate heel measurements – for the celebrity and himself.But even a celebrity whose height Rob has confirmed personally can be up for debate.Actor Brendan Fraser’s was initially listed as 6’3½”,based on a 2008 Guardian interview, but later changed to 6’2½” after Rob was able to get aphoto with him at a 2019 fan meet, albeit with the actor refusing to remove his fedora.This did not satisfy one commenter, who insisted Fraser’s “maximum morning height” – Celebheights jargon for how humans are tallest each morning before their spine gradually compresses through the day – was surely 6’3½”, before shrinking to 6’3” by lunchtime and 6’2.75” by bedtime.Some commenters do, however, provide valuable insights.“He’s a massive lift wearer,” user Simon wrote after claiming to have met Russell Crowe at a party 10 years earlier. “He got pretty tipsy and took his shoes off. He wasn’t particularly tall before. But when those shoes came off he was probably 5’8½”, max 5’9”.Could you walk across the UK in a perfectly straight line? Inside YouTube’s strangest challengeRead moreSurprisingly, even celebrities whose fame is built on being short have been caught fibbing. Danny DeVito has publicly claimed he stands “five feet short” on “a really good day” – though the figure is disputed.“In August of 2007, I was in the same subway car as someone that looked just like Danny DeVito,” Celebheights commenter MilkyB offered in 2019. “Based on the height of the doppelganger, I’m confident in saying he is 4’10½” at a minimum.”This led me down a DeVito wormhole. I re-emerged hours later with a cursed algorithm, now bombarded with ads for Danny DeVito cardboard cutouts.A mere human, I quickly caved, and now share my bedroom with a lifesize Danny. Infuriatingly, the manufacturer appears to have fallen for DeVito’s lies: cardboard Danny stands at 5’ tall.Explore more on these topicsCultureInternet wormholeInternetCelebrityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The country’s soul is still there, despite Trump’s best efforts to destroy itJohn HarrisFor many of us, the United States means music, progress, hope. Whatever their president does, plenty of Americans continue to believe in those tooSun 6 Apr 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 6 Apr 2025 13.31 EDTShareIt seems as inevitable as the economic chaos let loose by Donald Trump’s madavalanche of tariffs: a precipitous drop in the number of tourists visiting the US, which is now forecast to be even worse than initially feared. In February, overseas travel to the country was down by 5% compared with the previous year – and, now, reputable forecasters arepredicting a dropof nearly twice that size.We all know why. Trump’s hostile words about Canada and Mexico have hitthe US’s top two marketsfor tourism.Finnish, German and Danish transgender and non-binary peoplehave been advisedby their governments to contact a US diplomatic mission before travelling there. Note also a trickle of reports about outsiders falling foul of the cruel stringency apparently now gripping the American authorities: a 28-year-old woman from north Walesheld for 19 daysin a detention centre and escorted on to her plane home in chains; the French scientist who wassummarily denied entryinto the US after his phone was found to contain messages criticising the president. Those stories intensify the Trump administration’s general air of brutality and belligerence, which also brings familiar fears to the surface: of guns,politicised thuggeryand a country in a frighteningly volatile state. The result is the sudden understanding of the US as somewhere that may be best unvisited – which, for millions of people, brings on a very painful pang of loss.Many of us, after all, have always had our understanding of the world shaped by what some people call American soft power. My first sense of the US’s allure came when I was a four-year-old, watching the glorious educational TV showSesame Street, and being spellbound by its multiracial cast, and the way it offered a much more thrilling take on letters and numbers – and life – than the staid fare we got from the BBC and ITV. A little later on, I can recall a few lucky childhood friends returning from American holidays – in Florida, usually – coming home with comics and sweets that increased my sense of the States as a beguiling land of dreams. And then came the clincher: a great mountain of music, which still sits at the heart of my understanding of what the US is, and how it may survive its current crisis.The best American music is nothing if not honest: for me, it worked as a corrective to any rose-tinted ideas I had about the US, while somehow making me even more dazzled. That is definitely true of a run of records made between the late 1960s and mid-1970s, which I still return to again and again: the music of the consummate social commentatorCurtis Mayfield, or the mixture of small-P politics and joyous self-actualisation that runs through Stevie Wonder’s peak work, from Music of my Mind (1972) to 1976’s Songs in the Key of Life. By way of listening to something utterly different, when I first became immersed incountry music, I heard another kind of American truth: the sound of men finding space to be wounded, broken and vulnerable – in retrospect, the complete opposite of the brittle machismo Trump has made his own.View image in fullscreenJohn Harris outside Sun Studios, Memphis, Tennessee, 2001.And then I finally went there: first to the usual big cities, and then to parts of the country too often overlooked. Twenty or so years ago, I took repeated trips to the deep south – Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, Georgia – and found myself simultaneously holding two completely contradictory sets of thoughts. One was to do with the awful intersection of racism – institutional and everyday – and poverty, and the plain fact that the richest country in the world had left so many people to sink. The other, though, was a sense that at least some of these places were making fitful and hesitant progress towards something better. One of my guidebooks talked about a region going through something akin to the journey South Africa had taken after the end of apartheid: on a good day, it was just about possible to believe it.One of my most vivid memories is of a stiflingly hot weekday night in the Mississippi Delta town of Clarksdale, which is still a byword for cotton and slavery, and their long and awful legacy. In a bar owned by the actor Morgan Freeman, I watched a prodigiously talented teenager from the Middle East – her family were refugees – who, thanks to an educational programme run by the town’sblues museum, had learned to play spellbinding lead guitar in the style of such stars asBuddy GuyandAlbert King. She did her stuff watched by a mixed crowd, who were not just amazed, but seemed to share some idea that what we were watching was a small symbol of things improving.Not long after, the advent of Barack Obama’s presidency seemed to spectacularly crystallise some of the same sense of everyday hope, and that very American line, paraphrased from the preamble of the constitution, about progress towards a more perfect union. Whatever that means – and notwithstanding all the hatred, hypocrisy, slaughter and cruelty woven through the American story – I can still feel its force.Are Trump’s tariffs for real or an AI hallucination? I’m afraid the answer is both | Marina HydeRead moreBut Trump, clearly, wants to take his country in the opposite direction, partly by trying to reshape his country’s culture and the image it presents to the world. This is the meaning of – among scores of other actions – theremoval of black Americansfrom educational material produced by the Arlington national cemetery, his attacks on “improper, divisive or anti-American ideology” within the Smithsonian museum network, andhis self-installationas the chair of the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington DC. Such Republican lawmakers as the surreally stupid congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene even want todefund Sesame Street. In the midst of all those unhinged economic policies and assaults on science and academia, these moves are in danger of being overlooked. But they are just as important.My daughter is 15, and as interested in the US as I was at her age, something boosted by the fact that the country between 1789 and 1900 is part of her GCSE history syllabus. She wants to visit the Civil Rights Museum in Memphis, Tennessee, and Sun Studios, where rock’n’roll first took flight. When she finally gets to New York, her first stops will include the Museum of Modern Art and what remains of the old Greenwich Village. I now wonder: should we go? But I think we still will, for one very good reason: that in the end, everything those places and institutions represent will prove to be Trump’s undoing. Put another way, he is not America. And for those of us who remain fascinated by the US, the best response to his misrule is not to turn away, but to keep faith with the Americans who understand that – not as dazzled outsiders, but people whose future depends on something better.John Harris is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsUS newsOpinionDonald TrumpUnited States holidaysTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

If Trump wantsCambodiato import more American goods: look, we are just a very small country!”Khun Tharo works to promote human rights in the Cambodian garment sector, which employs about 1 million people – many of them women.“I think they are very concerned about their jobs, and I think they are very concerned about their monthly pay cheque. And that has significant effects on the livelihoods of their dependent family,” says Tharo, programme manager at the Centre for Alliance of Labor and Human Rights (CENTRAL), a Cambodian workers’ rights organisation.One of the most wilfully destructive aspects ofDonald Trump’s shock and awe trade policyis the imposition of punitive tariffs on developing countries across Asia, including rates of49% for Cambodia, 37% for Bangladesh, 48% for Laos.For decades Washington had championed economic development through trade. Now, at the same time as slashing overseas aid budgets and retreating from its role in supporting developing nations, it is ripping up that idea entirely.In its place, Trump intends to impose his will on the US’s trading partners. Some are all but powerless to exact concessions, given their small size, and dependence on the mighty American market.Cambodia hastily offered to cut tariffs on US goods on Friday, in a bid to propitiate Washington.Contrary to Trump’s bombast about the US being “pillaged”, the tariffs are not in any sense “reciprocal”.Instead, they relate to the size of the US goods trade deficit with each country, and the value of its exports. (Side note: the 10% paid by the UK has nothing to do with Labour’s negotiating flair – it just came out of the fact that Britain buys about as much stuff from the US as it sells the other way).Ironically, many of the countries in the global south hit by Trump had benefited from preferential schemes offering low or zero tariffs, precisely because building up exporting capacity is an accepted path to development.Alice Oyaro, the chief executive at the charity Transform Trade, which works with producers in some of the worst-hit countries, says: “Our biggest concern is that the additional costs are pushed down to those in the supply chain who are least able to pay. Small farmers exporting everything from green beans to cocoa, and women workers in Bangladeshi factories are already finding it hard to make ends meet. They will see their incomes squeezed even more.”TinySri Lanka, which has an economy 0.3% of the size of the US’s, faces a 44% tariff despite being bailed out by the International Monetary Fund two years ago and continuing to negotiate debt restructuring deals with its creditors.“It’s a highly vulnerable situation,” says Ajith D Perera, the chair of theAsia PacificTrade Agreement (APTA) Chamber of Commerce and Industry. “Sri Lanka will lose export income and see a hit to GDP and employment – and that comes at a time when it is just coming out of bankruptcy.”He fears the scale of the tariffs could compromise Sri Lanka’s ability to meet the conditions of the IMF bailout deal. Trade is meant to be a key prop for growth, as it rebuilds its shattered economy.“I think the fundamentals have been challenged by the US decision,” he says. “25% of Sri Lanka’s exports go to the US and 70% of that is garments. I think the government needs to start discussions with the IMF immediately.”As his warning suggests, there is a risk that a grim side-effect of Trump’s trade war will be to exacerbate the debt crises already hittingheavily indebtedpoorer nations.Even countries that have escaped the most punitive tariff rates could still be hit hard if the prospect of a global downturn depresses the value of the commodity exports on which many rely.Keir Starmer and other leaders of the developed world have been preoccupied with their own domestic responses since Wednesday’s bombshell briefing in the White House Rose Garden.But the severity of the probable impact for the global south calls for a concerted approach, too – albeit one that will have to bypassWashington.Most of the hardest-hit countries can already trade tariff-free with major markets under projects such as the EU’s Everything But Arms programme and the UK’s Developing Countries Trading Scheme, which are designed to help the poorest nations to develop through trade.But if Trump’s tariffs stick, multinational brands focused on the US are likely to switch production rapidly to countries hit with lower rates. One garment buyer in India told me on Friday she was already hearing of factory owners in Bangladesh being told by US brands that they would now be manufacturing their sweaters in Peru, which has a rate of just 10%.The social dislocation in some of these hardest-hit economies could be profound, if such rapid shifts result in mass layoffs.And the case for debt write-offs, already clear, may become all the more pressing, if the resulting the looming global downturn sweeps vulnerable countries over the edge.The fact that the British government’s deep cuts to the aid budget now sit alongside a probable global economic downturn and heavy US penalties for exporters in developing countries makes that decision all the more shameful.Back in Cambodia, Tharo says: “The industry right now seems to be in a little bit of a hectic situation. The government is also extremely worried because they are not seeing any alternative markets at the moment. And we don’t have significant goods to be exported to any other country.“Trump doesn’t care,” he sighs.Explore more on these topicsTariffsEconomics viewpointDonald TrumpTrade and developmentTrump administrationCambodiaUS politicsAsia PacificcommentShareReuse this content"

This rhetoric shows that the US administration doesn’t understand my thriving countrySun 6 Apr 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 6 Apr 2025 09.20 EDTShareI am a blue-blood Afrikaner, at least in terms of ancestry: both my grandfathers were young Boer soldiers in the Anglo-Boer war and I am directly related to the president of the old Transvaal Republic, Paul Kruger. I am a descendant of Dutch, French and German settlers who were brought to the southern tip ofAfricain the 17th century. Unlike other colonial societies in Africa, my ancestors never left.They occupied the whole country, displacing and oppressing the Indigenous inhabitants. Eventually, their concept of white supremacy developed into a formal state policy,apartheid. The UN classified this as a crime against humanity. Miraculously, my country has been a thriving democracy and open society ever since the formal end of apartheid in 1994.Imagine my bewilderment when Donald Trump and his “first buddy”, South African-born Elon Musk, declared that we Afrikaners are a threatened species; that our black compatriots areengaged in a “genocide”; that we are victims of oppression and discrimination and as such offered special refugee status in the United States – at the very point in time that thousands of migrants to that country are being repelled or deported. The US state department is evenpreparing “refugee centres”in Pretoria to house these “victims”.The criticisms and threats coming from Trump, his secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and Musk outraged the majority of South Africans because the claims were patently false and were seen as unacceptable meddling with internal affairs. A section of the white population, however – the ethnic Afrikaner nationalists and separatists –welcomed the US intervention, leading to harsh exchanges with racial undertones on social and other media.Just for the record: Afrikaners are generally better off today than prior to 1994, when they gave up political power; materially, culturally and in terms of personal freedom.South Africa’s progressive constitution with its extensive bill of rights is intact; the rule of law is maintained and the judiciary is independent and functioning; we are a genuinely open society with free speech and media that many other democracies, especially Trump’s America, can be jealous of.Whites (about 7.3% of the population)still dominate the economy and own about half the land – and not one square inch of it has been confiscated from white owners. White unemployment stands at 7% with the national figure at more than 30%. The crime rate in the predominantly white suburbs is minuscule compared with that in the vast black townships.South Africa is ruled by a government of national unity, a coalition between the ANC and the white-led Democratic Alliance, whom the president, Cyril Ramaphosa,chose to partnerwith instead of the two black nationalist parties, the MK and the Economic Freedom Fighters. The former leader of the predominantly Afrikaner party, the Freedom Front Plus, Pieter Groenewald, is one of several white members of Ramaphosa’s cabinet. Genocide? Victims?It’s true that the ANC-led governments of the last two decades have, to put it mildly, not performed brilliantly. We had a decade (2009 to 2018) of scandal known as“state capture”under the previous president, Jacob Zuma, and the country hasn’t yet recovered from that completely. There was a deterioration of infrastructure and inner cities, there are almost daily reports of corruption, crime is not under control and economic growth has been at around 1%.But these areourproblems, effectingallour citizens. We don’t need Trump’s or Musk’s help.Where does their interest in our country come from? South Africa irritated the US and other western governments when it took Israel to the ICJ (international court of justice), alleging genocide in itswar in Gaza – Trump made this clear in hisexecutive orderon South Africa. The scale of that conflict demanded that someone took the matter for international adjudication, andit was appropriatethat it be done by a nation that had overcome dehumanisation, forced removals from land, and gross human rights abuses. History, I believe, will be kind to my country on this score.But Trump’s expressed anger is mainly directed at the treatment of Afrikaners, a group of people he’s probably never thought of before Musk became his confidant. Why this fixation? Three letters: DEI. Diversity, equity and inclusion. In South Africa, it is called black empowerment and affirmative or corrective action: attempts to speed up the recovery from centuries of dehumanisation, exclusion from the economy, and job reservation.South Africa has been blessed and cursed because its history and demographics reflect the great themes of human experience. Blessed because the crudeness and cruelty of racial apartheid offended so many people around the world that the international anti-apartheid movement became powerful and white-run South Africa was isolated through sanctions and boycotts. Cursed because the global hard-right has found a seductive narrative – in the current era of immigration pressures and rising ethnic nationalism – in a white minority that is portrayed as endangered. The message is that the supposed fate of Afrikaners in South Africa will be that of white conservatives in the US unless something is done.Trump’s attacks on South Africa are a punishment for independence |  Achille Mbembe and Ruth Wilson GilmoreRead moreI get the sense that fellow Afrikaners are bemused by the offer of refugee status. I think the overwhelming response is “thanks for asking, but no thanks”. We named our tribe after the African continent. Most of us, even those who deeply resent our government and its policies, regard ourselves as pale-skinned Africans. We passionately love our expressive, earthy language, Afrikaans, that is only spoken here and in neighbouring Namibia; it is the most important part of our ethnic identity.The Trump administration’s threatenedsanctionsagainst our countryare going to hurt. The best among us Afrikaners and other white South Africans join the rallying call against this foreign interference to galvanise our entire society and to show ourselves and the world that we can be a harmonious and successful country.

I was humbled by Richardsons’s decision to do something genuinely worthwhile and by his foolhardy bravery. How would he control a class of teenagers pre-armed with clips of him clowning around with Russell Brand onThe Great Celebrity Bake Off?But it turned out Richardsons’s story was merely an April fool prank. D’oh! The fact that the inspiring tale wasn’t true left me deeply saddened, like the time I wept when my mum finally told me Father Christmas hadn’t been eating the mince pies I’d made for him. I was 28 years old.Of course a multimillionaire comedian wouldn’t quit comedy to become a teacher on a £31,650-a-year starting salary, you idiot! That would be ridiculous. Richardsons’s April fool was a publicity stunt to promote his casting as a teacher in the soap operaWaterloo Road, where actors are paid more than teachers to pretend to be teachers.But perhaps Richardsons should change career. And perhaps, despite being “the world’s greatest living standup” (theTimes), so should I. We should all do the right thing and comedians have crowd-management skills that transfer well to the classroom. “I remember when I had my first Prime energy drink, Jenkins! I’m here all week!! Try the fish!!!”Teachers inspire kids and thus change the world for the better. But nobody ever went on to change the world after watching8 Outof 10 Cats. And wouldn’t it have been great, for once, to see someone successful walk away from their wealth to help humanity? It shouldn’t always have to beMichael Sheenputting himself out, again and again and again, his beard all wet with Welsh rain.Like most north London champagne socialists, I am increasingly disappointed, for example, by the endless wrong choices ofKeir Starmer, who I voted for hoping he would allow me to pay lip service to progressive values while making minimal negative impact on my own standard of living and hoarded assets. That went well. Having been handed a blank cheque by a disillusioned electorate, Starmer has instead just drawn a fat ejaculating penis on it and left it on the worktop by the waste caddy to get smeared with old stinky food.Donald Trump says he is imposing tariffs because other nations have been“raping” the US for years, and it’s bold to use that verb as a metaphor for financial exploitation when you, and many of your houseguests and cheerleaders, have been accused of rape: Mike Tyson,Brand,Conor McGregorandAndrew Tate. It’s the worst series ofTaskmasterever.Is our economic future merely as an airstrip full of low-taxed American servers generating AI memes of Trump dressed as a golden Disney king?In return for our10% lower-than-averageTrump tariffs, Starmer offeredtax breaks to US tech companies. Presumably, these tech companies are the same sort of tech companies Starmer was complaining about last week because they didn’t regulate their hateful and false content? This false content includes Elon Musk-endorsed posts saying the “incel” dramaAdolescence,which Starmer is basing policy on, was originally a true story about a murderous black boy who was changed to a white boy because “blah, blah, wokeness, blah, blah, blah”. And, by the way, that bit in inverted commas was an actual quote from Kemi Badenoch.When the US national security adviser, Michael Waltz, invited a journalist on to an insecure group chat, we learned thatwanting to see Europe fail is essentially official American policy. Trump’s US is our enemy. And Jeff Bezos’sAmazon directly donates to Trump; former PayPal executives areembedded in Trump’s government; Uber’s chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, directly donates to Trump;Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta gave Trump $1m; a senior executive at Peter Thiel’s Palantir spyware company, into whose metaphorical Miami mansion Wes Streeting wants to move all our alluring NHS metadata, helped finance Trump’s campaign; and Musk’s Twitter, currently X, actively advances far-right talking points to destabilise European democracies and promote fascist candidates. They seem nice.Starmer is encouraging people who want to destroy our values to come and do it in our country at reduced tax rates, like a man putting on trousers made of meat and running towards a leopard. Even Ed Davey, the Evel Knievel of the centre left, says ourmoral responsibility is to join Canadaand the EU in opposing this new dark US. But, with our gross domestic product and European alliances decimated by Brexit, we can’t afford to take the moral high ground, which was of course the plan of its shadowy backers all along. Is our economic future merely as an airstrip full of low-taxed American servers generating AI memes of Trump dressed as a golden Disney king?People understand the peril we are in. I spent last weekend ecstatically inhabiting a small Welsh town at a multidisciplinary arts festival where punters and performers alike were preparing for possible US trips by deleting all their social media,fearing airport incarcerationfrom Trump’s thought police. But at least our Trump tariffs are 10% lower.What happened to youthful ideals? In March 2024, Starmer said he remembered being inspired by leaving his “village for the city of Leeds” and discovering “a whole new world of indie bands – like Orange Juice and the Wedding Present”. Did Malcolm Ross take his distinctive guitar work from Josef K to Orange Juice just so Starmer could sell us out to the new Nazis, like Neville Chamberlain waving a various-artists cassette thatcame free with a mid-80sNME?“I have in my hand a copy ofC86.”Perhaps, unlike the April fool John Richardsons, Starmer should become a teacher. We need more teachers. And if a big boy was bullying all the little kids and stealing their dinner money, Starmer’s already shown he knows how to look the other way.Stewart Lee vs the Man-Wulftours until spring 2026 with a Royal Festival Hall run in JulyDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But as a pastoral carer, it’s my jobSun 6 Apr 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 6 Apr 2025 20.11 EDTShare“It’s the waiting that is the worst,” the woman says to me. She sits by her mother, who is in her late 80s and has beenactively dyingfor about three days.“I keep watching her chest,” the woman admits. I watch it too, a shallow rise and fall.Waiting in the modern era has become something almost as uncomfortable as pain.As Denis McBride writes in Waiting on God:“In our society there is a direct correlation between status and waiting.”In other words, the more important you are, the less time you are required to wait for something you want. If I need knee surgery and I can afford private health insurance, I can skip the queue of the public system. My money would buy me time, but more than that, a sense of encapsulation, a protective layer between me and fate.Ramadan is not just about abstaining from food. It’s about truthfulness – something we can all learn from | Shadi Khan SaifRead moreEveryone knows what it is to wait. As the (ostensible) grown-up in my household, I enforce screen downtime limits and bemoan my child’s inability to entertain herself, conveniently forgetting my own mother’s exasperation when I would stretch out on the carpet of the living room, proclaiming, ‘I’mbored.’Using the word “bore” to describe something as tiresome came into vogue in the 1700s, presumably in drawing rooms inhabited by Jane Austen’s Lydia Bennet and Mary Crawford. The word has its roots in the old Englishberan:to carry, endure, give birth to; to move forward, or stand firm, under pressure. In this context, to bear becomes a virtue.Some of the elderly people I visit are perennially bored. “The days are long,” one man tells me. He is bed-bound, and anything to relieve the boredom, including my bumbling self, is welcome. A woman who has passed her hundredth year laughs ruefully as she tells me, “I’m just sobored.” She was once the kind of person who was always busy. Now she can no longer see well enough to read, and her hearing is almost gone, even with the aids.“I think this stage is the worst of it all,” the woman I am sitting with says. I try to imagine the stages of her mother’s cancer: the initial diagnosis, the pain of the growing tumours, the nausea of the medicines. I look at her mother’s face, which appears, to me, to be peaceful with pain relief.I know what the woman means. It’s the not knowing which is the worst. Not knowing the answer to the only question left: when will she die (and, in some tiny, irrational, deeply true part of ourselves, will she really die? Will I?) Not knowing if she is OK, or if, under the still surface of her shallow breathing, she is in torment, wanting to say something or do one last thing. Or if she is even there at all, and we are sitting here, waiting for something which has, on some level, already happened.As a pastoral carer, it is not my job to entertain or distract. It is my job to sit with people, and whatever they are feeling, even if it means that I am made restless with the deep discomfort of doing nothing. I employ my battery of spiritual practises: meditative breathing, offering prayer from the person’s tradition if they have one, reading poetry, even singing tunes that the person once (hopefully) liked.None of us wants to think about death. But pretending it won’t happen may not be the best option | Simon SmartRead moreAlthough I might be a professional wait-er, I almost always break under the pressure.“Do you need a cup of tea?” I ask the woman. Try as I might to remain still, I almost always find myself attempting to make people more comfortable, when they are not the ones who are uncomfortable. Every time I catch myself avoiding the act of waiting, I take a breath, and seek, again, to send my attentiveness to the person.Patience has to flow in both directions – to the person I wait with, and to me, whom I will always be waiting for.“No, thanks,” the woman says. She settles into the armchair by her mother’s side. “I’ll just be here.” Fidgeting, dozing, watching her mother’s breath come and go: it’s the last way she can love her mother. She will bear it, this waiting, for as long as it takes.Jackie Bailey is the author of The Eulogy, winner of the 2023 NSW premier’s literary multicultural award.

Yes. It’s on my ‘do not play’ listOliver KeensI get why wedding DJs are increasingly discerning. Our  job is to spread joy on the dancefloor – not upset and divisionSun 6 Apr 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 6 Apr 2025 09.21 EDTShareIhave DJed at some impressively esoteric weddings in my time. I started playing clubs in 1999, but in the mid-2000s I started advertising myself as a wedding DJ on the era-defining digital noticeboard Gumtree. One heroic couple only wanted the music of abrasive Manchester geniuses the Fall for the entirety of their nuptials. Another sweet couple wanted to evoke the night they met at 5am at the London gay club Fire – so hired me to bang out punishing hard house from 5pm in a hotel function room.From experience, people who hire wedding DJs are usually fairly clear about what they like. They may provide a short list of songs they love, usually across a few genres, and trust a DJ to fill in the gaps. It’s rarer that people are clear what they explicitly don’t like.However, a story in the Times this week claimed that wedding DJs increasingly “cater for these sensitivities” by “drawing up ‘do not play’ lists, to ensure that a happy couple’s happiest day is not spoilt”. It cited Ben Boylan, founder of Non-Traditional Wedding DJs, who claimed that names such as R Kelly and P Diddy were frequently appearing on such lists. In another piece in the New York Times, a 39-year-old rabbi from Manhattan explained she hadrequested no Kanye West, given his current pro-Nazi stance. “If a song is controversial or offensive to any community member, that should really be thought about,” she said.The art of DJing is essentially just a series of choices. You are forced to make a brand new decision every three to four minutes and hope you get them all spot on until the lights come on at the end.So the idea of curbing a DJ’s ability to choose may seem like a dangerous route to go down; a curb on artistic and creative freedom. Yet this is not a new phenomenon. I am proud that over the past 10 years or so the UK’s dance music scene has fiercelyshunned artistswho, in the cases of techno producers Konstanin and Boddika, for example, have respectively talked down female DJs and used anti-immigrant language online, or Lithuanian Top 10-scoring producer Ten Walls, who hasespoused homophobia.View image in fullscreenKanye West performs at Rolling Loud 2024 in Inglewood, California, 14 March 2024.Photograph: Scott Dudelson/Getty ImagesWhereas other creative industries take decades to erase bigots in their midst, DJs en masserejected their music almost instantly. To be clear, this isn’t cancellation by some kind of sinister cabal or woke diktat: I have never encountered a single “do not play” list in any club ever, even ones with activism and political causes at their core. I think the fact that DJing is so rooted in fast choices is a blessing in this regard. Choosing “no” just isn’t a big deal. That said, if I’m honest, I wouldn’t be averse to more clubs having “do not play” lists. Sometimes, it would be nice to not have to make all the moral decisions by oneself.As the Timespiece made clear, the more vile things we learn about our favourite artists, the more they rightly trigger our sensibilities. Just as a good DJ knows how to read a room, a modern DJ should already be well versed in deciding which artists and songs may make a room of strangers feel upset.‘Do not play’ lists: why every party needs one – or you’re bound to upset the guestsRead moreMy own moral approach has always been to remember that a DJ’s job is to spread joy to every single person in that room. Morrissey has made too many statements seen as hateful for many people to enjoy, I can report. Yet the fact that several 1970s rock stars slept with underage girls doesn’t seem to be an issue for older people’s morality on the dancefloor. I paused playing Lizzo when her former tourdancers accused herof sexual harassment and body shaming, and stopped playing Diplo afterallegations of sexual misconductarose. Their innocence or guilt is oddly immaterial: I just don’t want to even risk that someone on my dancefloor might feel bad, period.Beyond the individual tracks that make up a set, that’s my ultimate choice as a DJ – to treat a dancefloor as a beautiful haven, not a “platform” like Speakers’ Corner.DJs respectfully disagree on artists all the time, too. I personally find Azealia Banks’s previousonline hatred abhorrent (it ended for me in 2016 when she used thesame racial slursabout Zayn Malik that I got called at school). But her 2012 hit 212 is a mainstay of modern queer clubs, and I enjoy an ongoing dialogue with fellow DJs about her place in the culture.And even though in the wake of the vile stories told inLeaving NeverlandI give a hard “no” to Michael Jackson tracks, I’m keen to stress that nobody ever notices the omissions. There really is so much amazing music out there that you can be a principled, moral DJ and still kill it every time. In short, do not fear a “do not play” list: nobody should feel excluded from enjoying themselves, and if a song threatens that, simply choose something else.Oliver Keens is a writer, author and columnist, as well as a DJDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But it turns out unions don’t always make for the best, or even adequate, employers themselves.In last week’s parliamentary debate on the use of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) by employers to cover up abuse and discrimination in the workplace, Labour MP Louise Haigh recounted how unions haveused confidentiality agreements to hush up appalling behaviour.One example is the Transport Salaried Staffs’ Association (TSSA), which has used NDAs totry to preventformer female employees from publicly making allegations of sexual harassment against Manuel Cortes, the general secretary at the time; a 2023 review by Helena Kennedy KC later found that there had been “appalling incidents” and “leadership and management failings” at the TSSA in relation to sexual harassment and that Cortes’s behaviour around women was suchan “open secret”that women joining the organisation were warned never to be alone with him. It is not just unions. Haigh has also used her parliamentary privilege to talk about the case ofan ITN employeewith functional neurological disorder who experiences seizures and blackouts. He experienced severe bullying and discrimination from his managers, including being forced to apologise to those who had witnessed a seizure, and being accused of lying about his disability. He took ITN to an employment tribunal; the company eventually settled but forced him to sign an NDA as part of the agreement.Layla Moran, another MP pushing for change,has raised the caseof a female ITN employee who was demoted after ending an abusive sexual relationship with an older male editor; after she complained, she was suspended without pay and told she could not talk to anyone but the police about it; in settling, ITN got her to sign an ultimately unenforceable NDA that gagged not just her but her partner, her friends and her parents, from talking about what had happened to her.The stories we are least likely to hear are of those in low-paid, insecure jobs who are unlikely to have access to legal adviceHaighalso last week raised the caseof the former employee of a mental health charity who believes it has discriminated against at least four workers on mental health grounds, including herself; three ended up signing an NDA.Because NDAs are so effective at gagging people from talking about abuse and discrimination – even when they would be unenforceable in court, they frighten workers into silence – we rarely hear about them apart from in the very high-profile cases where survivors, often women who have been sexually assaulted by powerful men, have been brave enough to break them via the press.Zelda Perkins, a former PA to the jailed film producer Harvey Weinstein, founded the Can’t Buy My Silence campaign after she broke her own NDAto speak outabout his criminal behaviour. She has long been campaigning for change because it is clear that NDAs are being used to undermine employment protections right across the labour market.The cases raised by MPs using parliamentary privilege show just how systemic the problem is. Trade unions that exist to protect workers from abuse; media organisations whose job it is to hold power to account; charities that pride themselves on advocating for those with mental health issues: if these organisations are using NDAs to gag people from talking about things that are in the public interest, you can bet it’s going on in most workplaces.The stories we are least likely to hear are of those working in low-paid, insecure jobs who are unlikely to have access to the legal advice needed to challenge them. And it is those most likely to experience discrimination – women, ethnic minority workers and disabled people – who will be most affected.There are legitimate uses of NDAs: to protect confidential business information or to protect workers from details of discrimination cases being discussed – at their request – for example. The problem is that a legal tool originally intended to protect trade secrets and the like has expanded into a boilerplate legal clause that a huge number of employers routinely slap into settlement agreements.This has huge implications not just for holding employers accountable for abuse and discrimination in the workplace, but for freedom of expression. Why should a nurse who accepts a settlement from an NHS trust have to sign an agreement that seeks to prevent them from criticising that trust in perpetuity, for example?Various spurious arguments are advanced against clamping down on the use of NDAs: chiefly, the idea that if you take away the power of employers to bully former employees into signing NDAs, there will be fewer settlements. But settlements will still be reached as a means of avoiding expensive court cases. In the US – hardly a bastion of employment rights – 27 states have introduced tougher restrictions on the use of NDAs, and an analysis of data from six suggests settlement ratesactually went upafter they were enacted.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That’s an important development, but there is absolutely no reason why employees and students of universities should be entitled to these protections, while those who work for outsourced cleaning companies contracted by universities should not be.Haigh and Moran are leading efforts to get the government to amend its employment rights bill to more tightly regulate the use of NDAs across the economy; they not only have the support of the Conservative and Liberal Democrat frontbenches, but from business and union leaders and experienced lawyers in the House of Lords.It would be remiss of the government to introduce further important employment rights – such as banning exploitative zero-hours contracts and fire-and-rehire policies – without also addressing a key reason it’s so difficult for workers to enforce their existing protections. It should not only restrict the use of NDAs in harassment, bullying and discrimination cases, but where there is a public interest in ex-employees speaking out about matters that involve their former employer.This is so often how it works: when employment rights become codified in law, the powerful find workarounds, like NDAs, to evade their legal responsibilities, even as they claim to support them. Ministers must finally close this longstanding and much-abused loophole.Sonia Sodha is an Observer columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Given the Lib Dem leader’s proclivity for election campaign stunts, it would have been a man-bites-dog level of surprise that he was no longer prepared to charge around in fancy dress while trying to get attention for his party’s message.Of course, he didn’t do that: the man in a boring suit talking about change was Keir Starmer, while Davey chose to ride a hobby horse. His message from the back of the toy horse was that theLiberal Democratsare in a “two-horse race” with the Tories in many of the English council seats up for grabs in May. But he also argued that the Lib Dems were the “natural home” for voters who were fed up with Labour. His party is hoping it can hoover up more voters in the “blue wall” of the home counties where the Conservatives have alienated reasonably centrist middle-class types both by being incompetent in government and lurching right.Tory election expert Robert Hayward also suggests Davey’s party may want to expand into areas that Labour won inJuly 2024’s general election“but which are not parts of their natural territory”, such as in Oxfordshire and Cornwall. He expects them to quietly pick up county council seats and control of local authorities “without being the main story”.The Lib Dems have long been happy to not be the main story, benefiting as a protest vote party from whoever is getting the headlines for making a mess. But the profile of that protest voter has changed, and so Davey and colleagues have adapted their messaging. Back in the 2010s, the party was more likely to have purchase among the kind of people who might, on another day, vote Ukip: working-class or lower-middle-class people who were uncomfortable with the way the country was changing.Inside the party, there was confusion when they discovered that some of their voters were moving to Ukip: how was this possible when they seemed to be so diametrically opposed politically? They held focus groups with these switchers, which those present recalled as some of the angriest they had sat through (quite an achievement given the level of fury at the time about the party’s U-turn on tuition fees). In one session, a strategist interrupted and asked whether there was anything these voters liked about Britain. The reply was telling: “Its past.”Calling for a parliamentary vote on any trade deal between the UK and US ignores the necessity for the government to be pragmaticToday, the voters Davey is after are still worried about where things are going, but in a more global sense. They are still protest voters, but of the sort who listen to Alastair Campbell and Rory Stewart protesting onThe RestIs Politicspodcast about the mistakes the government is making. The party feels it is appealing to a new cohort of voters in affluent parts of Oxfordshire and Surrey who have voted Conservative all their lives but who feel left behind by their former choice. They are more internationalist, upscale, traditionally Tory voters with grownup children who live in flats affected by the cladding crisis.To suggest he is speaking for these new voters Davey has moved on from talking about Brexit (so last decade) to pushing Keir Starmer about his relationship with Donald Trump in order to express that discomfort with the way the world is going. Almost every week at prime minister’s questions and in other sessions in the Commons, Davey asks Starmer to take a harder line on Trump.The US president is so important to his messaging that the Lib Dem leader no longer asks about social care as much as he used to. Social care did, though, have the same function as Trump has now: it contrasts with the hobby horse stuff to show that Davey has a serious side as well as the attention-grabbing stuff. It helps that Kemi Badenoch has had a niche approach to PMQs, often leaving the field clear for Davey – and, more recently and surprisingly, the SDLP, to ask the really difficult questions.Now, as revealed in this paper today, the party is calling for a vote in parliament on any trade deal between the UK and US. The tactic would force Labour MPs in traditionally non-Labour rural areas to appear to take a side against their already angry farming constituents – as well as making the Tories take the same uncomfortable choice in public. It is an effective approach, as it pitches the Lib Dem protest mentality against the necessity for the government to be pragmatic. At no point does Davey have to make the argument that of course the UK has to talk to the US because he is not in government or pretending to be a party of government. He wants to pitch the Lib Dems as a campaigning force in politics, speaking up for the voters the establishment parties are ignoring.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They were mocked back in the 00s for having a “goldfish policy” (a motion passed at conference calling for a ban on live animals as prizes), but even a decade ago, their defence policy could largely, and not particularly unfairly, be characterised as wishing we all just got along better. They opposed full renewal of the Trident nuclear deterrent. Now, their manifesto position is that they support four submarines and the continuous at-sea deterrent of having at least one of those boats in the seas at any time. They talk a lot more aboutdefence in terms of higher spendingand support for the armed forces. This is in part because they have six MPs with military backgrounds and because the world really has changed. But it is also because the party sees what insiders call “quiet patriots” as a key voter group to appeal to. They want to target people who feel strongly that someone should be standing up for the national interest, but not in the tone adopted by Nigel Farage.The Trident policy change passed Badenoch by: recently, she claimed the Lib Dems had a lot of “silly and foolish ideas” including that they “don’t want us to keep, maybe, a nuclear deterrent”. Mind you, in the same interview, she also described a “typical Liberal Democrat” as “somebody who is good at fixing their church roof”. She was mocked at the time, but it was a good illustration of the impact the Lib Dems have had on politics more widely. They have always seen community politics (and more recently, fancy dress) as the way of attracting voters’ attention.That focus on the local has gone mainstream in politics in recent decades, to the extent that MPs from all parties regularly lobby for more funding for constituency staff, often to take on casework that should really be dealt with by a local councillor, not a member of parliament.This is not, by the way, a wholly good thing: while a deep local involvement keeps them in touch and empathetic to their constituents, MPs are legislators first and foremost and yet are devoting more time and resources to local issues that could often be prevented in the first place if parliament did a better job of scrutinising legislation.Constituency work is not finite: it is more like expanding foam and will quickly fill the capacity created by more staff, meaning those MPs will be back for more workers in a few years’ time. All driven in part by a fear that, if they aren’t seen to be fixing the church roof, then they will lose to their opponents, especially the Lib Dems. So in a sense, Ed Davey’s party is at least partly to blame for politics becoming less about the business of getting things done nationally and more about how intimately involved you are with your local drainage issues.Speaking of drainage issues, Davey will be performing more stunts in the local election campaign like his famousWindermere paddle board fall. He knows his party won’t be the main story of the locals, but that doesn’t mean it won’t continue to hold more sway over the discourse than many realise.Isabel Hardman is assistant editor of the Spectator and a presenter of Radio 4’s The Week in WestminsterExplore more on these topicsLiberal DemocratsOpinionEd DaveyLocal electionsLocal governmentcommentShareReuse this content"

Half a century on, that segment has become the focus of one of the most contentious and polarising of debates. For many on the right, the white working class constitutes a distinct group, both their distinctiveness and their problems, stemming largely from their whiteness. Many on the left have, Joel Budd notes, “fallen silent on the subject”, nervous of racialising issues of class.In his new book,Underdogs,Budd deftly negotiates his way through this treacherous terrain. The white working class, he argues, constitutes a distinctive group but one whose distinctiveness is explained less by ethnicity than by geography. Minority groups are concentrated in the big cities, especially London. This provides benefits in everything from education to infrastructure. White workers, on the other hand, live disproportionately outside metropolitan areas, in and around small towns such as Blackpool, Gateshead and Paignton. These are places that, despite constant chatter of “levelling up”, have largely been neglected by national politicians; places in which social mobility is low, and which are often lacking in good jobs, schools and infrastructure. It is this, Budd argues, that makes the experience of the white working class distinctive.Take education. The gap between attainment levels of middle-class and working-class children is much larger for white pupils than it is for most minority groups. While working-class children often have high aspirations, their expectations soon become tempered by reality. They may dream of becoming doctors or engineers, but their social pathways are often blocked. Doing well in school can feel redundant. “I was aspirational too, until I realised there isn’t much to aspire to”, as one of Budd’s interviewees despairingly puts it.White workers may constitute a distinct group but they are not, Budd argues, homogeneous. A key distinction he draws is between “heartlands”, “enclaves” and “colonies”. Heartlands are predominantly white areas, such as the north-east, South Wales and the West Country. Enclaves are areas with a largely white population but at the edges of more diverse conurbations, such as Wythenshawe, a sprawling housing estate on the outskirts of Manchester. Here, where social and demographic change seems always on the horizon, people are more insistent than in the heartlands on whiteness as an identity. Academics and journalists often come to such places to discover the “real” white working class as a “self-conscious group that feels invaded and put upon”, but fail to understand this as just one perspective among many.Depicting hostility to immigration ‘not as your own opinion’ but as coming from ‘vulnerable white working-class people’ gives it greater legitimacyAnd then there are what Budd calls “colonies”, towns and villages settled by white working-class people from elsewhere, who often transplant into the new environment aspects of their old cultures and ways of life, raising fascinating questions about the meaning of identity and integration.Budd’s argument about the diversity of the white working class may seem to cut against the claim of its distinctiveness. But, as he put it when I asked him about it, “It is possible and important to recognise both”, and to recognise, too, that “the balance between them” is not fixed. This is true of many social groups. We think of British Muslims, for instance, as a distinct group but they are also too diverse to talk of as a single community, though commentators often do.Budd’s rethinking of the white working class leads him to question many myths about it. Consider the immigration debate. This has been driven largely by a sense of working-class hostility and by the desperation of politicians to respond to it.While white working-class Britons are more opposed to immigration than white middle-class Britons, they also show a diversity of opinion – from liberal to xenophobic – that is often ignored. The best predictor of attitudes to immigration is not class but age: young people are far more relaxed about the matter. The British Election Studydata showsthat differences in views on immigration are greater between young white workers and older ones than between white workers and the white middle class.There are clearly genuine and widespread concerns about immigration. But those are rarely as portrayed by politicians and the media. Part of the problem is what Budd calls “ventriloquised xenophobia”. Depicting hostility to immigration “not as your own opinion” but as coming from “vulnerable white working-class people” provides it with greater legitimacy. The tactic of using the working class as an alibi for elite prejudices isdeeply embeddedin British history.Perhaps the weakest part of Budd’s argument lies in the discussion of the decline of class politics. For Budd, Labour’s shift away from its working-class constituency, if not wholly good, has been “necessary”, as he suggested to me, to allow it “to appeal to middle-class voters”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What has happened in the post-Thatcher era is a conscious refashioning of that coalition, jettisoning class politics, embracing neoliberal policies and promoting technocratic values. Labour MPs with working-class backgrounds have, as Budd notes, become rare, largely replaced by “political careerists” with a background “in thinktanks or as advisers”.Sections of the working class, feeling abandoned and voiceless, have themselves, over time, abandoned Labour, some gravitating towards the Tories and more recently towards Reform. It is difficult to see how you can address the issues Budd so adroitly raises without reclaiming some form of class politics. Not least because Winnick’s point that those who “act as the champions of the white person against immigrants” rarely “defend the interests of the white working class” is even more pertinent today than it was half a century ago. The left’s neglect of class politics has allowed parties such as Reform, whose policies, on topics from trade unions to welfare, are deeply regressive, to be able to portray themselves as championing working-class interests.Nevertheless,Underdogsmakes for essential reading. In cutting through much of the ignorance and cant, and bringing new perspectives to the debate, Budd’s thoughtful and nuanced account provides an invaluable starting point for this debate.Kenan Malik is an Observer columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The rest of the world has not been ripping off or pillaging and plundering the US, as claimed by Trump launching hissalvo of tariffs, the highest for a century. The truth is the opposite.There is no American “national emergency”. The US still represents the same 25% of world GDP, as it did in 1980. More than half the goods it imports are from affiliates of US multinationals denominated and paid for in dollars, so its deficit is an accounting identity with itself rather than reflecting economic weakness.The richest and most dynamic economy in the world has profited hugely from a global growth-promoting economic order that it created – one of rules-based open trade in goods and services undertaken in dollars. Its fake deficit in goods belies an economic strength that permits the US to be the world’s number one exporter of services in banking, consultancy, media and IT. This American wealth generation machine has been so aggressive in pursuing its self-interest that when taken to the limits – as in its relationship with the UK – its partners become de facto vassal states. Britain has not been pillaging the cream of US tech companies; rather, it has been stripped of its tech jewels by the US.Even so, the rest of the world has benefited, with Asia in particular bootstrapping itself from poverty over the past 50 years. Certainly, there are American rust belt, manufacturing towns that have done badly – their working-class inhabitants left beached, their interests unprotected by enfeebled trade unions. But the rest of the US prospered, although the country is pockmarked by gross inequalities that American public policy has never properly addressed.All has been wrecked by the economics of Trump, for whom the idea that trade is a win-win, promoting growth and opportunity, is inconceivable. To him, it is not possible that country A buys goods and services from country B because it offers what A can neither produce or not at such a low price – while A can sell other goods and services to B for the same  reasons. Hence the simple algebra, subtracting imports from exports, and calculating a pro-rata, escalating tariff, is based on the view that a deficit can only exist because the US has been ripped off. Trump wants to put that “wrong” right, with the grotesque result that the richest country on earth is now imposing swingeing tariffs on the poorest – abandoning the global system that, however flawed, has served it and the world well.This US wealth generation machine has been so aggressive in its self-interest that its partners become vassal statesImpoverished Lesotho, for example, must be a racketeer with its trade surplus built on its exports of irreplaceable diamonds; hence a tariff of 50%. The reason why Britain is levied a “low” tariff of 10% – the same as Iran – is because on US figures, we run a trade deficit. But Israel, arguably the US’s closest ally, made the error of running a surplus and so received a 17% tariff dictated by the algebra. Brexit did mean Britain was not lumped in with the EU, charged 20% tariff, but being “spared” springs sadly from our trade weakness that Brexit has accentuated. We have lost atleast 5% of GDP from leaving the EU; now Trump will cost up to another 1% or worse, according to theNational Institute of Economic and Social Research, and more again as the world potentially embarks on a full-scale trade war, heralded byChina’s tit-for-tat tariffson Friday. Equally, there is a growing chance of a full-blown American recession. In his great bookThe Great Crash, 1929,JK Galbraith wrote that the interaction of the self-feeding unwinding of a stock-market bubble, trade-crippling tariffs, overextended financial institutions, massive income inequality, economic ignorance and collapse of trust in economic leadership that were the proximate causes of the Great Depression would be unlikely to happen again. But he couldn’t be sure that stupid leaders, ignorance, greed and some of the proclivities of American capitalism would not repeat the same mistakes. So here we are in 2025 – doing just that. Britain, as an open economy outside the major trade blocs, is uniquely exposed.So what to do? Whatnotto do is to accept the Trump framework of trying to get a “deal” by making damaging, unprincipled concessions on standards for food imports, our capacity to regulate the content of digital platforms and our sovereign ability to tax. Only a symmetric, fair deal is in the national interest, and, given Trump’s view of trade, probably impossible.Instead, Britain has to combine with the G7 (excluding the US) and the EU – and, ultimately, Asia – to sustain a rules-based, open global trading and financial system. In this respect,Mark Carney, if confirmed as Canadian prime minister in its April general election, is pivotal. Well-networked, he is the nearest the west has to a figure combining theinsights of Keynes with the capacity as a political leaderto make necessary change. Carney’s response to Trump’s menacing threats is to re-orient Canada around a new global trade order he aims to construct – in which Britain is well placed to help.The first step would be to associate Canada as a privileged trade partner with the EU, as a matter of urgency to which crucially both France and Germany – with its incoming chancellor Friedrich Merz another leader who has seen the light – would surely agree. The next step, to be brokered jointly by Britain and Canada, would be to extend the terms of that association to a newly relevant commonwealth including African members such as Nigeria and South Africaand Asian members such as India, Malaysia, and Australia and New Zealand – keeping Japan and South Korea in the loop. The aim being the sharing of common mutual tariffs and market access rules, but also tough reciprocal sanctions on selected US service exports and a joint approach to challenging US monopoly digital platforms – especiallyMusk’s X, as the EU is already planning. If, and when, a better US wants to join this trading order, it would be welcomed. Meanwhile, European members should continue to step up their joint defence efforts and sustain Ukraine. Britain can be integral to these initiativesthis. We must introduce a defence levy sharply to raise defence spending and turbocharge our timid efforts to lift public investment to offset recession.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His articles on the new world era, created and perpetuated by the second Donald Trump administration, have been one of the few considered insights into our demise towards an acceptance of immoral behaviour by powerful demagogues.He has articulated an interesting proposition for the UK: a unified Europe which includes Britain, a concept rejected with the Brexit referendum, but rejuvenated by the betrayal of Ukraine, Europe and the UK by the US (“Britain has been paying a high price for Uncle Sam’s craziness. It’s time to turn to Europe”, Comment). For centuries, England barricaded coastal defences because of threats of invasion, but the recent era of supposed protection by allying UK interests with the US has been exposed as a fallacy.Michael and Raewyn FirmstonAuckland, New ZealandI congratulate Simon Tisdall on his explanation on why it’s time for the UK to return to Europe. Look back at history, the US dragged us into Korea and then stopped when it got too tough, it threatened to attack us over Suez, it knew about the Turkish invasion of Cyprus and failed to inform the UN. Its calamitous exploits, particularly the abandonment of allies in Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria, is well documented and recent threats to take over the Panama canal, Greenland and Canada show it is not to be trusted. It is time for the UK to realise that, for Americans, Europe has been the preferred battleground and they will do anything to persuade Russia to join them as an ally against China.GW MunroTenbury Wells, WorcestershireSection 28 is vital for victimsI was concerned to read Danny Shaw’s article regarding the use of pre-recorded cross-examination for complainants in criminal trials (“MoJ accused of ‘spinning’ video evidence study as rape convictions fall”, News). Section 28 is a special measure afforded to survivors in sexual offence cases, in recognition of the trauma of giving evidence – an experience many describe as worse than sexual violence itself. Cheryl Thomas KC claims conviction rates are lower when survivors use section 28, but without it there would be even fewer convictions as many survivors would not give evidence.Justice means more to many than convictions alone. Procedural justice – being treated fairly, with dignity and afforded a chance to voice their experiences – can be equally as important to the process of recovery and section 28 can help intimidated survivors achieve this.We agree that our courts require urgent investment but current rhetoric conflates issues with backlogs and technology with the use of section 28. This is deeply unhelpful, not least for those survivors of sexual violence and abuse who, without section 28, would have no justice.Ciara BergmanCEO, Rape Crisis England and WalesLeedsWelby’s error of judgmentJustin Welby says he would forgive John Smyth (“Justin Welby says he forgives serial abuser John Smyth”, News) if he saw him today. Surely someone has to ask for forgiveness and, by implication, admit their guilt before it can be given. As far as we know, Smyth never asked for forgiveness or admitted his crimes. I don’t forgive him and I suspect neither do his victims.Jim HatleyBrightonFirst they came for…Referring to McCarthyism, Kenan Malik quotes Ellen Schrecker: “Only two people were killed; only a few hundred went to jail” (“Just like McCarthy, Trump spreads fear everywhere before picking off his targets”, Comment). What is often ignored is the firing of thousands of government employees and many suicides because of actual or perceived homosexuality, well documented by David K Johnson inThe Lavender Scare. Individual authoritarian states choose specific groups as scapegoats, but the canary in the coalmine common to them all is sexual minorities.John WarburtonEdinburghYoko’s legacyYoko Ono may continue to be pilloried for breaking up the Beatles (“Yoko Ono is now getting acclaim, but why do rock stars’ female partners get so much abuse?”, Comment), but let’s not forget that she purchased John Lennon’s childhood Liverpool home in 2002 and gave it to the National Trust to help preserve his memory. She deserves some public goodwill for doing that.Mick BeebyBristolRoyal Mail’s giant gaffeThe “inveigling” of the Irish mythical figure Fionn mac Cumhaill into a set of Royal Mail stamps (“Let Britain’s magical, mythical creatures inspire a patriotism untainted by politics”, Comment) probably isn’t the most egregious of British misappropriations of Irish things. While I can’t see it “stoking ethnic conflict” it probably would have been advisable for Royal Mail to limit this issue to exclude this part of Ireland and Irish folklore.Ciarán Mac Murchaidh(Kieran Murphy)Droim an Tí (Dromintee), Contae Ard Mhacha (County Armagh)Wigmore still reaches outRachel Cooke celebrates Wigmore Hall’s decision to divest from Arts Council England’s funding by suggesting that it will be free from “onerous outreach work rather than to excellence in performance” (“Wigmore Hall’s principled stand over public funding is music to my ears”, Comment).The implication is that arts organisations’ work with and for the communities they serve is somehow a burden or a distraction from important artistic endeavour. Wigmore Hall is an organisation for which funding made up a very small proportion of its turnover and it has committed to continuing its outreach work. Many other arts organisations are simply not in a position to support such vital work without public subsidy.Rose GoddardDirector, Cultural Philanthropy FoundationLondon SW2Wasabi etiquetteNot once, but twice, Ed Balls references “wasabi in the soy sauce” (Food & Drink, Magazine).

Giant ran last year at the Royal Court in London and will transfer to theWest Endlater this month, with Lithgow and Levey resuming their roles.Lithgow thanked the audience for “welcoming me to England” and said “it’s not always easy when you welcome an American into your midst”, highlighting that this moment was “more complicated than usual” for relations between the US and the UK.He remembered seeing Laurence Olivier’s “astounding performance” at the Old Vic in the playDanceof Death in the late 1960s. “I have thought about him and stolen from him in just about every performance I have ever played on stage,” he added.View image in fullscreenCo-presenters Beverley Knight and Billy Porter at the Olivier awards.Photograph: Neil Mockford/WireImageGiant’s tally of three Olivier awards on Sunday night was matched by two musicals:The Curious Case of Benjamin ButtonandFiddler on the Roof.The former, based on the short story by F Scott Fitzgerald and with music and lyrics by Jethro Compton and Darren Clark, won best new musical, outstanding musical contribution (for Clark and Mark Aspinall’s orchestrations and arrangements) and best actor in a musical (John Dagleish as the hero who is born old and grows younger each day). Dagleish, who won an Olivier award in 2015 for portraying Ray Davies in the Kinks musical Sunny Afternoon, said that his late mother had been his “plus one” on that occasion. He dedicated the award to her and said that “she would have loved” The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.Previously stagedat the fringe venue Southwark Playhouse in 2019, it is now running in the West End’s Ambassadors theatre which recently opened its own on-site custom-built pub, the Pickled Crab, named after a Cornish watering hole in the musical.Fiddler on the Roof, which received afive-star Guardian reviewat Regent’s Park Open Air theatre and is transferring to the Barbican next month, had received a total of13 Olivier nominations, equalling arecord set by the musical Hamilton in 2018.The classic musical – composed by Jerry Bock, with lyrics by Sheldon Harnick and book by Joseph Stein – won nine Tony awards in 1965 for its original Broadway production. Director Jordan Fein’s new production won Oliviers for best musical revival, best set design (Tom Scutt) and best sound design (Nick Lidster).The ceremony, which celebrates the cream of London theatre, was hosted by the actorsBeverley Knight, a winner at the 2023 awards, and Billy Porter, who is starring as the Emcee in Cabaret. It opened with Knight and Porter performing Luck Be a Lady from the musical Guys and Dolls.Romola Garai achieved the unusual feat of beating herself to win the award for best actress in a supporting role. She had been nominated twice in that category, recognising her performances in Giant andThe Years.The latter brought her victory. Based on Nobel prize-winner Annie Ernaux’s memoir, The Years (at the Almeida theatre) also received the best director prize, with Norwegian theatre-makerEline Arbobecoming the sixth woman to win that award at the Oliviers.Garai said The Years had been the “greatest privilege of my life” and thanked “my family of Annies” [all the cast share the main role of Annie as well as playing supporting characters]. She called Arbo a “genius” who “put all women’s life on stage”. Garai also thanked her husband for his support while she took on the two productions.View image in fullscreenRomola Garai, winner of the best actress in a supporting role award for The Years.Photograph: Dave Benett/Max Cisotti/Getty ImagesArbo previously directed The Years forInternationaal Theater Amsterdam, the world-renowned company which also staged Robert Icke’s modern-day version of Sophocles’s Oedipusseveral years ago.Oedipus, which Icke directed with a newWest Endcast, won best revival and best actress for Lesley Manville as Jocasta.Icke praised his “24-carat team” including the producer Sonia Friedman, who he said the industry was “lucky to have”. (Garai, too, thanked Friedman, who produced The Years.) The experience of making Oedipus had been joyous for the ensemble, added Icke, who jokingly observed “incest really brings people together”. Manville noted Icke’s “care and precision” as a director in her speech.The award for best actress in a musical went to Imelda Staunton for her roof-raising turn inHello, Dolly!at the Palladium. It was Staunton’s 14th nomination and fifth win at the Oliviers. The most-lauded individual in Olivier awards history is lighting designer Paule Constable, who has received 17 nominations, and won her sixth award for Oliver! (shared with Ben Jacobs). Constable announced her retirement from theatre earlier this year.The prize for best theatre choreographer went toChristopher Wheeldonfor the Michael Jackson bio-drama MJ the Musical, best costume design went to Gabriella Slade for the colourful rollerskating trains inStarlight Express, andMaimuna Memontook the award for best actress in a supporting role in a musical forNatasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812.Lesley Manville calls for better funding for UK regional theatreRead moreLayton Williams, meanwhile, became the first Olivier winner in history to be recognised for portraying an iceberg (he took best supporting actor in a musical for the zanyTitanique).

The news item happened to pop up on the feed of Michael Grandage, the theatre director who worked with McGregor in the mid-2000s on two productions,Guys and DollsandOthello, both under the Donmar Warehouse umbrella. “I thought, ‘Oh God, how brilliant is that!’” exclaims Grandage, who is 62 and since 2012 has been the artistic director of theMichael Grandage Company. “We hadn’t been in touch for a long time and I just thought that I’d send him a text, because it’s a big well done. It’s not something that a lot of people get, actually. I was looking up whohasn’tgot one…”Grandage and McGregor, who are sitting side by side in a rehearsal space in central London, steal a glance at each other and erupt, simultaneously, in loud howls.McGregor was in Los Angeles, where he has mainly lived since 2008, when he received the text. But he had spent part of the summer in Scotland, where he has a home in Perthshire, and for the flight back he had grabbed a play from his bookshelf, a gift from his wife, the actor Mary Elizabeth Winstead. “I thought, ‘I haven’t read a play in years,’” he recalls. “And it was Ibsen’sThe Master Builder. I’d never read Ibsen, and God, I loved it. So when I got my congratulations for the star from Michael, I replied saying, ‘Oh, that’s very kind. Thank you very much. I’ve just readThe Master Builderfor fun. I must be wanting to go back on stage…’”Grandage insists, with a smirk, that he wasn’t fishing. “I’d watch that amazingHalstonseries and think, ‘Oh, he’s doing that massive bloody Netflix series now… then he’s doingObi-Wan Kenobi[on Disney+].’ I’m not going to disturb him. He’ll come back when he’s ready.” But, serendipitously, Grandage had a play on his desk:My Master Builder, a new work by US playwright Lila Raicek, which is described as being a “conversation” with the 1892 Henrik Ibsen play. Did McGregor want to look at it? Yes, he very much did.And so here we are, cramped in an L-shaped room that normally does service as a makeup space. McGregor, in earthy colours and natural fibres, is getting stuck into an instant coffee and a KitKat; Grandage, all in blue, wears a corduroy blazer and has gravity-defying hair.My Master Builderopens at London’s Wyndham’s theatre this month and runs until mid-summer. “Normally these things take years, or a year at least,” says Grandage. “This whole turnaround was just weeks, which is extraordinary.”View image in fullscreenMcGregor with Jenna Russell in Guys and Dolls at the Piccadilly theatre in 2005.Photograph: Donald Cooper/AlamyAt a time when you can hardly step foot in the West End without tripping over a Tom Hiddleston or a Brie Larson, the return of McGregor to the stage is still an event that would jump to the top of your news feed. He has been an indelible presence in British culture for more than 30 years, ever since makingShallow Grave(1994) andTrainspotting(1996) with director Danny Boyle. He went global in the late-1990s with a run of three Star Wars prequels and Baz Luhrmann’sMoulin Rouge!with Nicole Kidman in 2001. And the output has never slowed or dropped off:Halston, the biopic of the US fashion designer, won him an Emmy in 2021; the miniseriesObi-Wan Kenobibroke Disney+ viewing records in 2022.You’re not a film actor, and you’re not a television actor, and you’re not a theatre actor. You’re just an actorEwan McGregorThere is also scarcity at work here. McGregor has not appeared in a UK theatre since 2008, a gap of 17 years; he did perform the Tom Stoppard playThe Real Thingon Broadway in 2014, opposite Maggie Gyllenhaal, but that was more than a decade ago. Still, McGregor very much does not accept the line that he is the latest Hollywood star slumming it on the London stage for a few months. He started out working at the Perth Repertory theatre when he was 16; he then studied drama at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London. “You’re not a film actor, and you’re not a television actor, and you’re not a theatre actor,” he says. “You’re just an actor.”McGregor continues: “To me, coming back to the theatre isn’t like, ‘Oh, here’s this movie actor on stage…’ I’ve always found that a little bit offensive. And I’ve always found the first few minutes on stage in London, I can feel that in the room. After a few minutes, you can feel the audience go, ‘Oh, OK,’ then you can get on with it. And that’s partly why I wanted to work in New York, because I thought they might be different there. And I did achieve that.”McGregor cracks that boyish grin, his blue eyes alert and twinkling. “Because half the audience were asleep half the time. So it wasn’t quite as scary somehow.”Grandage, who has directed innumerable high-profile productions, featuring the likes of Kidman, Jude Law and Daniel Radcliffe, nods his head in agreement. “Well, it’s not a film star coming back in your case, because you kept at it,” he says. “You’ve done it over the years and you trained, that’s the other thing. There’s only ever a dialogue about it when somebody doesn’t work; when, universally, the critics and audiences go, ‘This person, something’s not right here.’ And quite frequently it is the people who are trying to do a play when they haven’t done a play before.“What usually happens then is a debate starts, articles get written and it goes away as soon as somebody who does it frequently comes back and shows you can be a film actor, a television actor and a stage actor. Because, as Ewan says, you’re an actor.”When we meet, Grandage and McGregor are in the second week of a five-week rehearsal block. Such extensive preparations are pretty much unheard of in the world of film. ForShallow GraveandTrainspotting, Boyle insisted on a week, which was unusually long. “We lived together forShallow Graveand we’d all go to see films at night,” says McGregor. “Then withTrainspottingit was the same. And I don’t know that I’ve ever experienced that since.”A big pull for returning to theatre then was what McGregor is doing today: breaking down scenes with actors (inMy Master Builder, his co-stars includeElizabeth Debicki, fromThe CrownandThe Night Manager) and the chance to deeply interrogate a text. “On film, it’s very often the case that you’re learning the lines in the car on the way in,” he says. “Then you get on set, everyone’s got coffee, and you just sort of put it together, and before you know it: ‘Action!’ On the whole, 99% of the directors you’re working for now are just happy to see that it works. And that’s it.”View image in fullscreenMcGregor playing Iago to Chiwetel Ejiofor’s Othello at the Donmar in 2007.Photograph: Donald Cooper/AlamyMcGregor recalls his early days at the Perth theatre with clear fondness. He struggled at school, which was awkward because both his parents were teachers (his father at the independent Morrison’s Academy, which he attended, and where his older brother, who went on to become a fighter pilot in the RAF, had been head boy). “All I wanted to do was music and art, and they said I had to choose one, so I sat in a physics class pretending I was taking notes,” he says. “I got more and more depressed and more and more in trouble. And it was probably embarrassing for my dad.”Then, one night, on a rainy drive into Crieff, McGregor’s mum said he could leave school if he wanted. “And I went, ‘What? Fuck, that’s it,’” he says, eyes wide. “So I didn’t go back, and I started phoning the theatre, where I’d been trying to get a job since I was 14.” His first gig was as an extra in the courtroom scene in the Santha Rama Rau playA Passage to India, but he hung around, made himself useful. “I’d take the sets down, I’d help to put the sets up. And occasionally they gave me a few lines. That’s where I started.”There’s also obvious affection when McGregor talks about his previous collaborations with Grandage. The director cast him first as Sky Masterston in a 2005 revival ofGuys and Dolls, and then in 2007 as Iago inOthello. “I’ve had some of the best experiences of my working life with Michael,” says McGregor. “Two completely different – couldn’t think of two more different – plays. But I got to play Iago and that was extraordinary.”“It’s one of the biggest parts in Shakespeare,” Grandage notes.“Fucking hell, quite a biggie,” says McGregor. “Terrifying, but I loved it. And I remember when it finished, I felt like I took a huge, huge weight off my shoulders that I’d been carrying for a long time. Just the pressure of it was massive. Even though I loved it, it was a great relief to stop.”It’s a recurring theme in McGregor’s career, his apparent suspicion of a comfort zone. Perhaps the most obvious examples are his global motorbike odysseys with his friend Charley Boorman. It started in 2004 withLong Way Round, a 19,000-mile journey from London to New York, via Russia and Mongolia. Next month, a fourth edition calledLong Way Home, a two-month trip from Scotland through Europe to the Arctic Circle and then back to London, airs on Apple TV+.The takeaway from these adventures invariably is how unspoilt and gung-ho McGregor remains. I tell him that, 20 years on, I still remember him eating testicle soup in Mongolia. “Did he do that?” asks Grandage, shocked.“I did do that,” McGregor replies. “I ate mine. Charley didn’t get his down, Charley’s came flying straight back out again. But I got mine down, it was all right.”This memory segues into McGregor reminiscing about being in “the middle of fucking nowhere” in far-eastern Russia on the same trip, travelling for days with the landscape barely changing, not seeing a soul. “Then there was a bus stop that was a toilet,” he says. “We opened the door, and there was a wooden toilet, but there was a pyramid of poo coming out of it. It filled up, and they didn’t stop pooing on it. But I was thinking: ‘How did they get up the top?’ You’d have to be standing up like…”McGregor, who has previous in his film career with horrible toilets, clambers up on to a kitchen counter and puts his hand above his head: at least three metres high. Grandage is bent double, laughing. “Anyway, we were just all taking pictures of each other next to it,” he says, miming a thumbs-up. “That was not a comfortable toilet.”The Master Builderis a late-period Ibsen play that is commonly accepted to be at least partially autobiographical. It concerns Halvard Solness, a middle-aged man who runs an architecture practice – he’s a builder, not an architect though, because he’s not fully qualified – in a small town in Norway. Solness is much in demand, but also tetchy, vain and fearful of being usurped by the dreaded “younger generation”. His inevitable unravelling comes with the surprise arrival of a 23-year-old woman called Hilda, whom he met briefly a decade before.My Master Builder, the new play, is set in the Hamptons in the present day on 4 July and centres on an architect, Henry Solness (McGregor). There’s a big party to celebrate his latest project, which is crashed by Mathilde (Debicki), a former student and fling of Henry’s. “I’ve done a few Ibsens before,” says Grandage. “And it’s not a version of, and it’s not a translation of, and it’s not a … what’s the other one? Adaptation! Weirdly, it’s its own thing, it’s its own new play.”View image in fullscreenMcGregor as Renton in Danny Boyle’s Trainspotting (1996).Photograph: Channel Four Films/Allstar“When I read Lila’s play, I realised she’s just brought it into 2025,” says McGregor. “The sexual politics of Ibsen’s play are not turned on their head, but fleshed out into our reality. So it’s not just a poor old master builder who’s moaning about … ” He smiles: “I shouldn’t paraphrase the themes of Ibsen’s plays! But it’s fleshed out for a modern audience, and the sexual politics are much more in your face, I suppose.”Nobody retires in our industry. We don’t retire. The word doesn’t exist!Michael GrandageFor both McGregor and Grandage, the fact thatMy Master Builderis a new play was a key part of the appeal. “This may be a little romantic, but everything was a new play once,” says Grandage. “The best thing about a new play is that there’s an audience at some point who don’t know what happens next. And you can never, ever get that back once it’s happened.”“When you open a script up, it lists who the original cast were,” adds McGregor. “And I always thought: ‘God, that would be amazing to be the first ever person to play a role.’ Then this happened, just by chance and by luck and by hook and crook.”As men at the top of their respective fields, do McGregor and Grandage understand Solness nervously looking over his shoulder at the next generation? “One of the great challenges of ageing, I suppose, is how you deal with it,” says Grandage. “There’s something very interesting happening at the moment for me. It’s a bit of a shock, actually. But our lighting designer, Paule Constable, who is one of the great lighting designers, and who Ewan and I worked with onOthello, she has decided to retire. Well, nobody retires in our industry. We don’t retire. The word doesn’t exist! I know Daniel Day-Lewis retired officially, but he’s the only one I can think of.”McGregor has five children and thinks that demystifies the fear of being usurped by young upstarts. “No, I always feel like I’m totally current to them and then I’m reminded by them that I’m not,” he says. “But because I’ve got kids in several of the generations – my eldest, Clara, is almost 30 years old and my youngest is three, and I’ve got many in between – I don’t feel that.”Grandage can’t resist a playful dig. “Of course, they are reminding you you’ve been around a bit when they give you things like a Hollywood star of fame,” he says.“Or the lifetime achievement award…” McGregor groans.“Theawfullifetime achievement award,” Grandage agrees. “It’s like, ‘Christ, is that it?’”For now though, both men seem determined to keep testing their limits.“I don’t look out of my eyes as somebody in their mid-fifties,” says McGregor, readying himself to return to the rehearsal room. “I don’t feel that way inside.”My Master Builderruns atWyndham’s theatrein London from 17 April to 12 July.Long Way Homeis on Apple TV+ from 9 MayExplore more on these topicsTheatreThe ObserverEwan McGregorMichael GrandageHenrik IbsenElizabeth DebickiinterviewsShareReuse this content"

We would have been quite helpless without her.”The British intelligence agent Donald Darling had her down as an especially “cherished agent of [Charles] de Gaulle’s government”. Well aware of her importance, the UK foreign intelligence service MI6 called her “the pet lady agent” of the Free French.Before the second world war,Josephine Bakerhad been “the Black Venus”: the world’s first female superstar of colour, dancing the Charleston dressed in nothing but pearls and a banana skirt, parading her pet cheetah, scandalising and delightingle Tout-Paris.After the war, Baker became a prominent and outspoken US civil rights campaigner, famously speaking with Martin Luther King Jr at the 1963 March on Washington and adopting 12 children from eight countries to live with her in her chateau in the Dordogne.View image in fullscreenJosephine Baker takes part in the 1963 March on Washington, where she spoke at the side of Martin Luther King Jr.Photograph: Sipa/ShutterstockDuring it, she was a spy. Shrouded in the fog of war, then recounted afterwards – often unreliably – in the memoirs of people (including Baker herself) with a story to spin, the entertainer’s wartime exploits have long been a subject for speculation and mythmaking.But a new account, working from contemporary, often unused sources, has uncovered evidence that Baker was not only a highly effective agent but was also using the same celebrity that provided the perfect cover for her espionage as a powerful means to promote the cause of equal rights.“Looking at her life through the prism of the war really helps us understand who she was, and to make sense of what she did later on,” said Hanna Diamond, a professor of French history at Cardiff University and the author ofJosephine Baker’s Secret War, which is published on Tuesday.“The war was so important; it’s the missing piece of her puzzle. She [Baker] was amazingly well equipped to be a spy; a performer, through and through. Her motivation came from the huge debt she felt toFrance, which had made her a star – and it had its roots in the racism she grew up with.”View image in fullscreenJosephine Baker sings in the Municipal theatre in Oran, Algeria, north Africa.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyBorn in 1906 in St Louis, Missouri, Baker left school at 12 and in 1921 was cast in an early all-Black musical on Broadway. Four years later, she won a place in a Paris show, La Revue Nègre, and set sail for France. She swiftly became a huge star.By 1939, when she was recruited by Jacques Abtey, an initially sceptical French intelligence agent who would become her handler and on-off lover, Baker was Europe’s highest paid entertainer and one of its best-known female celebrities.Abtey taught her the tricks of the spy trade, such as using invisible ink, but it was Baker’s far-reaching fame – which meant everyone, everywhere wanted to meet her – and easy charm (which ensured they also talked freely) that were her real espionage assets.From early 1941, Baker, under the aegis of the French secret services, travelled from Marrakech, where she was based, to Lisbon, Madrid, Seville and Barcelona, and round north Africa, giving concerts, attending receptions – and gathering and passing top secret information to allied agents.View image in fullscreenJosephine Baker receives the Légion d’honneur and Croix de guerre in 1961.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesShe proved expert enough at it to be awarded, after the war, the resistance medal and, belatedly, the Légion d’honneur with the military Croix de guerre.Although precisely what was in the notes that she carried – often pinned to her bra – was, in many cases, officially unrecorded and remains unknown, Diamond’s research suggests that on several occasions it proved hugely valuable, and was sometimes critical.Previously unused sources show, for example, that after the allied landings in north Africa in 1942, Baker and the local leaders she had cultivated played a crucial role aiding US counter-intelligence in Morocco, identifying Nazi spies and allowing hundreds of arrests.“We now know she continued as a key intermediary between the French, Americans and Moroccans through 1943 and 1944,” Diamond said. “We’ve long known a little about her allied spying activities. But this role as a vital go-between is new.”View image in fullscreenJosephine Baker performed in north Africa for allied troops, including unsegregated US military personnel.Photograph: © Jean Tourtois/ECPAD/DefenseSimilarly, contemporary sources show Baker’s well-documented postwar anti-racism campaign was already under way in the early 1940s. Her tours of US army camps across north Africa brought her face to face with the racial segregation she had left behind in 1925.Press interviews from the time make her motivations for performing very clear: “I am doing all I can to help win the war effort,” she told the Chicago Defender in 1943, but also “to make people generally more appreciative and kinder to my race”.Gaining acceptance from the troops for whom she was singing and dancing was about promoting racial tolerance at home, Baker told the Palestine Post that same year: “Every success that I have counts for my coloured brothers in America.”In north Africa, Baker performed, unusually, for audiences of unsegregated US troops. Playing to British forces, she was also subject to ugly racist remarks, apparently from South African troops, UK armed forces entertainments officer Henry Hurford Janes recorded.The question was existential, Diamond said. “Discrimination was behind her decision to stay in France. In Paris, she had distanced herself from the other African-American exiles. She wanted to be French and when the war came, unlike others who left France, she stayed to support her compatriots.”View image in fullscreenJosephine Baker dances with her husband, Jean Lion, at the Porte de Versailles in Paris in 1937.Photograph: APBaker refused to perform in occupied Paris, however, moving to the Dordogne days before the Germans arrived and, later, on to Vichy-controlled Morocco. Her 1937 marriage to Jean Lion, which made her a French citizen, reinforced her views. Lion was Jewish and Baker helped his family escape the Germans. “She knew very well, at first-hand, what Nazi racism meant,” Diamond said.By contrast, her ardent Gaullism – she corresponded frequently with the general long after the end of the war, the book reveals – and idealisation of France meant she kept largely quiet when its north African colonies strived for independence.In 2021, Emmanuel Macron decidedBaker should become the first Black woman to enter the Panthéon in Paris, the mausoleum for France’s “great men”. The French president referenced her wartime activities – which were a revelation to many.“In France,” Diamond said, “she is mainly known as a music-hall star, and in the US as a civil rights activist.” A whole chapter – the spying missions, the concerts that raised large sums for the resistance, her subsequent uniformed service in the French air force – was far less familiar.View image in fullscreenDuring Josephine Baker’s induction into the Panthéon, Emmanuel Macron referenced her wartime activities.Photograph: Sarah Meyssonnier/ReutersHaving begun her research “somewhat sceptical”, Diamond said she finished it “convinced Baker actually was really very valuable. She may not always have known what she was transmitting, but she did what she was told, and she did her best.”The picture that emerges, Diamond said, is of “an incredibly able, shrewd, committed” Black woman who “saw very clearly that she could exploit her celebrity for a cause and, often with very great courage, then just went ahead and did so”.During the war, Baker mobilised her talent as a performer, on and off stage, for Free France. After it, she applied what she had learned, effectively harnessing her celebrity to protest against the racial segregation policies of her native country.“Knowing more about her wartime experiences helps us see how she herself came to understand what she could achieve,” Diamond said. “It was the war – the intelligence work and the performing – that made her aware of her power.”Josephine Baker’s Secret War: the African American Star Who Fought For France And Freedom is published by Yale University PressExplore more on these topicsJosephine BakerSecond world warCivil rights movementFranceEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Instead, it’s a source of frustration as I crunch my legs into airplane seats and wait for them to go numb.Only after discovering Celebheights.com did I truly understand the depth of feeling – both excitement and rage – that height can inspire.It was 2019 and I was a cadet journalist reporting from the hustings, and had been barred from a brewery tour after someone nabbed the only other size 13 protective boots required for entry. So I sat alone in the break room, cursing my oversized hooves, and developed a theory that a certain wannabe prime minister had nabbed the final size 13s. I turned to the internet, where I stumbled on Celebheights.com. A whole new world opened.Its rigorous mission statement impressed me. “Heights are bare feet estimates,” it promised, derived from quotations, resumes, picture comparisons and in-person encounters.View image in fullscreenA grid of the most popular pages on Celebheights.com – ‘a thriving community of stature-obsessed keyboard warriors’.Photograph: Celebheights.comMore than a crowd-sourced database of A, B, C and D-grade celebrities’ heights, Celebheights.com is a thriving community of stature-obsessed keyboard warriors.At its heart is founder and moderator, “Admin Rob”: a self-appointed judge who hears pleas from opposing sides about why one star should be robbed of a quarter inch (Heath Ledger) or why another should be awarded an extra eighth to compensate for hunching (Roger Federer).Launched in 2004 (and retaining that era’s web design), it gained fame in 2015 when it was featured on the(criminally short-lived) Mystery Show podcast. One episode sees host Starlee Kine sift through Jake Gyllenhaal’s listing to hunt down his true height. Every commenter sounds like a madman: “I should see him shaven!” one enthusiast quips.But Gyllenhaal’s page is just the tip of the iceberg. Mariah Carey’s entry has amassed 1360 comments since 2004. Carey has repeatedly said she’s 5’9”, but her listing was adjusted down after a torrent of vitriol from commenters proclaiming she was anywhere from 5’8½” down to 5’2”.Complicating calculations is Carey’s penchant for high heels. Trigonometric arguments about a specific shoe’s heel height – and how much it would add to her standing – are routine.Debate intensified in 2005, when user Patricia Carey wrote: “My daughter is 5’9” I should know I’m her mother!” This was quickly discounted as a fake.View image in fullscreenFurious debate rages over Mariah Carey’s height.Photograph: Celebheights.comConjecture continues to this day. Rob has shot down requests to close comments: “The only time an argument should end is when they get measured … Until then I think every celebrity’s height can still be discussed until the end of time.”View image in fullscreenOften, the site’s moderator conducts field research – in the form of celebrity meet-and-greets.Photograph: Celebheights.comWhen he’s not moderating swears and death threats, he’s conducting field research.Rob has made it his life mission to meet-and-greet as many celebrities as possible, ideally back-to-back. Comparing them to his own height – 5’8” – is his only acceptable test.His success rate in convincing celebrities to remove their shoes for barefoot measurement is unclear. When they refuse,such as with Sam Neill,Rob provides separate heel measurements – for the celebrity and himself.But even a celebrity whose height Rob has confirmed personally can be up for debate.Actor Brendan Fraser’s was initially listed as 6’3½”,based on a 2008 Guardian interview, but later changed to 6’2½” after Rob was able to get aphoto with him at a 2019 fan meet, albeit with the actor refusing to remove his fedora.This did not satisfy one commenter, who insisted Fraser’s “maximum morning height” – Celebheights jargon for how humans are tallest each morning before their spine gradually compresses through the day – was surely 6’3½”, before shrinking to 6’3” by lunchtime and 6’2.75” by bedtime.Some commenters do, however, provide valuable insights.“He’s a massive lift wearer,” user Simon wrote after claiming to have met Russell Crowe at a party 10 years earlier. “He got pretty tipsy and took his shoes off. He wasn’t particularly tall before. But when those shoes came off he was probably 5’8½”, max 5’9”.Could you walk across the UK in a perfectly straight line? Inside YouTube’s strangest challengeRead moreSurprisingly, even celebrities whose fame is built on being short have been caught fibbing. Danny DeVito has publicly claimed he stands “five feet short” on “a really good day” – though the figure is disputed.“In August of 2007, I was in the same subway car as someone that looked just like Danny DeVito,” Celebheights commenter MilkyB offered in 2019. “Based on the height of the doppelganger, I’m confident in saying he is 4’10½” at a minimum.”This led me down a DeVito wormhole. I re-emerged hours later with a cursed algorithm, now bombarded with ads for Danny DeVito cardboard cutouts.A mere human, I quickly caved, and now share my bedroom with a lifesize Danny. Infuriatingly, the manufacturer appears to have fallen for DeVito’s lies: cardboard Danny stands at 5’ tall.Explore more on these topicsCultureInternet wormholeInternetCelebrityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

All of these have sold out online.Designers know very well that the TV show – which boasted a new high of4.8 million viewers in the US for its seventh episode– can work as a platform to market their clothing. Simon Porte Jacquemus contacted costume designerAlex Bovairdon Instagram with a request to collaborate before the latest series began filming – a reversal of the typical process, where a costume designer will contact a brand to borrow clothes.View image in fullscreenSam Nivola, who plays Lochlan Ratliff in The White Lotus.Photograph: Stefano Delia/HBOThe result is two custom looks for Chloe, including a pink swimsuit and cover-up with brimmed hat for her to welcome guests on her partner’s superyacht in episode four. Bovaird says this is the first time that a designer as renowned as Jacquemus has contacted her. “White Lotusfills this specific niche of being quite cool,” says Bovaird. “People want to be involved with it.”Bovaird has been the costume designer since the series began. She requests items to borrow from brands but also finds them in “a mix of flea markets, showrooms, charity shops, [and] we make some stuff. The unitard that Nadya [the partner of Aleksi] wears in the latest episode came from a market in Essex. There are bags from Hermès – and other things that cost £5.99, like that unitard.”Part of the fashion appeal, she says, comes from the characters always being on holiday. “When you’re going on holiday, you’re dressing up, you’re not wearing your everyday clothes. With other contemporary shows, you’re nailing actuality. I get a chance to play dress up.”Bovaird also collaborated onThe White Lotus H&Mcollection, around half of which has already sold out at the high-street chain. “The idea was that not everyone can afford luxury hotel resorts but everyone can afford to be glamorous and have a bit ofWhite Lotusin their wardrobe,” she says.TV has a long history of boosting the sales of fashion brands.Sexand the Cityin the 90s made Manolo Blahnik and Jimmy Choo household names – aNewsweekarticlefrom 2000 quotes a buyer for department store Neiman Marcus saying Blahnik’s sales tripled because of the show – andMad Mencharacters such as Joan Holloway and Don Draper inspired countless designers during its seven seasons.The White Lotusis not the first TV series to partner with a brand, either. In 2009, New York designerAnna Sui created a collection for Targetthat was inspired by the clothes ofGossip Girl, andBanana Republic worked withMad Menin 2011(and has also worked withThe White Lotusthis season).More recent TV shows with fashion kudos includeEuphoria, which influences twentysomethings with its eclectic thrifted style,Emily in Paris, with its ultra-fashion look, andSuccession, which arguably contributed to the rise of the quiet luxury aestheticand “finance bro” gilets. Apple TV’s office-basedSeverance, meanwhile, is a reference for the current return of workwear in fashion.View image in fullscreenAimee Lou Wood, who plays Chelsea in The White Lotus, in a T-shirt by New York–based artist Scooter LaForge.Photograph: Fabio Lovino/HBO“We’ve seen TV and fashion intersecting for quite a while but in this current era of prestige TV, it’s dialled up to 11 in terms of the impact,” says Beth Bentley, the founder of brand strategy consultancy Tomorrowism. “Successionbrought heat around brands that people maybe hadn’t encountered before – like Loro Piana and Brunello Cucinelli. It made people curious about those brands.”Paul Flynn, who writes about TV forGrazia, says: “There’s an argument to be made somewhere that [Succession’s] Kendall Roy is the most influential menswear figure of the last decade.”The love of these shows – and the discourse around them online – means fans will pore over the outfits, thinking of them as what’s known as “Easter eggs”, or clues to the plot. Bovaird says she does use outfits to plant clues – in an interview withDazed, she revealed that a mannequin wore one character’s dress in series two that foreshadowed that character’s death at the end. “I know people have delved into the outfits and their meanings,” she says. “Some of it is true, definitely, I just couldn’t say what.”Flynn praises the costume design in everything fromEastEndersto Ryan Murphy’sMonsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story, but he says the attention to what characters wear is also a sign of how TV is changing. “Wardrobe is one of the things that has started to make terrestrial TV look so 20th century, as opposed to the streamers,” he says. Bentley adds: “It’s a badge of honour within the industry to be able to say they got on [a show] before everyone else.”View image in fullscreenLily Collins and Ashley Park in Emily in Paris.Photograph: APThe White Lotushas been on fashion’s radar since series one, where Sydney Sweeney’s sardonic teen character, Olivia, became a favourite. Haley Lu Richardson’s Portia in season two became the poster girl ofgen Z “schlumpy” style.While independent brands often don’t have the resources to lobby for their designs to be featured in these shows, they notice the impact when they are. Scooter LaForge created the T-shirts that Chloe and Chelsea wear for the full-moon party in the current series ofThe White Lotus.He says the response has been “overwhelmingly” positive. “My Instagram following has skyrocketed throughout season three.”While LaForge hand-paints his T-shirts, meaning fans cannot buy the exact ones featured in the show, he sold similar designs at the Patricia Field ARTFashion Gallery in New York. “Sales have been strong,” he says. “I’ve been very busy, [even if] there’s no mass production or printing involved.”Often, designers won’t know that their products have made it on the show before it’s aired – as was the case with the green Hunza G bikini worn by Chloe. “When I watched the episode, I saw [the bikini] at the same time as everybody else,” says the brand’s founder, Georgiana Huddart. “My phone went crazy.” The bikini sold out within a week.View image in fullscreenSex and the City turned exclusive shoe designers Manolo Blahnik and Jimmy Choo into household names.Photograph: Startraks Photo/REX/ShutterstockHuddart says Hunza G has appeared in other TV shows, includingBad Sisters, butThe White Lotushas a special status. “It [reaches] such a wide demographic of people.”Bentley agrees the series has a unique place in culture, partly due to the fact that episodes are only released once a week. “There’s shared anticipation,” she says. “I was in a hairdresser in Somerset, and people were talking about it. It’s not just in media hotspots, or in city locations, or among gen Z – it’s everybody and their mum.”If watching these shows is a relatively universal experience, the worlds and people they often depict are anything but. “If you look atSuccessionorThe White Lotuscharacters, the writers of the shows are skewering the rich and poking fun at them – and yet, at the same time, we want to dress like them. There’s a crazy irony there.”Despite this, Bentley believes the connection between TV and fashion brands isn’t going away. In fact, she predicts they will fuse even more. “[There will be] collabs and capsule collections, and also maybe brands digging in financially and funding original content to create moments that have more intention and more control, from the brand’s point of view,” she says.As for costume designers’ work continuing to make a mark on consumers’ wardrobes, Bovaird – who is, admittedly, somewhat biased – argues that it’s a good thing.“Peopleshouldbe influenced by experts in how they dress,” she says. “I’m not saying a TikTok influencer can’t influence, but we really are the experts. We think about clothes all the time.”Explore more on these topicsThe White LotusThe ObserverTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Or maybe toe wrestling is more your thing? These (real) sports are ripe with joyful eccentricity – but for contestants and supporters, it’s serious competitionSun 6 Apr 2025 09.00 EDTShareWorm charming‘The sheer madness of it is the appeal’Each year around May, people flock to the village of Blackawton in Devon. Divided into teams of three, they are given a plot of land measuring 3m x 3m. While their dignity is sometimes lost in the process, ferocious bangs to the ground, war cries, singing and silly costumes are most certainly invited. But why?Well, if they can coax enough worms to the surface, there are prizes at stake: this is the World Worm-Charming Championships after all.It’s a proverbially ancient art, with a questionable origin story. Chris Oughton, head of the worm-charming committee explains: “Back in 1980, two gentlemen were on the way out from the pub and needed to stop, for a certain emptying reason. While they were both stood watching the field opposite, they noticed seagulls doing a dance in order to get the worms out of the ground.”And so, each year, about 300 competitors (and similar numbers of spectators) arrive in the small village. “The sheer madness of it is the appeal,” smiles Oughton, the guy who “makes sure the competition happens.”Digging is strictly prohibited, instead the worms have to be “charmed” to the surface. In 2009, Sophie Smith broke the world record – held since 1980 – by charming 567 worms. Often competitors remain empty handed. The competition starts with prep time during which each team is given a numbered plot and are allowed to “prod and play”. But noxious liquids are banned. “You’re allowed to shower the ground with any liquid you are prepared to drink,” Oughton explains, although it sounds rather ominous – just how far are people willing to go?Teams are in threes due to the roles that need to be assigned: a charmer, a picker-upper and a worm-counter. The rules are simple: in 15 minutes you want to pick up as many worms as possible from the assigned plot. It’s an international affair, with people coming from Estonia, South Africa, Japan, Cyprus, France and Germany.“It all happens in secret fields. Nobody knows where it is until that day,” explains Oughton. “Before the competition, there’s an ode to the worm that we sing. We also do a little prayer to make sure that the sun comes up every day, and then we process to the secret field.” The entire competition is prepared and run by volunteers and there’s an entrance fee of £5, which is donated to charity.While there aren’t too many recurring champions (apart from a team called the Frogs who have won three times in a row), there are some signature moves to up your chances. “Liquid and vibration are the two winners really. You’ve got to replicate that sound or feeling of rain.” Winners received worm-themed trophies, handmade by local potter, Imogen Nobel.“The lengths people will go to are hilarious, we’ve had saxophone players, druids, people playing cellos and, of course, lots of dancing and stamping,” Oughton says, adding, there’s no occupational hazard to the worms: “We’re very strong in our worm welfare, and we’ve been building that over the years. Half worms will get you disqualified – no cruelty to the worms. And they are immediately counted and then put back in a pre-dug trench, so they can get straight back out there. We provide containers so that people don’t handle the worms too much at all.”Pudding throwing‘It was pretty serious stuff. People were chanting my name in the streets’View image in fullscreen‘It was like entering a football match’: Harry Hogden, 2024 pudding throwing champion.Photograph: Richard Ansett/The ObserverThere’s nothing better to accompany a Sunday roast than a crispy, battered boat ready to be filled with gravy – also known as a Yorkshire pudding. For one weekend a year in September, however, a pub in Ramsbottom, Greater Manchester, becomes the gathering place for those trying to destroy this well-loved roast accompaniment – by throwing a black pudding at it.The competition has been held here since the 1980s, in a lighthearted (if that’s possible) homage to the Wars of the Roses, fought by the House of Lancaster and the House of York in the 15th century. There are 12 Yorkshire puddings to start with. They sit on a 20ft-high scaffolding plinth, placed in four pudding towers that are each three puddings high. The aim of the game is to lob a black pudding, via underarm throw only, high enough that it knocks the Yorkshire puddings from their tower. Each competitor gets three goes and the person who can knock off the most wins. Competitors must also have one foot standing on a golden block to ensure they are not too close.In a moment of spontaneity in 2024, 17-year-old Harry Hogden decided to join his family and 50 fellow Swinton locals on a coach trip to Ramsbottom. Having never seen pudding-throwing in real life before, he figured it would be a quirky, fun day out.Although technically a junior, standing at 6ft 4in meant he had to compete in the adult division. “As soon as I got out of the coach, it was like entering a football match. One group of people was wearing a football kit with four stars on top of their badge, showcasing that they had won four times. It was pretty serious stuff,” he explains.In the end, Harry managed to knock six puddings off the plinth, making him the champion. “People were picking me up, throwing me up over their shoulders and chanting my name in the streets,” he beams. He was awarded £100, a trophy and a necklace of black puddings.“A week after, I went to a festival not far from where I live, called Manchester Rocks. A stranger came up to me and asked if I was the pudding-throwing champion!” Harry very much hopes to fight for his title in the next competition. Does he have any advice on technique? “Swing and pray,” he says.Maggot racing‘Some maggots don’t even start and some get halfway and then start going backwards’View image in fullscreen‘We make sure to give the maggots names so that spectators can cheer them on’: Barrie Butler, maggot-racing organiser.Photograph: Richard Ansett/The ObserverAround 30 years ago, 75-year-old Barrie Butler went abroad on holiday with his wife – today he doesn’t remember where they went, but what he does remember is being introduced to maggot racing by a man outside a local social club.After coming home to the UK, cab-driver Barrie decided to build a six-lane race track suitable for maggots. Like horse-racing, but with smaller subjects, bets are placed by spectators as to which maggot might win and six races are run over the course of the night. Maggots are kept in labelled lanes in order to tell them apart. The money from each betting programme sold goes to charity.Each winning maggot then gets entered into the final race. “Some maggots don’t even start and some get halfway then start going backwards,” says Butler. While he is based in Lincolnshire he’s adamant he will take bookings anywhere there is a demand. He currently hosts around two races per month with up to 120 people attending, details of which are uploaded on his website (maggotsontour.co.uk). Each race is shown on a 120in screen. “It’s not like fishing; you don’t have to warm the maggots up in your mouth or anything, but they are supplied by my local fishing shop,” he says. “I then place them in boxes that can be joined together so that all the maggots can be tipped on to the track at the same time when the race begins.”With each race lasting on average two and a half minutes, Butler likes to keep things interesting by sometimes adding matchsticks as hurdles. “We make sure to give the maggots names so that spectators can cheer them on: Sweet Caroline, Smiling Susie and Brian are the most popular ones.”For Butler, the night is all in the commentary and he refers to himself as “Big Bad Baz” during races. At the end of the race, the winning maggot is auctioned off to the highest bidder. The highest a single maggot has ever sold for was £530, which was donated to charity at the end of the night.Shin kicking‘The first time I competed there was a lot of bruising, but it got better each time’Dating back to 1612, shin kicking today makes up part of theCotswold Olympick Games, which takes place every May and includes more standard running races and tug o’ war. Shin kicking isn’t for the faint hearted, although steel toe caps were banned decades ago, it is still very much a contact sport. Competitors battle one on one, placing a hand on each other’s shoulders with arms straight while kicking each other in the shins, the aim is to unbalance the opponent and force them to the floor. The winner is whoever is able to achieve the most throwdowns within three rounds.Five-time champion Adam Miller hasn’t competed since his last win in 2020, but still watches each year. “You can use as much straw as you can for padding between your knee and ankle,” he explains. Miller grew up locally in Honeydale, Chipping Norton, and has been used to watching the match each year. He describes it as “a game that gets the community together”. He was first signed up in the pub in 2015, but never imagined winning: “I thought, what have I got myself into?“Everyone is provided with a lab coat-style jacket to give you something to hold on to, but also they protect people’s clothing from ripping,” he explains. But there’s no sure way to protect yourself from the inevitable pain of being kicked in the shins.Miller might have more advantage than others though. “I can take a good kicking,” he admits, adding that, as he’s a farmer, “I’ve been used to cracking my shins on equipment and having sheep kicking me and all sorts.”Which leg you use to kick the shin doesn’t matter, the goal is to unbalance someone enough to get them on the floor. Some even compare the moves of the sport to jiu jitsu. On average there are between six and 10 pairs competing each year, and are partnered up at random. “The first time I competed there was a lot of bruising, but it got better each time I entered,” says Miller. Every year the winner gets a medal and an engraved cup, which they have to return. “People watch this and think we are all stupid, but this is tradition, people think it’s brutal, but it’s the sport,” says Miller.While he encourages everyone who is thinking about applying to “give it a go”, if this one feels more of a spectator sport, then there are plenty of food and drink stalls to keep you occupied.Toe wrestling‘You should only enter if you’re prepared with the mindset that your toe might break’View image in fullscreen‘This sport has what it takes to be in the Olympics’: Ben Woodroffe, four-time world toe-wrestling champion.Photograph: Richard Ansett/The Observer“The aim is to interlock your big toe with your competitor’s and then get your opponent’s foot on to a horizontal board,” explains 36-year-old Ben Woodroffe, the four-time world toe-wrestling champion, under the moniker “Toe-tal Destruction”.The game begins on the right foot and continues until someone has pushed a foot on to the horizontal part of the board, also known as the “toedium”. Once a point is scored, competitors then switch feet and play again on their left. They do a final third round on their right.The sport celebrated its 50th birthday in 2024 and originated in Derbyshire at a pub called the Bentley Brooke, when a booze-fuelled brainstorm was held between a group of friends, who jokingly decided to create a sport they could be good at. (They were beaten by a Canadian in the second year of the championship.)Today around 200 spectators turn up in Ashbourne’s market square each year, with some competitors so loyal to the sport that they have entered yearly for the last 15-plus years. Alan “Nasty” Nash remains the longest-reigning champion, with 17 wins under his belt. He officially retired in 2024. A tattoo on his leg reads: “In a ring of toes where champions dwell, with nimble digits they cast their spell.”The sport was turned down by the Olympic committee in 1998, but with a recent rebrand it’s hoped they can push for the 2033 Olympics. Woodroffe started recruiting people in Paris last year. “This sport has what it takes,” he says.Woodroffe has been watching toe wrestling since he was 14 years old and always dreamed of winning the championship. He campaigns for people to take the sport more seriously, but is aware that many believe it’s all a joke.In 2024, 28 competitors entered the tournament, which lasted around three hours. A waiver must be signed by competitors before entering to acknowledge that they are “free from foot infections or conditions that could be contagious or harmful to other participants”. A referee also confirms foot hygiene after each competitor washes their feet in a bucket of soapy water.If the toes won’t grip, either because they’re too sweaty or different sizes, talcum powder can be used, and if that fails, they will be strapped together with gaffer tape and bandages. While being bandaged toe-to-toe with a total stranger might be too extreme for some, last year marked the first year when winners were handed a cash prize of £500 each alongside their medal and trophy.“You should only enter if you’re prepared with the mindset that your toe can break,” Woodroffe warns. “Mine broke at a 90-degree angle last year, but I kept going. Pain is temporary, being a champion is for a lifetime.”Explore more on these topicsSports gamesThe ObserverComedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s a quest in which intensely personal family memories come to represent the enormity of what has been lost by an entire people (at the time of writing her preface, the Jewish community still living in Iraq numbered three).Everywhere she looks she sees ghosts of what has been lost. There is little surviving literature in Judaeo-Iraqi ArabicEllis writes that she has no idea what her father looked like as a child; he has no photographs from his first decade because, when his family left Baghdad in 1951, Jews were only permitted one small suitcase each, with strictly delimited contents. She interviews both her parents and her ninetysomething grandmother, Aida, about Jewish life in Baghdad and the trauma of leaving. Aida lived through the 1941 pogrom known as the Farhud, when more than 200 Jews were murdered in one night and Aida’s family were saved by their Muslim neighbours. To piece together a bigger picture, however, Ellis has to search further afield, where she finds the evidence scant.Everywhere she looks she sees ghosts of what has been lost. There is little surviving literature in Judeo-Iraqi Arabic (“My language was not like Yiddish, which was saved by its books”) and few artefacts in the British Museum, despite the number of Iraqi antiquities plundered by the British in the 1920s and 30s. When she tries to use the kohl in the little pots her mother brought from Baghdad in the 1970s, she finds it has all dried up. Nor will she ever eat the traditional fish dishmasgouf, because it has to be made with a particular type of carp only found in the Tigris; a fish now tainted because it was found that the carp had been feeding on the corpses of torture victims thrown into the river under Saddam Hussein’s regime. Her own paternal family name is gone, anglicised from “Elias”.Over and above these small losses arches the greatest loss of all: the permanent loss of homeland. Ellis and her family have little hope of returning to Iraq as it’s now a death penalty offence to have any association with Israel – an edict that effectively bars most of the Jewish diaspora. “Maybe I could go to Iraq and escape death,” she writes, “but I couldn’t go to Iraq and feel safe.”Yet, despite this litany of loss, persecution and violence,Chopping Onions on My Heart(the Judeo-Iraqi Arabic equivalent of “rubbing salt in the wound”) is an optimistic and often wryly funny book. It’s an exploration of collective memory: how we choose what to value and what to pass on to our children. Ellis is a knowledgable and entertaining guide to the history of a community that “rarely made it into history books” but whose story is an integral part of the broader history of the Middle East, reverberating down to the present.Her celebration of her endangered culture – through food, art, song, and especially language – culminates in the conclusion that changing identities can be reframed as addition and evolution rather than loss. Watching her son eatmakhboose(traditional date-stuffed pastries), she says: “I felt I’d broughtthere and thenintohere and nownot as trauma or anxiety, but as a mnemonic to help us remember happiness. A gift from our affectionate ghosts.” This book is likewise a gift to the future, rich with insights about the nature of belonging that are not limited to one community but matter to all of us.Chopping Onions on My Heartby Samantha Ellis is published by Chatto & Windus (£16.99).

It is the No 1 show across 74 countries and the ninth most-watched Netflix show of all time, with 96.7m views so far.Jack Thorne, its writer, has questioned whether the programme could have been made in the same way by the BBC because of the financial pressures it is under after cuts to the licence fee, the arrival ofstreaming services and the fragmentation of audiences.Emily Feller, the chief creative officer of Sheffield-based Warp Films, who was an executive producer on Adolescence, said the financial hardship hitting the public sector broadcasters (PSBs) – BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and 5 – had made them risk-averse about the kinds of shows they pursued.She said the next Adolescence or Baby Reindeer, a dark British comedy about a stalker that was also on Netflix, could be made by the PSBs if they were prepared to take a chance on difficult projects.“Hopefully Adolescence is allowing people to feel the risk-taking again, because there is an issue with money right now,” she said. “I think that it’s hard, and people are risk-averse. Hopefully, people will just take a moment and think this story has sold well. And obviously it comes down to money.“I really hope that this is going to allow the public service broadcasters to be able to look for those authored pieces. If you look at a BBC or ITV show, you’re talking about an 11-, 12-, 13-day shoot for an hour [of television]. And this was a 15-day shoot for an hour. So there is an expense in how we shot it. But I’m talking about the risk of storytelling, not just the production side.”Her intervention came afterElisabeth Murdoch, co-founder of the production company Sister, told the Guardian that a “perfect storm” hitting the UK’s television industry risked leading to British stories disappearing from the small screen.Warp Films, which co-produced Adolescence, has made its name by making challenging productions set in Britain, from This is England to Four Lions. Mark Herbert, its chief executive and another executive producer on Adolescence, said the show proved stories set in Britain could be successful internationally.“A British story set in this country can travel and you don’t need loads of effects, you don’t need crazy budgets,” he said. “Certain shows need that, and they’ve got their place, but I hope this shows you can hit a massive global audience without any of those. Just great acting, great storytellers.”However, he called for the government to intervene to help the UK’sstruggling TV industry. A post-Covid contraction, price inflation and the financial pressures placed on the main domestic broadcasters have resulted in thousands of the industry’s workers losing their jobs – and talk of a crisis in production.“I certainly think the whole tax credit thing needs looking at,” Herbert said. “If you look at what kind of stuff we’ve made historically, it’s £2-3m an episode. The international market is really struggling at the moment. People are not coming up with the ways to top up that finance – the costs to make those shows can’t go down any more. So we are in this weird chicken and egg situation where we do need some help.“I’ve seen what having proper dramas and films shot in the regions does, not just for the local economy directly, but also for confidence.”Warp’s next production, the revenge thriller Reunion, which begins on Monday, is set in and around Sheffield. It is billed as a bilingual series featuring both British Sign Language and spoken English. Warp also revealed that it has acquired the option to develop Threads, the critically acclaimed 1984 film depicting Sheffield during a nuclear war. Feller said it was another example of featuring ordinary British people against the backdrop of a provocative topic.“The way the original film was written and made, it absolutely had that voice with Sheffield,” she said. “That’s the kind of place, again, where you find that very rounded heart to the storytelling.”Explore more on these topicsTelevisionAdolescencenewsShareReuse this content"

Known as the Brixton Bard, he wrote fiercely but with understanding, energy and humour in a series of adult novels, starting with Brixton Rock (1999), before switching to young adult (YA) fiction.In 2020 Alex’s early life was the focus of Steve McQueen’s film Small Axe: Alex Wheatle, the fourth drama in hisBBC television anthology serieshighlighting institutional racism and the black British experience from the late 1960s to the early 80s.Alex was placed in care as a toddler and grew up in Shirley Oaks, a children’s home in Croydon where, it was later revealed,physical, mental and sexual abusehad beenwidespread over decades; he wrote of the violence inflicted on him inSufferah: Memoir of a Brixton Reggae Head(2023). He was born in Brixton, the son of Almira Gunter, who was married with four children when she arrived in the UK in 1961, where she met Alfred Wheatle, also from Jamaica, who worked as a carpenter. Soon after Alex’s birth, his mother returned home, leaving her baby son with his father, who struggled to cope.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Arcadia BooksAt 15, Alex was moved from Shirley Oaks to a social services hostel in Brixton. Here, he had his first experience of the West Indian community and was quick to embrace his black identity with clothes, hair, language and particularly reggae music, appearing as DJ Yardman Irie at 16 and becoming a founder member and the lyricist of the Crucial Rocker sound system group. He was also active in the struggle against police racism and brutality, and was arrested and given a prison sentence for his involvement in theBrixtonuprising of 1981.Alex’s cell mate during his four months in Wormwood Scrubs was Simeon, a Rastafarian who recognised the younger man’s deep feelings of isolation.“He understood too well that I was disconnected from my roots, culture and people from the moment I was taken into care at two and a half,”Alex wrote later. “He took it upon himself to reconnect me. He pushedCLR James’sThe Black Jacobinsinto my eager hands. ‘This will tell you ah liccle something about where you come from and where you stand in the struggle,’ he said.”He introduced Alex to other black authors including Chester Himes, who Alex later cited as the inspiration for his own writing, along with Maya Angelou, Charles Dickens, Linton Kwesi Johnson and John Steinbeck.But when Alex began to write, it was his life not books that inspired his debut novel, Brixton Rock; set in 80s south London, its central character, 16-year-old Brenton Brown, carries the same story of neglect and subsequent rebellion against authority. It was praised by critics and won the London Arts Board new writers award in 1999.This was followed in 2001 with East of Acre Lane, “a similarly hard-hitting slice of social commentary”, said one critic, set against the backdrop of the 1981 riots; and several other books includingThe Dirty South(2008) andBrenton Brown(2011), a sequel to Brixton Rock.He also drew on his own story for Uprising, a one-man play he wrote and first performed in 2011, in London and on tour, before touring it again in 2012 as part of the 50th anniversary celebrations of Jamaican independence.View image in fullscreenThe Small Axe episode about Alex Wheatle, played by Sheyi Cole.Photograph: Will Robson-Scott/BBC/McQueen LimitedDespite his success, and being made MBE for services to literature in 2008, Alex became disillusioned with adult publishing –“I felt like I was this token black writer who writes about ghetto stuff”– and turned instead to fiction for young adults, telling similar stories but in a lighter style and with more imaginative licence. Instead of recreating Brixton, Alex created Crongton, his own fictional world, with a multicultural cast of pumped up, slang-speaking teenagers navigating life on an inner-city estate.Character-led and told mostly through raucous dialogue, the Crongton stories gave a realistic picture of growing up in contemporary Britain. The switch to YA brought Alex immediate success. Liccle Bit (2015) was longlisted for the Carnegie medal in 2016 and Crongton Knights (2016)won the Guardian children’s fiction prize.“There was a real sense of excitement, both in the room and among readers, when Alex was announced as the 50th winner of the Guardian children’s fiction prize,” remembers Claire Armitstead, then books editor at the Guardian.“Here were sexting and gang violence and early-morning bailiffs’ visits to tower block flats: the stuff of grim news headlines freshly minted in a glorious invented slang that gave his characters ownership of their stories with not a whiff of condescension. As the author and prize judge David Almond said, the novel ‘hummed with the beat of real life’.”More Crongton books followed, includingStraight Outta Crongton(2017) andKerb Stain Boys(2018), as well as YA novels exploring aspects of black history includingCane Warriors(2020), on a slave rebellion in Jamaica in 1760, and Kemosha of the Caribbean (2022), about an escaped slave girl’s adventures as a pirate. A 10-partBBC comedy drama series, Crongton, based on the books, launched in March.View image in fullscreenWheatle doing a book signing at Hay festival in 2022.Photograph: Robert Melen/Rex/ShutterstockI first met Alex when he won the Guardian children’s fiction prize. I was inspired by his passionate belief that, by telling the stories of his life and the lives of other children like him, he could make a difference to young readers who had largely been excluded from representation in books. He later summed up what the recognition brought by the award meant to him: “I still see myself sometimes as ‘little Alex’ who never thought he would achieve anything. You grow up with this low self-esteem that is hard to fight against.”He spoke in schools and at festivals, encouraging young people to write their own stories. Aine Venables, the education manager of Hay festival who took him on a week’s tour speaking to children across Wales, said: “Alex’s life experience and his warmth grounded his writing, and his storytelling brilliance captivated thousands of young people.”Last year, as a“Thinker in Residence”at Hay, speaking to audiences of all ages, Alex advocated for greater interventions by government and those involved in the book world to do more to help even the very youngest children to enjoy reading so that their lives, like his, could be changed. He also campaigned for Prostate Cancer UK, having been diagnosed with the disease in 2023, speaking honestly to men, particularly black men, to debunk fears about the necessary check up.He is survived by his wife, Beverley (nee Robinson), whom he married in 1999, and their three children, Marvin, Tyrone and Serena.Alex Alphonse Wheatle, writer, born 3 January 1963; died 16 March 2025Explore more on these topicsAlex WheatleFictionRaceYoung adultTeen booksobituariesShareReuse this content"

Trump said Boardman’s portrait of the former US president Barack Obama was “wonderful”, but “the one on me is truly the worst”.In her first comment since the incident, Boardman said Trump’s comments meant that her “intentions, integrity and abilities were, in my opinion, called into question”.View image in fullscreenBoardman at the 2019 unveiling of her Trump portrait in Denver.Photograph: Jesse Paul/Colorado Sun/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockBoardman rebuked the president’s claims in a statement, saying she had “completed the portrait accurately, without ‘purposeful distortion’, political bias, or any attempt to caricature the subject, actual or implied”.The artist said that while she acknowledged Trump’s right to comment, the “additional allegations that I ‘purposefully distorted’ the portrait, and that I ‘must have lost my talent as I got older’ are now directly and negatively impacting my business of over 41 years, which now is in danger of not recovering”.Discussing her work with the Colorado Times Recorder in 2019, she acknowledged that there would “always be anger at a president from one side or the other. It is human nature.”In response to Trump’s criticism, officials said the portrait would be removed, and it has been since. Boardman says that for the first six years after she painted the portrait, she “received overwhelmingly positive reviews and feedback”, but that since Trump’s comments “that has changed for the worse”.View image in fullscreenPeople looking at an empty spot on the wall where Boardman’s portrait of Trump once hung. Colorado officials removed the painting after Trump’s criticism.Photograph: Jason Connolly/AFP/Getty ImagesBoardman was born in Britain, and her website says she spent years travelling around Australia, Papua New Guinea, New Zealand, Malaysia, the Middle East, Europe and the US while “conducting a successful career in airline travel and business”.In 1985, she began studying techniques of the old masters in Germany and built a successful career as an artist, eventually winning a nationwide “call for artists” by Colorado’s state capital of Denver, to paint the official portraits of presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump.Trump guards his image closely. In January 2025, before his inauguration, he released a portrait that was variously described by critics as serious or ominous, and seemed to reference his 2023 mugshot.That image was taken after he was charged with attempting to overturn his 2020 election loss to Joe Biden in the state of Georgia – a charge Trump denied.After Trump’s criticism of Boardman, his envoy Steve Witkoff confirmed the White House had been sent a new work from Moscow, which was a gift from Vladimir Putin. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov described it as a “personal gift”.Witkoff described the picture as a “beautiful portrait” by a “leading Russian artist”.Explore more on these topicsArtDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

In the US,Disneyparaded an actual bunny in a brown knitted jumper down the red carpet at the film’s Hollywood premiere.But the film’s theme of being at one with nature seems not to have extended to the real-life environment, with company documents showing the making ofSnow Whitegenerated more greenhouse gas emissions in the UK than the latestFast& Furiousfilm, despite the latter’s reliance on an array of gas-guzzling cars.Analysis of more than 250 sets of filings from the Walt Disney Company reveals that the live action remakes ofSnow Whiteand another animated classic,The Little Mermaid, created more pollution than any of its other movies made in the UK since 2019, when the environmental reporting requirement was introduced.View image in fullscreenThe Little Mermaid generated higher emissions than the combined annual total for Blackpool Pleasure Beach and London’s O2 Arena.Photograph: Photo courtesy of Disney./APIt obliges companies to disclose the emissions generated in the UK, so the global total may be higher.The Little Mermaid, for example, was also filmed in Sardinia, while theFast and Furiousfilm-makers travelled to Italy and the US.The combined emissions forSnow WhiteandThe Little Mermaidare higher than the annual amount produced by Birmingham and Luton airports. Each movie generated higher emissions than the annual total for Blackpool Pleasure Beach and London’s O2 Arena, where theSnow Whiteinfluencer event took place.Snow Whiteis the latest live-action Disney film and starsWest Side Storyactor Rachel Zegler in the leading role andWonder Woman’s Gal Gadot as the evil queen. It has been far from a fairy­tale for the company, plagued by controversy about everything from the outspoken politics of the lead actor to the role of the seven dwarves. The film is reportedly on track to make a loss of about $115m (£89m), with total takings of just $145m against a cost of about $260m.Despite being made by an American studio, bothSnow WhiteandThe Little Mermaidwere filmed atPinewood Studios, just outside London. Studios filming in the UK get up to 25.5% of their spending reimbursed under government plans to incentivise the industry. As part of this process, accounts must be filed for the ­production company behind each movie, showing the cost of making the movie and the emissions generated in the UK.These accounts show that by the end of 2023, Disney had received £44.9m in return for makingSnow Whitein the UK and £49.7m forThe Little Mermaid.Emissions are measured in tonnes ofcarbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e)and are divided into three categories, known as scopes. The first one covers emissions from fuel directly used to produce the movie, for example by generators powering cameras and heaters. The second scope covers emissions generated by the creation of the electricity used during production. Scope three shows indirect emissions which are generated by suppliers of goods and services.Scope three emissions are largely outside the control of the companies being measured, so many, including airports, don’t list them on their accounts. Scope three for airports includes emissions from the planes that use them, so if this were included they would have a much higher total than films.View image in fullscreenGal Gadot as the Evil Queen in Snow White.Photograph: DisneyIn scope one and twoSnow Whitegenerated 3,153 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent.The Little Mermaidgenerated 5,127 tonnes, to give a combined total of 8,279.6 tonnes. This compares with 7,829 tonnes for Birmingham airport in 2023-24, 6,243 for Luton in 2023 and 3,351 for East Midlands in 2023-24, according to their latest data.Major productions are known in the movie industry as “tentpoles”. A source close to Disney said last year that a total of around 2,600 tCO2e “is right in line for what the emissions for a tentpole production should be”.The Little Mermaidis double that (taking into account all three scopes) andSnow Whiteis 62% higher.The latter was filmed extensively on location, which increases the need for portable generators. Fuel for these accounted for the majority of the energy usage during the making of both movies, though it could have been higher. This is because the movie-makers used battery-powered generators and hybrid ones partly powered by batteries.They also tapped into mains power when possible and the accounts add that the “electricity supply at Pinewood was switched to a renewable supply via a green tariff in 2020 (reductions from this switch are not included in these calculations)”.They also state that production staff rented electric cars and “charter flights were only used for full crew moves where they are less carbon intensive than booking hundreds of commercial flights”.Explore more on these topicsSnow WhiteThe ObserverFilm industryPollutionGal GadotGreenhouse gas emissionsFast and FuriousAir transportnewsShareReuse this content"

He is thinking about how an image of a country catches on and, factual or otherwise, comes to define it.Just as the sexed-up Highland romance ofDiana Gabaldon’s Outlanderprojected a view of Scotland with questionable historical grounding so, in 1760, James Macpherson captivated the literary world with his rediscovered verses translated from the third-century Gaelic of the poet Ossian.O’Connor is saying all this as he stands in front of a misty landscape framed like an oval shortbread tin, while wheeling off an outsize stag and a giant thistle from the dislocated set designed by Emma Bailey and Rachel O’Neill. He makes light of the cliches, but in this witty and provocative show for theNational Theatre of Scotland, he takes a less expected route.It would be easy for him to ridicule Macpherson, whose discovery of the ancient bardturned out to be a hoax. That was after Ossian had been described by Thomas Jefferson as “the greatest poet that has ever existed”. Although Fragments of Ancient Poetry was the 18th-century equivalent ofthe Hitler Diaries, O’Connor views it more benignly.“It takes a lot of imagination to tell a true story,” he says, aware that Macpherson’s forgery established a narrative that influenced everyone from Sir Walter Scott to Friedrich Schiller. Fact or fancy, might these verses be as good an approximation of national identity as any?In Lu Kemp’s precisely paced production, O’Connor reads Ossian’s text aloud and hears it sung back to him in Gaelic, its supposed language of origin. Under Oliver Searle’s musical direction, Josie Duncan, Claire Frances MacNeil and Màiri Morrison give gorgeous a capella renderings in harmonious rounds, using words once spoken on the Isle of Lewis by O’Connor’s grandfather only to be neglected by an anglicised culture embarrassed by its own heritage.Shifting registers in a sequence of spoken-word pieces, all buried rhymes and rhythmic repetitions, O’Connor is both angry at having been denied an identity and wise to the fallibility of any national story that claims to be true. “Scotland is a hoax,” he says. The greater question, he argues, is who gets to tell its story.On tour until 2 MayExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreScotlandNational Theatre of ScotlandreviewsShareReuse this content"

That sentiment, that each generation of black Britons believes themselves to be bold pioneers working in a vacuum, has persisted since the beginning of mass migration to this country.But what if the contributions of black Britons were not carelessly neglected, but rather, asLanre Bakareidentifies in his estimable first book,WeWere There,a history that has been more purposely obscured?The roots of the current Black Lives Matter-fuelled renaissance of black artistic practice in Britain were established decades ago in the relatively under-reported past. Bakare focuses on the Thatcher era of the late 1970s and 80s, “the most restive period in postwar history”, when, he argues, modern black Britishness was forged. The Bradford-born author complicates and deepens this story by shifting attention away from London, writing with quiet enthusiasm and sharp intelligence about black communities, including those in Bradford, Wolverhampton, Manchester, Liverpool, Cardiff and Edinburgh.Bakare ably demonstrates the key disadvantage faced by black people – a lack of information about their predecessorsHe unearths forgotten stories of black participation in cultural movements such as northern soul, whose popularity coincided with the emergence of reggae sound systems in the 1970s. One such story is that of Steve Caesar, a Leeds-based teenage migrant from St Kitts and winner of the inaugural northern soul dance competition at Wigan Casino in 1974. “Northern soul helped me find a sort of way of belonging,” says Caesar, and yet his story was excluded from the narratives of a movement historically cast as a white working-class phenomenon by music journalists.Building on the work of cultural historians such asStuart Hall, Bakare champions advances made by social activists. These include grassroots campaigners who in 1979 overturned the miscarriage of justice suffered by Bakare’s fellow Bradfordian George Lindo, imprisoned after he was framed by racist police for a robbery he did not commit.View image in fullscreenRevellers at a sound system, Notting Hill carnival, London, 1983.Photograph: UniversalImagesGroup/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesThe toppling of the statue of the transatlantic enslaverEdward Colston in Bristol in 2020was a very public reckoning with the city’s toxic past. Bakare shows that this direct action had been rehearsed in Liverpool three decades earlier. In 1982, protesters tied a rope to the statue of the former Liverpool MP William Huskisson, who hadlinks to the Atlantic slave trade, and dragged it to the ground. Bakare puts that toppling into the context of theriots in Liverpool 8 (Toxteth) the previous year.The violence was sparked by police brutality, neglect and the kind of prejudicial thinking expressed by Margaret Thatcher in the aftermath of the riots, which she characterised as the unlawfulness of young men “whose high animal spirits” had “wreak[ed] havoc” on the city.Bakare ably demonstrates the key disadvantage faced by black people – a lack of information about their predecessors. In my experience, the interventions and successes of our forebears have been cynically obscured, creating the impression that nothing had come before. This discontinuation has often followed short-term initiatives by white cultural gatekeepers who pat themselves on the back for their enlightenment, which only lasts until the novelty wears off and the next worthy group emerges to attract their attention.We Were Thereacknowledges the true tapestry of British culture by shining a light on committed activists/artists, such as the documentarian Bea Freeman, the producer ofThey Haven’t Done Nothing, a film about the aftermath of the 1981 riots.But the publication of books about the forgotten cultural history of black Britons can only come about if commissioning editors recognise previous blind spots.We Were Therebridges the gaps to missing links and admirably achieves what it sets out to provide: further evidence of “Black people’s influence on the UK”. If these stories are only shown in isolation, “they can be dismissed as curiosities”, writes Bakare, “that don’t alter our sense of what constitutes British culture”.We Were There: How Black Culture, Resistance and Community Shaped Modern Britainby Lanre Bakare is published by Bodley Head (£22).

But there’s a problem: Edward is the primary carer for his elderly mum, Alma (Fionnula Flanagan). Alma is recovering from a stroke that has robbed her of her speech but not the ability to make her many opinions on Edward’s life forcefully clear. Edward’s situation is further complicated when his three friends decide to take a weekend break to Gran Canaria for Maspalomas Pride, unceremoniously offloading their mams on the doorstep of the boxy Dublin semi Edward shares with Alma.Co-written by director Darren Thornton with his brother Colin and loosely based on Gianni Di Gregorio’s hit Italian comedy-dramaMid-August Lunch(2008),Four Mothersis a charmer of a picture that lures us in with Edward’s angst but hits its stride when it digs into the dynamics between the four women who run Edward ragged with their catering requests and incessant bickering. What could have been a sentimental plodder gets a pleasingly acerbic tang from the bracing cattiness of the dialogue.In UK and Irish cinemasWatch a trailer for Four Mothers.Explore more on these topicsComedy filmsThe ObserverWorld cinemaComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

And yet, musically, this compelling performance of Britten’s masterwork, premiered in 1945, shows the company in the strongest possible form. Music director Tomáš Hanus brought a real integrity to his reading of the score: detailed, passionate, and ensuring that the various orchestral interludes were part of an organically cohesive whole.In adapting George Crabbe’s 1810 narrative poem, Britten had already softened the unruly ruffian that was Crabbe’s Grimes, and tenor Nicky Spence, debuting in the title role, made him a far more sympathetic individual again in Melly Still’s staging.View image in fullscreenMob mentality … Peter Grimes.Photograph: Donald Cooper/Alamy Live NewsHere, a misunderstood misfit, contemptuous of the parochial small-minded bitching of the Borough villagers and their assumption of his criminal culpability, Grimes’s hopes of redeeming himself through marriage to schoolteacher Ellen Orford seems credible; their relationship, such as it is, is given a tenderness, with hints of intimacy, with Grimes’ guilt at the death of his apprentice all the more poignant, pointing up the flash-points of volatility and then the moments of madness.Against a bare set – four harbour capstans defining the front of stage, lighting capturing the moody grey of the East Anglian coast, a single boat suspended above the action, black as doom – the villagers’ fierce prejudice against Grimes and the mob mentality, baying for blood, has the seething force of a wild and cruel sea. The personalities of the various villagers implicated in the whole vendetta are all equally vividly drawn and sung.View image in fullscreenNicky Spence as Peter Grimes with Sally Matthews as Ellen Orford  in Welsh National Opera’s staging of Britten's Peter Grimes.Photograph: John Snelling/Getty ImagesOf the considerable choreographic element, the recurring busyness of four dancing apprentices shifting ropes was frenetic though, with shades of the rope-weaving Norns, catching Grimes in a tangled web offered a striking metaphor. Sarah Connolly’s Auntie, landlady of the Boar, was richly sung, but looked rather mystified that her pub consisted only of a single window-frame and a door frame irritatingly danced around to signify the various comings and goings, not to mention the questionable goings-on of her nieces, (Fflur Wyn and Eiry Price). Catherine Wyn-Rogers’s Mrs Sedley, addicted to amateur detection and to laudanum, was finely delineated.Some of Still’s interpolations added ambiguities: Captain Balstrode – the excellent David Kempster – witnesses a distraught Grimes cradling the body of the apprentice who falls to his death, with the corpse then rolled into the sea, the knowledge adds to the tensions of his and Ellen’s attempts to protect Grimes from those bent on his blood.View image in fullscreenTangled web … Peter Grimes.Photograph: Donald Cooper/Alamy Live NewsAs Ellen, Sally Matthews is a quietly vibrant stage presence but with a vibrato that gives the lyricism of her lines too approximate a feel for comfort. Spence finds vocal colours to reflect the complexities of Grimes’s character and his outsider’s otherness; his aria Now the Great Bear and Pleiades has a luminous intensity. But the most rapturous reception was for the WNO orchestra, who Hanus brought onto stage with everyone else for the curtain call. Their wonderfully lucid playing is central to the overall intensity of the evening’s experience.Touring until 7 June.Explore more on these topicsOperaWelsh National OperaBenjamin BrittenClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

He had difficulty stringing together a coherent sentence, yet there was no serious discussion of his exiting the ticket until it was way, way too late. Harris, meanwhile, was isolated in her party and terrified of facing the press. She took the wheel of a badly listing ship. It sank.Allen is a veteran political reporter, now at NBC. Parnes is a senior political correspondent for the Hill.Both were once with Politico. Together, they have written two books on Hillary Clinton, HRC and Shattered, and Lucky, an account of how Biden beat Donald Trump to win the White House in 2020. Parnes and Allen possess perspective. Their writing is sober, their sourcing solid.View image in fullscreenFight: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White HousePhotograph: HarperCollins PublishersTheir message is clear: Biden should never have sought re-election and his selection of Harris as his running mate was a mistake from the start. By 2024, Biden was too old and too unpopular. He appeared feeble, if not outright addled. But his aides came to view Harrisas a liabilityand so did those at the top of the party. The president’s wife, Jill Biden, opposed Harris’s place on the ticket. Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi lacked faith too.At the same time, Jill andHunter Biden, the 46th president’s wayward surviving son, bolstered the president’s determination to cling on. They could not let go.“Nobody walks away from this,” Mike Donilon, a longtime Biden adviser, purportedly told one prominent Democrat. “No one walks away from the house, the plane, the helicopter.”Allen and Parnes add: “That was doubly true for the first lady.”Pushback could be construed as disloyalty. Biden’s closest advisers were family members or dependent on him for their living. That proved to be a problem. There were no social peers with incomes and lives of their own, figures in the mold of James Baker, secretary of state and chief of staff to George HW Bush, or Valerie Jarrett, a senior adviser and confidante to Barack and Michelle Obama. Biden bristled at being challenged but was a schmoozer, not a leader. He owed his comeback to Covid-19.On 27 June 2024, Biden faced Trump on the debate stage in Atlanta – and gave perhaps the most disastrous display in history. Allen and Parnes describe a reception hosted by Phil Murphy, the governor of New Jersey, two days later. The president’s aides had affixed fluorescent tape to the carpet, “colorful bread crumbs [that] showed the leader of the free world where to walk”.‘A case study in groupthink’: were liberals wrong about the pandemic?Read more“He knows to look for that,” one aide explained. Think, President Grampa Simpson. It’s a lousy image, whoever the other side is running.In 2020, the Trump campaign mocked Biden for hiding in his basement. In turn, Bidenites twitted Trump for his inability to handle stairs. Time passed. By 2023, Trump was approaching 80, but Biden had shuffled past it. In public, he froze. The memes flowed but Biden’s woes were not comedic.According to Parnes and Allen, Harris aides “strategized around the possibility that Biden might die in office”. Jamal Simmons, Harris’s communications director, drew up a “death-pool roster” of federal judges who might swear his boss in.After the debate, Obama and Pelosi were distraught. The debacle left Obama shocked, if not exactly surprised.“The 44th president never had much faith in [the] political ability” of his former vice-president, Parnes and Allen write. “Less than two weeks earlier, at [a] Los Angeles fundraiser, Obama led Biden offstage by the wrist after the president stood frozen for a few moments while staring into the crowd.”Obama was disturbed. Parnes and Allen describe a post-debate call.“What is your path?” Obama asked Biden.“What’s my path?Biden thought as he listened to Obama.What’s your fucking plan?”He intuited Obama’s endgame. But Obama also lacked faith in Harris.“Obama already had determined that he didn’t think Harris should take the president’s spot on the ballot,” Parnes and Allen write. “‘That was his position from the outset,’ according to one person who spoke to him at the time.”Pelosi, like Harris from northern California, unlike her a hardened politico with ruthless instincts, thought the same way.“She actually was worried when people were panicking the night of the debate, saying ‘Oh my God, it’s going to be her,’” Parnes and Allen quote “someone who spoke to Pelosi”.Biden skipped White House meeting after Trump debate for photoshoot, new book saysRead moreObama and Pelosi applied pressure. Biden caved. Harris generated buzz, but not enough. She bested Trump in debate, but memory of that triumph faded swiftly. Harris would not and could not put distance between herself and Biden. The president, his family and his handlers wanted it that way.Biden and Harris’s shortcomings had been clear for years. In June 2019, on the debate stage, Harris trashed Biden over his record on race. Less than six months later, having burned through millions of dollars, she dropped out of the Democratic primary. Her place on Biden’s ticket resulted from the threat posed by Trump, the protest-filled aftermath of the police murder of George Floyd, and the leftward drift and outsized role of identity politics within Democratic ranks.His opponents brought to a historic low, Trump openly weighs running for a third term, in defiance of the constitution. Whether the Democrats can respond is in grave doubt indeed.Fightis publishedin the US by HarperCollinsExplore more on these topicsBooksUS elections 2024Donald TrumpBarack ObamaJoe BidenJill BidenHunter BidennewsShareReuse this content"

Some are benign, funny or quotidian statements, others feature torture and incriminating violence. “Overwhelm” is what inspired the five-strong cast to devise this avant-garde experiment in polyphony and it might be the closest thing to the vocalised sound of online scrolling.Written by Alan Fielden, it plays out like a hybrid gig or word symphony with performers in front of music stands as they speak, sing and play various instruments. One voice rises above the others, angrily, another whispers, but then they sing in chorus or recite a secular liturgy.The cast, including Fielden, Jemima Yong, Clara Potter-Sweet, Ben Kulvichit and Tim Cape, is arresting and abundantly talented. Also directed by Fielden, they enact non-sequitur scenes, as if tuning in and out of different radio frequencies, with pointed, atmospheric lighting designed by Kulvichit.There is a lovely arrangement of words and sentences that carry the sound of falling rain; it is hypnotic, with a Philip Glass-like quality, and the act of listening becomes visceral and active in the auditorium.View image in fullscreenVisceral … Jemima Yong in Container.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianThe horror of people smuggling and human beings trapped inside containers also feels visceral. The blue shiny backdrop to the stage might be the inside wall of a truck carrying migrants. The schizophrenic western response to migration and asylum is cleverly captured: “Welcome to my country,” says one voice. “Get out,” says another.At its most powerful it is electric, but the deliberate opacity frustrates and diffuses the effect. At one point there is a news item from a TV studio reporting on what sounds like the California fires. At another, four performers walk off set with microphones still on so we hear the murmur of their chatter. A plume of smoke silently fills the stage as we watch, puzzled. Repeated riffs involve phone calls involving samurais or ancient imperialists, performed across the stage on microphones while reading lights are pointed at miniature figures on top of sound equipment; it seems mannered in its empathic contrast between cutesy set-up and unsettling dialogue.The various scenes – more like musical movements – do not seem unified although there are recurring ideas explored: violence, how we listen, what we choose to hear or ignore, even the “sound” of globalisation, perhaps. At 75 minutes, the show encompasses so much that you walk away knowing what you have seen is important but overwhelmed and uncertain too. Perhaps that is the point.Container is at New Diorama, London, until 12 AprilExplore more on these topicsTheatreImmigration and asylumreviewsShareReuse this content"

The sort of weather that can wreak havoc with dinner plans. Twice this week I have had to make last-minute changes when the temperature dropped.What started out as a light supper of stuffed aubergine ended up being rethought as a more substantial offering, the aubergines layered with haricot beans and chilli-spiked tomatoes under a thyme and breadcrumb crust.Later in the week, my plan for a feta and orange salad – a bit of rather wishful thinking to be honest – had to be quickly reworked into a dish of baked cheese on a bed of sliced blood oranges and bitter salad leaves. Both dishes using the same ingredients but tweaked to suit the changing weather. The cheese was the simplest. A couple of blocks of feta brushed with honey and thyme were baked in foil, so the fragrance wafted up when the parcels were opened. The salty, herb-freckled cooking juices mixed with the sweet juice of the blood oranges. We sponged them up with lumps of sesame bread.The baked aubergine was more suited to a cold day and we dug down through the layers of crisp crumbs and soft, quite-spicy filling for a warming supper. I used gochujang paste for its deep aromatic warmth, but also because that was what was to hand: you could use almost any chilli paste, including harissa or even Sriracha chilli sauce.Every dinner I make right now seems to have a Plan B. Dishes that will work for a blazing afternoon, but can be quickly nudged toward something for a cold night should the need arise. Think light spring soups that will turn into earthy stews with the addition of a can of haricot or butter beans. Grilled sausages that could go into a hotpot with a few sweet onions and some wedges of potato, or roast vegetables that can be rethought as a gratin, its creamy edges bubbling as it is brought from oven to table.Baked feta with blood orangesSalty, chalk-white cheese, honey and sweet oranges. Should you prefer, you could always grill the feta – place the cheese, thyme and honey on a piece of foil and cook under a preheated overhead grill until the surface starts to brown.Serves 2-3.

Place the feta on a sheet of tinfoil large enough to wrap loosely around the cheese. Brush the honey over the surface, then scatter with the thyme. Grind over a little black pepper, then bring the edges of the foil together and scrunch loosely together to form a parcel. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, until soft.Squeeze one of the oranges into a mixing bowl and stir in the vinegar, mustard, a little salt and some more coarsely ground black pepper. With a small whisk or fork, beat in the olive oil. I sometimes make this in a jam jar, shaking the ingredients until they lightly emulsify.Using a very sharp knife, peel the other 2 oranges, making sure to remove all of the white pith. Cut each orange into about 6 thin slices and add to the dressing.Separate the heads of treviso into individual leaves and wash thoroughly. Shake dry, then toss with the oranges, lightly coating them in the dressing.Transfer the leaves and oranges to a serving plate. Lift the cheese from its foil with a fish slice or palette knife, pouring over any honey or juices and place among the leaves and oranges.Aubergine and haricot beans with thyme crumbsView image in fullscreenBean feast: aubergine and haricot beans with thyme crumbs.Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin/The ObserverThe amount of chilli paste you use is up to you – I suggest you taste as you go. I start with 1 level tbsp, then increase it by just a little until the heat level seems right. Much will depend on your taste, but it is wise to assume that the darker red the paste, the hotter it will be. At least, that is my experience. The sugar I include is really just a pinch, but it seems to calm the more aggressive notes of the paste, but leave it out if you wish.Serves 4-6.

Starters from £4.55; pizza from £12.55; mains from £14.95; desserts from £7.30; wines from £28Places from your childhood age slower than you do. Giovanni’s is a family-run Italian restaurant in the centre of Cardiff. While most of the landmarks of my childhood have gone or become other things, Giovanni’s has been there for more than 40 years. It’s where, in a training bra and polyester dress, I’d come to celebrate family birthdays and exam results. It’s where men with cigarette breath would ask me to do a twirl, as my mum looked on proudly. It’s where I first saw my dad drunk – we had come to collect him after a work do, because he was too pissed to get home. At the door, as I watched Mum help him stand up, I felt like Lisa inThe Simpsonslooking into Moe’s. That was the last time I was here.Today, the only difference is that my feet touch the ground and there is a 55in TV on the wall showing videos on mute of a chef demonstrating how they cook their steak (in a pan, with oil). This chef is the eponymous Giovanni, the longest-serving restaurateur in Cardiff. He silently mouths seasoning instructions into the camera as if to say, “Unlike Miss Selfridge, I’m real.” As the onscreen steak sears, my dinner guest (a vegan) goes limp.View image in fullscreen‘I imagine this is how a medieval stew tasted’: minestrone soup.Photograph: Francesca Jones/The ObserverEverything else is the same. The same smell of wine and hot tomatoes. The same sound of dressed-up families ignoring each other. And the same laminated menus. I last held this menu with small fingers and now, with older hands, I think of my younger self and all the things that hadn’t happened to me yet, that I didn’t know were coming. Back then, I thought my parents would live forever. I’d do anything to have one more dinner together, ignoring them.Tonight, Giovanni is offsite. He must be editing his videos. Our drinks order is taken by a charming waiter in a black shirt. I order chianti, because I can pronounce it, and the vegan (who is teetotal, too) orders a Virgin Sex On The Beach. My wine tastes of leather and mushrooms, and gives me a squiggly feeling behind my eyes. The vegan’s drink has half a whole lime floating in it; he says it tastes of the cancelled soft drink Um Bongo. A techno remix of Happy Birthday is played through the speakers, and the waiter delivers a slice of cake with a candle to a nearby table.View image in fullscreen‘In the feminist utopia, I will eat this three times a day’: spaghetti carbonara.Photograph: Francesca Jones/The ObserverThen he returns to take our food order. “I’m vegan,” says the vegan. The waiter says, “I don’t like you,” then turns to me and smiles. We all laugh too hard with our mouths open, in case he means it. On the screen behind, Giovanni cuts the head off a fish.I order the minestrone soup for my starter. When it arrives, it is the colour of the soup that was thrown at Van Gogh’sSunflowers, and it smells like a forest floor. It has wads of carrot and potato and whole cherry tomatoes. As I put my spoon in, oil comes loose and pools at the side of the bowl. It tastes nutty and beefy, and the rough-hewn chunks of vegetable are earthy. I imagine this is how a medieval stew tasted, and I wonder whether Giovanni found the recipe in the margins of an illuminated manuscript. It sits in my stomach like lukewarm tea. The vegan has bruschetta and says it tastes “tomatoey”.View image in fullscreen‘Tastes like the olive oil you’d get in a hamper’: spinach in olive oil.Photograph: Francesca Jones/The ObserverAs we wait for the main course, I take in the faux-brickwork wallpaper. On each paper brick is hung a photo of Giovanni with a celebrity who has eaten here. I recognise Tom Jones, Ed Sheeran and Dawn French. Princess Diana, in a white power suit, throws her head back in laughter at a man in tinted glasses. As if she hadn’t been through enough. Some photos are signed with messages of gratitude to “Gio”. Some are of faces I don’t recognise (sports people) and some have a helpful description of their subject’s credentials (“fromCasualty”). Giovanni grins out from them all. He looks a bit like when one of Greek mythology’s Four Winds is personified in a painting. He ages across the photos as theX Factorcontestants come and go. This gallery charts a restaurateur’s life. Near the window, the photos are bleached from the sun.Our main course arrives. My spaghetti carbonara is the size of two dinners. At home, I cook my pasta to the softness of yoghurt, so I don’t expect the spaghetti to “catch” as I bite through it. The sauce is salty and creamy and has the consistency of Crème de la Mer. Growing up, Mum only made carbonara with low-fat sauce, so I still fetishise the taste of fat. In the feminist utopia, I will eat this three times a day. I fantasise how it will taste even better cold tomorrow, when the fat has congealed. The vegan has something with peppers in it. We share a side of spinach in olive oil, which tastes like the olive oil you’d get in a hamper at Christmas. I get full quickly, so eat a-dinner-and-a-half’s worth of my meal and smear the remaining half round my plate to make it look like less. I want to remain the waiter’s favourite.View image in fullscreen‘Tomatoey’: bruschetta.Photograph: Francesca Jones/The ObserverFor dessert, I have a white-chocolate and pistachio cheesecake. It arrives on a plate the dimensions of an iPad. Pistachios are crumbled on top, and green sauce has been drizzled in the shape of the lacing on the back of a corset. The base tastes like the free biscuits you get in posh hotels. I eat the whole thing. This dish is the highlight of the meal.My cup of tea comes with a shot of milk, like a Jägerbomb, so I ask for three more shots. I get my taste for milky tea from my nan. Her catchphrase was, “Let’s put some tea in that milk.” The vegan asks for an oat latte and the waiter pretends not to hear.View image in fullscreen‘The highlight of the meal’: white-chocolate and pistachio cheesecake.Photograph: Francesca Jones/The ObserverAs the waiter brings the bill, my eyes go over his shoulder to the TV behind his head. There is another person onscreen now, cooking alongside Giovanni. This new figure gesticulates in a familiar way and I realise it is our waiter, 10 years younger. His eyes onscreen are brighter and his hands are smoother as they stroke a fish. I want the screen to show my family and how things used to be. I want to grab the waiter’s arm and say, “Where have they gone? They were just here. Sitting right here.” I wonder if he will turn around and see himself.Explore more on these topicsRestaurantsThe ObserverFoodreviewsShareReuse this content"

This corner of the Caucasus has a distinctive culinary heritage, in which fresh herbs (tarragon, dill, coriander), nuts (as in the staple walnut pastenigvzis sakmaziused as a base for many dishes), fruit (such as sour plums and dried barbary/berberis berries), spices (fenugreek and the mix of fiery red pepper-based spice mix ajika) and the yoghurt-like fermented milk matsoni all play leading roles. Lamb, too, is widely used, not least in a leading contender for national Georgian dish, chakapuli, in which the meat is stewed with sour plums and herbs, providing layered, intensely vibrant-zingy flavours that go so well with the robust, darkly fruited, succulent reds, such as M&S’s Found bottling, made from one of Georgia’s many outstanding indigenous varieties: saperavi.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Tbilvino Saperavi, Kakheti Georgia 2023 (£13.99, or £11.99 as part of a mixed case of six bottles,majestic.co.uk)Saperavi is an example of a subset of red grape varieties called teinturier that, unlike most of those used for wine, have red flesh as well as skins – an attribute that gives the wines an inky depth of colour with vivid dark juice that calls to mind a punnet of freshly picked blackberries. The wines often have a similar crunchy-black-berried exuberance, with acidity and grip that makes them a fine foil for cutting through the fat of lamb dishes of all kinds, not just those made in a Georgian style. Separavis to try whether your preparation features slow cooking and sweet Moroccan spicing or classic Sunday roasting with garlic and rosemary include Tbilvino’s fragrant example, which reminded me of a youthful southern French syrah with its slick of succulent dark fruit and hint of aniseed, and the seriously classy Orgo Saperavi a wine of gorgeously silky texture, with notes of aniseed, hibiscus and blackberries (the 2022 vintage is £21.50 atnywines.co.uk; the excellent 2023 is in shops soon).Russell & Suitor ‘Alejandro’ Saperavi, Murray Darling, Australia 2021 (from £14.99,lokiwine.co.uk;davywine.co.uk;hedleywright.co.uk)The Orgo is made by star winemaker Gogi Dakishvili, who ferments and ages the wines in amphora-like clay pots known as qvevri, an ancient (8,000-year-old) Georgian traditional technique that has, in the past couple of decades, become much-imitated by adventurous winemakers all over the world. It is often used to make orange or amber-coloured wines from white grapes, too, with Georgian examples such as Okro’s Wines Zvari Rkatsiteli, Kakheti 2022 (£20.40,botteapostle.com), made from the Georgian white grape variety rkatsiteli balancing intensely, uncompromisingly nutty, dry, and richly umami-filled tones with autumnal fruit (quince) and citrus tang – qualities that also make it work very well with chakapuli. Georgia’s grape varieties, as well as its techniques, are also beginning to show up elsewhere in the world, with Russell & Suitor’s Alejandro bottling using saperavi grown in the hot heart of Australia’s Murray Darling region to make another vividly juicy, herb-and-spice inflected candidate for Easter lamb.Explore more on these topicsWineDavid Williams's wines of the weekFoodEastern European food and drinkEasterLambfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The first time we met was in a dimly lit omakase restaurant in downtown Tokyo, in the summer of 2017. We were both in Japan on respective work trips. Woolever was researching a travel book she was writing with her boss, the chefAnthony Bourdain, and I was filming a CNN digital spin-off series from hisParts Unknownshow. We were introduced through mutual friends in New York, where I had been living that year, and where her reputation preceded her. She was known to be private, tough, with a wickedly dry sense of humour. I was a little intimidated.As she expertly navigated a seven-course tasting menu of wagyu beef with her chopsticks, she casually mentioned that she’d recently stopped drinking, alluding to the fact it had become out of control. I self-consciously sipped my own cold beer, picked up sweet strips of marbled meat and couldn’t help thinking how tricky giving up drinking must have been, both because of her job as the then long-term assistant to Bourdain – one of the most rock’n’roll food personalities of our time – but also being immersed in a fast-paced New York food scene where drinking to excess was the norm. What I didn’t realise until reading her new memoir,Care and Feeding, was that while Woolever wasn’t drinking, she was still seeking hits of illicit pleasure. A few days after our dinner, she hired a Japanese male sex worker to join her for an “erotic massage” at her hotel. A clinical act to numb the discomfort she felt, trapped in an unhappy marriage without alcohol to smooth over the cracks.“I was having a hard time on that trip because I didn’t understand the point of Tokyo without drinking,” she tells me over a video call from her home in Queens, New York, in February of this year, ahead of the release of her new book. “Acting out sexually was a way to escape that.” She takes a reflective pause. “I’m a different person now, you know, just trying to decentre myself. As much as I thought I was a worthless piece of shit, I also thought I was the centre of the universe. I think that’s a common thing in addiction.”Care and Feedingis a blisteringly candid and laugh-out-loud account of hedonism and heartbreak. It chronicles Woolever’s two decades as a food writer, editor, chef and assistant to two of the USA’s most notorious chefs – Mario Batali and Anthony Bourdain – men whose own challenges with addictive behaviour at times seemed to mirror her own. “Very few people are curious about the unknown women who prop up the work of important men,” Woolever writes, as she sets out her own chaotic journey of misadventures while working in their shadows. It’s common practice for prominent celebrity chefs on both sides of the Atlantic to heavily lean on the work of others when releasing books under their names. “Without the Tonys or Marios of the world, there would have been no book, or TV show or magazine work for me,” she writes. “The flip side of this, that the end products, credited solely to the marquee men, wouldn’t exist without the work of women like me.”View image in fullscreen‘There were none of the assistant horror stories you hear about famous people’: Woolever and Bourdain in Vietnam, filming Parts Unknown in 2014.Photograph: David Scott HollowayWoolever grew up in the small village of Chittenango in upstate New York. She describes having “classmates who got up at 4am to milk cows and others who skipped school on the opening days of deer and trout seasons”. After finishing her degree in Natural Resources Management at Cornell University, she moved to New York City in 1996 in search of a good time. Outwardly presenting as reserved and shy, she had a secret wild streak that saw her spend her days quietly mowing and weeding at the Brooklyn Botanical Gardens and her nights partying in East Village clubs where she would creep home in the early hours “after discovering just how much vodka I could drink while on cocaine… clutching a handbag into which I’d quietly vomited bile and Snapple”.Following a stint catering for a wealthy Upper East Side family, Woolever decided to attend culinary school, drawn to the heat and excitement of the kitchen. Shortly after graduating in 1999she landed a job as assistant to Mario Batali, a rising star in the food world and proprietor of Babbo, a high-end Italian restaurant that was one of the hottest tables in New York.“It was an incredible education,” she tells me. “Managing the constant attention from press and surrounded by people who were proud of being at this hot genre of a restaurant. Mario was pioneering a new way of doing things, the food was elegant, but he had stripped away some of the pretence of fine dining. It was wild and uninhibited.”Woolever’s time with Batali was most notable for its excesses. On a trip to Atlantic City early in her role, she was chided for ordering a salad. “No fucking way are you getting just a spinach salad,” Batali told her. “When you are out with me, you will order a cocktail, an appetiser, a mid-course pasta, an entrée, a dessert, a cheese course and an amaro or a grappa, and we will drink a shit-ton of expensive wine.”Woolever understood the assignment. “I couldn’t not drink and do my job,” she tells me wryly. “That was a lie I told myself for a long time.” Having already developed a penchant for day drinking, accepting a bump of cocaine whenever it was offered and relishing the first bong of the day (preferably taken in the morning), Woolever embraced a work-life balance that often involved drinking until she passed out and navigating her days at the restaurant with painful hangovers mixed with a hefty dose of self-loathing. She also embarked on a series of messy sexual encounters, including “hate fucks” with co-workers who “smelt like an old spicy sausage left in a hot car,” hook-ups with strangers at bars and, on occasion, going home with men who picked her up on the street when she was almost blackout drunk.Very few people are curious about the unknown women who prop up the work of important menBack in Babbo, sexualised behaviour dominated the workplace, too. Batali is alleged to have created an atmosphere where female employees were regularly harassed (a claim he denies) and Woolever shares stories of her own harassment at his hands – from having her ass grabbed by him on the restaurant floor or being forced to straddle him across a plane seat when he refused to move when she wanted to use the bathroom. When Batali was brought down in the #MeToo movement andsettled lawsuitsamounting to $600,000 (£462,000) in compensation to former employees, Woolever was not surprised. “It felt good that justice, in some small way, has been served for people who were very hurt by him, but it was upsetting to be faced with all the evidence.” Did she feel complicit in enabling him, having worked so closely with him? She frowns, looking slightly pained. “That’s a complicated question. I did speak up on my own behalf when he groped me, but I think it’s important to note there was a massive power imbalance at play. Powerful men in an industry that’s very desirable get to use their power to get away with whatever they want. If I had spoken up in a public way, I don’t believe it would have changed anything, except I probably would have lost my job.”Eventually, Woolever decidedit was time to move on from Babbo, driven by a desire to pursue a career as a food writer. Not wanting to incur Batali’s infamous vengeance, she gave him a year-long notice period, after which, in 2002, she worked as a recipe tester on a cookbook for another up-and-coming chef who Batali had introduced her to, Anthony Bourdain.Her first impression of Bourdain was a surprise. “I was expecting the guy on the pages ofKitchen Confidentialand assumed if you speak that way on the page, and you’ve got this level of notoriety, then you must be brash and loud, sucking all the oxygen out of the room. But that was not the case at all. He was very polite, a little awkward and very kind. Immediately I felt I was met with respect and treated as an equal.”Having established herself as a writer, Woolever went on to become an editor for the culinary magazinesArt CulinaireandWine Spectator, got married and had a baby – on the surface presenting as someone who had settled down, but all the while continuing to fall deeper into her addictions. She was drawn back to assistant work when Bourdain reached out to her and relished taking on the role of supporting the superstar chef. The flexibility of the job (remote, primarily via email) was well suited for a new mother, but also perfect if you regularly woke up hungover and liked to smoke weed. Over the course of the next few years, while her career remained stable, Woolever found her personal life unravelling as she reached for the bottle more intensely. Finally, in 2017, off the back of a weekend of hard boozing and a fallout with her extramarital fling, she dragged herself to an AA meeting. “I listened hard, cried about my own feelings and did not raise my hand or say anything,” she writes. But she went back the next day. And the next. Until, at last, she stopped drinking.Throughout her book, Woolever’s admiration for Bourdain is evident, describing him as a supportive boss as well as a caring figure in her personal life. During their tenure together, her role grew from assistant to the occasional editor of his work and eventually co-author ofAppetites, a cookbook they wrote together. When Woolever’s marriage imploded due to her affairs, Bourdain offered his bank account as an asset in her application for a rental agreement to ensure she was able to get a decent place to live, as well as counselling her about his own experience of divorce.“There were none of the assistant horror stories you hear about famous people,” she tells me. “But I still wanted to deliver for him above and beyond.” Her role involved scheduling flights, doctors’ appointments and liaising with the press, but also more unusual activities, such as organising helicopters for quick transportation, finding jiu-jitsu classes he could attend all over the world, or preparing feasts of crab and caviar for trips on a private jet. Today, her fondest memories of him relate to food and travel, whether it was “shooting the shit and eating ice-cream” together on a beach in Sri Lanka, or learning from him how to cook organ meat – “straight from the fridge, never brought to room temperature, that’s a recipe for disaster”.At the height of his success, Bourdain achieved an almost statesman-like reputation for his artful blending of food, travel and politics. His Emmy award-winning documentary seriesParts Unknowntook him to places such as Iran, Cuba and the Occupied Palestinian Territories, opening up windows into these hidden worlds for American audiences for the first time. He even recorded an episode with the then US president Barack Obama, eating bowls of bún cha at a noodle joint in Vietnam. What was it like working behind the scenes of such an influential man?“I think it took me a while to recognise that behind all the invitations, overtures and gifts I would be sent, there was a desire to get close to Tony or get a favour from Tony…” She pauses, searching for the right words. “Certainly after Tony died, it was really eye-opening to see who stuck around and who suddenly didn’t have a lot of time for me.”View image in fullscreen‘After Tony died, it was really eye-opening to see who stuck around’: Bourdain and Woolever in Vietnam, 2014.Photograph: Ben SelkowIn June 2018, just weeks after Woolever had moved out of her marital home and was in the process of negotiating custody of her son, she was woken at 4.25am by a call from Bourdain’s agent who told herhe had taken his own lifein his hotel room in France.“I felt a kind of shock that I don’t know I’d ever experienced before,” Woolever tells me, her voice growing quieter. “There were probably three hours where a handful of us knew what had happened before anybody else did. And it was just surreal to think that everyone thinks Tony is still alive, but I know the truth. I kept thinking, how do we fix this? We’ve got him out of difficult situations before, those of us that worked closely with him, we’d fixed things… Which is just nonsense, right? But it’s where your brain goes.”In the book, Woolever describes Bourdain’s increasingly erratic behaviour in his last few months of life, due in part to the challenging entanglement he had with his girlfriend at the time, Asia Argento. The day before he killed himself, photos of Argento looking close with another man had appeared in the Italian press.“I’ve had my heart broken,” Woolever says. “So I understand the extreme pain you can feel. I don’t think that ending one’s life is the right answer, but that was the choice he made. It was a spasm of pain and grief and humiliation and rage. At the time I felt irrationally angry that he couldn’t have found another way to deal with the enormity of the feelings that he was having, but they were just too big.”After Bourdain died, Woolever’s life became a lot smaller. “I went from being very busy and connected to being kind of on my own. It was lonely, strange and unclear what the next steps would be for me in terms of work and in terms of my life.”In previous years, Woolever’s first response to uncomfortable feelings would have been to get drunk. With her marriage over and her boss dead, was she tempted? She shakes her head,“I was not. I was deep enough into not drinking at that point that I knew, if things are bad, you’re not going to make it better by having a drink. You’re actually going to make it worse. But I was still smoking pot like it was my job. When I would have to go into Manhattan to pick up Tony’s mail after he died I would get really stoned, and then get on the subway and cry.”Today, Woolever issix years and four months sober – no alcohol and no weed – a statistic she confirms by pulling out her phone to check her daily sobriety app. You still count your days? She nods. “Yes, and it feels good. If you’d told me I would have this amount of time sober, I’m not sure I would have believed it.” I tell her one of the most moving parts of the book was when she describes her good fortune at being pulled out of the nosedive of drinking before she hit the ground, which doesn’t tend to be the general trajectory of addiction memoirs. Why was it important to make that point? “I think with addiction there is a sense that you have to completely blow something up in order for it to be valid. I had impostor syndrome when I first went into the rooms of the 12-step programmes as I had this idea that you’ve got to almost die, or go to rehab, or be in a drunken accident in order to justify your presence. But it’s just not true. If you’re able to stop drinking before any of that stuff happens then you should consider yourself lucky”.Today, Woolever continues to care for the important men in her life, though these days it’s less about A-listers and more about feeding her 16-year-old son – a source of great pleasure for her. “Cooking is a non-negotiable for me. Sometimes I feel tired and overwhelmed, like all parents, but then I remember that this kid is growing up, he’s going to go to college soon and it’s a real privilege to cook for him and for myself.”As we wrap up the conversation so that Woolever can get to her weekly AA meeting, I’m struck by how she has emerged, at 50, with a new lease on life. Does it feel that way? “Yes,” she says, “And it feels like closing a chapter… the book chronicles the years it took for me to finally grow up.” She laughs and rolls her eyes, “I guess it took me 25 years to become an adult.”Care and Feeding: A Memoir by Laurie Woolever is published by HarperCollins at £22.
